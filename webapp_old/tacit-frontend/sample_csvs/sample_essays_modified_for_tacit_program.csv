F19.PHYS222.01.02,"I am here in this physics course as a requirement for my degree here at San Francisco State. I came here to pursue my goals of becoming a doctor of some sort. I came to achieve my bachelorís degree in Biology, in hopes of going to medical school right after. I chose to go to college to not only fulfill my dreams but my parentsí dream as well. Coming from the Middle East and Asia, my parents did not have access to the best education systems. My dad however managed to leave the Middle East at a young age to become a pilot. He made his dreams come true, but it did not really last long. All he did was fly for a couple years and moved to the US with me and my mom. All they did was sacrifice everything to have better opportunities for their children. I could not let that sacrifice be for nothing."
F19.PHYS222.01.03,"I am here in this class to get my degree, but I am here at this school to better my life. I am here to allow myself the opportunity to succeed in something bigger than myself. Being here has many different meanings and perspectives. On a day to day basis I will say I am here to just get through the day or that I am here because I feel I have to be. I am here in this class because I had to enroll in it but also to actually learn the material. I am here in this city because of all the schools this most likely had the best tuition rate and most appealing place to live. †Overall I am here for my future.†"
F19.PHYS222.01.04,"The question can be subjective. I am here because I am required to take this class for my major. I can see how it may relate to my major. I can also see how calculus has to do with physics so therefore, I can correlate the two subjects together. I have to take another physics classafter I finish this one.Also, why am I at this particular school? I am not from San Francisco so I thought it would be interesting to attend a schoolout of the city that I live in. I also like the hands-on experience or experiments involved in physics. I can also correlate that with the calculus thatI've been taking. Hopefully taking all these integrated math classes for my major, I can be very well-rounded in math, although it takes me a While to compute problems, at least the answers will be right."
F19.PHYS222.01.05,"I am here because I am a Bio-Physio major, and this is a requirement for medical school.† I have never taken a physics class before but truthfully I thought by taking this class in place of the other physics series I would able to get another requirement out of the way without spending as much money.† However, I am unsure if I want to continue down the path of preparing for medical school and may decide to do something else with my major.† Maybe through taking this class I will develop a stronger interest in physics and want to discover different interesting aspects about it.† If I decide to change my major, which may not be the smartest idea because I am currently a third year and that will set me back a lot for graduating on time, I would change it to some sort of engineering major because of my father being in the engineering field, sparking my interest toward it.† I hope through this class I am able to meet more people to study for the quizzes in this lab as well as those in lecture and create a large study group. †"
F19.PHYS222.01.06,"Currently I am in the Physics 222 class to develop a greater understanding of Physics. However, looking at the broad spectrum, I am here to continue to build my knowledge of science and its impact on the world, and to use that to further my education and aid me in going to medical school. I strive to one day become a neurosurgeon, and I believe that my education right now gives me practice and knowledge that will aid me in becoming a neurosurgeon, and just simply giving myself ideas of how Physics works. I believe life is a step by step journey, that can be broken down into many little parts. I am in the journey of college, and more specifically in the journey of Physics. I hope that in this class, I will improve on my quantitative thinking, and will improve on formulating the work I have done in experiments. These two things, I believe would the most influential aspects of this class on my future, and would help me conduct better thinking in my future classes in both college and medical school. For one, being able to use numbers to solve problems, or for example determine how large of a dose a patient may need in a hospital is an incredibly beneficial skill. Second, writing out lab reports, helps me learn a way to focus and organize my work in a way that can be used and aid anyone. If I was writing a patients state on their charts. It would be best that I know how to write it in an organized way that makes it easy to understand the patients status.†"
F19.PHYS222.01.07,"Why am I here? For most of us here it is to graduate with a degree from a higher learning institution so that we may gain a job and finally make money to support ourselves. I do not want to lie and say that this is not also my goal. I have always had a passion for hands on work and an affinity for math and physics. All of this has lead me to pursue a degree in Mechanical Engineering, ultimately leading me to taking this course. Higher education for me is a Segway into the job field, without it would make getting a job in the future that much more difficult. This is the main reason I am here today. In todays society most individuals want to support themselves and their family as well as live as comfortably as they can. For me I want to as well which has lead me to be here as well as pursue education past high school education."
F19.PHYS222.01.08,Why am I here? Because I was expelled from my mom's womb.
