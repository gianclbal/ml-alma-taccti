       "\"I am here to learn the basics of physics through experiments, also to graduate as the first one in my family from a college university. This should help me in the future because it is for my major requirement for kinesiology. I am also enrolled in the physics lecture. Physics is in everyday life so this class will come in handy. Currently I'm learning conversions which I am bad at. I wish to improve my math skills and conversion skills. This class will prepare me for upper division classes, even though its my last physics class, it should come in handy in everyday problem solving. For example if I ever need to calculate how much gas I need to pump in my car. I can calculate it with money, gallons, and miles. So this class will enhance my problem solving skills right now in life, and later in life. I am here to learn.†\""
