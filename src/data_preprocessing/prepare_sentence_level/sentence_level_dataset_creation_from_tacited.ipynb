My mind has not been made up yet if I   wanted to go to medical school etc. Since I am a personal trainer and have been coaching   clients in different populations for about 4 ½ years, I feel this is my passion and my calling.   Anything can happen though till I graduate so I do have time to reflect and process everything in   my mind to make the best decision for myself and future.\n",

I want to learn more about how the world moves and the forces in it. Being a  kinesiology major we study the bodies and how they move. When a body is in motion many  forces are acting upon them. This class hopefully will help me understand those forces and  allow me to better help a patient.

I enjoyed the class but it wasn't something I saw myself doing as a profession. I was more of a critical thinker than an artist. After high school, I ended up attending a community college where I didn't really know exactly what I wanted to do. I bounced around in majors starting off with business. After struggling in an accounting class I felt that I wanted to major in a science. I then declared a major in Psychology and realized that it was not really the subject for me. During the summer quarter, I took an Oceanography class and just fell in love with earth sciences. We were really able to collaborate with our classmates to help each other along and I really enjoyed the field trips.

      "After reading the question prompt, two responses came to mind- job opportunity, and role model. From what I understand, the US is currently going through an industrial revolution, and if you don't work in STEM, then there's a chance you will get left out out of the job market. One of the reason I chose this degree is because it allows me to segue into a number of other career fields, and I find comfort in knowing I have that option available to me. So to summarize my first point, more job opportunity implies more stability. The reason I included the phrase, \"role model\" is because people who come from my social-economic background generally do not end up working in STEM. At first I thought I was because most of us don't have an interest in STEM, but overtime I've started to believe it's actually because most of us don't get exposed to STEM. The way I got exposed to STEM is kind of an interesting story. The short version of that story is that I grew up kind of poor, joined the military at 18 years old, used my VA benefits to go school after I separated from active duty, went to art school for a few years, took a class where we learned to develop a mobile application by leveraging preexisting GUI's, and that was the moment when I first got exposed to a little bit of STEM. If you would have told high school me that I'd be 2 semesters away from graduating with a BS in electrical engineering, I would never have believed it, mostly because my grades were terrible, but also because I had no idea what STEM was back then. So to summarize my second point, I want to encourage people to take an interest in STEM because it can be rewarding and if you don't do it then there's a chance you will not have a job in the future.\n",

Senior year my   purpose was to help others solve their own problems and find ways to promote mental health.   The question came up again in my head entering college. Why am I here? What can I do to   change the world? Why should I care about changing the world? I then realized that I care a lot,   that’s just who I am. With that being said I care for the plant and the beings on them, both   animals and humans. I made my purpose to help not only others but nature as well.

      "Josceline Perez  8/24/20 ASTR 116-02  Reflective Journaling Essay #1: Why am I here? I enrolled in Astronomy Lab this fall semester because I'm interested in this topic of learning about space like our solar system, moon, stars and more and have a better understanding of the discoveries found in outer space since I don't know so much about it but I'm really excited about learning more about our universe. I also enrolled in the lecture of astronomy this semester and I hope I am able to learn more about this topic and expand my interest and knowledge in astronomy. I also took this class because it was a GE requirement but mostly because I find this topic really interesting to me that gives me an interest to go more in depth. I want to learn about different galaxies if there are and go in depth about our different planets there are in space.

      "Lesley Alexander928023576PHYS-0222Reflection -1Why do I want to become a computer science major? To answer this I go back all the way to when I was six years old playing one of my favorite video games Super Mario World on the GameBoy Advance. This was a golden gem to me when I grew up being a fun game to play whenever to get lost into this 2D world and enjoy it at its fullest. As years pass I tried to figure out a career path I want to follow and be successful financially as well enjoying it too. Then it struck me that I want to work in the video game industry to help in any way possible. I started narrowing what I enjoy about video games and its the backbone of how it performs/functions, the engine. The engine of the video game is sourced by lines of codes functioning in a complex way that the computer has to understand for the user to access it easier for the general public. So, I want to be a software engineer for a video company one day, enjoying my favorite hobby and learning at the same time.\n",

      "So the reason why I want to go into a STEM major is because I have always been passionate about the Sciences since I was a child. I have always been fascinated by how things work and the inner mechanics of anything that has a motor or gears. Like I still remember as a kid I spent all my money on Lego sets and RC cars and I always liked building and modifying to make it better by trial and error. Currently I am an automotive technician and I’ve always been into cars because of my father. Also I just really want to invent something that will benefit society one day but in reality I just want to design and recreate something out of scratch and build it better. Maybe one day I can work for Elon Musk for SpaceX but if not NASA would be dope. But overall I have always been interested in the theory of quantum physics so hopefully one day I will be able to do field research to get a better grasp of how our universe works.                                                                                                                                                                                                     Waseem Anwar\n",

      "The question is why do I want to get into the stem field. Ironically, I ask myself this question about once a week when I find myself struggling on courses that are required for my major. Personally, I’m doing civil engineering with a focus on transportation, and I got into the stem field personally for hopes of financial success coming with the degree and due to my fondness of engineering in general. Like most students who are in college the big goal of earning a degree is to give themselves the opportunity to advance in society in contributing to what they are researching or studying and to give themselves the chance to get a better paying job. For me part of being in the stem field is for the financial opportunities that I would be opening for myself because the reality is money is a big part of our lives if we like it or not. Thankfully structures and the way thing were made struck my interest into engineering growing up and when it came time to decide my major and focus I went with transportation in hopes of solving the terrible bay area traffic that I experience on a day to day basis. \n",

This is because it is a pre-requisite for my major which is Biology with a concentration in cellular and molecular. Although I am forced to take the physics series, I have actually come to really enjoy learning about physics and realized that physics is all around us in everything that we do day to day. Why am I at San Francisco State University? I am currently here because I wanted to further my education and study something I actually enjoy which is what I am currently doing. I want to be successful when I am older and have always been told that you first need an education in order to secure a good job in the future.

Firstly, I'm in this class because its a part of my prerequisite for my major which is biology - physiology and also for dental school. I'm also here in college because I want to pursue a higher education and be able to get a job that I am passionate about. Lately I've been feeling very discouraged, especially since the whole covid - 19 and everything going on. Especially switching all of the classes to online classes has been very hard to adjust. I've taken online classes before but having all of my major courses online is difficult. It requires a lot of self discipline and organization. So far I'm definitely trying my best and I'm doing okay in school/work life, home life not so much but things happen, I'll get through it. I want this work ethic to continue this way until the end of the semester. It's my last year here at SF state and I want to work super hard since I'm so close to the finish line. \n",

      "Why am I here? Why am I here in my room doing school work instead of on the campus? The answer is simple, I am here in my room doing school work because of the ongoing pandemic. This pandemic didn't need to happen if our politicians weren't so concerned about themselves and their wealth. They should have listened to the scientist to make sure everyone in the country could be safe, but instead they chose to ignore them and tell us the people to ignore them as well. Now the school season has started back up and some schools want kids to come back to class while others are doing distance learning. While the distance learning is good and it keeps everyone safe, it has it's complications if some students don't have the proper equipment, and opening schools back up for kids is a very bad idea since kids could spread the virus to others.   \n",

I don't really do well with being told to do something. For some reason school has just been really hard for me, but I know, its hard for everyone but after starting at SFSU I felt I knew what I wanted to do and where I wanted to be with my own. I still have about two semesters left, it has been a different experience for me going from community college to sfsu. I was able to finally get good grades, even in the classes that I wasn't good at and just feel comfortable where I am at. Something that motivated me was that in chemistry in community college, I did horribly at, so at sfsu I was frightened that it would be the same but I actually did very well in my chemistry classes, and I was a chemistry learning assistant for a semester and my instructor even said I should minor in chemistry! Words I never thought I'd hear. That kept me going and really motivated me to keep doing well. The next semester my instructor in Pre-Calc told me to minor in math!

Though I must admit that I am really having a hard time understanding physics. At first I thought that physics is more like math. Solving problems and just all about calculating numbers, but after taking my first semester of physics, I realized that physics is a combination of science and math. I hate math which makes it even harder for me to love and learn physics. Whenever I see weird and very complicated numbers that requires long calculations, right then, I give up. Physics thought me how to change my bad habit. I don't quit when there's harder problems. I start thinking of other ways in which it will be easier for me to understand concepts and not just solving or getting the right answer. I try to spend more time studying for physics compared to my other classes. However, because of our current situation right now having to take classes online, and having an asynchronous class, my struggles in physics is back. I don't know how and what strategies I should do to be able to succeed in this class but I am for sure to give my best so I can get an A at the end of the semester.PS: Thank you for this week's lab. I like that you are doing the powerpoint and lecture. Our lecture class doesn't do that or maybe I'm just having trouble understanding the lecture. Anyway, I hope we keep our labs like this.

Does purpose define life? If we pay attention to life, you can see how every person serves a purpose.

However, If I have learned anything from my other classes, even if you are not trying to have a career in this field it can still help you. I do believe physics can play a role in the Physical Therapy field which is what I am trying to go into. In physical therapy patients manipulate objects with forces. This helps the therapist determine what someone’s range of motion is, how deep their injury goes, or how advanced they are in their therapy.

I always tell myself that the reason I am here and not home going to a community college is because I wanted to experience and learn new things so bad. I didn't think I could do that back home, because home was a comfortable spot for me and I needed to be pushed out of my comfort zone. I am always so eager to learn new things weather its from a Biology class or Philosophy or Physics. I always think to myself all of the things that have happened to me since I moved to San Francisco last year, good or bad, and all the new things I learned and how there was no way I would have done that back in San Diego. As far as why I'm in this class, of course its a requirement for me to take this class but even if Physics isn't really my strong suite, it's still science and I love science and I'm excited to know other science other than Anatomy.\n",

For learning physics, it's easier for me to understand the concept when I see the instructors working out physics problems and explaining how to solve it or the thought process of solving a physics problem. I understand how to do math but setting up the problem was always a challenge for me. I’d like to say I'm pretty good at biology, chemistry, and math but when I come to physics I'm completely lost and almost have no interest.

It’s a shallow answer, but if I had to elaborate then I would say that this class is a step towards becoming a doctor. I’ve wanted to become a doctor for as long as medical books have existed in libraries. My mother used to quiz me on them from a young age, and I could watch TV excessively if it were medical dramas. I doubted if that was what I truly wanted, but after interning in an operating room over the summer in high school, my passion was solidified. I wanted to be the one doing the procedure- not just watching. Of course, to get to that point, I had to go to college. I am more passionate more than ever to achieve my goals. My friend passed away recently from a disease. When my other friend who was much closer to her said to me, “I hope you become a great doctor so you can help people like her,” I knew that my ambitions were personal. I miss my friend every day, and I haven’t been the same without her. I struggle in day to day life and classes because of the grief. However, if to do well in school is what it takes, then I will power through. I have the chance to do the things she did not. I can’t afford to take this time for granted.\n",

To feel human, to feel pain, heartbreak, serenity, forgiveness, joy and feel that life is actually so much more simpler than we think it to be. I am here to grow and experience and give life my own personal meaning through my own form of storytelling. I think that is what the meaning of life is, not to get too existential, but the true meaning of life is to give life your own meaning, deliver a happiness relative to your own perspective. Being a young person can be difficult sometimes because as your developing, you start to learn how overwhelming your own emotions can be, how complex the world is, how scary and different it is from how you imagined.

However, after working in the pharmaceutical setting, I came to realize that the work I was performing did not leave myself feeling satisfied but, instead, weary and tired. After graduating, I stumbled upon optometry and became fascinated with the study of the eyes and their importance. The field seemed perfect to me.

But I’m glad I’m finally here, although school is online. I also originally wanted to transfer to a nursing program, so I applied to many schools in California. However, I did not get into any of them. It was also a really hard time for me to get through, because I was really struggling with deciding if healthcare was really the right path for me, and I felt like I was back to my old self that was feeling so inferior and “not good enough” from a few years ago.

I am here to become a successful person and learn to the best my ability as much as I can from SFSU. At SFSU I hope explore San Francisco during my downtime. The reason I chose to major in Mechanical Engineering is because I hear that engineers get quite a nice amount for their payroll and I also think that learning about the building process of the many mechanical devices we use in our daily lives is interesting. I am taking this SCI course to get more practice and a better understanding of Calculus 2. Calculus 2 is a required course to major in Mechanical Engineering and failing Calculus 2  will severely impact my college road map. In this class I hope to gain the hands-on lab skills for the physics laws and material.

Most jobs require a specific college degree in order for them to hire you to work for them. I figured that if I were to graduate from college and get my degree, it will increase my chance for me qualifying for a high paying job. The reason why I choose to enroll in the SCI class was because you actually get a unit towards graduation. I needed that unit because I am currently behind due to me passing only 11 units last semester. The other reason why I chose to enroll in this class is because I do have trouble in math sometimes. I make small mistakes and I did not even know it until my work was graded. I know this class is okay to make mistakes because the people around me here are very understanding and they will support you whenever you are in need. This class also have people helping each other and I am proud to be part of it. With the help of this class, people will not struggle as much as they do in their regular math class and it will definitely save some grief. This class also helps us prepare upcoming math exam and also go over homework problems that we have trouble so we can earn the most point possible. This sums up the reason why am I here in this community and how it affects us.\n",

After high school, I was very unsure of what I wanted to study and what career I wanted after that. I began as a history major at Riverside City College, and by the time I arrived at UC Riverside, I was a Spanish major. I was very unhappy with what I was pursuing and became very unmotivated; this led to me dropping out of school. For months I worked random jobs while I searched for something to inspire me. I have always been good with my hands. My father taught me many things about construction while I was growing up. One day, a friend approached me about joining a construction trade. I took the job and as soon as I set foot on my first big construction site, I knew there was something there for me. The first three years I was an apprentice, and I learned a lot about my trade. With a lot of hard work and dedication, I was able to master my craft and was given more responsibilities by my superiors. I was made a foreman and had the responsibility of running a project, along with a crew of carpenters. I became fascinated with managing projects and wanted to learn more about it apart from the blue-collar aspect of the job. I quickly realized that if wanted to do this, I was going to have to return to college. I enrolled and spent one year at a junior college and transferred to SFSU.  I am now on track to earning a bachelor’s in civil engineering. I am here to continue paving the way to a successful and fulfilled future. It definitely is a difficult journey and comes with many challenges, but in the end, I will achieve something that is going to benefit me for the rest of my life.\n",

I enjoy it because it is forced studying in a productive manner. I forgot where I read this, but many educators say for every unit you take you should be studying one hour per unit your class is worth. I am taking sixteen units therefore I should be studying sixteen hours a week. These SCI classes will help me accomplish that through, making myself accountable to go to class each week and get extra help. It is amazing review and reflection time on what we just learned in class. It also gives you an opportunity to ask any questions that you have, that you were unable to ask in class due to time. I also like hearing from different people on how they are learning the material because it might also help me. It is very helpful to have someone in the same shoes as you, since you are taking the class together it is a much better time to get to know your class mates and forum study groups. So far from the first three weeks / four weeks of class I have gotten A’s on all my quizzes given in my main classes thanks to my SCI helper classes.

I wanted to help figure things out because I felt that it was important to ensure that no one comes across these illnesses that have killed many of my family members.

Being in a sci class makes it easy to ask questions and work with the people around me so that we have discussions about the concepts-- comparing to the large 100+ people class. Here we can compare notes or go over topics that we may have not gone over yet. The sci course also helps improve my GPA and gives me an extra unit, so it doesn't hurt to take it. \n",

Not only that but I also wanted to learn about the Sun and Moon and by taking this course, it is allowing me to do so. In astronomy, you get to learn more about constellations and also makes you question things that you never thought about. For example, are there any parts in the globe where Polaris can’t be seen?

      "Why am I here, I am here for a few reasons. The reason I choose to add this class was that I felt the need for extra help in biology 240. Last semester I took biology 230 and although it was my first semester in college I struggled a little bit. Looking back at last semester I could have tried harder to earn a better grader in that class but it didn’t happen. Now that I have completed my first semester and first biology class I now know what to expect for the future. Biology is interesting to me because there’s always something new I learn every lecture. So for this class, I decided to join is for that extra help to understand the material better. In the lecture, there is no homework or quizzes so that is a major part of the grade that is not going to be added because it is just based on the exams. Knowing myself I know I will need to pass those exams to get the grade I want in than class.

The particular reason why I specifically chose a physics course rather than other science courses is because I wanted to kind of witness the application of calculus in the real world at a much higher level than how the applications were taught in calculus. In mathematics we are just basically given the equation already and just plug in numbers. For example the equation for an object throw (the parabola) is just given such as something like -16t^2 - 8t + 32. Which just gives us the ability to calculate the velocity or acceleration of the thrown object at a given time but I do not necessarily know how to arrive at the equation if we were to actually perform the experiment in real life.

      "When the question \"why am I here?\" gets asked, I instantly think they are referring to where I currently am at that exact time and place of being asked. Although that is my outlook on it, this question can become more in debt by adding on to the question continuously for example; Why am I here in college? Why am I here in San Francisco? Why am I currently here sitting in this lab class typing this response? And so forth. These questions typically can all be answered through one reasoning since they all tend to tie in together in the end. To begin with a little insight on why I am in San Francisco is due to me wanting to be in a city environment when working towards my bachelors degree due to me originally coming from a similar environment, making it a bit easier to adjust. Being comfortable is very important, especially when moving alone, because of the high chance of home sickness that can arise when making major changes. Leaving home and venturing out to attend college at San Francisco State became something I wanted do once I was presented with how this route can lead me to success. This lab class is one of the few courses/steps needed to complete all requirements made for my degree which is why I am currently completing this response. \n",

I know that when working on these labs I will be able to get out of my comfort zone and ask for help whenever I’m confused or in need of assistance during the process. I intend to put my part in the lab and it’s reports. As well I hope with this lab class I figure out what I would like to do in the future.

      "I am taking this physics lab technically to meet the requirements for my major. I believe that physics is a requirement partially due to the nature of this major. Computer Science is related to Computer Engineering. Computer Engineering involves physics. Perhaps another reason is, it's important to know physics, so that we'd understand how things theoretically work. Perhaps it's included to require students to round off their major with other subjects--so that students learn about subjects outside of their field. If I were to ask myself, \"why am I taking physics?,\" then perhaps I would be asking myself why I'd want to pursue a degree in Computer Science. Computer Science is about logic and how things work. It's within my understanding that this is similar to physics. I enjoy learning about how things work underneath the hood. I explore different ways of deriving a solution that gives the same output, and relish in methodically documenting my work and improving my code. So in a sense I enjoy learning about physics because the underlying thought process shares common ground with programming. In addition, I also want to learn cool things about machinery.\n",

However, one rings out louder than the rest without getting too existential, that one relating to why I am at SFSU, studying physics in a temporary building right now. I chose physics as my major for two main reasons. For one, physics was the only subject in high school that I actually enjoyed studying, mostly thanks to having an excellent teacher (shout out to Chris Balmy.) Secondly, thinking about the mechanics of our day-to-day lives has fascinated me for a while, since it ensures that physics will always be relevant, no matter the circumstances. As for why I'm here studying physics in this very moment, this lab is a required addition to the lecture component of the course, and while I would have liked to avoid coming in on Tuesday at 9:30 AM, sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do. It could be worse though, at least I don't have any 8 AMs. This is my first lab course that feels like a real lab course, so I am very excited to see where this goes!\n",

My religion is Sikhism and I really am grateful that I am Sikh because it really accepts any person, no matter what race you are, gender, or anything. I have two sisters and I love my family; my parents are the main reason I’m in college because I want to support them in the future and provide for them like they did with me. I am a very shy person but I get used to talking to the people around me in a few days. My current goal for my life is to be a researcher, and to be honest I really don’t know what to yet. I want to explore anything in the biology department, but botany sounds like a great thing to start with. One of my motivations for doing well is probably my parents and wanting to make them proud. Back in high school I had fun in biology, and in the cell department actually, so that might be a second option for me. For a few months I was thinking to study RPT, (recreation, parks, and tourism), because that major seems very fun to me and with jobs it could come with. For researching as a biologist, I think it might be very hard but fun to do something that you are passionate about. For the RPT, I think it might be fun to do your job depending on your passion as well, but also there are a few well-paying jobs and I want to be able to provide for my family, I found this out from one of my professors I had for RPT. The researching in biology is awesome, for me I thought the environment conservation one is interesting. We need more people in this field because the earth is really a beautiful place and it really needs help. I just don’t know if all these biology courses would be great for me, I don’t really do well in math and if the major needs math I might struggle. But luckily botany doesn’t really need math, cell research also doesn’t need that much math as well. The forensic department sounds awesome because you work with the police and that would be great to help out at a crime scene and help the police. I want to explore during this class and see how an actually biologist does lab work during the labs, this will help me figure out if this is right for me. I would also like to see a botany advisor for some guidance and help on if that is a good option for me.\n",

I completely forgot about those guys because it’s like so basic but yet important as one continues to build their chemistry skills as the courses get harder.

       "\"I am here to learn the basics of physics through experiments, also to graduate as the first one in my family from a college university. This should help me in the future because it is for my major requirement for kinesiology. I am also enrolled in the physics lecture. Physics is in everyday life so this class will come in handy. Currently I'm learning conversions which I am bad at. I wish to improve my math skills and conversion skills. This class will prepare me for upper division classes, even though its my last physics class, it should come in handy in everyday problem solving. For example if I ever need to calculate how much gas I need to pump in my car. I can calculate it with money, gallons, and miles. So this class will enhance my problem solving skills right now in life, and later in life. I am here to learn.†\""
