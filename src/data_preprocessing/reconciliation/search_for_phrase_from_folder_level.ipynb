Though these obstacles may be tough, I try my best to push through because I know I can. Despite my struggles, I want everyone to know that it is not easy. I am here to make someone’s day. I like to make those around me happy or even doing one little thing to make their day. I value kindness and happiness. I also value friendliness. How I treat others is how I expect others to treat me. I am here to explore the world. I love to travel and visit new places I have not been to before. Visiting a new environment is a good feeling and puts me in a position where I don’t always know everything. Lastly I am here because of my friends and family. They give me the love and support to keep going in life. They are my reason to go on in life.', \"For this question, there are many ways that I interpret it. Why am i here in this class? Well honestly, I am here because it is part of my pre req requirements to get into dental school. But the other way i interpret it is, Why am i here on this Earth? I think I am here because I was born. I do not really believe in predestination or that we are here for a specific reason. But my current purpose on being alive is just to enjoy what life has to give me. I want to have as much fun before I die and that I am going to do everything I can to remain on that goal. And for me to do that I have to make money. Although money isn't what will lead me to happiness, it allows me the freedom to do whatever I want. And the idea of being free, and doing anything that I want is the main purpose of me being here. And if I can change a few people's life at a certain moment in time then so be it.\", '\"Why am I here\", the reason why I am here taking this class is because I need to take this class as a requirement for my major which is Construction Management. I didn\\'t know that physics had to do something with my major. I know nothing about physic, never took a physics class in high school so this is all new to me.I started off by attending SF state as a business major but always had a passion for nursing so I started to take some pre-reqs for nursing but after figuring out the process in order to get into to nursing program it brought down my hopes of majoring in nursing.I started to think what other major interests me and after doing research I decided that Construction Management was a great option for me since I had plans of owning a construction company in the future.', \"Ever since I was a little girl, I’ve dreamed of becoming a veterinarian. I loved animals so much that I couldn't think of anything else that would make me happier than to work with the animals that I loved so much. This is the main reason I’m here; because it is a requirement in order for me to acquire my bachelor’s degree. That being said, I plan to do my best while we are in the middle of a pandemic. On a broader note, I think about why I am in college in the first place. I’m an at SFSU because I come from a family that did not have the privilege of attending college, so I am doing it also on my family’s behalf. I hope that one day when I graduate from college and become a vet, my family will be proud of me and know that I didn’t only go it for my own benefit, but theirs as well. I also want to be able to give back to my family as much as possible, because they sacrificed so much to get me to where I am today. I am incredibly thankful for all they've done for me.\", \"I am here to learn more about physics and motion by putting it into practice via labs. We can learn more about mechanics in physics and how it applies to everyday life, like in our machinery and other stuff. Today I assume we're going to learn about vectors and how we can use them on a coordinate plane to view motion in a simple manner.I'm here to further my education and complete requirements for my major in order to graduate. We have a lot of subjects that we need to cover and this class is another stepping stone towards that goal of being able to attain a degree that I could use in the future.I have the goal of becoming a forensic scientist or to be in some field of forensics. I just find it to be an interesting subject that we could apply everywhere else. Physics, chemistry, biology and other scientific subjects need to be applied to it in order to figure out problems in the real world.\", 'I think I am here as of right now because I want to be able to do well in the present and in the future. I want to be able to help my family, be able to graduate, find a good job in the future, etc. I guess it\\'s called the \"American Dream\" that people would believe they\\'ll be able to achieve. I want to be able to make my parents, family, and friends happy because of what I can do and show them that I can do it. Even though I struggled throughout school, I was able to make it through even if it doesn\\'t go my way. I think the saying you learn and you grow is kind of my motto. Hopefully, with these mistakes that I made, I will be able to grow and improve. Though I can\\'t really predict my future, I hope I\\'ll be able to make people happy and find a career in the medical field since I\\'m still unsure now.\\xa0', 'Why am I here?It’s a question that I get a lot in classes nowadays. To be quite honest, this class is necessary for my degree and most likely to get into medical school. It’s a shallow answer, but if I had to elaborate then I would say that this class is a step towards becoming a doctor.\\xa0I’ve wanted to become a doctor for as long as medical books have existed in libraries. My mother used to quiz me on them from a young age, and I could watch TV excessively if it were medical dramas. I doubted if that was what I truly wanted, but after interning in an operating room over the summer in high school, my passion was solidified. I wanted to be the one doing the procedure- not just watching. Of course, to get to that point, I had to go to college.\\xa0I am more passionate more than ever to achieve my goals. My friend passed away recently from a disease. When my other friend who was much closer to her said to me, “I hope you become a great doctor so you can help people like her,” I knew that my ambitions were personal. I miss my friend every day, and I haven’t been the same without her. I struggle in day to day life and classes because of the grief. However, if to do well in school is what it takes, then I will power through. I have the chance to do the things she did not. I can’t afford to take this time for granted.', 'I recently graduated from USF in May and I am currently taking classes here at SFSU to meet my pre req requirements.\\xa0 I graduated with a kinesiology degree at USF and I want to pursue physical therapy in the future.\\xa0 I will be applying to physical therapy school after this semester.\\xa0 Physics courses are essential in terms of physical therapy and human anatomy because topics such as vectors and forces can be a good analogy when it comes to the human body and its bones.\\xa0 I currently work at a physical therapy clinic at Presidio Sport and Medicine and majority of the exercises that i prescribe my patients coincide with physics topics/analogy.\\xa0 The human body, specifically our bones, joints, and tendons all move in different directions and provide different amounts of force that can be acted upon.\\xa0 This is essentially why I think I am here in this course.\\xa0\\xa0', \"If we are talking about this specific class I am here primarily as a prereq for Biomechanics. Luckily I also enjoy physics and learning about physics so I am glad I am able to take this class. I also understand that this is a relatively important class as physics is found all around us and not just in math formulas we learn in class. If we are talking about why am I at SFSU it because of the great kinesiology program that is offered here. I also learned about the kind of fast track program to work on my master's in kinesiology while I am finishing up my bachelor's degree. So to the question of why I am here is that I am trying to finish up my degree in Kinesiology to pursue a career as a strength and conditioning coach at the college level, and to do so I need to complete this class to be able to continue my major classes.\", 'I am here because this is the path of my major here at San Francisco State. This class will give me one of the requirements that i need to eventually graduate from here so i can hopefully go on to law school. The reason i am here today is because i have changed my major three separate times, and i have finally chosen to pursue my dream major of being a scientist. Before i was listening to my parents who told me that a science degree would not give me the amount of job opportunities later on in life, but now i have learned that if your whole heart is not in something, then it is not worth doing. This is the way that i want to live my life, and hopefully it does not come back to haunt me in the future. My dream is to become a lawyer and someday have the money o be able to provide for my family. But looking at how i got here is something truly amazing - as all the accidents and coincidences have led me to this moment.\\xa0', '\"Why am I here?\"I am here to become more educated, so that I may grow as a person, academic, and professional. I was required to take this course as a form of foundation to build on the classes I need to get a Career in Envriontal Science and my Degree. But regardless of this, I know that every class I ever take in my lifetime will be for the betterment of it, and my view of it. I know that everything I learn will make me more round and capable to be more prepared for what\\'s ahead. So, I am here for two reasons only, myself, and my goals to obtain a degree so that it may assist me in getting the career I want.', 'I am currently taking Physics111 at the same time. I believe taking the laboratory along with the lecture can help me to understand the material even better. I think that is why this course is being set up in this way. Also, the reason why I am taking this class because it is one of the prerequisites of a graduate program that I am trying to apply. General physics will be highly related to my major Kinesiology as well. For example, body movement or balance is based on the concept of physics. Without having general physical knowledge, I will not be able to accomplish my education goal in the Kinesiology major, or graduate program in the future. At the same time, physics is often involved in our daily life. Learning more about physics should be very interesting and can relate to our environment.\\xa0', 'I am at SFSU because I want to get a college education and graduate from a college without having to pay an extreme amount of money for tuition like other colleges have. SFSU is also a college that is relatively close to where I live so I chose to go here in order to be able to stay with my family which is important to me. When getting more specific towards the question of “why am I here?” I would say that I am generally just taking this class because it is required for my major..however, I am specifically taking this lab because I did not pass my lab last semester. I would personally say that after covid started and everything went online last semester I kind of just checked out since I was so used to being in class in person. This semester though, I feel like I have gotten more used to the idea of everything being online and the fact that I will have to keep myself in check and be more responsible.', \"I'm here because I want to be a nurse and help people with their needs, and so that I am able to support myself without having to worry about how much rent is going to be a dent in my wallet, so that I can learn as much as I can, especially in university where I have access to knowledge and resources that I may not have again. I'm here to make myself content as I can be and to travel.\\xa0\", \"I am here taking this course because it is a requirement for my major. I am currently a pre bio major planning to concentrate in physiology. Despite it being required, I am also here to learn just like for any of my other courses, whether they are required GE's or required for my major. I have taken physics before during my junior year of high school, but if I’m being honest, it wasn’t exactly the best. I do anticipate learning something new in each of my classes, including this one. As for why I'm here at SFSU, I am here because it seemed like a school with a lot of diversity and opportunities. Also it is relatively close to my home here in the East Bay of California. I am here in the East Bay because it is where I was born and raised my whole life. Most of my friends and family are here as well.\", 'I’m a 5th year here at SFSU, majoring in kinesiology and minoring in anthropology! I plan to get my doctorate degree in physical therapy. I used run track until my freshman year of college and with that experience I was able to see PT’s at work and I fell in love. I initially was planning on going into athletic training but two semesters ago I decided to go full throttle. I’m here in PHYS 112 to complete my requirements for graduate school! After SFSU, I plan on taking a year to catch up on all my requirements and also get more hands on experience.', \"There's several reason why i'm here, Mainly is because i'm enroll in this class and i have to present in the class to follow the lecture. if i miss a day lecture, i feel really uncomfortable since i will miss some important information.\\xa0Another reason why i'm here is because of my parents that decide to have two kids and that i ended up born as the second child and therefore i am here on earth and have an older sister that sometimes really annoying, flying far away from home to pursue my education in the states and that will be another reason that i am here in the states. In addition to that, i am here in the class because i need this class to fulfill my GE requirement for graduating with biology physiology major. Although i don't like physics so much before, but i try to learn as much as i can from this short class.\\xa0I am here because i am destined to be here, by fate, by my parents and by God.\\xa0\", \"Apart from this being a required course for my biology major, I guess I would have to say I'm here so that I can continue to pursue my goal of being in the medical field in the near future. I have always believed that my sole purpose on this earth was to help others. As a kid, I've always wanted to be a veterinarian, but I have also shown interest in other fields of medicine throughout the years. I'm currently on track to pursue a veterinarian career with a concentration in zoology within my biology major, however, I'm keeping my options open. I really enjoyed physics in high school and was even ambitious enough to take AP Physics, but I later ended up dropping the class feeling extremely overwhelmed with my other AP classes. I really do hope to get a lot out of this class despite the circumstances.\\xa0\", 'The reason that I am here in school and in class because I want to learn about physics. I want to learn how matter and energy is related to physics and who invented the matter. Another reasons that I am here in school because i want to graduate from college and being able to attend medical school. I like to learn about physics because it has to do\\xa0 more about related to math.

However I do hope that I learn a lot about physics because I enjoy learning and gaining new knowledge. I am here because I hope to be successful and pursue my goals in being a scientist especially within the research industry. I am here because I love science. If I were to choose any subject, science would by my number one choice because there is science behind everything in everyday life. I feel like science can be applied anywhere while math, english or history etc. does not. Science interest me the most and I have always been interested in science since I was in elementary school. However it wasn’t until High school I learned that I would to make a living off science.', \"I am in this class due to it being a pre-req for my major which is biology. I am her so that i can gradute with a bachelors in Biology and hopefully get into medical school. I am passionate about this because i want to become a pediatric surgeon or doctor. This has been a dream of mine for a while and i have stuck to it ever since it became just an idea in my head. The reason for my interest in the medical field is as a pediatric doctor or surgeon, is because i love working with children and i would love to give them a second chance at life and just put a smile on their faces by making them feel better. It is going to be tough but i know that it is something i am really passionate about. This is the reason why i am here so that i can acheive my goals and what i am passionate about. I chose SFSU because it was the closest school from home that accepted me and i didn't want to be to far from home.\", 'I am here at SF State to pursue a degree in Biochemistry and become a pharmacist. This class is a prerequisite to my major but also, I never took a physics class so I wanted to see if physics is a really interesting subject in the science field. I believe that becoming a pharmacist is very underrated. There are many benefits to becoming a pharmacist like getting to know which medicine is OTC and what can instantly help you out or your family. In addition, they make a lot of money so it helps you out financially too. I also think it would be really cool if someone in your family is like \"I got this issue\" and then you have the answer to that and can tell them what medical doctors are likely to recommend as well.\\xa0I came here to SF State because my first intended major (Pre-Nursing) was very hard to get into so I decided to look at other jobs and pharmacy really caught my eye. I also took care of my grandma\\'s medication before she passed away so I was also just interested in how other medications can affect the body.\\xa0', 'Why Am I Here? If I’m being honest with myself I feel very lost. A lot has happened to my life the last few months and it made me do a lot of things that I might regret in the future. I felt like I didn’ t know what I was doing or where I was headed in terms of what I was doing with my life. At the moment, I am trying to find my middle ground and focusing my time on school so that I can take a break from all the problems I’m experiencing in my life. Working hard and getting school work done allows me to feel at peace and in control of what’ s happening in my life. Being in college and getting my degree is probably my biggest motivator in life at the moment. To answer your question, I am here because I want to find myself and give myself a better future.', \"I am here because I have to. I need to be here to pass the class.

Oh I'm here because I completed physics 101, I couldn't compete together because it would be too much work for me. For someone who wants to graduate early, doesn't want too much on their plate. Right now I making lunch because I'm hungry, its time for lunch anyway. Theres only soup in the kitchen but I'm not craving it. Soup is only good the day it made, fresh out the pot.

First I want to become an EMT, to gain experience and be their first hand to help.\\xa0\", 'At first glance, I take this question from a metaphysical and philosophical perspective and I want to answer by explaining my existence on this Earth. While it being a rather grave and serious topic, I think it is a good practice to review my life so far, and what better way to do so than to document it here in this submission box for a prompt asking me to reflect on my existence for a Physics laboratory course. So I begin with stating that I am alive on this planet at this very point in time because my body has not failed me yet, with all of my physiological processes and internal homeostatic activities continuing to provide for my survival. I like to think that I have taken care of myself through healthy practices such as a balanced nutrition and regular exercise, and my body has taken care of me in turn by keeping me alive and well. As a result of my good health, my brain and heart and all of the above have kept me living and existing today. At second glance, the question may have simply been asking me to think about why I am taking this Physics laboratory, to which I respond in simple regards as well. It also makes a little more sense to answer the question about the course since it is in the context of the physics course, but I digress. I am here in this class because it is a prerequisite for the Kinesiology major to which I am interested in declaring, so I take it to satisfy the prerequisite and advance towards my endeavor to achieving a degree in Kinesiology.', 'Reflection #1   I am here on a journey just like everyone else.

I am a Kinesiology major and physics is an important component of this field of study.  My ultimate goal is to become  a doctor of physical therapy and have my own practice potentially and I would specifically like to work with athletes or wounded veterans.  I think that this class will be beneficial to me in many ways including improving my knowledge of how the world works around me, especially in relation to injuries caused by external forces acting on the body.  I also think that this class will help improve my critical thinking skills because physics require you to investigate the reasons for why something occurred and consider many different variables in relation to something happening.  All in all I hope to be a better well rounded student after this class and better prepared for the next steps in my journey.', 'Why am I here?  \\tI am here because I want to pursue in Physical therapy helping injured clients in need to live with basic necessities and functions that are part of their life. Conceptual physics lab is part of the pre requisites of Kinesiology that I must accomplish to progress further in route of my physical therapy career. Before I majored in computer science and I changed after realizing that I do not like solving problems in one sitting for 6 to 8 hours a day. So I reflected on myself and what I would like to do and one part is that I like to help others. I also keep positive thoughts most of the time when times are hard or not. I am also into fitness and love to exercise specifically body building and weight loss as it is part of my lifestyle.

I started here at San Francisco State as a transfer student and this is my second fall semester at this school. I hope to finish soon so I can go start working in my career field of choice. I am taking this class to fulfill my graduation requirement for my major. I am hopeful my college career at this university will open many paths in career choices. I know my career is not set so I hope to learn and experience different settings that will set up my future.', 'I am here for m second year of college at San Francisco State University to get my degree which I do not know in what yet. I am here taking this class online because of the coronavirus pandemic that is ruling the world everyday and is not stopping for everyone even is people get the vaccine or wear masks because of ignorant people that choose to not get the vaccine or wear a mask and follow social distancing rules and tactics to keep yourself safe when outside. I am here in this class to check a requirement off of my degree plan so that I can keep persevering through my years at SFSU to get my degree. I am here because the physics course I am taking requires me to take a laboratory class with the course. I am here because I want a future after college and try to be successful for myself and for the ones that I care and love for. I am here because I am on a journey to pursue a career path that is still unknown to me but will reveal itself soon to me because I am hoping to choose this certain path in the year to come.\\xa0', \"I think that I've had a long journey to where I currently am. As a junior transfer student, I've been in many classes already and I hope that this Physics lab isn't as hard. Since moving here to San Francisco to be closer to school, it's been a much different experience compared to San Jose. Even though these two cities are not that far a part, the lifestyle is already so different. I hope that through the courses I am taking this semester, I can grow much more as a student. Especially since I've felt so discouraged and unmotivated since the pandemic forced all of our schooling online, I hope that this semester has a little effect on that because I am able to attend one in person class. I am here to complete my degree, and I enjoy learning new subjects!!\", '\"Why am I here?\"I am here to graduate with my degree and be the first one of my immediate family to graduate from a 4 year university. I also wish to make my parents proud of me for accomplishing this. I am also here to make a better future for myself and to also pursue my interests in animals specifically reptiles. More importantly I wish to have a career in an area where I can interact and work with reptiles. I\\'m not sure in regards to what I will specifically specialize in reptiles but I just know that working with them has been a dream of mine and to be able to understand these creature more thoroughly.\\xa0', \"I am here in this class because I have always been very intrigued by how physic works in our world. I really have no idea, if you were to ask me right now, what physic even is. I personally enjoy learning how things work because I'm naturally a very curious person and I love to talk about the things I learned in class to my friends. I don't like the learning process, but enjoy knowing things. I'm majoring in biology, hoping that I can get into an accelerated BSN program, so I know a few random cool biology and chemistry facts. I sometimes ramble to my boyfriend because I thought it was cool learning about how our body works and how chemicals work the way they do. Although this is a very new topic for me, I hope I can end the semester with some knowledge in physics and share some cool facts to my friends\\xa0\", 'I am here taking PHYS 0112-02 because I plan to go to medical school and Im not very good with calculus so taking physics 220 was out of the picture. Hopefully I can pass this class with a B or an A so that when Im in my last year, I wont have to worry about my grades as much as I would if I get a C in this class. And for the medical schools I do want to go to (UCSF), I need to have a grade above a C anyways so im killing two birds with one stone. Im trying to work smarter not harder.\\xa0', 'In the context of this class, I am here to develop my critical thinking. I am here to try and see normal, everyday, things in a different and more scientific way. Before taking a class like this I gave things a little bit of thought, but now the understanding is starting to get much deeper. For instance, ice, water, and water vapor can exist at the same temperature. I have become more curious and interested in the world around me. I am hoping this class helps me to think about non scientific things in other ways as well. I am looking forward to taking more physics in the future.', 'Linh Mao September 1st, 2021 Reflective Journaling #1 Words: 181 The purpose of why I am here is to learn physics in general. I took a physics class in high school, but I never took one in college. This will be my first time learning physics in college, and therefore I am looking forward to applying some physics in my real life. I had a lot of fun during the physics lab in high school, so I hope to gain the same experiences in college. I am excited to learn new challenging problems that I will encounter throughout this class. I am also interested in learning the topic of Newton’s law of motion and gravitational. The first time learning physics in high school was confusing because of the math problem. However, it started to make sense as I kept doing practice problems. I hope I will have a better understanding of physics in this class, and learn something new. I am a third-year and major in Kinesiology with a concentration in Exercise and Movement Sciences. PHYS 111 laboratory is a required concentration course that is needed for the degree in Kinesiology.', 'The reason I am here is because I am a Biology major with a concentration in Zoology. I attended my local junior college for a few years with poor advising, so I missed out on a lot of core STEM courses. But I am excited to learn and face the challenges of physics. I did not do well in high school physics but there was a lot going on at home.\\xa0I think it is interesting how Physics ties in to other fields of science. Especially meteorology or learning the patterns of the waves. This is very important for safety reasons and expanding society.\\xa0A lot of my friends are physics majors, one is working through is Masters at Long Beach State right now. So it would be nice to talk ideas and concepts. Plus, I am a big Rocket League nerd. The math and equations are intimidating sometimes but I believe I have the patience to have a great experience this semester.', 'Honestly I am here because it is a requirement for the degree I am trying to obtain. I am a biology major on the pre-med route so taking this class and doing well in it is essential to being successful in my near future. This class is also a pre requisite for classes I will take the following semesters. There is a physics portion on the MCAT and one of the tougher topics students complain about, which gives me some anxiety. By being in this class I hope to understand the fundamentals of physics and apply it to studying for the MCAT and getting into a good school.', \"Why am I here? I'm am here based on the decisions I have made in my life. Since I was a little kid I was always interested in learning sciences and how things in nature lived/ worked. As I got older and went to high school I took classes based in science like biology, life science, and a medical program; that all peaked my interested even more in chasing a career in biology. Now that I'm in college and had the chance to chase my dreams and it has put me into physics. I'm not the strongest in mathematics nor solving word problems. But in order to complete college and retain my degree I need to push through my struggles and pass physics. I'm here to create better study practices and to make sure I have enough time to review lectures, so I can do better on the testing materials.\\xa0\", 'I’m here for the second time to learn about Physics. The first time my professor from my other school was not quite approachable. I would like to earn the best knowledge from this class. Although, this is a requirement for my pre med requirements. I want to be able to understand how physics works in the medical field. Understanding the value of medicine and physics and how and where it has connections with patients. I hope by the end of semester, I will have a better understanding of physics. I hope to memorize it in the back of my head without constantly reteaching myself or reviewing. I am well sure this is used in radiology and cardiology. Also, I do enjoy physics slightly more than chemistry and biochemistry. I hope to also be a physics tutor as well since there is more theoretical concepts of physics\\xa0', \"I am here in this physics class because my major requires it. In addition, I need to take this class in order to take physics 121 and 122 next semester. I am a biology major with a minor in criminal justice. I'm not entirely sure if my future career requires me to do some physics work but I guess it's nice to know. I would like to become a forensic toxicologist in the future or shortly after I graduate SFSU.\\xa0\", 'The question \"why am I here\" has many possible responses. If the question pertains specifically to why I am in this physics lab, then the answer is because it is a prerequisite for my major. I am currently deciding whether I want to change my major from business to either biology or physics. I think what I\\'m going to do is a physics major with a biology minor because both interest me but that would be the easiest route. I am here in this specific lab course because I originally wanted to major in biology and this is a required class for that route. If I major in physics, this class doesn\\'t count for anything but I\\'m taking it because I\\'m also enrolled in calculus and would need to have already completed calculus to take physics with calculus. I\\'m pretty behind and should be graduating next semester but I dropped some semesters and didn\\'t enroll for other ones so I\\'d say I should technically be a sophomore or maybe junior. This semester I am trying to get straight As and work really hard to learn because, up until now, I haven\\'t really tried much in school and it kind of feels like a waste. I\\'d really like to major in physics because I love math and I love the world and want to learn more about it. I feel like there is a lot left to do in the world and I want to be a part of making it better. So uhh yeah.', \"Reflective Journaling #1\\xa0Why Am I Here?I am here in this class because this is my journey to my purpose in the medical field, what motivated me to want to go into the medical field is because I want to help and make an impact on people's lives for the better, but I want to target people of color mostly because there is a lot of inequality within the medical field on who gets the most access to great healthcare which is why I want to break that barrier. I feel that taking this class will give me some knowledge that can contribute to my career of helping others to the best of my ability. I see a life for myself that I know I can accomplish pushing all the stereotypes and opinions about being an African American woman being a doctor in the field. Furthermore, what brought me to the class is my goal to help the black and brow community. Physics is a way to give me a foundation and open up many doors to showing more of my potential in society and health to make a difference. Additionally, I feel that this will help with coming up with calculations whether that prescribing medicine for people's health or helping with someone's treatment which is definitely a big factor for me in the medical field which I will be taking advantage of every day.\\xa0\\xa0\", 'Brook Miller  September 2, 2021Reflection Journaling #1  ‘Why am I here?”  This type of question is very broad it can mean a lot of things, like why am I here in the world or why am I here in this class or why am I here in this school? To be honest for the first question I can’t answer that not yet that is. I believe that people are put in this world at the time they are meant, and, in the place, they were born because everyone has a purpose to do something. It can be as big as curing cancer to as small as saying hello to someone who has suicidal thoughts. Everyone has a reason to be on this earth my is I have no idea yet.  However why am I here at this school taking this class because I want to. Here at SFSU I can get a degree that will help me with my career choice. From the start of college, I wanted to be an animal control officer, so I wanted to major in animal science, but when it got to the time to transfer, I decided to go to SFSU because they don’t have animal science, but zoology. With a degree in zoology, I have more options on what direction I want my career to go.   Now why am I in this class simply because it is part of my major. I have to take this class is required of the school if I want to graduate. I’m going, to be honest here I have never taken a physics class before, so I don’t know what to expect, but I know that I am here in this class at this school in this plant for a reason and some of the reason I don’t know why, but the other reason is because I want to be here and I’m also required to be here at one point or another. \\xa0', \"The reason I am in this class is because I need to fill my major requirements, which makes me take Physics. I have always been afraid of taking physics because thee concept is completely new to me. I hope to be able to understand the material in the course. With answering the question, Why am I here... I am in college because many like many of us, are looking for a better future. I am currently studying Biology in hopes of becoming a doctor either for children or adults. I know i want to follow this career path because growing up i wasn't fortunate enough to have a great pediatrician. As a child, they told me something that truly stunted my confidence, and I wouldn't wish that on any child. Also, my parents struggled with having adequate care in the medical field because there has always been a language barrier for them.

I am at this university because it was the best option for me out of the ones that I got accepted into. I am also here to honestly just get to where I want to be in life. I want to be able to enjoy my life later on and live a comfortable lifestyle and the only way to do that is to get a good education and get a good job. Many years of schooling and training are needed to become a doctor, so I'm just taking one step at a time and this class just happens to be one of the next steps that I needed to take.\\xa0\", \"I'm here because studying physics will strengthen and help me problem solving skills that are valuable in areas beyond physics. to approach problems using what we'll be learning in class this semester. learning how to speak about things in a way that I actually understand beyond a dictionary definition and apply what I'll be learning, even if I don’t understand necessarily how to go about a problem. To label my axes and units, and be as specific as possible because I still struggle, my goal is to keep trying and practicing difficult problems and making mistakes in order to ultimately learn something important. I'm very terrified when it comes to physics, but I'm here to learn and see how far I can get in the sciences. I want to be able to have the ability to solve problems that I still think are impossible and have trouble with.\", 'Right now I’m not really sure my life is all over the place with work, school, and friends I barely have time for anything.

Because I need to graduate, it’s my last lower division physical science I need in order to move forward with my degree. I am very grateful to be in this class this semester without it I wouldn’t be able to take most of my upper-division classes next semester, so I am here to pass. I also really enjoy physics I actually read many physic books and I have a few audiobooks as well.

Personally, I hated Physics in high school, so if I could, I would avoid taking this class entirely. No matter my opinion on the subject, I will strive to be present and actively learning in each lesson. Mainly, I am here for an “A,” and will do what it takes to achieve that goal.', \"I'm here because none of my older siblings went to college or even graduated from high school.

My dad kind of pushed me into this direction and made me feel like I couldn't let him down or disappoint him by not furthering my education. I'm really happy that my dad was there to push me to do better than what I've seen because I discovered a lot of interests I didn't know I had. I really love science and I'm very passionate about getting a career in the health field. My interest in science and medicine led me to major in biology and now I am in this class because it is a pre-req and also to get me closer to my degree.\\xa0\", 'The reason why I am here at SF State is that I decided to go to college for a four year degree. This allows me to be able to get a successful career, and there are many things to do while in college. Some of the activities would include going to classes and meeting new people, but sometimes there are stresses at school such as homework and exams. This school seemed to have the best surroundings based on what I know in terms of the schools that I applied to. Many of the buildings can be very interesting for a school in terms of the architecture. However, this class started at the trailer, but we are now in Thornton Hall due to ventilation issues. This would seem counterintuitive because the trailer has open able windows while the new room has an air system from what I assumed. This can show that we still must be flexible to new updates. Another reason why I am here is to learn more about physics and be able to get a prerequisite for my degree. This can be fundamental for learning about more advance topics, and these topics can rely on many different sources for information. Also, this class was able to meet my schedule.', 'I’m here to complete a requirement so I could graduate in 4 years. Even though I like to do math it dose t mean it’s a hobby.

Sfsu is my 2nd choice if I don’t attend a Uc, first starters it close to my house and cheap. Even though I decline 2 Uc acceptance letter I think that I did a good decision in a economical perspective because I would be in depth in my 4 years of college . Even though I’ll need to take a loan \\xa0for Med school I guess I did the right choice. Also I’m thinking of going to Med school but I’m not sure what branch or career I’ll apply because I’m not going to make a decision this early and might regret it.\\xa0', 'Why am I in Physics? That is a question similar to “Why are you in Bio?” “Why are you in Chem?” Well, because they are classes that I need in order to work at places like Genentech or any bio/bio medical company. A lot can be connected to physics, whether I like it or not. Chemistry is bordering on physics, as it mostly touches upon the physics of elements, chemical compounds and how they interact in the world. Physics however, its looking at the world mathematically. Now unless you like math, are very passionate about what Physics does, or a masochist, this would be one heck of a subject to take. For me, I’m trying to be optimistic about this class, mainly because I’m terrified to look at my calculus grade because I know I failed. What does that have to do with Physics? Again, physics is bordering around mathematics itself and my brain is now wired to fear math because of the countless times I tried, failed, tried to get help, failed again… Just when I thought I had everything together it just falls apart. Its precisely because of that that I want to do better this semester. I want to understand, I don’t want to feel helpless when I’m doing a test or lab. I want to prove to myself that I can do mathematics, that I can learn and am capable of doing so. Whether it be desperation or genuine need to understand, I just want to be able to trust myself again. So again, Why am I in this class? Because I know I need to. I know it’s going to get tougher.

After 5 blissful years in Italy my parents decided that our life was too easy and peaceful so we moved to the bay area with my two older siblings. I grew up in the same house as my mother in North Berkeley with my grandfather. Growing up in Berkeley opened my eyes to many possibilities. In high school I was able to learn about animals which I had always had a yearning passion to care for and learn about. When I was younger I was a huge horse girl and every Saturday morning at 7:30 my dad would take me to San Ramon which is an hour away from where we lived to go to horseback riding lessons. I loved it there, well partially. I loved being with the horses and grooming them and just watching their behavior. I would sometimes try talking to them to get some sort of response. However no matter how hard I tried to talk to these horses they never responded. That did not stop my desire to be with animals. In middle school I started volunteering at my local animal shelter so my parents would get me a dog. Then in High school I learned about rhinos and elephants being endangered species.

Another reason why I want to pursue STEM is to bring innovation in healthcare. As we have seen during covid pandemic, none of us knew what steps to take or how should we resolve this issue, but I want our future to like where any disease can be cured within minutes.

This love started when I was a little kid walking into Disneyland for the first time and continues to this day as I walk into any amusement park I go into. The intricacies of the rollercoasters, the layout of the parks, and the complexities of the animatronics that bring the rides to life.

I will be graduating in fall of 2022 so i guess I can say that so far I’ve been keeping up, and once I am able to go into my field of study; the first pay check I have will be used to help my parents out financially because they’ve been such a blessing in my life.', 'I want to go into the STEM field because I have never seen myself going into any other field. I have always been good at math and science and enjoyed it as well. I never did bad in English or art or anything but I have always felt more at home doing STEM related courses. I have found that I like the stimulation I get from finding solutions to math, science, and coding problems. I have a passion for coding and I want to do things I like for the rest of my life which is why I have decided to go into the STEM field. I have also seen people in my family who work in the STEM field be pretty well off and that is also a motivation for me to go into the STEM field, not one of my main reasons but a very good reason nonetheless.', \"I want to go into the STEM field is becuase: First, it need learn many things and need update technology with time. This makes it have law of jungle, if you don't learn, you will be eliminated.\\xa0 Second, it don't have many literature need to see and recite. I don't like liberal subject. I don't like recite history. And my writeing skills are poor. Third, I really like computer science. I can use a computer to do many things. I can develop a web which is belong myself. I can develop a new apps with others. I like use my brain and think. STEM field give me a comfortable environment. Some people maybe says, girls are not suit in STEM field. They can't do good in calculate. But I want to prove that girls can do these things. My dream is join a web develop company. I hope my work can be used in everyone's telephone or computer.\", \"I want to go into the STEM field because I find computer technology fascinating. Ever since I was young, computers have been always apart of my life whether it was through school computer lab or using a handheld device, I always found a way to use one. By the time I was in middle school I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do, I just knew I wanted computers to be apart of it. In my freshmen year of high school, I took a class which had me learn to use a computer keyboard without looking while I typed. Two years later, I took a basic computer coding class and I settled on wanting to pursue a career in Computer Science specifically with web penetration or hacking. To this day, I want to major in Computer Science and do something in CyberSecurity.\", \"I didn't actually desire to go into the stem field. I just prefer the subject of math over literature. Pair that with me being on my computer all day and the main choice would be majoring in Computer Science. So far, it hasn't been a bad choice. I feel like it does fit me. It's a lot of logical thinking and building which is pretty fun. Otherwise, that's about it.\", 'During my junior year of high school was when everyone in my grade was deciding what university and major they wanted to study. For a long time, I had no idea what I wanted to study in college. I had always considered something in the STEM field, but never felt confident enough in my science classes to do so. For a long time, I tried to just find things that I was interested and enjoyed. After a lot of thought, I realized that two things that I enjoyed were solving problems and making/thinking of new things. From this, I decided to study mechanical engineering.\\xa0There are many varying sub fields to mechanical engineering but as of right now, I do not know exactly what field I would like to go in to. Part of myself would love to go into something with cars or planes as I find both very fascinating, but another part of myself would also be interested in the design portion of new products or applications.', 'The reason I chose a major in the STEM field is because of the money. I initially wanted to stay away from the STEM field because of math but after a while I decided to choose computer science as it is the only field that seems fun and high paying as well. I wanted to choose a major that would help me get a job that has a high starting salary because I plan on paying student loans as soon as possible.', \"Manish Sharma  PHY 232-07   1 September 2021  Reflection #1  Why do I want to go into the STEM field?  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There was no specific reason or events in life resulted to choose STEM as a major in my life. However, growing up I was always curious about how things work? Like I always used to think about how the earth is there, the sun, everything around me. To be honest, I still have so many questions in my mind. I think this curiosity led me to take Science as a major in high school. During the 11th grade, I decided I will be some sort of engineer. And as I grew up in the developing country, Nepal, there is always an enthusiasm in kids to become doctors, engineers,s or anything related to the STEM sector. I think that is because my parents had to grow up in difficult than my generation. And they always used to tell me and my siblings, that you should study better and be an engineer, doctor, or nurse. So, here I am trying to fill my parent's dreams and find the answers to my own curiosities.\", \"I want to go into the STEM field because I really want to make video games. And in order to make them I need to learn software development. Whether I want to create my own game engine or not. I decided to go for a computer science degree because I feel that it would go hand in hand with software development within the gaming industry. Needing to know hardware, software, programming, and if you're artistic as well 3d modeling, along with animation. I'm not the most artistic person so I more of the person who is interested in programming, more specifically gameplay mechanics. A lot of the video games that come out today seem to have very little unique mechanics, or very many generic mechanics that have been in every other video game that has released already. I don't really have many places I wouldn't want to work for in the industry, (except for Activision) but I wouldn't mind working with a small team making our very own unique game or if I work on a giant team at a AAA development studio. All I really want to do in the field is make fun, exciting, immersive, and enjoyable games that don't try to manipulate their playerbase.\", 'the reason why i want to go into the stem field is because i feel like i can do more for the world then any other field. I want to do more good for the world by using my knowledge to make life easier. I also feel like the reason i want to go into the stem field is to help my family out. Besides i dont think i will do as well in any other field other than STEM. That is why i would want to go into the STEM field.', 'I have lost a good amount of the passion I had over this last year when it comes to becoming an engineer. I haven’t been as excited or encouraged to work as hard because I wasn’t in a very good learning environment, the sudden transition on to online learning was difficult, working from home was just not efficient. Nonetheless, the reason why I want to become an engineer is so that I can acquire the skills to create and restore. I have been very interested in aircrafts and how fast they are able to fly. I’ve done research on commercial jets that flew at the speed of sound with up to 100 passengers on board which was impressive but it had its flaws. Recently this form of travel has resurfaced and engineers have redesigned and found solutions to the previous models flaws and it will perhaps return in the near future and it’s where I want to be apart of.', 'I want to go into the STEM field because I believe in the importance each field has to society as a whole. STEM majors tend to be rewarding for those who have a passion and drive to complete them. I also like a little bit of a challenge and engineering definitely brings just that. Even as a child, I have always been into sci-fi and action movies that incorporate science and technology. I would hopefully like to go into the automotive industry as my first choice and participate in engine or frame/chassis design. My second choice would be the clean energy industry, more specifically solar, where I would work on solar panel design and function. They also generally pay very well which will help with my student loans as well as other financial endeavors in the future.', \"I want to go into the STEM field because I want to be able to contribute to society and make an impact on people's lives with engineering, whatever it may be. I just want to be able to use engineering to make a positive impact on people's lives.\", \"There are many reason why I want to go into the STEM field. first of all I've never been a big fan of english classes or classes where we have to interpret the meaning of something so obscure like the color of a curtain from a poem written years ago. Subjects such as math and and science have reasoning behind them and for the most part have a straight forward answers. Then when they don't or are a bit more difficult i enjoy going through the process of understanding the problem and finding some fort of solution. math and science help explain the world around us from why rollercoaster work to why the earth is orbiting the sun. I like knowing those things because it helps me feel safe and knowledgeable about the world. also for the longest time I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life then once I took my first physics class it just all made sense to me and I knew this is what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.\\xa0\\xa0\", \"Why do I want to go into the STEM field?\\xa0I don't think I have a remotely passionate answer for this. In my junior year of high school, I had to choose which core subjects I wanted to study for the next two years and the two main options were either Commerce which had\\xa0Business Studies, Accounting, and Economics, and Science which has Physics, Chemistry, and Maths. I chose science because I enjoyed or tolerated those subjects more than the ones in Commerce. I chose Chemistry as my major because that was my favorite subject. I have now added a second\\xa0major as Computer Science purely for the job opportunities because I want a financially stable future. So I guess my answer for why I chose STEM is that I like science and I like to think that I am good at it and I want a well-paying job.\\xa0\"]\n"
