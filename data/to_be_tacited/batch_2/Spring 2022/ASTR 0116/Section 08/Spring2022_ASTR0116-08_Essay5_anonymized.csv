2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2555,"My major is Criminal Justice and I choose this major because I have had a background with it. During senior year of high school in my AVID class, while applying for colleges, we had to select a major we wanted to take. I was scrolling through the majors and saw criminal justice. At the time I was looking at career paths and seeing which major would correspond to this field of work and kept looking into what Criminal Justice actually is. The background I had with this major was working at this summer program during high school where the San Francisco Police Department and Sheriff’s Department was involved. During this time I along with the youth who worked at the program developed relationships with the law enforcement. We were given a good connotation of who the law enforcement was instead of what the media portrays."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2546,I am a fashion design and merchandising major.  I chose this major because fashion is something I have been interested in from a young age.  The way we dress is a creative way to express ourselves and that is my favorite part about it.  I want to get into the field of fashion because it is something I am passionate about.  Not only do I love fashion as a creative outlet but I think it is important that we work towards shopping sustainably and creating sustainable clothing.  Sustainability is important for a better future and ensures fair wages and proper working conditions in the fashion industry.  Fast fashion brands are using workers in developing countries and are paying them less than minimum wage.  I want to help continue to pave the way towards sustainable fashion.  While there are brands out there starting to become sustainable there is still a long ways to go.
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2548,"The reason I want to major in Criminal Justice is because I want to make a change for people of my background. I want to be a Mexican-American in law so that family members of mine can see that everything is possible. I want to focus on being an immigration lawyer to help people. I feel like being in the law field will help me understand the laws and how they work better. I am excited for what the future holds and will take on every challenge that comes my way.  At times I disagree with certain laws but that is another motive as to why I want to major in that field so I could further understand why certain laws are passed. I think it is very important for everyone to know the laws and their rights because it is essentially what gets us out of trouble, being aware of our laws and rights. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2543,"I want to go into the field I am majoring in because I want to help people. I also believe that it is a very versatile field that can have a flexible schedule which would be ideal for whatever plans I have in the future. I truly believe that taking care of mental health issues and learning how to live and manage them can help change lives. It can put people at less risk for addiction, relationship issues, and other symptoms of mental illness that can make life miserable. I am a firm believer that there is almost always a reason behind someone's actions, however most of the time they are not even sure why they do what they do. That is another reason that counseling can be beneficial, after all, if you do not know why you are doing something, it can be hard to stop/change. I also think I could relate to people's life experiences which is helpful, I think it is much easier to talk to someone about something when you know they understand what you've been through. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2541,"I wanted to go into Marketing because it seemed like something i could be good at because of my artistic backgrounds. Although I know a lot of times people will find jobs that have nothing to do with their careers I know I can learn a lot with knowing how to market, especially in the US. It also helps that if things don't work out the way I want then i have a backup. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2540,"Emily Gonzalez  Journal #5 For 5 minutes, journal reflectively on: ""Why do I want to go into the field I am majoring in?"" I don’t know why I'm majoring in the field that I have chosen. A big part of me knows I chose it just because I know that my younger self would have wanted to achieve my childhood dream job. But as time went on, I lost interest in the field. Now I'm weighing the pros and cons of changing to a different major. I also kind of choose my major due to just expectations set by myself and promises made to myself. What sucks though is that in order to be successful in the field I chose, I must have the power of nepotism and money on my side, and I unfortunately don’t have either. But I guess those two things are needed in every field in order to be successful.  "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2552,"I am currently a double major in criminology and psychology. I first started my major with the intent of joining the FBI and then furthering my psych degree to leave the FBI and pursue therapy. However, the more I learned about my subjects and learned more about society, I got fed up and hate how capitalism uses the power of hegemony to claim society as its own. But more specifically the social (in)justice system of our society that mainly marginalized communities have to suffer with. Because of this, I have changed my career focus and have accepted the fact that I might not do a how a lot of change, but as long I help the lives of some for the better then I will feel satisfied with myself. I would pursue my pschology degree with the end goal of advocating for mental health in Hispanic communities while also providing them with access to therapy. Whereas my criminology degree serves now more of a purpose of education and being able to know about the social justice system and all the wrongings and find what areas I want to help volunteer for to help improve the conditions. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2538,I an undeclared right now but the field that i was interesting in majoring in is psychology. I choose psychology as a possible interest  because thats the number one choice that i was thinking about majoring in is because ever since that i was little i always wanted to be able to help other people. I think psychologist help people want to have better and healthier lives.i want to be able to help others with their mental/emotional state. Especially in the society that we are in right now and going through an whole pandemic thats effecting everyone and their lives. The second major that i thought about in choosing was a wildlife biologist. I chose this because alot animals are going extinct and its a chance that we could possibly save them. Studying Animals can help the ecosystem become more healthy and functional. I think it is very interested to learn more about their wild life habitat. 
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2536,"My major doesn't necessarily have a specific field like most majors do since I am currently an English major. I wanted to major in English because of my love of literature. Writing and reading have always been a passion of mine, so I thought it was the right choice. I'm still not sure of what career I want to pursue especially since I don't know what an English degree is good for. I have thought a lot about changing my major but still I feel reluctant to do so because I love English so much. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2542,"I don't know yet what I want to do with my major. Basically, my intention is to just learn and keep learning. I want to be a life-long learner. That means learning anything and everything that excites me--astronomy, archaeology, medicine and the human body, geology, engineering, building and making stuff, etc. Basically, I'm just going to take a bunch of classes I like and see where life takes me. I want to be able to ask and investigate questions every day. I want to be constantly learning. I constantly want to challenge my preconceptions, my prejudices, my worldview, and the paradigm I've taken for granted my whole life. I want to a job that challenges me to keep an open mind to to adapt to changes that might rock my view of the world. I want to there to be unknowns, trial and error, and experimentation in my job. So, I don't know what field I want to go into. I just know that there will be never-ending learning within astrophysics. That excites me. Whether I go into research, teaching, or something I haven't even heard of yet I am ready for! In fact, I highly doubt I know what I want right now, so I am keeping an open mind to anything and everything. I can't wait to be exposed more and more to the possibilities of what I can do."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2560,"Journal reflection #5  Why do I want to go into the field I am majoring in? 	it feels kind of stupid to say that I have no clue what I want to do in life. I’m currently majoring in business but there was no future goal attached to the choice. I just looked at the options and choose it. My image of what I want my future to look like changes weekly, I don’t have one specific career that has always called out to me. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2544,"I am majoring in Apparel design and merchandising, and want to go into this field because making clothes is what I love to do. Since my senior year of high school, I have been making and repurposing second hand clothes for my self, my friends, and for profit. I think learning more technical skills in this field will help me branch out of current habits I may have while creating. Creativity and art have always been super important to me. I also like the idea of working in merchandising for a fashion house or being a stylist. I love giving clothes a new life and wearing something that is one of one. I also have loved receiving support from my friends and people who like the brand ive created. Its a great feeling of validation when someone understands and appreciates your art. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2549,"I have struggled this past year to figure out a major that I think I would be content and successful in. I chose accounting and took a big risk because I still wasn't sure if I wanted to pursue it or if I would be happy. My sister is an accounting major, so I mainly wanted to go into the field because she inspired me. I have always known that I'm good at math. All throughout high school I would get good grades in math and actually enjoy doing the work. I liked problem solving rather than writing or history. I switched my major the beginning of my second semester and so far I am really enjoying it. The math class that I am currently taking has only proved my love for math and has pushed me to pursue my career further. I will admit that in the beginning I just wanted a career that would provide me with a big salary, but I am happy to say that I am excited for the future and working on my career. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2550,"The reason I chose to enter my major is simply that I love watching movies, I think movies are not just a way of entertaining people in their free time, movies are a way of expressing emotions just like paintings and novels Way. Directors use the film to give voice and express their ideas. This semester I also took some professional courses. In these professional courses, I learned about American revisionist films and Italian neorealist films. These films used some stories to express the director's thinking and criticism of social phenomena. My dream is to shoot one or more films and leave some of my own thoughts and ideas so that people who see my work in the future can understand my ideas."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2545,"I picked finance because I didn't want to major in art. Finance seems to have more jobs that are related to it and seems to have positions that are more stable than being an artist, I have a friend who is a graphics major and said she wanted to get into game designing. Although, it doesn't seem like game designing at all and that she seems to be doing magazine covers instead which don't look all too good ironically. Also that I wasn't sure about taking a computer major, I didn't want to deal with any more math than I already have done and that means more calculus if I ever took a computer science major and I don't want to even think about doing it without a calculator."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2556,"I am currently going to a major in Art with a concentration in Studio Art, and a minor in Design. Art, in general, has always been a passion for me, I was never the best at academics but always had an obsession and impulse to draw every single day. My imagination went wild and I realized that I could turn this into a career of passion. Not only art but, I also have an interest in computers, because as we know, computers and technology are slowly taking over the world, so it's a good idea to become tech-savvy. I've always had an interest in technology and Minoring in Design is able to give me that knowledge of how to use computers to my advantage, whether it's computer coding or doing art digitally, having both of these majors and minors together complements my goals in the future. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2561,"The reason why I want to go into the field that I am majoring in is because I like kids and I want to be able to teach them the basics while they are still young. I believe that teachers make an impact in a child's life at a young age and I want to make a positive impact on many children's life, just like how my first grade teacher did for me. Being an elementary school teacher is something that requires patience and I do have patience. We need to teach the younger generation the basics and what is right and wrong because they are going to be the generation to have a majority of votes when my generation is older. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2553,"I chose Visual Communication Design as a major because I thought it would be interesting and I like stuff that has to do with design. What I thought that this field might offer me is a chance to grow my skills in communicating something clearly using methods that I enjoy in an art-like form. I have mixed feelings about whether or not this is really for me because a lot of people keep saying how difficult it will be for me to thrive in this type of field. Even though they say that, I want to at least know and be able to tell others about my experience if it turns out either bad or good. Hopefully I will be sure about my decision in the future and I think I still have some time if I want to change the field I am interested in. I have been interested in design for a long time in my life and I want to be able to know where this will take me."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2554,"i am majoring in business administration, with a concentration in information system. I am interested in business filed because i want to do my own business in the future or i would like to work in the office in a big business company. Under the major business administration, there are some concentrations. I choose information system because i want to learn to something about tech. informations systems are the tools for companies to run their business more effectively and efficiently.

2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2537,"Currently I am an undeclared major, but am switching my major to psychology. Right now I’m currently leaning towards majoring in psychology because I find the topic really interesting and it’s something that I think I want to pursue. I’m not really sure what I want to do with a psychology degree, but I’m hoping that further along I will figure it out. I have been thinking about becoming a psychologist, maybe a child psychologist, but it isn’t something that I’m certain I want to do with my psychology degree. I want to be a psychologist because I want to help people how to deal with their emotions and understanding them. I was thinking of becoming a general psychologist because I want to be able to help a variety of people, not just be in one concentration. Not being in one concentration, I think, will make it more flexible for me to work in different fields in psychology and be able to explore more options."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2562,Reflection 5:The reason I majored in psychology is because I would like to be the person that I needed in my life for someone else. I’d like to help fight the stigma against mental health in sports and men to create a healthier environment for mental health in sports. I’ve always had a strong emotional intelligence so I’d like to apply my passions to a career. When I was younger I didn't understand why I felt the way I did and the men around me blamed my character instead of considering mental health as a possibility. These things pushed me to wanting to study psych so less kids can be like me. 
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2563,"I am currently a business-finance major. I chose this major because I like to work with numbers. I also want to be able to manage my personal finances when I get older. When I chose this major, my goal was to become a financial advisor. I want to help people manage their money. Another goal I have is to teach high school kids about finance, since it is not taught in most schools. I think this is important because money revolves around everything in life, and it is important to make financially smart decisions. As of right now I am thinking of changing my major to hospitality and tourism management. An idea I have is to open a restaurant in the future.  "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2558,"I am majoring in BECA which is Broadcast and Electronic communication Arts major because I have a future dream that I want to get a job in the TV industry. Especially, I want to be a news anchor in the future, and I started to think about it since I was an elementary school student. I was born and raised in Japan where earthquakes are a regular occurrence. When I was 10 years old, I experienced a big earthquake called Grate East Japan Earthquake. People including me were confused and got panic because we have never experienced such a big earthquake. I remember that the news anchor in the news TV program was accurately informing even in such a confusing situation, and her calm attitude makes people who had panicked to calm down and reassured. People would be more confused if she failed to accurately inform the situation at that time, so I thought this job is cool and started to admire a news anchor. Many people’s lives were saved by telling them where and how to evacuate on TV. I was fascinated by the fact that providing information by them can indirectly help people, even if they cannot save people directly like rescue squads. I believe that taking media studies class helps to achieve my career goal, so I decided to take this major."
