2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2536,When life gets challenging I tend to shut down and isolate. I feel like that is the only way Im able to fully process what has become a challenge in my life and is what makes me realize what i need to do to turn it around. I feel that by allowing myself the time to simply be one with my emotions really lets me think deep about what's going on in my life. I try not to think too far ahead about what is difficult but rather stay in the moment. 
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2537,"When life gets challenging, there are different things that I like to do. I really like to be alone whenever I'm feeling stressed out or overwhelmed, and think things over. Being alone helps me figure things out and helps me calm down. Sometimes when I feel like my life is chaotic, I like to use reading as an escape from my problems until I feel calmed down enough to find solutions to my problems. When I have time, yoga sometimes helps me feel relaxed and not stressed. If I can't find solutions to my problems on my own then I ask my family members for advice on how I should deal with the situation(s)."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2538,"When life gets too challenging I try to tell myself that whatever I am going through is only temporary because whenever I am feeling sad or angry it goes away. When  life gets challenging I take the situation as a learning experience because I personally feel like every time in life when I went through something challenging I learned how to react to the challenging situation and so if another challenging situation happened I Learn how to respond. Lastly when life gets too challenging I practice self care. It is important to value self care when life gets challenging because of u don’t it will cause you to be very depressed and miserable.

2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2539,"For me this semester is quite difficult as I am doing full time internship in an accounting firm and taking classes simultaneously. To help my bills I am additionally working at a restaurant as a server. Also, this is my last semester at school and I am taking 3 classes so at any cost I need to get through all classes to graduate. More than my work and school I am missing my family little more seriously during this time as my grandmother is incredibly sick which is significantly stressing me out. I'm making an honest effort to keep everything balance of my mental and physical health. Thus, I attempted to calm myself down by talking with my parents and friends continually over phone sharing everything to them and not keeping everything inside me. Furthermore, I'm expecting to graduate soon and return to my country to meet my Family. Hence, the hope that I have inside me is making me focused and calm during this challenging time.   "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2540,"When life gets challenging, I just listen to music or watch tv even though I know it probably won't improve the situation at hand but at least I get to feel a tad bit better. When it comes to different aspects of life that become challenging, I have different methods to resolve the challenge I'm facing. Like if schoolwork becomes the main challenge in my life, I just go to google and practically beg it to help me cause some of these math problems I'm getting are ridiculous. YouTube is one of the main resources I use for when I'm facing a challenge, I mean come on now You Tube has everything for anyone or anything. Honestly if Google and You Tube didn’t exist ill be failing life challenges left to right.  "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2541,"When life gets challenging I try to be alone. Lately I’ve been going to a lake near the school in order to gather my thoughts and try to not react without thought. I also cry if I'm being 100% truthful. I’ve tried to accept that crying isn’t always a bad thing, sometimes it’s all you need to do to feel better and let go."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2542,"When I feel the oncoming stress of a challenge, I make a conscious decision not to freak out, because nothing productive or useful can come from a fear-spiral. Instead, I pause and try to restore a calm state of mind. Then, I take specific and concrete steps that will improve my situation. As long as I continue to take action, there is no way I can't eventually overcome my challenge. But, if I slink away and let the fear of the challenge overwhelm me, the challenge will only become even greater and more insurmountable. But, if I eat away at the challenge, I can eventually consume it--metaphorically-speaking. Action is much better than inaction. Making a choice, doing something, putting something forward and taking responsibility for my action is much more productive than not doing anything. I can learn from what I've done. Even if I don't know the answer right away, make a lot of mistakes, or outright fall flat on my face, at least I am practicing and putting myself out there. If I continue to practice, continue to make choices and take action, I will learn and improve. If I don't do anything, I not only don't improve, I get worse. What I mean by this is that not doing anything at the first sign of fear can cause that fear to overtake me my basic functions. That challenge in that one part of my life can blow-up so big that it becomes a challenge in all parts of my life because I don't address it. It's important to realize when something is challenging and causing discomfort because it signals to me a learning opportunity and a chance to get better. It is actually an important sensation to feel discomfort because it means I am breaking barriers and boundaries, and have the chance to expand my skillset, my knowledge, and better myself as a person. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2543,"What do I do when life gets challenging? As someone who has had a very challenging upbringing, I would say when life gets challenging keep going. Not to say that if something is causing you pain to dismiss that. Being self-aware can be a powerful way to reclaim and honor your emotions and life experiences. Assess the situation; What am I hoping to gain from this? Why am I struggling? Who can I turn to for help? Is this worth what I am sacrificing for it? The answer lies in these questions, and usually, you will find a better perspective to act upon. Humanizing your own life experiences is also helpful. It is normal to be upset when things don't go your way, however, remember you are only human. Of course, humans are capable of brilliant things, but it takes time and practice. Tap into all available resources! In a world with the internet, peers, family there will always be a guiding recource. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2544,"When life gets challenging I tend to seclude myself, and work on school/business in spite of life. When life is too easy, I tend to get comfortable and procrastinate. I used to resort to drugs often, but I quit and have better coping skills. How I cope is still not perfect, as I never really reach out for help from other people and instead bottle it up. I think this can have some flaws and result in running myself into a rut. Right now, I seem to be doing okay. If life gets more challenging than it is right now, Im not sure what I would do. Maybe move somewhere cool for the hell of it. Change is good for difficult times. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2545,"When life gets challenging then I would ask the people I know around me to help with things I find difficult to complete. Although sometimes it doesn't work and I would contact the professor if I had any questions with anything. I also can send them email since it's easier that way, but it usually takes a bit longer because professors often get a lot of emails. Though most of the time I would set a small goal, and then work on it. If the goal is too big then I won't be able to finish it in a day. So, doing little tasks overtime is much better so I don't overwork. Taking breaks are also important because if you mindlessly work then I would have no motivation to continue working. Even if there was no one around I would still be able to manage a bit on my own, but I still would have to seek out resources so things would be easier. People who offer resources as well would be highly beneficial, I would help them in return for helping me as well. I think that is about what I would do besides limiting my spending and only needing to purchase things I NEED and not WANT."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2546,"When life gets challenging for me I try to take time to allow myself to rest and heal.  I spend more time on self care and let go of everything I have been stressed out about.  Sometimes it is difficult to allow myself to lay down for a day because I feel the constant need to be doing something and there is a lot to be done as a college student.  Between work, school, and other things that come up in my life I feel overwhelmed.  When I feel overwhelmed I find that watching a comfort movie and getting in my favorite pajamas helps me to feel better.  I also find that writing down things and journaling helps me to write down what I am feeling since I often bottle up my emotions.  I recently lost someone really close to me and I have been trying to use these tools to get me back on track. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2547,"When life gets Challenging I like to stake a step back and reassess and connect with my inner self. I do this by writing a letter to myself. I write what I am most proud of as well as things on my my mind that I have been fixating on. Doing this allows me to release all the stresses, negativity, and intrusive thoughts onto the page to then I create more space in my mind for new. I also like to list my priorities down as this helps me feel less overwhelmed with my workload and results in easier time management. I believe the most important practice to remember during challenging times is to not suffer our gifts as humans, that being our spark to live for today, our imaginations for tomorrow, and our abilities to create. Once we tarnish these abilities and view them in a bad light, in my opinion life becomes even more challenging. By appreciating the present by practicing self awareness and gratitude for one's gifts life becomes a beautiful, fulfilling challenge. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2548,"What I do when life gets challenging is I usually try not to overwhelm myself with whatever is going on. I try to remain calm because I have noticed that it helps me get through the problem. If it is school related, I try to complete whatever assignments I am missing. If I am overwhelmed with school work I try to squeeze in an hour or so to allow myself to decompress a little bit and it helps me regroup my thoughts. I am blessed to have a healthy life which is something I am grateful for. I have noticed that my fall semester and this current semester have been going good because I have allowed myself to complete assignments and do schoo work, but also allow myself to have time for myself and that time has helped me regroup my thoughts, rather than being anxious or stressed about school work. Life will always have its challenges but I feel like it is important to stay calm throughout those challenges. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2549,"This reflection is perfect because this week has been especially challenging for me. From relationship problems to school, there are a lot of factors that make it hard for me to relax. The one thing that always helps me destress is taking a bath. This week has been my first full week back in the dorms and I personally don’t trust the bathtub. I find life challenging pretty frequently because of my depression and anxiety. When I feel stuck, I call my mom. I’m lucky to have an amazing boyfriend that came to visit me in SF on Valentine’s day, but I do miss being closer to him. Being apart this week has been a huge challenge. Whenever I feel that life is getting a little too hard, I call a loved one. It always reminds me that I have someone or something to stay for. Life gets challenging, but it is nothing that I can’t push through."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2550,"What if life is full of challenges? This is a problem that everyone will face, and we will inevitably encounter many challenges in life. We have all faced the same challenge for the past two years, and that is the pandemic. This disaster has changed people's way of life, many people are facing unemployment, many traditional industries are facing huge tests, my favorite nba is also facing the crisis of shutdown, and what is even more frightening is that many people lost their lives. But in the face of this challenge, if we choose to complain blindly, then we will not only fail to change the status quo, but also make ourselves very negative. For myself, because of the epidemic, I can't go back to the United States to complete my university studies. I have to take classes in China through zoom, which will cause problems like jet lag and unstable network connection. I choose to accept this challenge. , After a period of adaptation, I have gradually become accustomed to this way of teaching. And because of the online classes in China, I can spend more time with my family in China, which is great."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2551,"When life gets challenging, I think to the hardships that my family has gone through. My grandfather was an Irish Socialist, who moved to America to escape persecution of the government. I often find my struggles to pale in comparison to his. When I think of my goals in life, that also helps me overcome my challenges. Playing with my dogs helps too."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2552,"What do I do when life gets challenging, it definitely depends on how many factors are affecting me creating my life challenging. My obviously favorite thing is to just disconnect from anything that gives me any ounce of stress or responsibility. I know I get very overwhelmed with stress and easily stress myself out by overthinking things like deadlines or responsibilities that are social, educational, and ones for my job. Aside from discounting I really like to hang out with my boyfriend, friends, or family mainly because I have always had that support system and they help with negating from challenges that arise in my life. Then there is of course just trying to problem solve within my life to help figure out ways to prevent more challenges or fix them to stop the challenges I'm feeling. A downside from that is that is trying to prevent and plan, will lead me to overthink and self-analyzing. Which will lead to more stress, making disconnecting and having a support system helps greatly. Ohh also to have hobbies, I like to game, recently my other hobbies have not been cutting it but gaming has sufficed."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2553,"When life gets challenging, I just try to take a break whenever I have a chance to. I also take my mind away from whatevers stressing me out or is difficult. Sometimes, I might reach out to my friends or family for help or guidance so that I stop feeling too lost or that at least somebody understands what’s going on in my life. First I would think about what the exact problem is that I have, and then I would either just try my best to get rid of the problem or find any sort of resource that could assist me. I don’t like to face challenging things head-on but at the same time I would probably still go for it anyway even if I didn't enjoy it. I always try to make sure things aren’t just stuck in one spot, so I take action so that I have an idea of how to move on."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2554,"First, I will accept the challenges and figure what the exact challenges are. Then think about i want really want. At last, i will find out how can i deal with the challenges and what resources i can utilize to get along with the challenges. at the same time, I will live a healthy life, such as eat healthily, exercise often and took enough sleep, in oder to keep me mentally and physically healthy to face with the challenges."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2555,"When life gets challenging, I look at the bright side of things and think of what I am grateful for. I'll tell myself that everything is going to be ok since it's just temporary and things will bounce back to good again. Usually, it's like a roller coaster where you'll bump into challenging times but end up overcoming them. Also, I'll find myself doing my hobbies which helps me to cheer up. That includes playing basketball with friends or doing something productive such as cleaning and exercising. Also, the presence of those with who I am close with these things helps me feel better about myself. Music helps too with cheering up and overcoming certain obstacles. But sometimes it's best to forget about challenging times to help with moving forward. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2556,"I've had a really bad habit develop in the past year of impulse buying whenever I get into a depressive episode. I'm slowly making a habit of taking care of myself such as my hygiene and mental state. At the beginning of this semester, it was really difficult as I missed a ton of work from all my classes and it was hard to get out of my mental depression after my surgery. I feel lucky that I have hobbies such as Drawing and painting that can help ease my brain and give me a reason to get out of bed. I noticed my episode slowly subside after I started painting more, it gave me the motivation to sit down and do my homework, and my desire to constantly buy something every day slowly went away. Music is also something that puts me in the mood of working and being productive. I've slowly started to build my hygiene habits again, slowly doing self-care things that make me happy and feel clean can make me feel motivated to constantly keep working. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2557,"I can't handle ""challenges"" well. I am not a very competitive or ambitious person, which means that when life gets challenging, I often just wallow in my own space and release all that negative energy by just crying. I lock myself away from other people and hide under the covers because I simply don't feel like dealing with the challenge. I know that that probably shouldn't be my way of ""dealing"" with life, but I'm not really sure how to change it. I've been told multiple times that if life ever gets too hard, I can email teachers or counselors or therapists, but that doesn't feel real, I guess. I'm striving to become a more ambitious person, so that I at least am moving toward something in life to get me through the challenges, but I still haven't really found myself to ever be motivated enough to try for that ambition. Nothing ever seems that important."
