2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2550,"The good thing about online classes for me is that I can attend classes in China via zoom and I can see my parents often. But the bad aspect is also because, in China, there is a problem of jet lag, classes need to be taught in the middle of the night every day, and there are often some problems with the network. I also missed some exams due to jet lag. But the good news is that classes can be taken offline next semester, and everything can be back on track. As for self-care, this is a very good thing in China. People are required to wear masks in public places, and they need to undergo nucleic acid testing every three days. If the test result is positive, they need to be quarantined. Although the measures are troublesome, they can also make me feel at ease."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2557,"I think online classes has been both negative and positive for me. It has affected me negatively because it's allowed me to be more lax and I've become more ignorant with school. I get lazy because it's not something I have to necessarily ""get ready"" for. I also feel that it has given me anxiety for in person classes. Positively, it has let me focus a lot on me. I've been able to care for myself more mentally and emotionally. I feel like it has allowed me to separate myself from school and function as an individual. But part of me does wish that in person classes were still the regular because of the laziness factor. I hate that online classes have caused me to slack a lot and do the bare minimum."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2541,"Online classes were a bit more challenging for me in different ways. The main issue I had is my attention span, with online it is a bit harder to stay focused when it is so easy to pick up your phone or stare at the wall. With that I have gotten more comfortable with speaking to people in general because its so easy to just talk when you feel like no one is listening despite people actually listening. As for self care I tend to just listen to music and play games."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2542,"I developed some bad habits and a negative mentality when I was doing online classes. First, I felt disconnected from the content and from my peers. Because I had to engage over a screen, I lost interest in the subject matter and tuned-out. I wouldn't participate or pay attention in class as much as I do now, in-person. I was more timid and less self-confident, which meant I wouldn't say hi to my classmates or my teacher, I wouldn't ask questions when I needed help, and I wouldn't speak-up when I had an interesting thought or something to share. This dissociation I felt between me and my learning got so bad that I didn't feel a responsibility to myself to learn about or care about the material. If one doesn't actively engage, interact with, and practice the concepts and material, you can still show-up for class and not actually learn anything. But, even worse, was that my mentality toward learning became negative and toxic. I dreaded attending online class, I dreaded completing the online assignments, I procrastinated like crazy, and did everything I could to avoid the negative emotions. This meant consoling myself with other types of screen-time like social media, YouTube videos, and movies. Now that I am back in-person, I have been able to process my negative reaction to online-learning. I understand now the importance of active learning, not passive learning. I need to create the engagement and interaction for myself even if it's not done for me. This means doing practice problems every day, reading to myself aloud, doing daily or weekly study sessions with my peers, going to office hours on a regular-basis, making a journal with questions that I ask my teacher or classmates, forcing myself to ask at least one question or make one verbal contribution per class, and completing a homework assignment over a span of many days so that I have a chance to marinate and simmer in the material. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2549,Online classes have become normal for me because of how long they have been going on. It was difficult to get back into in person learning. Once I got comfortable in my classes it started to feel normal again. Although I like in person classes I don’t think I would want all of my classes to be in person just yet. Online classes give me the freedom to do work on my own time and at my own pace. I try to get plenty of sleep and eat well to take care of myself. I also really love taking baths. It's the one place where I can relax and tune out the world. I also try to go out with friends more and do adventurous things rather than staying home. I noticed that going out more often has helped my mental health. My only concern would be if I am having a rough week and I cannot get my work done that it will impact my grades. So far my mental health is on track but I would have a concern if it were to get bad. Sometimes it is hard to get school done when not feeling well so I wish that would be recognized more by teachers. Overall I think this semester has gone really well and I hope it stays that way for the next.
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2546,"Online classes have impacted my learning in many ways.  At first I really struggled learning online because it did not seem to work well for me. It is hard to keep a strict daily schedule when you could just do class from your bed.  I’m not gonna lie I definitely did that in the beginning of COVID when I was in High school but now I sit at my desk when I have an online class.  This definitely has helped me to absorb the class material better.   However, I have adjusted to online learning now and I actually appreciate it because it allows more flexibility for my work and every day schedule.  For self care I make sure to get my body up and moving and do some sort of exercise for at least ten minutes.  This helps me have a good start to my day because I used to turn to my phone first thing in the morning.  Another thing that helps me is setting aside about an hour everyday for myself to relax and read or watch tv.  To stay on top of my school work I like to write down everything in my planner."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2543,"Online classes have impacted my learning in the way I have become more self-sufficient. Most of the time we must teach ourselves things that may have otherwise been taught to us in in-person instruction. It is difficult in the sense that there are not always resources when help is needed. For self-care, I have been trying to relax and take more time to myself rather than dedicating it to others all the time. I have been weight lifting more and watching the walking dead. I am concerned with my mental health, I keep working on it but honestly, it's hard to find what works for me, I often get stressed with feelings of never being able to manage my worry, like I wish there was an off switch. I try to let things go without being super apathetic but it's hard to find a grey area. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2539,"Online classes have impacted my way of learning in a negative way. As I have been taking all my university classes through online due to the COVID-19 and I am graduating this spring 2022 if I pass the classes. However, I feel like it would have been different for me if I had a chance to attend the class and learning face-to-face connecting with Professors and Friends. In order to do self-care, I tried to meet my friends, talk with my family member over a phone, go for a hiking, biking and so on. For learning the concern that I have for myself is that I might not be able to perceive the message that professor is trying to give over a zoom as English is my second language and also it would be difficult to have a moment with professor to elaborate the topic. For my well-being I might not be able to maintain my diet properly and go for a gym in regular basis in order to stay fit and active. Also, since I am having difficulties in focusing towards specific subject I might need to start mediating for at least an hour every morning to keep my mind healthy.  "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2563,"Online classes are horrible, especially asynchronous classes. Online classes makes it harder for students to do group work. It also makes learning harder for hands on learners. As a student who likes to do group work and ask other students for help, it is hard for me to connect with others. (Especially as a commuter). Asynchronous classes are the worst. You feel like you have no one to go to for help. Instructions are super unclear at some points since its all on a video or am email. I am hoping that the years to come we stay as far away from online learning as possible and bring back fully in person classes, like how school is meant to be.  "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2545,"Online classes have been more convenient than ever now. Although some classes require you to learn by yourself and that makes me schedule for those days when I do work in those classes are not, but sometimes I do tend to forget to do them since they don't require a mandatory zoom meeting. Since I live far away from SF, I don't need to worry about driving to classes everyday, that would actually be too much and that's why I like having online classes. Gas is even more expensive right now and the only concern that I have is that I have car sickness because I haven't ridden a car in a while because of COVID, also that the lack of sunlight I haven't had in a while despite opening my window, later during the day the sunlight gets redirected to the other side of the house which is pretty inconvenient since I usually stay in my room. Also since the weather is getting warmer, living upstairs is not the best thing when you don't have a built in AC in your house and have to use the fan, it's twice as hot compared to downstairs and living with your relatives it's way too noisy, I could've moved into campus, but it was just way too far to be honest and that would add on to my college debt so I don't think it's worth it right now even though I'm missing out on the true college experience."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2548,"Online classes affected me because it challenged my learning experience. I was accustomed to always being in class as a student and would rarely do any online work until high school. Then the pandemic hit and instructions were moved completely to online. It made it harder for me to engage in class and take notes because everything was through shared screens rather than being on the board, however lecture notes being posted on iLearn was very helpful for me. It was also harder to focus while on Zoom because I was home and everything was more accessible to me such as laying on the couch or bed, meanwhile at school I was there to work. Being at home made it harder to focus because I associate my house as a comfort place rather than school were I need to focus and engage in school work. The only benefit was that I did not have to commute and gave me more time to do more of my school work. It seems like next semester classes will be taught in person which means I will be able to go back, but it will be hard to adjust because I am now getting accustomed to online classes. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2552,"Online classes have affected my learning greatly. Just easily today I was talking to my roommate about how I am genuinely scared to start taking tests in person again. I in all honesty have no recollection of wth a test feels like anymore and what taking a test that's not an open note is like either. Not to mention I can't even say that online learning affected my study skills because even before the pandemic, I had no type of actual study techniques. Online learning made classes definitely way easier in a way that I didn't need to apply myself as much as I would have in the class would have been a formal in-person course. However, I do truly miss the in-person environment for the discussions, the test scares me but the discussion mainly in my major topics is very interesting. Mainly when you're in a class that actually discusses, if not then there's no one to discuss with. As for self-care, I smoke weed and take breaks throughout my day and week for myself, so I know not to overdo it. I also do yoga and mindful breathing techniques. My concern for my learning is that I feel like I'm not learning to my capability and I need to bring myself back to like scholar quality, for my well-being, that scholar quality could possibly stress me out. Which I then would need to find ways to prevent stress build up. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2544,"Online classes have impacted my learning in that is takes a lot more effort to set aside time to get things done. Ive only ever taken online courses throughout my college career, so I can really only compare to high school. In high school I was physically in an academic setting for hours at a time with clear deadlines and resources to complete assignments. With online classes, I need to be very self motivated and not fall victim to procrastination in order to complete assignments. In terms of self care, I don't think online classes have impacted me that much. I have enjoyed not needed to commute to a class and having a lot of free time for work/travel. The flexibility of not needing to be in a specific city or in class at a certain time has resulted in a lot of fun memories. I was also able to work full time as a freshman because I wasn't commuting, and some of my courses didn't even have a zoom class to attend. Im concerned about my finals right now because I have been really unmotivated. Its been really hard to get out of bed and complete tasks when Im the only one who knows it has to get done. I have some late assignments that are stressing me out to the point where I just cant do them. It doesn't make much sense and is hard to deal with. I think when things in my personal life are going bad, I do bad in class too. The two parts of my life have sort of blurred together with them being online. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2540,"Reflective Journaling Essay #6 For 7 minutes, journal reflectively on: “Describe how online classes have impacted your learning and what you are doing for self-care. What concerns do you have for your learning and your well-being?” When I comes to learning through online class for me personally, I enjoy it more than in person learning due to me not having to go through the fuss of getting up calculating when I must leave my house, go through the motions of getting to campus with time to find parking. It is just easier to be available for the class time alone and on top of all that I do not have to go through the anxiety of being with people. However, when it comes to “self-care” for me it is more like self- indulgence. This pass semester I have become too lenient with myself and let my grades slip which is a downside of the online learning. But I have noticed that I do spend too much time on my devices because I already spend a good deal of time on them cause of school, but my self- indulgence means I spend another 5 hours on my computer, which is not good for my eyes. I mean for trying to practice self-care I have been making myself bike ride and not staying up late reading.     "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2562,"“Describe how online classes have impacted your learning and what you are doing for self-care. What concerns do you have for your learning and your well-being?”Reflection #6:Online classes have very much negatively impacted my learning and self care for many reasons. I'm a much more hands on learner and have ADHD, so it's difficult for me to be able to work online and stay focused from home. I also enjoy real life discussions and feel less comfortable talking online. Quarantine and online learning have negatively impacted my self care a lot as well too. School encouraged me to go outside, care for myself, and socialize with other students. During quarantine I became a lot more down in my mood and had less motivation to pay attention in class and do out of class work. I hope in the future we go back to in person classes to help me get back on my feet, but this year was very rough for me."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2553,"Online classes have impacted my learning quite a bit. I like the freedom it feels like it gives me but I also dislike it at the same time because some things are more difficult online than in person like group work and stuff that requires collaboration. Things I am doing for self care are allowing myself to take breaks and trying not to stress too hard on school by focusing on other things. A concern I might have for my learning is that maybe I might not be learning as much as I used to when I was doing in-person classes and it is easier to feel disconnected. My learning has been slower with less motivation by being at home and I tend to forget content easily which is detrimental. I think that online group work does stress me out a decent amount but it is still doable. But to me, a good thing about online classes in general is that it feels more comfortable for me since I don’t have to travel by train to get to campus. All in all, I think my well-being is not doing too bad and next semester I hope that online classes will start to feel better for me."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2554,"Personally, I do not like online class most of the time. as a student, learning experience in campus is very important. For example, student can have more connection with classmates and professors. They get to know each other and help each other in the classroom and expand their connect into the future life and job. Tt is easier for students to seek for help when they get stuck in study and personal life. Sometime I felt depressed once a while when taking all the classes online from 2020. For this semester, I decided to take two classes in person. going back to campus can take more time than taking online class. I feel energetic when seeing students on the campus and I like studying in the library. but the online has its advantages. I can have more flexible time to arrange my life and study. I can save time to read the text book more often. I can take my class and do my homework anywhere. The deadline of the homework and exams are in wider flame. therefore, I choose some classed in person and i choose some classes online. the classes that are related to my major I would like them on campus."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2538,"Online learning has impacted my learning because the lack of communication when engaging with other students. Sometimes when doing group projects some students have their screen black which makes it hard to get the college experience. It has also has effected my learning because sometimes I get distracted because sometimes I am on zoom for long hours which makes my eyes and head hurt. For self care I try to make sure I eat something before class instead of waking up and staying on zoom for hours. I also try to go zoom at the library or at a Starbucks, so I can become more focused. Some concerns that I have  for my learning is trying not to be overwhelmed by the work load and staying positive. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2558,"I am an international student, so the time of learning in class is really important for me. It means that just taking class in English is good opportunity for me, not only learn about that subject because I can learn and improve both of my ability to listen and speak English. In this perspective, taking class in online makes less opportunity to talk in English. Also, it is hard to make friends in online classes. For my self-care, I was doing workout at the gym because exercising helps to decrease stress.  Especially, exercising in the morning makes it easier to concentrate on my studies. To be honest, it was hard for me to study about astronomy because I did not have any knowledge about astronomy. However, It was fun for me to gradually increase my knowledge about stars or planets as I studied. If I did not take this class, I would not know any astronomy things like stars and so on. Therefore, I am glad to get this opportunity."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2556,"In the beginning, the stress of classes was almost unbearable. I got really anxious about everything and I couldn't control my depression and anxiety. But now, I feel like I've improved a lot, I still have bad days, but I could feel myself mentally improving this year as a freshman college student. At the beginning of this semester, I had a lot of dental issues and as someone with an irrational fear of the dentist, it made me almost bedridden because of how depressed I became with no one to talk to about it. I've gotten better with self-care and creating a consistent schedule that will keep me motivated and productive. It's nice to see that I am indeed capable of hard work and perseverance. In terms of concerns for my learning and well being, I feel very guilty that I ended up not putting in my all this semester, I personally really enjoy taking notes on the subjects and learning from those notes, and this semester I took close to no notes at all, but I want to see if I am able to catch up with those notes. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2555,"I feel like I’ve gotten down the familiarity of doing online classes to when I first started which was a little more than two years ago. When school started to go online, it was difficult to adjust to a new environment, since it was my first time doing any sort of online classes. I was used to being in a classroom setting. I noticed that it would be harder to focus, having family members in my house doing online classes as well. Sometimes this would give me the feeling of being less productive. Online courses have given me more independence. Things I’ve learned from it was setting up a schedule that I would have to follow throughout the school year. These would include weekly habits on a day to day basis for each of my courses. Another thing I’ve noticed from doing online classes is having more free time than going to in person classes. I’ve gotten more of this time since from not having to walk from class to class as well as commuting to campus. I liked the aspect of this since I can use that time to reset my mind and body.       "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2537,"Online classes have impacted my learning in both a positive and negative way. In a negative way, it distance me from others in the class. While I worked with them in breakout rooms, almost everyone had their camera's off, so I don't know what the people in my class look like. The positive side of online classes was that, I have learned something new about myself. What I learned about myself was that I learn better with in person learning than in online classes. It was also good to not have to rush to go to campus for class. For self care, I like to bake to distract myself and I like to read and do yoga. The only concern that I have over my well-being is, how I'll be able to mage stress from my school work. For me sometimes I find school really stressful and don't have time to take care of myself and decompress."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2536,"Online classes have impacted my learning in a few different ways both negatively and positively. I think my attention span has decreased a bit due to the lack of engagement that comes with online classes which makes it harder for me to focus and I often feel like I’m falling behind because of it. I think online classes have also made me manage my time better in a way simply because with no in-person teaching, it’s me that has to set time aside to do my learning because most classes are asynchronous and if they are synchronous then they aren’t that demanding when in session but more so after class time is over. I think online learning has both its perks and its downfalls, but for the most part I’ve learned some things from taking online classes. My concerns for my well-being are mostly about the long-term effects of online learning, like the attention span thing that I mentioned earlier. I’m worried about the effects of self teaching in the sense that online learning has normalized self-paced classes and student-led work. I think overall my wellbeing has been mostly affected by not online learning itself but how teachers and student treat online learning in the sense that it is seen as mostly the student’s responsibility more than the teacher’s. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2560,"I think online learning was a good temporary change for me. at the time everything about school was really stressing me out. The people, classes, teachers, etc., I was at the point where I didn't even really want to be there. So for the first couple of months, I was fine, I almost enjoyed it. My grades had improved and I was actually understanding what I was learning. After a while, though my feelings did a complete 180. I was over it and just wanted to see people."
