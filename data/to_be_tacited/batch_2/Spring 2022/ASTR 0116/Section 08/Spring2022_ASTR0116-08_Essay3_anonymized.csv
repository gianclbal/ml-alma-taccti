2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2556,"How the values of my community and family helped me navigate through college was how supportive of a community I realized SFSU was. I'm happy to see how diverse the college was, and how open everyone is. So far, my classmates have been way more kind and talkative than my classmates back in high school. I'm still trying to navigate through the big community and it's been a bit more difficult since everything is through a computer (for me personally). I've been really anxious but excited about the idea of going physically to school and joining clubs and learning new things. it's been a bit difficult for me to go physically to school because of familial conflict and issues (I also live more than an hour away). I'm also nervous about the idea of living away from family for the first time, it sounds refreshing to be away from clingy parents but I still love their company nonetheless. I'm still navigating my options and thinking about how I'll be in those conditions. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2545,"The values of my community has helped me through college. It's very important that you know about money and how to spend it because in college people sometimes don't know what their essentials and wants are. It's very difficult for people to wait for the things that they want and save up money for it later when they can afford it because it doesn't really help them with anything other than just making them happy. People do this a lot and sometimes they live paycheck to paycheck which I find it quite ridiculous, especially in America. I have a friend who almost does the exact same thing and she doesn't really think about her purchases and realizes that her car needs to be repaired and car parts are expensive. Well other than being told about financial issues, I've seen them way too often with my own family as well. It's not like we're poor or anything, it's just that people tend to make horrible decisions when it comes to how to use their money efficiently (like buying clothes off of SHEIN and it piles up in the house) and this is the reason why I chose finance because for the life of me, people think they can manage their money, but they can't. It is true, Americans, even though I'm one, are financially dumb and also have bad behaviors when it comes to spending money. I mean that's not the only reason why, America is also one of the countries with a large economic gap."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2536,"The values of my community have helped me navigate through college in many different ways. I feel that my upbringing, as the child of an immigrant family, have always been centered around gratefulness, perseverance, and ambition. I think these values have been instilled in me, as a person, for so long that I have learned to embody them and incorporate them in my everyday life. As I navigate though college, I have made it a point to continue to uphold these values through my self-discipline in homework and attendance but also to motivate me in hopes of making my family proud. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2549,"My family is my biggest support system so I am beyond grateful to have chosen a college close to home. I think I would struggle tremendously if I weren’t able to visit home whenever I wanted to. My parents value education and strongly believe that I can succeed in college. I am glad that I can reach out to my parents and talk to them when I have doubts about my career choice and plans. For example, a couple days ago I texted my parents “maybe I should just be a teacher”. In which my dad replied “no, not an option”. My dad is a teacher and my mom is a principal. I can tell that they don’t want me to be a teacher so that I can pursue my dreams instead of falling into my safety net so soon. My dad's response made me realize that I should focus more on my goals instead of doubting myself so often. Sure it wouldn’t be so bad being a teacher but it is not the path I am dreaming to take. Without my parents I don’t think I could have navigated my way through college up to this point."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2552,"One value I have from my family that has helped me navigate through college is my family. I was will forever value the relationships with my family because my family is my support system. They help me and remind me of why I keep doing what Im doing and why I strive for more in life. As long as I can remember my family has viewed and supported me in a way that they knew I could and would be successful in life. As much as this was amazing and they were amazing there are still bad habits that are created from family too. Which is the inability to ask for help, as much as my family was there for each other and believed in each other, no one really ever asked for help. I used to struggle a lot with asking for help, and I would stress myself out until I would reach a breaking point. I took a lot and still takes some reinforcing that my family isn't just there for my successes. They're there for everything especially in the times that I really need that little extra support. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2558,"I believe my community and my family had a big impact on my college choice. I am from Japan and I grew up there for about 20 years. First of all, the reason why I chose college in the United States is influenced by my mother’s values. Although she wanted to go study abroad when she was a young, she couldn’t do that because of financial problem. And then, she came to think like “I want my child to study abroad”. Also, the ability to speak English is useful in job hunting in Japan. From these values, I decided to go to university in the United States. I would not choose this school if my community and family did not care about learning English or studying abroad. As a result, I am satisfied with this choice, so I am grateful for the values of those around me."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2543,"I don't believe I have a community, and let's face it many people don't. Community to me is a tight-knit group of people who help each other expecting nothing in return. I suppose it just depends where you live. I love my family though. They mean the world to me even when I feel like everything is crumbling. I took care of my brothers when my parents were struggling with addiction. I used to feel like their mother instead of their sister. I can't imagine my life without them, although they can be rude and annoying, they've taught me to not take myself so seriously. (Which in my opinion is a great life skill to have.) A lot of my goals were born of the spite of my parents, but I do not hold it against them. When I feel like giving up or that college is too hard or too expensive I remember all of the things I and my brothers went through. I remember all of the things they never had and I want to give it to them, even if they grow too old to appreciate it. That is one of my biggest drives and motivators. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2548,"The values of my community and family have helped me navigate through college because of the values I was taught. I was taught to show perseverance in anything I do and to believe in myself. Also, the fact of trusting myself and knowing if I put in work and effort I will get the results I want to see. College is not easy and at times it gets really difficult, especially since we were hit with the pandemic, virtual learning is nothing compared to how it was before. Although times have gotten hard, I have to remember that it is all worth it and that it will be a satisfying moment when I receive my degree and I could bring it home to my parents and siblings. As a first generation college student I have to serve as a role model for my younger siblings so that they could also pursue a college education. Becoming a college graduate is not only for me, but also for all the hard work my parents have done to provide me a good life. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2546,The values of my family have helped me navigate through college in several ways.  My family taught me the importance of working hard to succeed in everything I do.  Whenever I am in a rut or feeling lazy I make sure to remind myself that working hard will pay off in the end.  I also was taught to treat everyone with kindness.  It is easy to be nice to people and the little things we say can make or break someone’s day.  I also was raised to get up and do something you’ll be proud of at the end of the day.  I make sure I am doing something creative or getting out of the house everyday because it makes me feel good. Another thing I was raised to do is workout or get my body moving during the week.  When I exercise I get lots of endorphins which makes my day more productive. 
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2542,"Well, my community has helped me feel safe and comfortable in this learning space and has helped me feel comfortable enough in myself to explore new bounds and take risks. I think vulnerability is a huge part of being a student-- being vulnerable enough to try and fail, to ask questions, to try new problem-solving strategies, to open the mind, spirit, and body to new possibilities and new ways of thinking about or doing things. I think being a student forces you to go out of your comfort zone. It forces you to go out of your routine way of thinking, understanding, and doing things. It forces you to be comfortable with the discomfort of ignorance and not knowing how to do something. I have built connections that have helped me see my value, my capability, and my self-worth even when sometimes it feels shaky or insecure."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2553,"I think that the values of my family have helped me get through college by continuing to support me even if I don’t get the desired outcome that they particularly wanted. It made me think about how if they were to be more strict on me instead, I would probably be feeling worse about the rare situations where I get a C or D in school. I am really grateful that I live with this family and I hope they will still accept me for whatever I want to become in the future. The people I keep in contact with are definitely strengths, as they occasionally make me feel more positive and confident when I’m feeling down. I feel that college is a bit stressful for everyone in general. My friends and I share this feeling with each other as we move through college. It is a little surprising how this negative-ish feeling brings people together and keeps things going."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2539,"I am the first person of my entire family who migrated abroad in order to complete my study. My father is a professor and my entire family members, and relatives are associated with some titled profession and the environment around there suggest me to pursue something. I am from a country where we don’t go out to party and usually do fancy stuff. Therefore, even after coming to USA I don’t get an urge to do any of those activities which helps me focus on my study. I believe peer pressure and outside world influences are something that prevents student from focusing on study and going to school or college. Therefore, not letting this factor interfere in your personal life really helps a lot. Apart from this my family were super strict and I had a schedule of studying on daily basis. I had to choose between or getting punished; I chose to study and here I am."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2544,"I think the values of my mom specifically have helped me navigate through college. She has always been a hardworking, self motivated person. Her encouragement for me to be the same way and the support I have gotten from her have definitely helped me be the student I am. My dad and I share some bad traits like procrastination or easily giving up, so ive had to make myself overcome those obstacles. I think this semester ive done a good job at keeping up and motivating myself. My brother also goes to school at SF State and has always been super helpful. He has shown me how to navigate iLearn and the SFSU website, and also helped me understand some course expectations if we had the same professor. Ultimately, my family has instilled good values in terms of work ethic and time management. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2550,"I am from China and my parents are Chinese university teachers, so it can be said that I grew up in a Chinese university atmosphere. Due to the work of my parents, my parents often said that many college students in China did not hurry up to study hard during their four years of university, which led to the discovery that they had not learned anything until after graduation. There is a big difference between Chinese universities and American universities, that is, Chinese college students can choose their majors, but not specific courses, while American college students can choose courses that they are interested in, which I think is great. My parents taught me from a young age that four years in college are very important four years. I should study with purpose, understand what job I want to do in the future, and then learn what I should learn based on this. I think it makes sense."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2559,"My family has always been very education-oriented, which I'm told stems from our Jewish heritage and culture. My mother especially made an effort to make learning interesting and engaging, going so far as to homeschool me for kindergarten and my older brother through middle school. In addition, I was lucky enough to go to well-regarded schools where learning was more than rote memorization and I was free to express myself through creative avenues like writing and performance. Now, all this has helped me with the learning part of college, though I feel that all this time spent learning was somewhat at the expense of social growth, which could be argued to be almost as important in one's college career. In this aspect, I'm not quite sure where to start. Although I don't feel that I'm very ""good"" at socializing, I am quite skilled in giving emotional support and communicating with people in higher authority. These are skills I definitely gained from establishing my place in my family- as the youngest, but not only someone who is taken care of."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2554,"I was born in remote village in 1980s in China. At that time, only my family had  all of the seven kids get educated. My father told me that you had to go to school and learn more knowledges so that you did not have to come back our village as a farmer in the whole life. I studied hard and finished the college in China and changed my background born as a farmer. I keep the belief that education is the best way to change my life, in whatever way related to education. I come to the US to restart my college life and i believe that this is changing my life to be better."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2555,"Sometimes there is a mix of both motivation and pressure, being a first-generation college student. I feel motivated knowing that I have to advantage of this opportunity I was given, knowing that I am not too familiar with this situation. Just knowing that others are in the same situation as me helps because it doesn’t make me feel out of place. At the same time, I have relatives who have gone to college and got their degrees. It was a good opportunity to ask them questions right before I started at university. I felt very anxious and a little lost heading to my first year of college, so I needed that guidance in the beginning. When I feel the pressure of being the first person in my family to go to university, I look at the positive side of it. Being the oldest of my siblings, this is an opportunity for me to test the waters of college. Therefore, I can teach my younger siblings what it will feel like when they head into college as well."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2557,"I think the ""values"" of my community and family have helped in the sense of having people who are going through similar things. Community is one of the biggest things to comfort me because I know that I'm not going into something alone. At college, people are obviously going to get their degree and to gain knowledge and experience. We're all in that boat, trying to get through and finish schooling, so we can all understand each other's perspective here. I was undeclared for a year and coming to live on campus has introduced me to a bunch of people with different majors. Talking about majors and courses with people here have helped me to understand a little more of what I want to do in life. I'm now a declared communications major and I'm almost 100% sure I want to stick with it. As for my family, I do call my mom often because sometimes I crave normalcy and I want to go back home. Being able to talk to my mom has been helpful for me because she just always has an answer to everything. That's something that has been comforting for me while being away from her."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2540,"How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" The values that were taught to me by my family were to be hardworking, loyal, responsible, and respectable. Obviously, I do apply some of these values towards my navigation of college. The values such as being hardworking and responsible when it comes to my studies. The value of respect towards meeting new people and their perspectives. However, I have yet to apply the value of loyalty, but I am just going to assume it is for my friends and family. I hope in college I will find new values to apply in different areas of my life.    "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2538,"Some of the values that helped me nagative through college is responsibility. I learned this through my community/ family. I learned that responsibility is one of the key essentials that will help u be responsible and successful in life. I learned that it helps build and strengthen you as a person because you learn how to go through mistakes without feeling angry, sad etc.This relates to college because I learned to always be responsible in turning in my assignments and also being on time. Another value that i learned was determination, to have determination is important because in college things can be difficult which will make you want to give up but if u have determination to get through whatever no matter what then you can succeed even though things may get difficult. The last value that i learned was persistence. Having persistence helps you  gain tolerance in being organized and focused for an example i have a consistent schedule on doing homework and other activities which helps me in turning things on time. "
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2537,"The values that were a part of my family helped me be more motivated in going to college and doing the best that I can. They have helped me not give up and find ways to overcome obstacles in my way. Although I'm a first generation student and don't have someone to guide me and help me navigate college, The values that are a part of my family have helped work hard in my classes as I navigate through college."
