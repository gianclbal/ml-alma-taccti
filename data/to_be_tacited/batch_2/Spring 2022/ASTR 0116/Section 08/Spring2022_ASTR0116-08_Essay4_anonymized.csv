2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2549,"""What resources do I have?"" This essay is meant to remind you that you have resources you can draw on when you are in need of them. This is not meant to be a formal essay. It should be stream-of-consciousness writing from the heart. You will be graded on participation only, not on the specifics of what you say.  5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150-200 words. One resource that I rarely use but really should use is the library on campus. I’ve only been inside the library a few times since living on campus. I find myself being annoyed by my roommates making noise when I’m doing homework. It’s hard for me to focus and get my work done. I think going to the library would really help me find that quiet time to get my work done. Office hours are also something I should utilize more this semester. Last semester I learned that office hours are a great resource and opportunity to get feedback from my professors. Instead of putting off my work because I’m not confident in it, I should start going to office hours to get help. The last resource I could utilize more often is my parents. I consider them as more of a support system than a resource. Giving my mom or dad a call really helps me in overwhelming situations, and sometimes I forget that I can just call them."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2551,"As a music major , I am limited in my resources. There is an SFSU Music Student Center , but that hasn’ t been updated since Fall of 2019. My other classes have many resources but I feel no motivation to take advantage of them, as I generally have no interest in my non-music classes (no of fense.) I find myself slacking of f because of my lack of interest and my grade reflect that. I hope I can save myself before the end of the semester but I am doubtful."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2555,"“What   resources   do   I   have?”       A   resource   I   have   are   my   family   members   since   they   are   easily   accessible   for   me.   I    remember   having   a   phone   call   with   my   aunt   who   went   to   college   and   got   a   degree,   what    college   would   be   like   since   I   was   very   anxious.   Aside   from   my   mom,   who   had   some   college   experience,   I   would   be   the   first   in   my   family   to   be   going   to   university.   Another   resource   I    have   is   the   program   that   I   work   at.   They   were   very   helpful   for   me   during   high   school   such   as    sending   emails   regarding   financial   aid   for   college.   I   found   the   workshops   that   they   hosted,    virtually   and   in   person,   pretty   useful.   It   was   useful   because   they   taught   certain   life   skills    such   as   financial   responsibility.   A   big   resource   I   can   think   of   is   technology,   specifically   the    internet.   Nowadays,   technology   is   everywhere   and   it’ll   keep   growing   as   time   goes   by.   It’s    also   very   accessible.   With   the   internet,   there   is   so   much   information   available   for   anyone   to    use.   It’s   a   good   resource   for   wanting   to   learn   about   certain   things   since   you   can   information    about   that   specific   subject   or   even   find   a   mentor."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2550,"What resources do I have? When I think about what resources I have, the first thing that comes to my mind is the computer I am currently using, which means that I can search the Internet for the information I need anytime, anywhere, but sometimes the information on the Internet is mixed with true and false situation, so I need to choose as reliable sources as possible. Thanks to the development of technology now, it is possible to simulate astrological movements (like we use in class) with some computer technology, which is a great help. In addition, another important resource is my professors and classmates. I can ask questions that confuse me through the professor's email or office hours."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2543,"As you said this prompt has many possible interpretations, as resources can be defined as many different things. Educationally I know I supposedly have resources with councilors, EOP programs, and scholarships. Emotionally I think is where I have the most support, my family is always there for me when I need them and I know I can rely on them if I ever needed something. I’m not sure what else to write about, I’m thinking the expected response would have something to do with statements like “I have the internet” or “The library is a great resource!” But I don’t really know.. I’m content with what I have in life, I know many people don’t have anything."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2556,"Reflective Journal #4 What resources do I know I have available to me is the mental health department for when I’m struggling with my mental health and illness, the disabilities department to assist me in my struggles with my ADHD, and multiple tutoring departments for multiple different subjects for when I’m struggling with homework and keeping ahead with the subject I’m struggling with. I know they also have many different clubs for community building. (i thought we were talking about school resources) After talking with my groupmates we talked about the resources that were available to us in general, as our luxury items such as computers, phones, and clothes. As well as being blessed with a good home and good everyday life resources."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2541,"Reflective Journal 4 What resources do you have ? In general, almost everyday items are resources I have in order to live. For example the resources of essential living like water, food and shelter. I also have resources for luxury, for example my laptop, my ps4, my phone etc. The laptop itself has an absurd amount of resources, for example stellarium which is a resource for my homework. To conclude I am blessed to have this many resources because in many places in the world and even in America if I walk in the street I am bound to find someone lacking some."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2552,"""What resources do I have?"" What resources do I have is a question that makes my mind blank in a way that I kind of forget the resources that I do in fact have and use. I do know that I am 100% not using all the resources I can in terms of academics. I take the blame for some of this, mainly because I am slacking in terms of going out of my way to find opportunities and more resources to further advance my academics. However, I don't always know where to look or who to ask for help for certain things and this is where I feel like my school can do better because although they offer things, they don't always do the best of informing their students about them. We both play our part, but I am making it point now to start more actively engaging myself in my academics. Other than this, the resources I do have and use are in the USU building on my campus, more specifically the Gender Equity Center in the USU. They have really comfy seats and tables to study and give free pins that are super cute."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2536,"I have plenty of resources for all my needs and issues, some that the school provides and some that are personal. Academic wise, I know the school provides resources such as the library and wifi all over campus that allows me to do homework or attend class if I do not have wifi at home. The school also provides me with mental health and physical health resources like COVID-19 testing. There are also food and housing resources for students who struggle in those aspects such as Gator Groceries. Personal resources, in my case, include friends or family that I can talk to if I ever feel the need to ask for help when I’m struggling."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2560,"Julia Perez What resources do I have? One of the only things that you'll always have is yourself, and sometimes that's enough. Often resources like your time and energy tend to be overlooked. The people in your life can also be considered a resource, and it's okay to rely on them sometimes. In the past few years the internet has become a major resource for many different things. It provides information, as well as access to countless amounts of people all around the world. Torturing resources as well as mental health resources through the school."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2538,"The resources that I have in school are access to free computers, books, tutors and extracurricular activities. The resources that I use in school are the access to free books. And free computer.Other resources that I have out of school are free access to therapy and helpful supportive people like my mom, sister and aunt.  Having supportive people in my life are beneficial to me because it motivates me to get up and complete my goals , even when life is feeling terrible. Having a Thearpist is very beneficial to me because college can get very overwhelming especially with the overwhelming amount of assignments, but getting to talk to someone about how I feel who’s been through the same experience makes everything feel better because they can understand. In my opinion, being able to have resources are important because it helps maintain an organized lifestyle. Lastly having resources helps you reach your goal for an example having a tutor when a major test is coming up can help you study for the test so you could pass."

2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2544,"Keeley Ward ASTR Lab Journal Assignment Resources I have resources in a couple dif ferent definitions of the word. I know SF State has a good amount of of fices/people that can help with things like finances, mental health, assault, depression, therapy , or work load. I am also lucky to have people in my life that are willing to listen and give me advice when/if I need it. Even my coworkers are good resources that are always open to vent and help with frustration. Sometimes having the people around you relate to your struggles can even be a good resource because you don't feel so alone. As of now , I am feeling good about my life and don't feel I need to reach out for help with anything. It's still good to know the option is there if I want it. In terms of physical resources like food, shelter , money , school supplies etc, I am also well equipped. I am lucky to have these things, as well as the option to help others if they need them."

2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2553,Rachel Hoang The resources that I have are the counselors in school and also my friends. I feel like there are a lot of resources out there online which can help me too if needed. My teachers also have of fice hours that anyone can attend which is another resource. I think that using these resources will help me in my growth throughout the semester and can bring me up if I’m ever stuck somewhere. I also email my teachers occasionally so maybe I would say emailing is an additional resource as it helps me get clarification on anything that needs it. My brain is a resource that can be used to figure my way out of problems. I don’t usually use the resources other than the brain but I am glad to have them here with me whenever I might have to reach out to them. Resources help me and probably everyone in the world to feel like they aren’t alone with their troubles.
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2559,"Autumn Stern What resources do I have?  My first response to this would be to think of three main sources of support; my family, friends, and mental health practitioner. However, in terms of resources I know I have more than this. Even by virtue of being an SFSU student alone I have access to libraries, athletic centers, and much more. I also don’t want to forget the internal resources at my disposal- even if I may not always be as strong or as capable as I’d like, I have to value my own resilience and creativity when the time comes for it. There are many times when I feel alone or powerless but objectively, this isn’t true. It’s nice to be reminded of it sometimes. It’s also encouraging to remember that I’m someone else’s resource- when I lean on someone else, I’m not simply taking advantage of their kindness but participating in mutual support."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2537,"Some resources that I have come from San Francisco State University from the TASC tutoring program, as well as EOP program and the Metro program. In these programs I have advisors that help me navigate my classes, offer help with financial aid, different types of workshops, health and wellness opportunities, etc. I also have access to the library’s database in case I need to search for scholarly research and have been taught how to use the database. Aside from advisors and tutors, I also have financial aid helping me pay for my education and I know that I can look at the university’s scholarship website that show the different types of scholarships available to help me pay what the financial aid won’t cover. I know that there are plenty of resources available to me if I need them and I will continue to use these resources."
2022,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,8,2539,"The resources I was provided to do this assignment was the stellarium observation website. i.e. https://stellarium-web.org/p/observations , my birthdate, my geolocation and access to calendar. I also accessed information from website //astrology.wonderhowto.com/how-to/discover-your-new-zodiacastrological-sign-thanks-ophiuchus-0123964/ to help me match my birthday with constellations. This resources were really helpful to plot the findings. I loved using the stellarium website and in future I will continue to use it because its super fun to see how constellation and members of our galaxy changes according to time and date."
