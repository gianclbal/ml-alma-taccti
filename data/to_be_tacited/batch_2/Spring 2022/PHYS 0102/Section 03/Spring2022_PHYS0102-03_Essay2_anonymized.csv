2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2615,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?"" - I think mainly my goal of the class and for this lesson is really just to understand physics. I took physics last semester and I learned a lot of information on how things work and the effect it has on other things. That's my goal and it will be my goal for the entire semester. Is just to understand physics on a more detailed level to where I can explain these subjects if I need to. This class and this lab focus more on application and understanding the subject on a deeper level. I like how we relate the subject to everyday life and how we can actually apply some of these things. Maybe not apply them but see them in the everyday things we do. Things like throwing a ball in the air and analyzing what's going on with its force and how it's fighting gravity and acting against other forces. So examples like that are just somethings we look at in our everyday life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2607,"What’ s my goals? My first goal is to learn more about physics and gain more knowledge to help me through life. The second goal is to have a great grade on this class to help me get my GPA higher . This class has opened my eyes to work harder to know more about physics and to contact that with my daily life experience. There’ s things that I do in real life that need some explanation, so physics is the answer to it and I find it a great thing to have and use it even on small things that don’ t even matter . Other goals of this class are the requirement of some classes to advance or in order for me to be in it i have to take these classes and it was better than I expected."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2605,"Reflection Just like most of the students, my goals are also to achieve academic success. I want to work hard to complete my assignments on time and get good grades. I want to get knowledge about things that I am curious about that I apart from my major field of study. I chose this class to understand the basics of physics and to get an idea of how things work around us. I feel this is extremely important to understand the laws of nature. This is helping me achieve all the above goals. I feel I am also gaining new skills that would help me in my future like working in a group and holding discussions with them about the problems that we solve. The mini presentation in the beginning gives us a supporting idea from the Physics lecture and helps us solve the lab exploration to practically understand the subject. This class is also giving me a chance to experiment myself via simulations. Also, I love that we get to work and understand concepts with the help of those."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2623,"What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?"" - My goals are to become a pt with a major in kinesiology because sports has been a part of my life and I want to do something that I can connect with and love to do all day which is work on my game and help advance athletes performances. This class is helping me achieve that goal by covering this class as one of the classes needed to take in order to get to my goal and get into kin school. This is because it is a prerequisite in order to take certain classes that are important to my major in being able to take other classes. Also to get a refresher of physics because it's been a while since i took a physics class"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2614,"PHYS 102 B. Chestnut Reflection #2 My goals in life at this time and age is to achieve everything I put my mind to, whether it is viewed as little or big. I want to be more positive with my mindset as I am someone who usually thinks of the negative first. I want to make my mom proud, that is a continuous goal that I continue to push for and strive to reach everyday . She is a true inspiration as a single mother , so she is someone I want to base my goals on in the work ethic she creates and demonstrates for myself to follow in the footsteps of. This class helps achieve my goals because graduating this semester is a goal that I want to stamp of f and this class is a requirement. I think it helps develop my communication skills and teamwork, which I need further down the line to achieve goals in careers I want to pursue. I can set out as many goals as I want, but if I do not have a set plan or consistent flow , I’ll never reach them all, only a few ."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2624,"1 Reflection My goals in the future include becoming a physical therapist. To do this i have to do all the classes and GEs in order to become one. This class helps because it is a pre requisite for KIN classes. Also the content is pretty useful to know in life. Although online class is hard , my in person classes have been really fun and I am actually learning.  Other than that these classes will contribute towards my goal."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2611,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""  	My goals are general goals such as hoping to continue to move forward with all my required courses to earn my degree and graduate. I would also hope to get into a good PT school or program that will benefit me in my journey to becoming a physical therapist. Of course, I’m not as much as in a rush to get to my career as I was many years ago due to my constant change of major throughout my educational career, but I have seemed to find my calling within the kinesiology department. This class will benefit me in achieving my goals by checking off one of my core major course that are required for my major. I also believe that this physics class will provide me with the knowledge I need to understand how physics can be accounted for when doing Physical therapy work."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2612,"My goal is to complete any medical course this summer. I would like to either get certified as a CNA, EMT, nurse assistant, phlebotomist, etc. I would prefer that my certification is under EMT but I take anything at this point. My goal is work as an EMT after college which would be nice but if I am not able to get into then getting certified in other medical fields is good enough for me. My goal right now is to get out of my current job which is Target. I’ve been working there since I started college, it has become a very toxic environment, the only reason I haven’t left is because they are really good with flexibility in schedules. Let’s say out of nowhere I can’t come in to work without a notice for three days then they don’t mind. Not every job is like that. I’ve told myself that I would only leave if I found a medical job and so far I haven’t had any luck. Also this place was one of the few that remained open during the pandemic so that was good."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2619,"Reflection#2 My goal now is to absorb more knowledge and enrich my mind. I am familiar with my surroundings, but I do not understand them at all. This class will help me to understand more about the explanation of some phenomena I encounter in my daily life. Physical phenomena are happening in every minute of my life. For example, the gravity of the earth, the speed and time of my walk, and so on. It was only after I took this course that I was able to understand these more specifically and think about them more deeply. The study of physics opened me up to new perspectives on things and made my life more interesting, while in the process of being interesting, it gave me a deeper interest in the study of physics. This healthy mindset will help me to be more effective in my studies and thus reach my goals."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2625,"My goals for this year are to better my relationship, whether it is family wise, partner wise or colleagues. Besides that I would like to be more open with myself and with other people as well. I would want to be more social with others as I am currently not, i get anxious and scared to speak which is a bad take on me personally. I would also want to become more consistent with exercising based on my family history who have high blood pressure and diabetic. Career wise I would like to finish school to get my degree, go into working as a physical therapist or becoming a registered nurse. On the contrary this class has helped me become more social with working with groups and advocating for my grades. Not only that but this class has also helped me how it is like working with other people and setting your boundaries and taking initiative in situations."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2608,"Mari Johns PHYS 102-03 24 February , 2022 Reflection #2 My goal is to work somewhere along the fields of sports medicine, or somewhere in the medical fields. But I do not know exactly what I want to do yet. And I think that physics is important to learn since I am majoring in Kinesiology . When an athlete gets injured, knowing the physics around their injury may be important to look into. Such as collisions with an object or a person, the amount of force that impacted them can lead to concussions or broken bones or ligaments. Or just monitoring a person’ s workout routine, and their capabilities to do certain things. For example, if a person tries to lift weights that are more than they are capable of it can strain their back. This class is helping me learn about opposing forces and how greater masses are more reluctant to move or change in motion. It is also nice to learn about physics in our normal everyday lives. Because it is constantly happening around us and impacting our lives."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2609,"One of my goals is to be able to obtain a Bachelor's degree. Ever since I was young, it has always been a dream of mine to go to university and get a degree. Now that I am here, it honestly does not feel real! Every class is important and brings me one step closer towards my goal, which of course includes this Physics course. I am extremely excited to be a part of this course since it will contribute to my degree. I used to dread the fact that I would have to take general education courses after high school, but I honestly have had some of the best experiences in my courses. I was able to learn new skills and make long-lasting connections with my peers. It is incredibly important to me and my family that I receive proper education. I strongly believe that it is a vital part of my life’ s journey . Every day , I am reminded of how lucky I am to be studying at San Francisco State in such an amazing Cinema program."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2606,"For 5 minutes, journal reflectively on: ""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?"" This essay is meant to connect you to your purpose. This is not meant to be a formal essay. It should be stream-of-conciousness writing from the heart. You will be graded on participation only, not on the specifics of what you say. 5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150-200 words. After you finish your essays, we will provide some class time to discuss your thoughts, to the extent that you feel comfortable sharing. Personally I find physics to be very intriguing and useful for everyday life. I like learning about the different types of topics we have covered so far and it is relatively easy to wrap my head around. My goals for this year is to have a strong understanding of all of the topics we discuss and not just go through the motions of listening and doing the labs. Like I really want to learn the material so that I can apply it in my everyday life as well as my major. This class can help me by just showing me the way and having the professor continue to communicate with the class and make sure no one is falling behind."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2613,"My goals for are to understand physics and how its applied into the real world. Physics is complicated but self explanatory once you understand it. I have dreams of becoming a physical therapist and this class helps me get one step closer to it. Learning about the forces, motion and balance has been interesting and informative. I have gained so much knowledge while being in this class . It has helped me see how i use physics daily and understand how im using with every movement or thing that i do. I strived to challenge myself daily and taking a course that pushes me to critically think and apply personal knowledge to an experiment . I think this class has been giving me the push i need to really forces and understand the material. This class has been interesting and enjoyable which i appreciate. Working with others have also allowed me to build great communication skills that i will continue to apply."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2626,"Aislinn Bautista 02/25/22 Phys 102-03 My goal for this class is just to have a better understanding of physics, but overall I want to finish with an A or B after this semester is over. I also am hoping to get into the kinesiology program which I found out about next month. If I do get into the program it  will allow me to start taking upper division classes and if I pass this class with an A or B it will also allow me to enroll in those classes because this course is a prerequisite. And on top of that I want to graduate early by at least a semester or so and by completing this course it keeps my right on track to graduate early so I can complete the other few years of school in order to become a physical therapist. For these specific reasons, that’s how this course will help me overall."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2621,"Asiana Duong 02/26/22 PHYS 102 Reflection #2 ""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?"" My goals currently are to achieve a GPA of 3.5 or higher this semester. A more long term goal I have is to become a pediatric nurse once I’m officially done with school. This class is helping me achieve my goals because it requires me to have discipline. Because this class is long and attendance is so important, it encourages me to have good time management skills and to maintain balance. Being in a class for nearly three hours is not easy, however it is possible. In addition this class allows me to collaborate with my peers which is a super important skill when working in the medical field. This class is also all about teamwork which is a trait that can help motivate me to achieve academic excellence."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2616,"Reflection    - My goal is to become a Registered Nurse. That has always been my dream, and it still stays strong. Of course, I’ve had doubts on the path that’ll lead me there because sometimes things don’t go as planned. However, that hasn’t changed my mind that I want to help those who are in need of medical attention. This class is helping me achieve this goal by giving me the background knowledge of how physics can be used in the medical field. Physics is a natural science, and it’s one of the many sciences I must learn in order to fully understand life, and how it operates. This is my first time ever, in my history of being in school where I have taken a physics class. I always knew that physics would be difficult especially because I’m learning it so late in life. However, it helps to apply whatever is being taught to me in my everyday life, so it gives me something to relate to, and understand more clearly."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2620,"My goals are to finish school and start my career and become a physical therapist. This class is helping by not only it is a requirement to take this class in order to graduate and get my bachelor's degree but also it teaches me how life work basically . This physics lab teaches me how to be hands-on and learn how things work in life, why things are the way it is. Physics is a part of my career path so this class will help me on how the body moves, etc. My goals are just finishing this class and passing this class because it would be a huge waste of time retaking a class I know I could’ve done better in."
