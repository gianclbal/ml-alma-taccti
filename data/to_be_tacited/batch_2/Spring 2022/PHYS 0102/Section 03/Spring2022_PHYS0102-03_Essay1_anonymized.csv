2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2605,"Reflection 1 – Physics Lab  I am here because I was dreaming of this life for a long time. I wanted to experience college life that I was looking in movies and stuff. With the college life, I also wanted to learn to live by my self and try to take decisions on my own. I am learning a lot of new things every day. I think ways of making my routine better each time so that I am productive in my work and save time so I can also have fun or go out. Sometimes I make good decisions and sometimes bad, but they all end up teaching me for the next time. I want to make enough free time in which I stay away from social media and try to inculcate new activities and hobbies. I recently started to cook by watching you tube videos, but it did not go to well. But I am still going to continue doing it and hoping it turns out edible one day lol."

It should be stream-of-consciousness writing from the heart. You will be graded on participation only, not on the specifics of what you say. 5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150-200 words. After you finish your essays, we will provide some class time to discuss your thoughts, to the extent that you feel comfortable sharing Good afternoon class my name is Kyle Botelho and I am a sophomore at sfsu. My major is kinesiology. Now when the professor asks me why am I here it's due to the fact that I need to take this class for my major. Physics to me is a very complex topic that can be explained in many different ways. Now having this be our third/fourth week in this class I am personally confused and kinda feel slow when it comes to learning this material. It kinda takes me a long time to learn new things and so far I feel like I don’t belong in this class to begin with. I feel like I should be getting the material and understanding it, but for some reason I feel as if I am just overthinking this whole thing. I'd also like to mention that during the span of class I feel like its unproductive to go through the introduction in the beginning then jump straight into breakout groups. I feel like we should be in class as a whole during zoom so that questions can be asked so there is less confusion."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2607,"1 Bobakr Hussain Physic 102 12/02/2022 Reflection Why am I here? Good question , I always ask myself the same question. And the answer is still the same, to have myself a less stressful future, a better future to have the best environment a family could grow in. Where I came from, no matter how hard you work for your future, you can’ t make it so far because of the war and lack of education. Even if you get a degree it won’ t get you anywhere. You would just frame it and go look for a job. Here I found myself surrounded with so many opportunities and I have to take advantage of it to make my future so bright. I know that it’ s not going to be easy but I know for sure I will make it to the end and have my degree and find a job that I love and build a great family .  The next time I ask myself this question I will be so ready to answer with my plan to be on top of the world."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2608,"Mari Johns PHYS 102-03 12 February , 2022 ""Why am I here?"" When I think about the question, “why am I here”, I automatically think about my friends and family . I think about how they all love me unconditionally and how that brings me and them all happiness when we are together . And just the feeling of joy and content that I have such a loving and supportive family , and a caring friend that is there for me. If a person is not happy and does not have any sense of belonging, they a lot of the time get depressed. I know that without my family and friends, I would be miserable and lonely . When I go out and just enjoy my surroundings, go to a concert, eat yummy foods, they all make me happy . It makes me think, “aaahhhh, this is nice.” without those moments, what else is there to look forward to? So I think the answer to the question would be to be happy and just enjoy life with the people who care about you, and do the things that make us happy ."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2609,"Sanaz Homayounieh Physics 102-03 Professor Grigorescu 10 February 2022 Why am I here? This question can be answered in a number of dif ferent ways, and can be applied to numerous different contexts. However , I will answer it to apply to my reason for being here at SF State. I am here in order to prepare for my future career . My goal is to become a professional video editor , creating motion pictures to be viewed around the world. After researching schools, I came to the conclusion that I can meet my career and overall life goals here in San Francisco, studying here at SF State. I am extremely happy with my choice, and honestly could not imagine fulfilling my goals anywhere else in the world! I have fallen in love with this city , and I am proud to call myself a student of this school. So, that is the reason why I am here. Every single class I take here at SF State is contributing to my success, and I strongly believe in that."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2610,"I believe that just as every or ganism in our ecosystem has a purpose, I have a purpose as well. I believe that the purpose given to or ganisms such as animals, insects and plant life is ingrained in them & becomes an instinct to support their survival. I believe that the purpose aligned with humans is much more complex. For example, a dog’ s purpose may be to eat, play , protect their territory , and remain a “good dog” in the eyes of their owner . However , a human’ s purpose may be to fill a void that they feel within themselves, be a supportive friend for their friends and family , & maintain a healthy self image. Clearly the dif ference of a dog’ s purpose in comparison to a human’ s is clear . I think about my purpose quite often. I think that in life we go through cycles of altering what we believe our purpose should be based on our changing environments and stages of growth. After my 20th birthday , I felt the need to solidify what I believe my purpose is. I felt the urgent need to do this because I believe the things I consume, the actions I initiate, and the people I surround myself with should all align with my purpose. I’ve spent the first 19 years of my life getting an understanding of who I am as a person, the things I like, and the think’ s I do not care for . This understanding was solely made on the basis of my childhood, my family , and the friends I have made during those 19 years. I believe that now , being 20 years old, I am solidifying this idea of myself. I am looking deeper into myself and the relationships I have. I am grateful to have grown up in an environment where my purpose did not belong to anyone else. By this, I mean I am grateful to have parents that did not push their own purpose & yearns onto me. My parents made it clear that whichever path I choose in life, as long as I am happy and fulfill all the academic goals I currently have, they will be more than proud of me. I am aware that not everyone has parents or a support system that nurtures their purpose. This is a very dif ficult thing to heal from because years of not being able to openly express one’ s purpose without judgment has a lasting impact. One has to rediscover the things that they enjoy or fulfill them to find this new purpose. In my upcoming years, especially my twenties, I plan to continue to learn more about myself to solidify what my purpose truly means to me. Not only that, but I plan to ensure that the things I partake in, & the people I allow to share my ener gy with align with this purpose."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2611,"“Why am I here”  	When I here these words in my own thoughts it does make me question my existence and whether the person, I see in the mirror is really who I am. This thought may not have often come to my mindset often, but it does show up in my moments of lost and sorry. My current goals of graduating with my degree in kinesiology is one of the main motives of my current lifestyle and gives me a purpose or objective to approach as I reach further for bigger goals such as hopefully finding a well-paid job with the Physical Therapy career route and being able to finally move out of my parent’s place to take a further step into my adult hood. All these goals may seem materialistic and ambitious of me to be reaching for the same general goal that any college student like myself would generally want to reach for as well. My current understanding of “why I am here” is that it not completely about what my purpose of being in this world is, but more towards what I want to make of myself in this world before them comes a day where I end up passing away in this world. The understanding of what type of mark I want to leave on this planet before my times comes to leave this planet."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2612,"PHY 102:  Reflection #1: Why am I here?  I am currently here taking this class because I need to meet all my credits in order to graduate with a degree in Kinesiology. Although I feel like I am the verge of being done with school, I can’t. Getting this degree will mean so much to my family because I will be a first-generation college grad. I no longer want to continue to do school, this whole pandemic has made my college experience extremely overwhelming, but I have to stay motivated. I am here to graduate and hopefully begin my EMT career soon afterwards. I am sure this course and it’s calculations will help me figure problems out in my every day life in the medical field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2613,"Chloe Thornton Professor Grigorescu PHYS 102-03 February 13, 2022 I am here to learn and examine physics. Learning about the forces, motions, sounds, and radiation . Experimenting through simulations and experiments will allow me to have a better understanding of it. Allowing many theories and hypotheses formulated to be tested allows physics to be as experimental. Learning throughout this semester will inform me on dif ferent aspects that I confront in everyday life. Physics gives me the ability to explore and think beyond my imagination. I’m here to understand the deeper meaning and origin of it. Physics creates a space for critical thinking and applying knowledge that already exists. It also pushes you to make sense of certain conclusions and results. Physics has many interesting aspects but it also shows you how much physics is seen in everyday life scenarios. I’m here to explore and learn the basis of physics and build my own understanding of it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2614,"PHYS 102 B. Chestnut Purpose in Life The purpose of taking a breath everyday is to accomplish the goals I set out for myself. I want to feel like my life was worth it and meaningful to other people. In order to do that I feel I have to bring purpose and joy in someone else’ s life. I want to contribute to the youth as I believe they are the change within generations. I feel my purpose is to live life as lessons instead of good and bad because it puts pressure on someone without realizing it. I feel my purpose is to live freely , unstressful, and successfully with everything I attempt. I feel my purpose is to make my mom proud and happy as she contributes so much to my life in all dif ferent lessons. Her driven self is a true inspiration, so I feel it creates a purpose within myself to take on her lessons and make them an achievement to my life in any way I can."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2615,"""Why am I here?"" - ""Why am I here?"" I think that's a question I’ve been asked so many times in my life. The answer still remains the same. I was to be successful. I think that's a very vague answer but that statement has a purpose and it's what drives me every day. I think of all the times I was at practice or in school and think of them as stepping stones to a place that I want to be at. I see them as obstacles that I need to cross in order to get what I want in life. We go through school and learn to get a better job and find who we truly are. We go to practice to achieve that goal of being a national champion or state champion. My coach in high school always described wrestling as being like a pyramid. We all have those athletes who are good when they're younger and eventually there's high school wrestling then college and then very rarely there's Olympic wrestling. For me, Olympic wrestling isn't my purpose or my goal. I believe something greater but what my coach was saying is correct. It's a pyramid and it all depends on how far an individual wants to go. So to end my very short statement I will say the reason why I am here is to achieve a goal that I wanted to achieve all my life. That's to be successful and be able to have multiple sources of income and be able to provide for the ones that I love. I want to make my parents proud and everyone around me. I strive to do my best every day although that's not always the case I still try to do my best in whatever it is that I do."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2616,"Reflection #1 I’m here because I figured that after years being a pre-nursing major I came to the conclusion that things might not always happen the way you expect them to. I always dreamt of being a nurse, and that’ s still a goal of mine, but the path that’ll get me there might change throughout time. There are a lot of obstacles in life, but obstacles are meant to be challenging and help you find a more accessible way of achieving your goal. I never thought that maybe there could be other ways of reaching my goal. I was always so fixed on one pathway , and that specific journey , but now as I’ve gotten older , I’ve seen life in a whole new light. That’ s why I’m taking Kinesiology classes as a back up plan in case I don’ t get into the pre-nursing major . I’ve come to terms with the route, and I’m not mad about it. I’ve accepted all the struggles that’ll come my way , and I won’ t hide from them, but I’ll face them head on."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2617,"I thought about this question when I was in the third grade of junior high school, because I had already studied biology in junior high school and knew the knowledge of cells and so on. Since childhood, we have all accepted materialism, that is, after death, nothing is left.  It was the first time in my life that I strongly felt the existence of 'self' or something that controls my body or the real 'I'. The concept of 'I' is not a real thing, but 'I' resides  In the body, but also in the brain, because even if my hand is broken, 'I' is still 'I', which means that 'I' is not in the hand, and the same can be said that 'I' only exists in the brain, which specific  Location unknown.  Forget it, this question is too difficult to define at all.  Here are my answers to a few questions.  Are memories part of the 'I'?  I don't think so.  Does 'I' really have to be parasitic on matter?  Personally I think yes, leaving the substance will quickly disappear. Will 'I' disappear?  Yes, it's gone when you die.  Did the world exist before 'I' existed?  Yes, and the negative axis of the time axis extends towards negative infinity."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2618,"Madeline Zevallos Reflection 1 I am here because I want to have a career as a nurse. I am here to learn. I am here to understand physics. I am here because I desire to make my parents proud. I am here to get my bachelor’s degree. I am in Physics 102 so that I can learn about why and how the structures of matter across the universe work. I aspire to become educated. I know that if I lost everything I owned tomorrow, I would still have my education left. Education is important because it leads to a career, a purpose. For me, education is important because not only does it give me a sense of confidence, it gives me knowledge, and knowledge can be powerful especially to a young woman like myself who has the odds stacked against her in today's world, a man’s world. I appreciate my teachers and all the people who have supported my learning because without them I wouldn’t have the mental strength to finish those long homework assignments on nights where I just simply didn’t feel like doing them. Through education I have learned determination and use it daily in school and in my real life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2619,"Reflection of Why Am I Here  This question is particularly profound for me, and I have not thought about it specifically, so I don't have an exact answer to this question. I don't feel that I am really looking for the meaning of my existence. It is possible that I exist so that I can help others, to experience the pain and joy of life, or just to exist because I exist. I often hear my friends talk about where they are going and what they are aiming for in the future, and my feelings are envious and confused. I look back at the time I've lived through, and I see a void because I haven't set myself any goals or pursued anything. But I didn't want to just get by, probably because all my friends around me had their own pursuits one by one, which inspired me. I won't be able to find the answer and the purpose of my life in an instant, but I will keep looking for it and do everything I should to do. For now, I hope I can do my best in both my studies and in life, and that is my purpose."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2620,"I am here because I have a purpose to fulfill. That purpose is to succeed in life whether it may be a small success or a huge success. I want to make my family proud and finish school. Finish school and start my career . My career is becoming a physical therapist. It is important for me to finish school because my parents did not. I am not also doing it for them but also for me because I want to become a success for not only myself but also for my future family . I want to have great financial stability for my family so they don’ t have to worry about it in life, but I also do want them to become too comfortable with the wealth. It is important for me because I did not grow up wealthy so I want my future children to grow up like that so they can help the ones in need out."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2621,"""Why am I here?"" Reflection #1 I am here because I’m interested in either being a nurse or a physical therapist. Because my major is kinesiology, I figured physics would be a beneficial course for me as it studies motion. Motion is important in nursing and physical therapy especially because studying motion relates to our body movements. Learning about physics can help me enhance my knowledge before I enter my career."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2622,"I am here to understand conceptual physics. We are taking what we learned in the lecture and using the lab class to understand the topic even more and how it can translate into real-life current events. But not only am I here to learn conceptual physics I am also taking this class to get units and it is a requirement to help me apply to my major , which is kinesiology . I have heard a lot of people struggling with physics so I went in very scared and anxious about how hard it will be but so far it doesn't seem too dif ficult and hopefully , it will stay that way , but probably not. So far the labs have been very interesting and  I have been learning a lot. Hopefully , I can use what we learned in class and apply it to real-life circumstances. I am looking forward to learning a lot more and doing fun labs for Physics."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2623,Why am I here? There are many reasons as to why I am here writing this short response question. It all started from the first thing that brought passion out of me which was sports. Playing sports from 5 years old to 18 years old in or ganized sports allowed me to come to a conclusion that in college I would pursue a career in kinesiology . This is because with this I can work with athletes and organized sports teams to help athletes out with their injuries. I am here trying to gain more knowledge in everything that I am being taught so that I can reach my main goals. In addition to this I am here to learn from good and bad experiences and what I take out from every experience that comes to me whether that experience be in school or in my life outside of school and have no regrets.

I can keep up and do everything fine, but it's just like I am not really doing anything since it is all online. I don’ t feel like I'm learning anything but doing stuf f just to do stuf f. I like my selection of classes this semester and I am excited to go in person and do class. I feel this semester will show me if I really want to take this career path since it is actually real in person school. The sur ge was also pretty scary , I thought I got covid. It has put a damper on my social life because I went from going out regularly to very rarely . I am nervous for inperson classes and very excited at the same time, I still need to get a haircut and everything. These are just a few thoughts before in person class."
