So because of that I always tried to be the best I can be and make it as far as I can. It also navigated me to what I should be. I realized that being a doctor is too hard for me but I was interested in something in the medical field. Which led me to learn about Physical Therapist and that really interested me so now I am a kin major and hopefully in the future I can be a Physical Therapist. But because of how my family keeps pushing me to do well in school it helped me choose what I wanna be and help create that mindset for me to keep being persistent.

The first thing was helping me choose my career path  and therefore deciding a degree for me. I was taught to do my work and never take fail ures  as a breakdown point. This is what keeps me going. As a college student, I often face  periods of stress where I can’t seem to figure a way out. This is when my family steps in.  Seeing people around the community also motivates you. It is a very import ant factor as it  acts as a support system. Of Course we should try to learn and keep growing, but the  motivation for it comes from family. Whenever I feel like giving up, my family asks me to  take a break if I am stressed out and then encourages me to get back on track."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2606,"Throughout life, it's gonna knock you down and beat you to the ground. But, the reality of it is those who will succeed will persevere. I would have to say that the values instilled by my family have monumentally helped me navigate through college. My dad has always told me to just ask questions if you are confused. Because at the end of the day you're asking the questions to figure out the answers and you will have the tools to teach others. Another major piece of advice that I have gotten from my family is to always be calm. In situations where you don’t know what’s going on or if you have a boat load of assignments due by the end of the week and you don’t think you’ll get it done. I talk to my family almost everyday and friends in the community and without them I don’t know where I would be."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2618,"The values of my family helped me navigate through college by being taught independence, determination, and ambition. I believe that my mother raised me to be independent and to have goals in life. I feel as though it’s my independence and pride that never let me fail even when I think I’m going to. I want to do the assignments on my own and I want what I do to be right, I want the words I put onto paper to be my own and I want to get it done all by myself but I want it done the right way. I was always taught that if you could give 1% of effort then you can give the full 100%. Determination is what has helped me through my academics thus far, the will to not give up. I see it as I'm literally fighting for my education everyday, I'm fighting to not fail and that’s what my mother taught me to be, a fighter, someone who doesn't give up even if they're scared."

So it helped me meet and socialize with a lot of dif ferent people at school. I am also very open to trying new things and activities. But because I live kind of far from the campus and San Francisco I feel like I can not connect with the people I meet as much on a personal level and hang out for too long. Also, because my family has a history of heart problems and other health problems, my mom pushed us to be as healthy and active as possible. I did a lot of dif ferent sports and watched my diet. I think that influenced me now because I wanted to major in a sports health major , Kinesiology . And it just happened that a lot of my other relatives are also majoring in the same field or nursing."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2619,"Reflection#4 The presence of my family was a very influential presence in my growth and the development of my values. For as long as I can remember, my parents have constantly instilled in me the importance of learning. I was sent to kindergarten when I was two years old. It may have been difficult to really learn anything powerful at that age, but it gave me a deep sense and habit of the school atmosphere. My parents put a lot of effort into my studies and school while I was growing up. In their values, learning is very important in one's growth. Keeping good study habits and knowing how to study this can be learned in my school. So, I followed in my parents' footsteps and started going through elementary school, middle school, and all the way to college. During this time, I got to know a lot of highly educated people and found that their vast knowledge made them able to talk about anything they encountered, which made me really realize the importance of studying and be glad I chose to go to college."

Also by having a community that has similar struggles or difficulties as I do. Knowing that I'm not the only first generation going to college and trying to navigate my way through college and having people I can always fall back on. My family has always tried to help with every way possible that they could. My family has always told me from a young age that I needed to go to college and they would always encourage me with my studies. Sometimes I would become irritated because I felt like they were putting so much pressure on me but I would not be here if it wasn’t for them pushing me so hard and believing in me.

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2616,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""  - I was able to view college differently through the eyes of my family, by seeing all the sacrifices they made to give my siblings and I a proper education, so that we could have a successful future. My family sees college as a staple to a successful future and having a stable career. I knew that with all the challenges my parents faced, I needed to be that person where they can see that they raised me right. Because my parents didn’t go to college, they feel as if they are starting fresh by having their children go off to college, and it’s a big deal. I want them to be proud of my decisions, but also not be too overbearing when it comes to those decisions. Overall, my parents have been very supportive when it comes to helping me navigate my education, and being beside me through all the challenges, and success."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2628,"Reflection #4 Mercury Piscitello My family has been very helpful in getting me to where I am today in college. While very hands off, I can always go to my Mother for motivation and advice. She is my role model, and is the main reason I’m pursuing the degree that I’m pursuing. While my Dad dropped out of college after partying too hard, he’s always supportive and wants to help whenever possible, which I greatly appreciate and goes a long way. I’ve found my community and friends are honestly not as helpful. Only half of my friends are in college and I do my best to hang out with them the most but they tend to have less motivation than I do. Luckily my girlfriend is my number one supporter and we moved 2 hours south of my friends and family to start new and be self reliant. While risky, and new (we moved over the break) it’s been really helpful to take that step in both life and in my education."

Since the beginning of my childhood, I have received endless support from family and friends, slowly leading me to the place I am now. Now that I am here at university, that support has not stopped. At first, my family was hesitant about letting me attend university here since it is not too far away, but still far enough that I would have to move out of my home. Regardless, they have been my number one supporters and always make sure that I am doing the best I can to be successful while also making sure I take care of myself. They remind me of what I value so that I do not lose motivation when I am miles away from home. I am here to get an education above everything, so I will remind myself of that goal on a daily."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2621,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" The values of my family have helped me navigate through college as every time I feel like giving up when school gets too overwhelming, I think of my family. Because neither my grandparents nor my parents had the chance to go/ finish college, I took it as a personal challenge to go and succeed for them. In high school, I made it clear to them that not only would I go to college, but I would achieve good grades and graduate. In addition, I have two younger siblings both in high school and I want to set a good example for them to follow as they both look up to me. By setting an example of a hard working college student who also works full time, I want to motivate and encourage them that it is possible no matter how stressful the workload can be. I want them to always understand that nothing in life comes easy and we must make our other family members proud by succeeding in school for all the sacrifices they have made for us."

The values of my community/family have helped me navigate through college by having a sound support system for these past two years. My older brother has been a significant influence in being able to give me advice not to commit the same mistakes he did. Both my parents have supported me and continue to support me in what I choose to do in my future life or in the present time. My boyfriend has also significantly impacted my life by pushing to be engaged in school rather than driving me away from school. Besides that, I also believe that my community has impacted me positively into becoming a more fantastic version of myself. Seeing what I do and don't want to be in the future based on the community has helped me. Besides that, the community I live in has high hopes for me, and I choose to make that come true, by becoming someone successful in life. I hope to make important people in my life proud of who I am becoming and put myself more out there."

Additionally, asking students like myself to reflect on community and familial support demands reliving past trauma for a teacher to review which is not conducive to a healthy learning environment. Resultingly, I will not be responding to this question, thank you for your understanding."
