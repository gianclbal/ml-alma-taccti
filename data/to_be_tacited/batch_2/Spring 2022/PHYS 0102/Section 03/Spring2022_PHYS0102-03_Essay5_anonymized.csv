2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2618,"Reflection 5 I am given an abundant amount of resources on and off campus. I see my family and friends as a resource because I tend to gravitate towards them when I need comfort. They help me feel better and get through the difficult times, emotionally, psychologically and mentally. Another resource for mental health is the therapists they provide on campus. I've never used them before but there have been a few times where I’ve needed one. For physical health, they have the wellness center and the clinic where they test for std’s/sti’s, and HIV/AIDS. They have tutor centers I can go to off campus, or tutor groups on campus in the library. My teachers and other classmates are another resource I can go to when I have questions on homework or need help understanding a subject matter. There are academic advisors and counselors on campus that are meant to guide and advise me on the correct classes to take to make sure you are on track with your major. There are much more resources that are provided on campus but these were a few that came to mind right away."

I really like the simulations because it allows you to get hands-on with the experiment through our laptops and through that process we are able to observe what is going on within the lab. IN addition to this, another resource I have to support me would be my group mates. This is because we all rely on each other to help one another when we are struggling with certain parts of the experiment."

For example I know a resource that I have would be metro, which I joined in my first year at sfsu. It was really great to have, especially as a 1st year student. It really helped me when I came to finding my ways around and picking classes. Like recently I've been struggling to find an internship within my major. I reached out to one of my metro advisors and they were able to find me an internship with pay for the next following semester so I can use them for when I try to apply to a DPT program after I finish getting my bachelors degree. Another resource I know I have would be the other people in the same major as me because in a way we all support one another if we have any question with anything."

My family has been a big part of my success in school and in my sports my entire life. I have a year left of school and my parents are still going to support me that's just how they are. Until I finish up with wrestling and school in the next year my parents have always been my biggest supporters in whatever it is that I wanted to get involved in. I will always and forever be thankful for what they do for me. Not only my parents and family but my coaches also play a huge role in my support.

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2619,"Refelction#5 Every time I want to settle down and enjoy life, I will think about who supports my current good life. My parents are my financial support, they are the ones who are trying to earn money for my schooling and all other expenses. Every time I think about this, I feel a twinge of guilt. If I didn't have the support of my parents, what resources would I have left. I think about it for a long time and can't seem to come up with anything. All my resources are provided by my parents, a stable living environment, contacts, money, etc. So that's why I want to study hard and create my own resources as much as possible based on the resources my parents provided me. I want to be a better version of myself and create meaningful value. So, for me learning and growing is a necessary process to reach my goals. The only way I can enjoy peace of mind is to create my own resources."

I think  that I am happy that our college offers so much wonderf ul resources like financial aid opportunities, the  libraries  that are equipped with so many computers that we can use to do our assignments and  homework . We also have support from library by helping us researc h on things. We get help  from TASC  if we need extra support in a class. The main benefit  of all of these is that they reduce the financial  burden as these all are free of cost. We also have gym facility and sports that give us a break from study  and help us get ba ck on track by increasing  our focus ."

In terms of learning psychology, it is particularly difficult to understand the determination to make progress.  It is an important task and effort for self-study. Don't make progress because students think they are important and difficult, but firmly believe that they are the best and most promising.
