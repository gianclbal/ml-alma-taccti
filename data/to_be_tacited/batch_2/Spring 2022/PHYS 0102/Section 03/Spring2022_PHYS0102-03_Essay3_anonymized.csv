2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2621,"Asiana Duong 03/10/2022 Reflection 3 ""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" When life gets challenging, I simply take a break. Life gets overwhelming with juggling school and work along with having a personal life so I like to take a step back. I usually go for a drive to clear my mind and reflect on how I should take all my responsibilities one day at a time. I try my best to find time to take care of myself whether it’s going to get a massage or even finding time to go on vacation. When life gets extremely challenging, I schedule more appointments with my therapist just so I can gain more advice on how to better handle my stress before it becomes too much to handle. I also like to just go places alone to spend some time bettering myself when I feel my life is getting hard to bare."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2623,"When life gets challenging I tend to begin to overthink and start to think negatively , but I have gotten better at that by taking things day by day and not trying to stress about the little things. Also when life gets challenging i try to escape from that environment by going out whether that be going snowboarding, watching/hearing a podcast, studying, or at times smoking a joint. This helps me reset my mindset and try to solve the challenges I am dealing with. In addition to this, I ask for advice from my family and friends and they give me advice as to how to push through my challenges. It's okay to ask for support if you need it and having a good support system around you is good to have in your life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2616,"Reflection #3  When life gets challenging, I always make sure to take a deep breath and assess what the issue might be coming from. I make changes by altering the way I go about certain situations to make it less stressful. Things in life are always going to be challenging but should never be discouraging. We have the power to make changes and make these situations easier or harder. Whenever I feel discouraged, I take a break and do something that I can enjoy. For example, watch a movie, listen to music, go for a walk, hang out with friends, eat delicious foods, etc. There are plenty of ways to help me find joy and reevaluate how I choose to handle certain situations in my life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2625,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" When life gets challenging, there are different ways I approach this situation, depending on what it is. Sometimes many of my challenges can come with feeling stressed, overwhelmed, tired, frustrated. It can also be a lack of sleep, too much homework, or too many classes. When these situations present, I often try to go to the gym to work out; my workout varies from running on the treadmill to lifting weights to doing core workouts. Another way is talking to my boyfriend about situations that I have; he listens to me and gives me the best possible advice that he could give me, which often time helps relieve tension or stress. Besides that, sometimes I like to either go out by myself or go out with my boyfriend to forget about the challenges I am facing in life, and it is often good to take a step back from things, then reapproach them from a different perspective."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2624,"What do I do when life gets challenging Usually when it gets hard in life, I usually take a break from life and play videogames, or take a break day. Having a break from work and hardship is always good. If you indulge yourself in only work, it would be very unhealthy. If i really feel stressed I would go out on a trip or do something fun with friends. The change of pace would help and keep me focused and healthy."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2619,"Reflection#3 When I was a kid, the thing to do when faced with a challenge was often to run away from it or to get an adult to help me solve the problems. But as I grew older, I realized that there are some challenges in life that no one else can interfere with. These challenges must be faced and overcome by myself. And I am facing such a challenge right now. After this semester, I will graduate and say goodbye to my academic life. I don't have too many worries about life during this period except for my academic worries, such as money and housing. My parents will support me in these matters. After graduation, life is different, and I need to start fighting for my family and myself. The worries of work started to come up. But I can't run away from this challenge now, I can only adapt slowly, and then keep looking for a state of life and work that suits me and that I like."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2628,"Mercury Piscitello Reflection #3 When life gets challenging I tend to focus on the good things at hand. Whether it be lack of money or falling behind in school, I know I’ve got a good job and a home to fall back to. As difficult as things may be at the moment, it always gets better eventually, and when it finally does I’ll know it. So, until then, I try to keep my head up and look to the future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2611,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" Although I do tend to ask myself the question of “What do I do when life gets challenging,” there are some instances where my mind continues to stay stuck in the negative parts of what is making life challenging. Of course, I then find ways to think about the positive parts and regain my confidence, because confidence is what make a person able to achieve their goal. This tells me that even at the most difficult paths in life one must understand how he or she can approach the path of difficulty before they attempt to successfully continue on the path."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2626,"Reflection #3 When life gets challenging, the one thing that I always do is make sure to take some time to myself. I like to go to the beach or a park and have a little picnic while painting or just sit there and read a book for a couple hours.  Another thing I like to do is exercise. Running is a really big way I like to relieve stress . I used to run competitively in high school but now I just do it for fun and whenever I start to feel a little overwhelmed.  It’s important for me to always make sure I make time for myself to look after my mental health because  when I don't I usually tend to start closing off to everyone around me. I don't like to distance myself from people but when things in my life get hard it always makes it easier for me to be by myself until I figure everything out."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2618,"When life gets challenging I panic. No one likes change and neither do I. It takes a while for me to get used to a challenging situation. Usually challenging situations make me very anxious and make me overthink to the point where I think of all the negative outcomes and I scare myself. I need time to get used to certain situations so when I finally get accustomed to those challenges, I know that I truly tried considering the amount of time and effort that I had put into fighting my anxiety. I get scared of the possibility of failing the challenge, so I’d rather run from my problems than actually deal with them like fight or flight id rather flight than fight. I guess it's all a part of the growth mindset mentality that I need to start using. That's why I need time to adjust to challenges but I know life won't stop just for me so I guess i just need to roll with the punches."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2613,When life gets challenging I start to stumble but what brings me back is when I make time to relax. I find myself making myself busy or just doing work that I need to do instead of taking the time to breathe and let all my stress go. When it comes to school I have to schedule it out to make sure I'm not stressing myself out . I have to not only deal with school but also work. Having to juggle the two has been stressful and tiring but I've created a schedule that has allowed me to make it possible. It's been tough but when it's hard I know that if I find time to watch my favorite show or sleep I feel better. There are times that I need to set that relaxation time later but it's rewarding when I get the time to do it and treat myself. Self care has been important and I would not be as happy as I am without it.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2609,"Sanaz Homayounieh Reflection #3 When life gets challenging, I typically like to take a step back and evaluate my current situation. Due to prior experiences, I found that its much more ef ficient and easier on myself if I carefully think about what is going on that is making my life challenging in the first place. Therefore, I am able to assess the situation and think calmly about how I can make life a bit less challenging, if anything. I would definitely prefer to handle the situation with the least amount of stress as possible. I am also happy to know that I have access to a wide variety of resources here at San Francisco State. While I have not had the chance to utilize most of them, I am grateful to know that they are there for me anytime I need them! For this privilege, I am truly grateful and appreciative of this institution."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2608,"Mari Johns PHYS 102-03 10 March, 2022 Reflection 3 When life gets challenging, I usually take a step back and take a break. I usually do this by doing a leisurely activity that does not require that much thinking. Such as taking a mindless walk with music, reading a book, or just simply watching a light hearted show that I enjoy. I usually need to take a break when I over use my brain, such as in school or work gets too overwhelming. I think it is important to take time for yourself and just focus on our mental health. Too much pressure is bad for our stress and anxiety levels, so people should learn to take more breaks and just reflect on where they are on the scale of their mental health. I usually feel refreshed and ready to start my work again after I take a break. It feels like I am recharged, especially after I get fresh air and go outside on a nice day and not cooped up in my room. It is also healthier for your body to get away from the screen or from staring at small writing for so long. It is good to stretch your body and move around outside and let our eyes take a break."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2615,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" - Life is not always easy. My parents used to tell me that all the time. From a working class family struggling each and every day to provide for their three kids it was hard for my parents to keep going. Here I am now 22 years old and the oldest sibling trying to get through life and make my parents proud. I’ve found a couple of different things that help me get through life when life is getting hard. As a wrestler and student I’ve always been pushed. I’ve been put into some of the worst situations and put into some of the best ones. I can say from experience that when life gets tough I take a deep breath and get straight to work and embrance every moment until I’m out of that challenging part in life. Keep going. Push through it. Those are things I tell myself every day. My parents even though theyre fully retired have been working and running a restaurant for the past 5 years. They go to work everyday to put three kids through college. So sometimes when things get rough we find a way to push through the pain and keep going. Thats what we do. Theres no other way around it. Sometimes ones gotta do things the hard way to get through it. Keep going! Push through every obstacle. This essay is meant to remind you that even at challenging points in the semester, you have resources you can draw on and that you got this. This is not meant to be a formal essay. It should be stream-of-consciousness writing from the heart. You will be graded on participation only, not on the specifics of what you say.  5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150-200 words. After you finish your essays, we will provide some class time to discuss your thoughts, to the extent that you feel comfortable sharing."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2605,"Reflection #3  Often, I get bombed with so much work and I can’t seem to work it out. This is when life gets challenging for me. In this case, I like to keep myself calm and try to prioritize the tasks. I do certain things like listening to music or eating my favorite foods to keep my mood happy. In this time, I like to take a break from my regular work schedule and do things that lift me up. After my break, I like to work on things one by one and solve each problem. At the end, I feel happy that I am able to overcome this difficult time and not give up. I would also ask help from others and seek their advice. Sometimes spending time with friends or family or just talking to them gives many solutions. I motivate myself to do the hard work and finish up things."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2612,"When life gets challenging, I usually like to go out and sometime be surrounded by nature or places that keep me distracted from my problems. When I’m feeling extremely anxious, I ask my friends to come on walks with me or sightseeing or on hikes. When they aren’t available, I’ll ask my boyfriend to take me to run errands with him. Spending quality time with someone I love always makes me feel better. When life gets challenging, I like to also work it keeps me occupied and makes me feel productive as well. I will literally try to do anything but stay home. Only very few times have occurred where life wins and I just want stay in bed and sleep all day and not know about anybody, but this doesn’t happen often. I like to remain positive and think good things will happen to me. I also strongly believe in manifestation, it brings major comfort to me in difficult situations."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2617,"1. Get things done on the same day: focus on today, don't worry about tomorrow.  The Bible says, ""Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about tomorrow; one day's troubles are enough for one day."" (Matthew 6:34) 2. Eliminate tension and relax yourself: No matter what job you do, you must do what you can, don't do overloaded things, pay attention to the combination of work and rest, relax yourself. 3. Leave some time to talk with your family: Many times you are busy with work and have no time to talk with your family and children, resulting in a lack of communication, which affects family relationships. In the long run, it will affect emotional breakdown.  So, set aside some time every day to talk with your family and children, care for them, love them, make them feel the warmth of home, and at the same time eliminate unnecessary troubles. When unloading heavy burdens: Heavy burdens (such as worries and sorrows) on one's body will affect people's physical and mental health, and heavy burdens can make people breathless.  Jesus said, ""Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."" (Matthew 11:28)"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2614,"Reflection #3 When life gets challenging I usually take deep breaths and refer to the phrase YOLO (you only live once). I stick to this motto because rather than my mistakes or my success it will only be one life I can live. Everything is a lesson in life and I have to take the lessons seriously and more on or learn from. I like to listen to music as well when I am facing challenges, it reassures me to remain confident and humble. I know life itself is challenging and will always come with it’s obstacles, but I have to overcome it in some way, so I believe peace is the best way to overcome it. A healthy environment and positive setting goes a long way. Eliminating things in my life that aren’t necessary and removing the negativity that people, objects, or things that come with that. Everything that may not work the first time, doesn’t mean it won’t come back around another time."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2629,"James Kreiss PHYS 102-03 Professor Gri-Go-Rescu 10 March 2022 ""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" When life gets challenging, I take time to myself to soothe any feelings of being overwhelmed. I try to take my mind off of my thoughts by investing in my hobbies or performing some self-care. When I have calmed down, I think about what I can change in my life to avoid reaching the same overwhelming point. While participating in higher education, I have had to use these strategies to determine a work-life balance."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2622,I honestly don't know what I would do if life gets challenging but I would probably start talking to other people to see if they can help me with whatever I am having problems with. Another thing would be to destress first so I can regain my thoughts. I would probably either go play some games or work out to calm myself. But I will always talk to people about what's going on with my life. I have very good friends who care about me and I know they will always help me out when I ask. I would probably also email my old teachers because they are very wise and helpful and I am very close with them as well. They used to always have answer to my life problems in high school so I am sure they would also help me if I ever face any life challenges right now .
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2606,"For me personally I do get overwhelmed when life gets challenging. Nowadays for me it's a constant cycle of work, school and sports and it's really hard to balance all of them well while also maintaining a social life. Creating a constant high pass life is what I like because I don’t like to just chill and do nothing. But when life does get hard I like to reach out to my parents and talk to them. Honestly it isn't ever the same thing, but we just talk about life. Being able to just talk and rant about everything that I go through on a daily basis. I think the best way I get through a bad week or if life gets challenging is just communicating with friends and family. I like talking and having conversations because I like how I get to hear about other people's views or days."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,3,2607,"1 Bobakr Hussain Reflection When life gets challenging all I could do is try to distract myself from whatever the challenge. I try to figure out the challenges and see an easy way to make it go as planned. To distract myself I try to make myself busy either working out or playing soccer . When it comes to school , I try to stay focused and give each class a day to work on whatever I have to do such as homework, reading or exams. If it gets harder I try to ask the people around me for help or if they have any idea to make it easy on me. No matter how hard it gets, I always try my best to stay focused. For every challenge, I have to overcome to continue my life the easy way ."
