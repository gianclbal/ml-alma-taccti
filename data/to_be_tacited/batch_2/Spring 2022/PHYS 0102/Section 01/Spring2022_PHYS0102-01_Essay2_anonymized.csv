2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2566,- My goal at this moment is to graduate college while working a full-time job. I have not thought much about life after college but I believe I’ll be fine. In order to graduate college I must pass about 5 to 6 classes I have left. I am currently taking 4 and this class is one of them . I enjoy it because it is not as demanding but it teaches a lot. This class is in my Kin requirements but I do not think about it as such. I enjoy this physics class because it is not as complex. Since this is not my major I like the type of challenge it gives me. It is not too hard for me but not as easy either. I also enjoy this class because it can help bring up physics topics with other students who might be majoring in it. -
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2575,"My goals are to build my knowledge and understanding of kinesiology and learn about the mechanics of how and why our body moves the way it does. I believe this physics lab will help me achieve these goals because the importance of learning about concepts such as different forces and torque are very applicable to the way our body moves. Learning about these concepts also gives me a better understanding of the limits of human body movement and how we can safely perform such movements to avoid injury. So far in my physics lecture and even in our upcoming lab lesson about forces, I will be able to apply those concepts to my everyday life when it comes to safe weightlifting techniques at the gym. Through these online lab simulations I will be able to know the limits of my body and how much I can handle when it comes to weightlifting to avoid injury."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2578,"My goals are to become an exercise specialist and gain as much knowledge about it as I can with the addition of learning other subjects throughout my life and applying those things to my life that I believe will help me in my journey. Physics is one of those subjects that can be applied to many aspects in my life especially for exercise science purposes. Learning things like force, velocity, and Newton's laws are definitely helpful for my chosen career path but they are also somethings that I was curious about and wanted to learn and know about it. Each week I learn something new which is great because that is what I was hoping for and hopefully I can apply this to my future career."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2572,My goals in life or my goals in college. I don’t really know hat goals i would have for this class besides passing with a fair grade. I don’t know if i can say this class is helping but it is making it easier by working in groups.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2586,My goal is to become a physical therapist. In order to achieve that goal I have to take this class as a prerequisite for another class to be able to finish my degree. Taking this class also helps me with understanding different mechanisms that take place in the body. This class would also help me understand other physics concepts when I have to take other physic classes in the future.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2576,"So far I have been enjoying this class even though it is the longest class I have. It is difficult to focus over zoom for nearly 3 hours and just continue working. What has been making it feel ""not that long"" has been the way my group and I work together in order to move on quickly through the lab, but in a way that we still understand what is going on. Since we have started I have created a bad habit were I have not been turning in my post lab assignments (I believe that's what it is called). But it has not been because I don't want to do it. It has been because I have a lot of things going on, specifically running my baking business and I completely forget to do it. I know in my previous science classes we usually get about a week at the most to turn in lab assignments since they are usually bigger then regular assignments so in my mind I feel like I have more time but in reality we only have about 3 days. If my brain was not as busy I would have definitely remembered to do that part of my lab assignment but I generally keep forgetting. So my goal is to just put reminders on my phone, fridge, or ask for extensions if I know I have a busy schedule. "

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2583,"My goals vary depending on the different aspects of my life. In terms of my life, I hope to move out of state for a few years then eventually settle down back in the Bay Area. In terms of my career, I feel as if it can go in many different directions. I know that ultimately, I want to be a nurse and work in Labor and Delivery. That has been a goal of mine since I was a child. However, as I got older, I realized that maybe there are more things I want to do than just commit to one job for the rest of my life. I have always had great interest in sports and the whole industry surrounding that that I am now taking the time to feed into that curiosity. I think this class serves as a great stepping stone in that direction. What I am learning in this course is closely related to and ties to what I am learning in my kinesiology classes."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2565,Angela Torres 2/23/2022 Reflection 2 I have many goals I strive to achieve in this physics class. One thing I hope to gain is a better understanding about how these natural laws are applied and seen in the world around us. Another thing I wanted to achieve by taking this class is to strengthen my math skills. The reason why I want to do this is because math is one of my weaker subject areas where I normally struggle the most. I also wanted to simply increase my understanding and gain knowledge for the pure purpose of learning. I made this a personal goal of mine because I discovered from my own personal experiences that a lot of adults become stubborn and complacent upon reaching a certain age where they decided that they didn't have to learn anymore because they were “old” and I decided I didn't want that for myself. I also wanted to attain that goal so I can be a good example in the future when I finally decide to have a family so I can raise the next generation of our country in the right way .

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2570,"My overall goal is to get through college. It's a pretty vague goal but it's the one thing that I truly want to get done. I have never been the biggest fan of school but I know its importance and value for my future endeavors. How will this class help me achieve my goal? This class is a GE requirement, it's required for me top acquire my degree. That's the simple, cold hard truth. It's not that I dislike this class, I quite enjoy the concepts of physics as I've stated in the previous reflection. I also have smaller goals that I don't prioritize at all but I might as well state them here. I've recently started playing Valorant and a goal I set for myself was to first improve at the game then climb the ranks hopefully to around Immortal. Another long term goal I have for myself is also to get more active and just live healthier. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2591,"When I first signed up for this class, I had no goals, to be honest. I just wanted to take this class since it was a requirement, A-G courses. I still don't think I have any goals for this class other than to learn the material being taught. Usually, in all my classes I just manage by paying half attention and doing the work, not really learning. I think it's because the classes are online and honestly I do shitty in synchronous classes. So I guess a goal I made myself was to actually learn from this course, or at least to try to focus more. I don't think I have any actual goals, other than to pay attention. This class is helping me achieve this goal by being hard if I don't attend class or understand what is being taught. If I don't understand, I won't be able to help my group with the labs or do any of the other assignments needed without the understanding of the subject being taught I think I'm doing okay so far, I could do better though. I still don't understand most things being taught to me (not the teacher's fault, I just generally have a hard time learning certain things) but I know that with patience I'll come to get the hang of this course. "

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2582,"My goals are to be successful and accomplish whatever my true dreams are. Throughout my life, I’ve always had dreams of playing basketball, and being an actual profesional basketball player. But that has not been going as I wanted it to go. But I always remember that everyone’s path is different. Not saying it’s guaranteed, but I can’t give up on that yet. I also understand that some people’s goals change when they get older. In 2 years, I might not have the same goals and same aspirations that I have now. So, I want to be able to be successful, make a good amount of money, and live a lifestyle that ali actually want to live."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2571,"My goals from attending this class is to attain a better understanding of physics to where it will give me a better understanding of the world that I walk in, and also to help me out in my other physics class that I am in. I hope that I gain not just a general knowledge of random facts, but I have interesting things that I retain from this class. For example if someone wonders how long it will take for something to drop and hit max velocity, I would be thrilled to know this off the top of my head. I have heard someone know the formula before, and I was very impressed. I am looking for things like this out of  this class."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2564,"What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""My goals are to have a better understanding of everything, in general. Knowing how the world works, what changes I can make in my everyday life to make even the smallest change. How I can help others understand the basic concepts of life, space, movement, energy transfers, etc. This class will help me achieve these goals because it gives me the basic knowledge I need in order to start with a question and explore other possibilities without being clueless. Working hand in hand with the material will also help me have a better overall understanding because I am able to see why things do what they do or how they get to that point. This class is also giving me practice and I believe practice is a great way to familiarize yourself with almost anything.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2567,"My goals are to work in the healthcare field because I have always wanted to help others. Some of my academic goals are to finish my bachelor's at San Francisco State and I am not sure what I want to do after. I have been looking into physical therapy and occupational therapy school. However, for physical therapy school, it is 5 more years so I am not sure at the moment. Another goal is to learn to balance my academic and personal life. I saw a tiktok the other day that said that students should be people first and students second because there is so much to do in our lives. Therefore, the recent goal that I have is to enjoy life a little more because school is very important to me but I have to learn how to balance the two better. This class is helping me achieve my goals because it is a requirement and then I am closer to graduating. This class also relates to my major, kinesiology, especially biomechanics because it uses physics in relation to the body. This class also has taught me problem-solving skills which I will definitely need no matter what healthcare profession I go into."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2587,"My goals consist of receiving my bachelors of science and becoming an athletic trainer. This class is helping me achieve these goals, but specially the first one. This class is a core class for my major, so passing it will help me move forward in completing all the units I need to graduate. I will need to understand conceptual aspects of physics in order to flourish in my future career. Lastly, this class will help me succeed as I apply to receive my Athletic Training Certification before I actually move onto my career officially. Outside of my major, this class is helping me achieve one of my personal goals in life. I strive to learn and understand concepts that I haven’t learned before or am not too knowledgeable about. I’ve never taken a physics class, so this is definitely out of my element, but is also helping me in achieving a personal goal of mine. I believe it’s important to keep learning and educate yourself, even if it’s new or unfamiliar. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2592,"My goal is obviously to learn about physics. To give me a general idea what physics and the relating topics. For example, I learned about velocity, acceleration, motion, and many more related topics. It is giving me some general knowledge about these topics. Especially velocity and acceleration because of the negative and positive. Learning about the direction of the item being used also learning about the graphs and how to describe them.  Even though I am learning something different from the main class and lab, it is still helping me out learn more about physics in general.  Hopefully, in the end, I hope I learn more and go into detail about the related topics. Going in, I did not know much about physics but I am learning a little bit of it. Also to cross it off my ge list to get into my major program. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2579,"I have many goals involving fitness, finances, and educational goals. I would say that this class is helping me on the journey to finish my undergraduate degree and bring me to the next step in obtaining a master's degree and doctoral degree. After I have reached each goal, I hope to open my own business. This class is a small stepping stone along the way to helping me achieve everything that I aspire to do. I also think that this Physic courses has many life applications that will help me better understand things in everyday life and help me along the way."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2590,"My goal in life is to be able to be financially stable, and be able to help out all my family members, both here in the US and the Philippines. This class is helping me achieve this goal by allowing me to finish my prerequisite and continue with obtaining my degree in Kinesiology. As I stated before, I am not sure if I will utilize my degree, however, there might come a day when I realize that being in the medical field is my actual dream. Until that day comes, I will continue to pursue real estate, and become financially stable so I never have to worry about money again and just live my life to the fullest without any concerns regarding money. Before I continue to pursue my goals, I want to be fully engaged in my classes and obtain knowledge to the fullest extent. I think physics can help me with my everyday living, allowing me to see things in a different light. Physics has allowed me to see the world differently, I am able to think more deeply about how we are treating our planet and ways that we can help to prevent it to completely deteriorate due to global warming. Also, it allows me to think more carefully about what I do when I am working out, especially since both my dad and my younger sister have problems with their knees and shoulders. Overall, I think physics has benefitted me for the long run."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2585,"My goals for this class is to not only get a good grade, which I think is pretty much implied but another goal of mine in this class is to be able to apply this knowledge to different aspects of my everyday life. In order to achieve my first goal to get a good grade I will just continue to do my assignments to my best ability. As for my second goal which is to apply my knowledge that I have gathered from this class and use it towards different situations in my everyday life, I would first dissect the information from each lab to help me understand the information provided throughout the lab but an additional thing that i think i can do is use this towards what i am majoring in which is kinesiology, especially with motion because i think it will really help me not only feel independent but really challenge my brain to think in different ways on the more medical side. "
