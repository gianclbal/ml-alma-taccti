2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2576,"When life begins to feel challenging most of the time it's because I feel that I have a lot on my plate OR when I don't have motivation to deal with the things on my plate. When I begin to feel overwhelmed I like to create a schedule or an agenda of the things I need to prioritize, that being a homework assignment, my soccer practices, chores etc. When finishing this schedule I sometimes feel like my brain is burnout so I like to take a moment to myself by either going out to eat, watching a movie, or taking a walk for a few minutes. Right now I am in the semester where I feel consumed so I will start to practice these things again. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2577,"PHYS 102-01 D. Caden 1 Reflection 3 Question: ""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" When I’m faced with adversities throughout my life, I tend to visually plan out a method (in regards to the situation) while taking into consideration how and/pr what is the best route for me. This can look like avoiding the situation entirely or finding a resolve when the entirety of the context in regards to the situation is gathered. Personally , when it comes to identifying the context of a situation, realization is the first part. You need to understand what situation you’re in (Scale) and the severity (Threat or Non-threat). These concepts translate to any situation and once you understand the context of a challenge, you can formulate an execution strategy . As mentioned earlier , this can take any form depending on the situation. In addition, once you understand those two concepts, you can apply them as you see fit because at the end of the day there’ s no step-by-step process that can tell you to live your own life. Our lives and the decisions we choose to make in them are like a snowball ef fect and as you experience and gain knowledge, you’ll deem for yourself what you believe is “right” or “wrong”. Once this is achieved, you can essentially “ride the wave” and/or “go with the motions” to face any challenge that comes your way."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2590,"We all have obstacles that we need to overcome, and sometimes, they can turn out to be too challenging. For my personal experience, when life becomes challenging I tend to submerge myself to watching a lot of Korean dramas, or I would hang out with friends or family and go out of town. Korean dramas and K-pop have helped me through some of the toughest times of my life. These two allowed me to put my mind on something else, and not constantly think about problems that I had. Also, it just puts me in my own little bubble, where I feel most comfortable in and not worry about the world around me. There are also times when I feel that I simply cannot stay home, so I would ask my friends or cousins to come hang out with me, be it to eat out, go for a hike, or go for a road trip and just have some time for myself. Self care is important in order to push through all the problems."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2564,"When things get challenging, I sit and reflect on what it is I can do to help m yself  adjust without  reaching anxiety. I reach out to people whom I feel most comfortable asking for guidance. If  they are not able to help me understand, I then reach out to my instructors during their office  hours and ask questions  about the material  I have trouble understanding. I also branch out to  outside sources such as YouTube , journal articles , and tutoring sessions when needed. I make  sure that I give myself time to co mpose my thoughts and anxious feelings before I proceed to  continue. Some other things I may consider when facing a challenge may be taking a short walk  outside to breathe in fresh air. Grabbing a glass of ice -cold water and maybe a snack to go along  with it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2567,"Erica Labagh Phys 102 March 9, 2022 ""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" When life gets challenging I like to go outside and spend quality time with my friends and family . When I get stressed or feel as though I have too much on my plate I like to go outside because I can disconnect from my computer and phone and for get about the stressful event coming up. It also helps me to be present and to take a moment to breathe. I also like to spend time with my family and friends because they make me laugh and remember all the good things. Talking with them also helps me to focus my mind on fun things instead of the hard things at the back of my mind. Being able to see the people in my life who make me happy allows me to have fun and step away from the challenging parts of life. Overall being outside and with people who I enjoy spending time with helps me to stay grounded and to relax when life gets challenging."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2574,"When I get a challenge, I'll evaluate how difficult it is. If it's really hard, I'm sorry but I'll give it up and console myself, telling myself ""it's okay"". But if I feel like this challenge is something I can conquer, I'll do my best to get it done. I feel like it's a resiliency in my character, which allows me to cope with the challenge in my life, but it also shows my some weakness when facing severe challenges.  I don't mind challenges, in fact, I would like to have some challenges in my life. After all, I prefer challenges than boring, bland, day-to-day activities. I can't let myself face all the challenges without risk. I always have a lot of worries: I worry about failure, how my parents will judge me if I don't do it well. When faced with major decisions, I tend to be more conservative than usual and feel tied down. In fact, I recently received an email from the school informing me that there is a design competition going on. I'm interested in this, but I didn't go to the competition's website. I'm a bit scared. I don't know if I'm afraid to face this challenge, or a failure that has yet to come."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2591,"When life gets challenging, honestly I get angry. Not at myself but at life. I think life is hard how it is, so when challenges get in the way, it makes it 100x worse. OMG, especially when I'm already having a hard day and something little happens, I even get angrier. I tend to break down and have the worst time of my life when life gets hard. I try my hardest to look at the bright side or deal with the challenges but it's hard. I also ghost people when it gets hard. I know I probably shouldn't but it's what works for me. I also try to think about how others have even more rough challenges, and again I know I shouldn't try to make it seem like my challenges aren't as hard as others but I do. I don't know why I do that but I then end up thinking are my challenges even that hard? And I end up dismissing them as challenges and just dealing with the issue. There isn't one way I deal with my problems or probably a healthy way, but I'm learning and surviving so it's all good. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2592,"What I do when life gets challenging is I rethink my life decision. I like to rethink what I did so I do not make the same mistakes or get myself in trouble. I want to make it a learning experience so in the future I know how to help myself out of the challenges I have faced.  Rethinking my decision helps evaluate what I have learned.  Usually, when life gets challenging, I build up a wall and be alone. As I have mentioned that I like to rethink Also, asking for help when it gets to the point that you cannot handle anymore but overhelp I like to have my peace whenever life gets challenging for me.  Taking a nap would be helpful but it depends honestly. I honestly write down my feelings."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2587,"When life starts to get challenging, it takes me a while to realize that I am struggling. When I finally understand my situation, I allow myself to take a break from things that are causing me stress in order to get myself organized. Usually in times like these, I will write my schedule for a few weeks onto a calendar to avoid forgetting assignments, class, work, etc. Then I complete tasks by urgency. In other circumstances when life gets challenging, I like to take a walk or talk to a friend to help clear my mind and to regain focus. It's taken a long time to realize what works for me and what doesn't, and although I still struggle to find solutions to help reduce my stress, I am continuing to grow and learn more."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2578,"When life gets challenging I take a deep breath in and just try to assess my current situation(s). Sometimes things get overwhelming and gives me a little bit of anxiety but I try to not let it get to me so much because then I won't be able to get things done if I am just worrying about them and not do anything about it. When it comes to learning this subject, which is a hard one to understand, I try to go over the material again until I have a full grasp and understanding about it. If I can't find it through the material then I will try other sources to help me get a better understanding. I do not unwelcome challenges because I like to be challenged. Getting through hard challenges helps me feel like I have accomplished doing those things and so I can accomplish other challenges going forward in my life. Going through challenges is a part of life that leads to life lessons."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2584,"What I do when life gets challenging is I take a long break from everything and anyone who I know will just get me in a bad mood. By long break I mean just take a day or two focusing on only me. I try to do some self-care and rest as much as I can, especially rest my mental health since that is a very important thing to do. I also try doing things that won't stress me out. Something that relaxes me a lot is taking a shower or a bath and just not thinking of anything stressful. Also, just eat whatever I want."

I try to get my head/mind free from whatever is stressing/challenging me. I usually play video games, work out, or listen to podcasts/music to help me relieve some frustrations/stress. After I feel better, I try to go back to what I was doing with a fresh mindset and just continue with what I'm doing and hope to accomplish whatever it is that is challenging."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2571,"When life’s get challenging I make a plan to see how I can solve it, and then I take a nap and begin the execution. For stress, anger or sadness I have always used a nap as a way to escape the hard sorrows of what I’m dealing with. When I wake up, I feel refreshed and I am now ready to just go tackle whatever I have to get done next. I also enjoy the sleeping part, as I typically only get stressed if I’m tired. One day we will all master our sleeping schedules and we will be much happier people in the world. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2575,"When life gets challenging, I try to unwind by participating in some of my hobbies. Going to the gym and going on hikes is very therapeutic for me so whenever I find myself getting overwhelmed with situations in my life, I’ll go for a walk or take myself to the gym. Working out feels very cathartic for me and it allows me to channel my stress in a way that still benefits me at the end of the day. Finding the motivation to go may be difficult sometimes but it is something I know will make me feel good by the end of it and that is what I always try to tell myself in order to find the will to go. Being able to put on my headphones and zone out at the gym for an hour or two is what helps me get through the day, and a lot of the times going to the gym is considered to be the highlight of my everyday schedule."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2579,"When life gets challenging for me which it often does with a busy schedule I try to take a step back and take a break. I try and spend time with my kids and husband, do something that is not stressful, go hike, or do something to reset. I also try to remind myself what I am grateful for and that it is okay to face challenges and failures. I am also someone that practices self-care and meditation which helps me refocus and push through challenging times. I also seek help from the VA and talk to friends and family when I am having a difficult time."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2583,"When life gets challenging, I allow myself time to take a pause. I think that it’s important to give yourself a break even if no one else does. As college students, it is so easy to get overwhelmed, and unfortunately, it’s even easier to fall behind because of it. When life throws its challenges at me, I think it is important to take a step back and just refocus. Even if it means taking time away from school. Yes, you may fall behind, but I think that the risk is worth it because your mental health is what will stick with you forever. School and every other hard par that comes with life will always be there, so you might as well take everything on when you’re ready. Listening to music, taking a walk, napping, exercising, reading, etc. are just some of the ways that I deal with life’s challenges."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2586,"When life gets challenging, I like to lean on my friends for support. They are always there for me whenever I need them and they always help pick me up. When it comes to school getting tough, then I try to push through and figure out what I'm doing wrong and seek out help from my friends or if they don't know either then I will ask the professor to help. I try to solve everything on my own first before trying to ask others for help. I also like to go on a run to help me think about what I should do when I'm struggling with some thing. Running helps me clear my head of any unnecessary thoughts and keeps me focused on what I need to do "

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2570,"Personally I believe life is a challenge in itself. We aren't given the ability to freely do whatever we want whenever we want. Its a matter of how can we do this while also doing this. In more simpler terms people may view a challenge as something that is hard to overcome, this may vary from taking a test to losing a loved one. Overcoming any of these challenges take the same form, it all comes down to how can you as the individual process what is in front you. To overcome a challenge I tend to first put it aside and really let myself digest the situation at hand. Giving something a long thought has always allowed me to gain an understanding and eventually get through whatever stood in front of me. Though it may not be the same for everyone, some are unable to overcome a challenge causing discomfort or stress. Some find nothing a challenge, though I believe this is untrue. Everyone in their life will eventually come across an obstacle they have to face in order to move forward. Challenges are a part of life and we have to get use to that."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2582,"When my life gets challenging, I pull myself to the side and just make sure that I am okay, and assure myself that everything will be fine just keep being the person that I am. I also play basketball, whenever air play basketball, it takes my mind off of everything and allows me to truly be myself. I love playing it so much, and cherish it so much. It is so fun, and without it, I don’t think my mental health would be how it is today. I also listen to music as well. Music gets me through a lot of things, including homework and hard times as well. Those two things help me a lot, and allow me to be who I am today. Basketball was played throughout my family, including my dad, uncles, and cousins as well. I am appreciative of it, and thankful I got to play it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2585,"Life can be one of the most challenging things that us as humans have to deal with on a daily basis. What i do to help me combat the challenges that life has to offer is light a stress relieving candle from bath and body works then i will write in my journal about the emotions i am currently feeling. I feel like jotting down what you are feeling inside is a good way to live in your own world for even just a little bit. Another thing that I do when life gets challenging is workout or play soccer because it helps me let go of my frustrations physically and mentally as well. Overall i would say that life is something that brings upon all sorts of feeling like anxiety, stress, sadness but there is also happiness, peace, laughter, and much more so my question to you is are you really living life if you do not feel those emotions in the first place? "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2569,"When life gets hard for me I usually write everything down that I need to get done of importance. While working two jobs and taking 4 classes this semester my life can get really overwhelming. Once I had the list of importances in front of me I check things off as I get them done. At the end of the day, I will look at it and start planning what I am going to do for the following day so I don’t go to sleep stressed out. It also helps to see what I get accomplished through the day.  I have a whiteboard where I write all my assignments as well as a calendar to write down what days I work and what days I need to spend doing homework for each class. Most of my homework is due between Friday and Sunday. So I try to get them done before Thursday so I am not stressing the day of to do them. I also work Friday through Monday from 7:30-6:30 so I am tired by the end of the day."
