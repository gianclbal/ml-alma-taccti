2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2567,"Erica Labagh Phys 102 9 February 2022 ""Why am I here?"" I am here because I wanted to continue my education so I could support my family and myself. I went seeking higher education because I will be the first in my family to graduate with a bachelor's degree. After I finished school here I am looking into a career in the health field to help others as my mother does. As for why I am in physics, an honest answer is it is a requirement to graduate. However , I have come to like and not be as scared of physics, except for the math portion, a little more after starting this class. I am in this class because I have worked hard so far in school and I want to continue and see what else I can do. I am in San Francisco for school because I wanted to be close to home and still get a good education. Overall I am continuing my studies because I want to make myself proud as well as my family ."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2568,"I think physics is an amazing subject.Physics is the basis for understanding the natural world. Physics is the cornerstone of many scientific and technological developments today. Physics education provides the necessary scientific basis for cultivating human development.The first point is that physics is undoubtedly the discipline with the deepest and most precise understanding of the material world today, and its research methods and thinking methods are the most mature, rigorous and scientific;Second, almost all natural sciences and applied technologies today are based on physics. In the field of basic science, mathematical research often leads to discussions in physics, chemistry uses a lot of experimental methods and theoretical predictions from physics, the theoretical and systematic research of life science relies heavily on the work of physicists, astronomy and earth sciences All are using physics as the most basic research method. In applied technology, modern information technology is completely based on the theory and experiment of physics. According to statistics, more than 80% of the world's gross national product is generated on the basis of applied technology based on the principles of quantum mechanics. A large number of high-tech industries need physics graduates"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2569,"The reason I am here is for a prerequisite for my major to be a physical therapist. I am taking the lab part because I want to be able to implement what I learn in the lecture. I never realized how much of my daily activity has to do with physics. I hope I am able to learn more about physics. I want to be able to spread positivity and be able to help others find positivity and health in the world. But more deeply why am I in school? I ask myself that alot these days. I want to have a better life and not have to work so hard like I saw my mom and dad. I want to be able to live comfortably. I saw how much of a struggle it was to live paycheck to paycheck. Even though it built me to be the person I am today, I want to be in a better position when I get older and hopefully get my parents everything they dreamed of."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2570,"Why am I here? A short question with so many different meanings. I'll start simple and talk about why I'm currently in college. To be frank I'm here to provide myself with more opportunities in the future. Stability is the most important thing in life, without it you wouldn't be able to live a life you see fit for yourself. I'm not rather fond of college, I just don't have the motivation to constantly put in 100% effort. I wake up every morning to open an application named Zoom. A tedious daily activity that I must overcome in order to better not only my life but also those around me. Why am I in this physics course? The simple answer is that  I need this course to meet graduation requirements. In all honesty I actually quite like physics. I think the subject is fun with many interesting concepts. My issue again resides in my motivation. I wouldn't say I'm lazy by any means rather I often procrastinate a little too much.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2571,"Jesse Escobar Michelle Chong 9 February 2022 Physics 102 Why Am I Here  	I am here today to both learn and extend my knowledge of physics, and to make it through the requirements to get my Kinesiology degree here at San Francisco State University. I am in this class to get this degree because I am trying to become a physical therapist and help others overcome injuries that they have. I am wanting to do this because physical therapy has helped me, and I have had many injuries. Some where I have had good PT’s and some bad. I want to help ensure that in the Combat Veteran world at the VA, they get a good experience with physical therapy."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2573,"I have no clue why I am here but I just know that I need to make the most of it. By that, I mean that I should enjoy my time here on this planet. I should do things that I love and spend my time wisely. I feel like no one has a purpose but if you do things that change people's lives, then I guess you might have a purpose. I just feel like we should do what we like and maybe find a purpose out of it? I also feel like we don't have a purpose because we don't get to choose if we want to be here."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2575,"I am here to continue my education and finish what I started back in 2015. From what was originally supposed to only be a semester off from school, turned into a few years of feeling lost, I was not happy with where I was with my career and education. I originally went to college to pursue nursing, but after taking all those classes and being rejected numerous times by nursing programs from all over, I was losing a lot of myself and my desire to continue with nursing. I kept asking myself if this was something I really wanted to continue doing or if it was even meant for me since I was not getting accepted into any programs. It wasn’t until last year where I decided to expand my options and consider other majors to would spark my interest. At the age of 24, I felt like I was behind compared to some of my peers since a lot of them had already graduated with their bachelor’s and working with stable jobs, but kinesiology was something that I never thought would interest me, so I decided to look more into it and come back to school to finish getting that degree."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2576,"Why am I here?Well we all know that when the pandemic hit many things changed drastically. My change was the setup of my new classroom. Instead of walking to catch the bus and strolling down the hallway to my class, I was getting up from my bed and logging onto zoom. My senior year of highschool I was introduced to my first physics class. Right from the start my teacher, Mr.Woolgar, said things would look different during “labs”. We had to do many simulations, lots of group projects, and watch videos of people doing experiments. It was interesting to watch but I wish I had that moment to experience these findings with my own eyes. I am hoping that in this class I can dive in deeper to the work I started in my last year physics class. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2577,"PHYS 102 D. Caden 1 Reflection #1 The question, “Why am I here?”, is a controversial question simply because of the fact that it leads to more questions, essentially leaving the main one unanswered. Personally , I believe that the answer to this question can be dif ferent every time in regards to the context behind it. If I were to ask myself this question today , I would tell myself that you’re currently accomplishing the things that need to be done now so that you will be better of f in the future. I am here now so that I won’ t have to be back in the future. I am here for those who wish to have, and those that can’t have, the slightest magnitude of the opportunities that we take for granted. I am here now to learn, apply , and revolutionize my knowledge so that it can be applied to the outside world in a beneficial manner so that for those who can’ t experience it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2578,"I am here because I need this class to fulfill a prerequisite for one of my core classes. I took this class before at DVC Diablo Valley College but had to drop it but I still finished physics-101. Now that I am taking it again I am going to try to actually learn or review what I learned from the previous semester I took physics. I also need the units for this class to graduate. Also, I am going to apply what I learn from this class to real life situations when possible because physics applies to pretty much everything around us. I am here to learn what I can from school and get a good job and make a nice living. I am here to do great things."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2579,"I am here because this is apart of the goals that I have made for myself. I am here for myself to become educated and learn about life and I also enjoy learning. A big part of my purpose, is my two kids, I want to show them how important education is and this class is apart of my education journey so I want to be here and be present and learn each day to teach them as they grow and get older. It is important for me because I think Physics has so many parts that deal with real life applications and I believe it's important to expand and spread that knowledge to those around me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2580,"I believe that I am here to inspire with encouragement and positivity. Part of the reason I want to become a physical therapist is to help motivate those who may be in a difficult position in their lives. Someone coming back from injury, or dealing with a disorder I feel needs someone to stand by them and not only help them physically but also mentally. Even outside of the physical therapy realm, I feel that my energy can help those who need it. I am looking forward to learning more about the human body and using that information to inspire others"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2581,"Kyle Le	PHYS 102 Professor Michelle Chong Why am I here?The reason why I am in this course is because I’m sort of interested in physics because I took one course back in high school and it kind of made me intrigued. Another reason is that this course along with PHYS 101 is my pre-req for a major I am trying to get into which would be Kinesiology. Now the reason why I am here in life is for many reasons. Such as being born into this world is already a reason. I am here to meet new people and care for my friends and family, I am here to go to college and get a degree in order to find a good career. I am here to look after my family, to create a family of my own, and to cherish memories that have been and are being created. I am here for the laughter, the joy, the thrills, even the sadness and sorrow. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2582,"“Why am I here”, I am here because I want to fulfill my goals and find out what I am supposed to do in my life. Currently, I am unaware of what I actually want to do, but I am currently experimenting and figuring out things that I want to do and how I want to live my life. Ever since I was younger I always wanted to play basketball , just because it runs down my family. I still feel like that is my purpose and absolute goal throughout my life but I just take life one day at a time. Hopefully, I can fulfill this goal and make my younger self proud."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2583,"I am here because this is a stepping stone to where I want to be. I always knew where my interests lied and what my end goal was, but I think the struggle was incorporating the two. I had taken one physics class before, and I enjoyed it so much. The labs were so fun and the content wasn’t too hard to understand because it was related to the labs. As much as I wish we could be hands on with this course, I am excited to see where the class takes me. I have high hopes that the things I learn in this class, as well as all my other ones I’ve taken in college, will enhance the work I do in my career. I am a firm believer that I am able to bring the tools I learn in school and carry them throughout my life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2584,"Why am I here? I am here in this class specifically to learn physics. I am here to be able to get to my major which is Kinesiology, this is a required class. This class will hopefully teach me a lot to be able to understand how things work. I am here in order to graduate from San Francisco State University in four years to then go into a physical therapy school which is something that I know will be tough but I know I will be okay and succeed. I am here in college to make my parents proud because I know they went through a lot to get me here and I'm proud to be the first in my family to be in college. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2585,"Why am I here? Well the short answer is to fill out my GE requirements for my major. The more detailed answer would be as a way to help build upon my major which is kinesiology. I have always found physics interesting but i just have not taken the class yet so i am glad i have done it now.  I knew that we would be discussing physics in class which is one of the main focuses of kinesiology depending on what field you are going into like physical therapy. Physics is a good way to understand how multiple things in life work like weather patterns, animals, gravity etc. Would i love to do experiments in person, yes, but at least I get to see them within simulations online. I am looking forward to gaining more knowledge about life itself from this class. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2586,I believe that I am here to make others happy. I usually make other people’s days by making them laugh and have fun. I try to push everyone to be their best whether that’s pushing them at the gym or making sure that they’re on top of their studies. I help my friends whenever they’re sad and we all help each other achieve our goals. Making others feel better makes me feel good. Helping others achieve their goals and what they set out to do is a good achievement because it means that people are happy instead of working on a job that they aren’t happy about.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2587,"I am here because this class is a core class for my major. Despite this, I have never taken a physics course, so not only am I nervous but I am also very curious about the material I will learn throughout this semester. I am excited to apply my new knowledge to real life situations, especially in my future occupation (hopefully becoming a Physical Therapist or Athletic Trainer) In a more broad sense, I believe I am here by chance and that I have an opportunity to find my own purpose as I keep moving forward in life. I am unsure if I have one or multiple purpose, so I am taking each day at a time. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2588,"Ruby Parish  Reflection #1  “Why am I here?” I am here in San Francisco because this is where my parents decided to make a family and have roots so that they could stay with my mother’s parents. I am here in this class because I am excited to work towards an important goal in life like college, and I feel like I can achieve more than I have ever believed. I am here at home with my family and pets because after I was kicked out of the dorms at the beginning of the pandemic, my mom wanted me to help out and take care of my grandparents, and because she wasn’t ready for me to leave home yet. After a couple of months, I realized that I was not ready to leave either. This future is not what I expected for myself but it is fulfilling everyday!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2589,"I grew up a Catholic believing in a spiritual means of the purpose of why we are here. You are lectured to be good and to others in this world. As I got older, you get to know more about everything. How we got here and the world around changed itself to the beauty it is over millions of years is what is learned in science classes up to high school. I used to worry if my purpose here is to make something meaningful and to live up to the standards around me. But, I think as I’ve gotten older and have insight into the concepts of the world anyone could put meaning into what they do in life. It’s really just to live with what you can and don’t get too distraught about what you don’t have. Do what you can do that makes you the most content and satisfied in this life. Pursue what you want to do, and grow with others who want to do the same."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2590,"“Why am I here?” To answer this question, the main reason why I am here is to finish the remaining prerequisites I need in order to continue with obtaining a degree in Kinesiology . I initially wanted to major in Nursing, but I changed my mind three years into college, and I am currently trying to earn a degree in Kinesiology since it’ s the only major I have most of my prerequisites completed. With all honesty , I am not sure how I’ll utilize my degree or if I’ll even use it. However , I just want to graduate college since I’ve already put four years of my life into it, and so my family in the Philippines can’t say anything bad to me since I graduated. I do know that I want to get into real estate after graduating, and we’ll see where I’ll be from there. Hoping this plan of mine will be successful, and maybe, I’ll eventually end up in the medical field in the near future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2591,"I think that's a very good question to ask, and honestly, I don't know what to really say. I think the obvious answer would be my mom had me and boom that's why I am here. Without her, would I even be here? But anyway I think I'm here because I fought many sperms cells to the death of course and won. Yes, my small brain won against many others that could have replaced me. I also think I'm here alive for certain things, for example to thrift, to decorate my house (sadly my parents lack taste), to dye my hair the most I can, and to simply make others feel better. I've come to the conclusion I love helping others with their problems/feelings, BUT I do not like when others help me. Maybe explains why I want to go into criminal justice, especially to be a detective, so I can help others solve crimes. I also think I'm here to be the funny friend because man can I be funny lol. But I think that's pretty much why I am here in this cruel world we call home. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2592,"Why am I here, it is a very hard question to think about since there is no right or wrong answer regarding this question.  My sophomore year, my geometry teacher kept mentioning physics. She was giving us mini-lessons and it was interesting. Asking about why I am here, the way I think about this question there are multiple ways to answer this. If you are asking, why I am in this class now, I need this class to graduate, and it is needed for Kinesiology. It is part of my general education requirements.  Also, to learn about physics since I have never taken a physics class. It is interesting to learn about physics and how it works. I have heard things about physics but never fully taken a class and fully learn about it. I am here mainly because of the major I wanted and check this requirement off the listen. I needed to take a lab for physics, and it seemed interesting so why not take it."
