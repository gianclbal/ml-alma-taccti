I have a tendency to keep to myself under times of stress and don’t speak out as much as I know I could, but I do have family and friends that I know are always there and around for me whenever I need to talk or vent to someone about something or any situation. In school, I have educational resources such as my professors, peers and classmates, and advisors/TAs to help me succeed in case I ever need help. At school, I also am aware that there are mental health resources that I can utilize if I ever need to seek help as well. All of these resources are great to have because with the stresses of school, many things in life happen as well and it can get overwhelming at times, so it is good to know that I have people that will be there to help me get through those times."

My family pushes me to succeed and attain my degree. My friends can react to me and are even some of my fellow classmates. Another resource that I would say supports me is my professors because they do not only want me to succeed but are often times very understanding that life happens and sometimes things get in the way.

Then there is also government support, financial aid, low income housing, and medical. "

The thing is that I have to be one willing to go out of my way in order to gain access to resources outside of my easily accessible ones, those being my family, friends, teachers, and the internet. To be frank I've never really seeked help outside of these resources since I usually can manage on my own and if I can't these most likely will help me solve the problems that I may have with whatever I am dealing with. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2565,There are many resources disposable to students everywhere but the one used the most is the internet. The internet allows students to be able to find all types of resources at the touch of a button. You are able to use many and any sources online that includes all over the world research and sources.

As a college student, I am surrounded by books, articles, journals, etc. to help further my knowledge in the field that I find interest in. When writing reports or doing labs, I rely on equipment, the internet, my notes, and so much more. One of the biggest resources that we have access to is each other. Our peers and professors will take us further than anything else. When there are questions about an assignment or need help studying for an upcoming test, these are the people that we will need contact with to find success in the class. This is our best resource because these are people that are experiencing the same journey as you and at the same time, so they will understand it better than anyone else. In recent years, our greatest resource has been the internet. It is the most accessible as we can find everything we need at just a few clicks away. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2593,I don't usually have a support system helps me a lot. I do most of my homework by myself. My family rarely asks me how school is going. I just try to focus on one thing at a time. It's pretty hard managing school with work but I think I'm doing a pretty good job at it. People at work have been asking me how school is going but I can’t really tell them how it really is going but I knew that I lost some time of motivation to focus on school but just with that questions if motivates me enough to try and finish my work.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2587,"I have resources available to me that include friends, family, healthcare, food resources, and stable income. I am privileged to have the resources that I do so it’s important that I use them to help those who have difficulty accessing their own. It’s a shame that accessibility to basic needs is difficult for a large population of people in America, and government action needs to happen in order to reverse this trend. I am very thankful for my resources because they keep me safe, healthy, sane, and alive. They are my security and my support system both literally and figuratively. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2591,"I have a few resources that I have to support, but they are the most important. My family is the main support I have, they have supported me through a lot of my struggles. Especially now during college, although I am first gen meaning my parents have little to no clue on how to navigate through college themselves but they are doing their best to help me. They make sure I stay on top of all my classes, do my hw, stay motivated, and everything needed to succeed in life. I also have my friends to support me, they also help me with the things my family helps me with but they also support me in life. For example, when things get hard, they help me go through it, or when I'm sad they help. Although the school has a lot of support groups, I don't think I have ever used them. I get nervous so probably that's why. I wish to use the resources in the future. "

I think some of the resources that support me are maybe like my family. Even though they’re not like a thing or like maybe the ideal definition of a “resource”, but I feel like that or maybe my relationship with them could be considered a resource maybe. I think that another resource could be like their supportiveness and their advice because it helps me out a lot. Their ability to support me in whatever I do makes life a lot easier and gives me more motivation to complete whatever is was that I wanted to complete. I don’t think of resources as like an item but I feel like those things that I just listed could be a good example or a good answer to the question."

In this case, the financial support I got from my family is necessary. And the suggestions I got from my parents are from their experience or their circles'. Those suggestions are real, realistic. Mostly they make me feel worried about my current situation and my future, but I have to admit that they are helpful. I seldom get emotional or mental support from my family, but money and suggestions are also useful, I appreciate them. However, I'm an emotional rich person, in both the good way and the bad way, which means emotional support is very important for me. I got my nerve and emotion supported by my friends and psychological knowledge. As a college student, I also need the support from the school. The library, labs, professors, and advisors.

I used the machines and materials in the lab to finish several my works, and I really enjoyed the progress."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2568,"Resources are important in supporting one's ideas and relations. Therefore, it’s important to identify one's resources and how one can use them when required. Personal resources are important aspects that help improve everyday activities since they help create awareness of the world around me. I will discuss the resources I have and how they can support me. One of my most crucial personal resources is concentration. Concentration is helpful since it enables faster comprehension, assists in studying, helps focus on a job, task, or goal, and ensures I can ignore irrelevant and meaningless thoughts. Also, concentration ensures I am disciplined because I must pay attention to people, objects, and details. 	Also, I have a great sense of imagination. Imagination is an important life skill since it aids in the development of emotional, social, physical, creative, and problem-solving skills. Also, imagination acts as a powerful brain-booster since it improves creativity and makes one think in ways that are not standard for people. Also, it is important to find solutions to various challenges by creating scenarios that create solutions to the problems in the most effective way. To identify different issues that require problem-solving, I have developed observation skills as a personal resource. Observation helps in establishing areas I am required to work on personal growth. I am determined to obtain knowledge, and therefore I have pursued different education levels to increase my knowledge in different areas. Knowledge is a crucial life skill that sharpens my reasoning and problem-solving skills. A strong foundation of knowledge helps the brain function effectively and smoothly. Knowledge has become one of my most important personal resources since it has made me smarter by giving me the power to solve problems more easily."

Also, watching my favorite youtuber, Korean dramas, and BTS are another reason that helps me get through stressful times and to practice self-care. In order to stay healthy, I try to workout on a regular basis, which I noticed that my stamina has improved and my mood is a lot better. I think as long as I continue with these healthy ways, focus in school, and have some free time for myself I will be able to get through what I want to achieve, especially with the help and support of my loved ones and the community around me. Academically speaking, there are multiple clubs and other programs that will guide and prepare me for my future goals. Looking into that will allow some ease in my busy schedule, and provide less stress during my college life. I just want to get through college in a healthy and smooth manner, rather than continuously stressed about certain things due to the lack of support from school or loved ones. Therefore, resources that support me will always be essential in my success."

Pay attention to what others suggest, because they're an outside perspective, and based on what advice is being given you can choose whether or not to listen and apply to your own life."
