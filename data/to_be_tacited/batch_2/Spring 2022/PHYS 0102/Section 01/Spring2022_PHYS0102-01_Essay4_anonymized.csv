2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2570,"My family values have been engraved in mind since a young age. It was simple, word hard to be successful in the future. My parents always reminded me that school was an important factor of life and was necessary for a kid like me to try my best. Throughout my whole life I went through school with the mindset to get into college. So when it came time to actually apply for college I was quite nervous. I was unsure of my future, not knowing whether I would even get accepted to the colleges of my choice. Luckily I got accepted to SFSU, the school that I had desired. Now that I am a college student I will continue to try my best to provide myself with opportunities in the future. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2579,"When I think of the values of my family and community I think of first and foremost my husband my kids and what I value things such as commitment, honesty and always moving forward to try and do the best that I can so I can positively effect the people in the community and my family as they do for me. I think that reminding myself what is truly important and keeping these values in mind help push me in a direction to complete tasks and motivate me to push through obstacles in my educational journey. I also think having support is essential in navigating my way through college."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2575,"The values of my community and my family have helped me navigate through college in that it helped me discover what career path I wanted to pursue as well as influenced my work ethic. In my family, my mom has been a nurse for more than 20 years. She immigrated from the Philippines and left her family with my dad to build a new and better life for me and my brothers. Her story really showed me how far you can get with hard work and perseverance, and motivated me to succeed in my schoolwork. It was through her that I also knew what direction I wanted to go in with my career. During high school, she helped me get involved with hospital volunteering and with my previous jobs as a caregiver and nurse assistant, I knew I wanted to help people in some way for a living. With a kinesiology degree, I hope to become either a physical or occupational therapist, either working in an acute care hospital working with patients or working with clients at an outpatient clinic. With these future career goals in mind, I hope to improve other people’s quality of living through helping them regain their confidence in moving about in their everyday lives again."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2590,"The values of my family helped me navigate through college since they were always supportive of what I want to do. One thing that really stuck out to me during my life in college is when they allowed me to study abroad in South Korea. If I hadn't received the support my family provided me, I would have never experienced something that happens once in a lifetime. It made me realize how I am independently, how I am able to live by myself even when far from family. Also, the fact that they didn't push me to continue to pursue nursing took a huge weight off my shoulders. Realizing that I did not want to continue with it, I changed my major to Kinesiology. Now, I know what I want to do after I graduate from college."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2567,"Erica Labagh Phys 102 6 April 2022 ""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" The values of my family that has helped me through college are that they are hardworking people who don't give up and make the best of every situation. My family has been through some challenging and trying times but have never let that get the best of them, they figure out a way to get it done and push through so they can achieve what they set their minds to do. This has helped me in college because when exams or classes get tough I have learned through my family to keep trying and not give up. They have also taught me to put my best foot forward and to try my hardest in all of my classes. The values that my family has taught and shown me are to never give up, put in the most ef fort that you can, and have fun while doing it. My family has shown me that in life you have to have fun while you are doing what you do because life is too short to not enjoy every moment."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2591,"Hmm, this is a good question that I've never really thought about. I think when it comes to my family's value on college it's huge. No one in my family has ever made it this far, literally NO ONE, so for me to be the first, I am honored and amazed. The values we keep as a family that has helped me through college are: always ask for help whether it's about a class/HW/anything, never be afraid to speak up, always be friendly to everyone you meet, never be disrespectful, ALWAYS do hw, and most importantly never give up. My family has many more values but these touch on the basics. I think each one is equally important and have similar aspects to one another. I think the most important one that has helped me through college has to be never giving up. There were so many times when I wanted to give up because of how stressful a class can be. I would wanna just drop the class and worry about taking that class for next semester or choosing another that would fill in for that required portion. Instead of giving up, I would remind myself of the most important value of my family, NEVER GIVE UP. I went ahead and try to finish the classes that were stressing me out as best as I could. If I didn't then I'll just retry, there are no victories without failures first. "

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2577,"Throughout my life, I have been a part of many communities and I'm thankful to each and every single one because I was able to attain some sort of knowledge from each. Whether it'd be creation stories, morals you should operate off of, or experiencing a bit of culture. There's always something that was new for me and translated into how I view the outside world around me. Personally, I would say from these experiences that I'm more open-minded, which helps me critically think in an efficient manner and corresponds with my school overall. I'm able to analyze documents and gather key information that can be used as references or evidence. In addition, from my previous school communities, I was able to acquire grammar and writing skills, which were developed as time progressed. In doing so, writing assignments related to academics, became something of ease."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2592,"Values of my community or my family helped me navigate through college is dedication. Dedication because my family helps me stay motivated throughout tough times. Since the pandemic, my motivation has been low. My family is very supportive when it comes to my education. They are my biggest supporters.  My friends are very helpful also. They are always telling me I got it. They are always believing in my strength and motivated me to be a better person. They are my inspiration to achieve my goals and dreams in life. My values have not changed since but it is hard these days to stay focused. College is different from high school. Even though my college experience isn't like others since I mainly have online classes but I do hope I get to have one normal college year experience. My family pushes me every day to do work hard and try out new things. Don't be afraid to try out new things. Working hard can be pay off in the future and help me achieve whatever goals I have created or wanted. Balancing school and work isnt the easiest but my family and my friends help me. It helped me beomce more wise and motivated. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2584,"The values of my Community and family have helped me navigate through college by teaching me that no matter how hard things get we can still keep pushing forward. To focus on school but not stress so much over things because I still need to have a life outside school, to live while I'm young. I am still hardworking no mater what life throws at me specially since school isn't easy. My parents have always told me to work hard and not give up which I've done my best since I am the first person in my family to go to college and I want to show them that I can do even more and have a good job and a good life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2586,My mom has always told me the importance of finishing school and making sure that I stay on top of all my work. She always wanted me to do well in school so that I could get a good job. This made me make sure that I stayed on top of my work and made sure to take classes that I would need. my friends also help me out because they make sure that I'm not taking any unnecessary classes and making sure that I stay motivated by giving me encouraging words and advice. I also have friends who are older than me who are like mentors guiding me in the right path
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2566,"The community I grew up on is not as united, so I do not know how they feel about morals and values. On the other hand, my family believes strongly about values and standards. Not giving up and being a trustworthy individual is what gets me through college when it gets hard."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2578,"Some of my core values that are important to me have been obtained throughout my life and my experiences. I try to take in the things that I feel are important to me and apply them to my life and live by those values. They have been obtained mainly through my family and a few from the Army and life. To be honest and true to yourself is a huge one because it keeps me accountable for my actions in my life. The people who are in my life deserve to get the best out of me, to work hard and be a good man and be one that holds the important things close to him. This keeps me going everyday to just keep moving forward. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2585,"How I would say the values of my community helped me navigate through college is that sense of togetherness from friends and family. Especially through having been online for a very long time my friends who are also in college and some family members can relate to me in the sense of the struggles that come with being in that situation. As for how my origins have helped me navigate through college other than having Filipino food fuel my brain, my favorite being Adobo, I know I always have the support of my family to keep me pushing towards my academic goals. Overall college is not an easy thing to be doing especially when you have a job or just life gets in the way but if you can feel like you are not alone that is all that matters. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2564,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college in very positive ways. Their words of encouragement and just to see how happy they are that I am pursuing a degree in something I love. I grew up in a hard-working family where all their successes were worked for and never handed to them. Moving to a country where everything was unfamiliar, and you were looked down upon. They strived to learn the ways of this country for their children, grandchildren, etc. to have everything they need. Those values got passed on to me growing up and I have applied them to my everyday life and school. I learned that if you want something bad enough, you have to go out and get it. Do whatever it takes to be successful, even if it means asking for help. Asking for help is something I do often and honestly has gotten me where I am today. My family has really provided me with the tools I needed to be a successful college student, even if they never made it there, they knew what it took."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2574,"I was born in China and have spent most of my life in China. In line with the stereotype of Chinese people, my parents indeed value education, and they expected me to get good grades in school and then to do great jobs in my work.  Contrary to my parents, I am a purposeless, unplanned, and unmotivated person. In this case, the combination of external force from my parents and my laziness allowed me to grudgingly carry out my studies in an ""I don't want to, but I don't care, so I'll do it"" attitude. I like to study, but I don't like school. I have thought about get school out of my life for countless times, but I just thought. I feel like it's out of a sense of responsibility, a sense of ""I started, I'm done."" There is also the traditional concept of ""education is very important"" and the accompanying anxiety that ""if you don't study, you can't have a good job, and without a good job, you can't have a good life"". These are the top three things from my family and community that have kept me going in school."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2576,"Whenever I walk through my community my body gets attracted by the murals in balmy alley. I grew up with this art and whenever I get the chance I like to come back to it, to remind me to stay strong. All of these murals tell a story of the power people of color hold. You can see stories of migration, poverty, resilience, and it is just a reminder of how strong my community is. These murals give me strength to pursue my dreams and lift my head whenever I am faced with challenges. Life in general is not easy but to me it's important to stay connected to my community and my family, because it is them that give me strength to succeed in life "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2583,"Ever since I was a child, my parents instilled the importance of education to my siblings and me. Being first-generation college students definitely has its added pressure on top of the stress that college already consists of, however, it fills me with pride. The values of my parents stem from what they lacked in their life and their childhood. They didn't grow up with much in the Philippines, yet still gave us the best life here in America. I use their struggles and the hope they put in me as a driving force to be the best I can be. As the youngest of three, I feel a lot of pressure to finish college, especially because my older siblings did so already, but it motivates me. Technically there is pressure, but it is something that wasn't put on me by my family. I think I am harder on myself than my family is. This creates a nice balance because they are constant reminders of reassurance. When they see me stressed, they calm me down. My parents want to see me succeed just as much as I want to see myself succeed, but the way they support me shows that I am very capable of doing so and that they will stand beside me the whole way through. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2571,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""The values of my family have helped me navigate through college as most of my family are self made millionaires, and their parents before them self made. I say this as each person is raised as an individual and we only get what we earn. None of us get anything handed down, funding for school, housing or pretty much anything. We are all out of the house by 18. With this being said this has helped me navigate trough college as I have seen what it takes to be wealthy, and I knew for how I wanted to obtain it, it was going to take a higher education. I did not have the money for college so I chose the military to help me pay for it, and to also use it as a stepping stone for many other things. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2582,"The overall values of my family allow me to understand how important college is, and allow me to push through my classes. Although it has been a harder year for me, I remember that some of them did not have the opportunity that I have right now, and that I need to keep pushing and end the semester the way that I want. Lately, I have been very behind in a good amount of my classes, I have been lacking a lot of motivation to do my work and everything which is not good at all. I have pretty much dug myself in a hole and it’s going to take a lot of energy and hard work to get myself back to the position that I want to get myself into. I’m hoping that my teachers will be able to work with me and allow me to get back into that position as well. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2593,Well not a lot of people have helped me navigate with college. I basically had to do everything myself since I am the first one in my family to be in a four year college. I’ve been trying to get help from my community to help me understand everything on what I am supposed to do but it has been hard to find the right support system. All I know is that I have to finish college in order to be great in life and I live by the motto everyday and I’m trying my best. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2572,My family values are actually something that i find very important. I guess the way that my parents have raised me has shown me that all is possible with hard work. I am someone who finds family super important so I guess in the college sense i have a lot of friends who are also family oriented.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2569,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""My community helped me navigate through college by helping me gain knowledge about how important it is to finish school. As well as the benefits that I can get once I finish college. My family helped me a lot going through college. My mom got her AA degree and my dad only went to college for a few semesters so they show me every day how hard they work to try and provide for me and my siblings. My dad is a manual labor worker so he is starting to get older so he has a lot more pain in his body than he should. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,1,2587,"My family has helped me so much in the process of going to college. They helped me with registration as well as moving into the dorms. They also have constantly offered their support to me, even from 300+ miles away. In my family, we value communication, honesty, and strength. I’ve carried these with me from youth to adulthood, which has helped me greatly in college. I try to conduct everything I do with honesty. I try to constantly communicate with others I’m order to avoid misunderstandings. I try to have strength throughout each semester in order to graduate."
