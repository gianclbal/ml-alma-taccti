2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2631,"Reflection #1  I want to learn about experimental methods and some basic physics. I think many important scientific achievements are related to physics, such as Newton's laws of motion, force, these are the basic courses of physics, and I want to do more exploration in physics in the future. Maybe I'll go for courses in electromagnetism, astronomy, etc. that require knowledge about fundamental physics. I really think physics is amazing, involving many life phenomena, especially some classical physical experiments, the determination of the gravitational constant, because the gravitational force is often small, and it is very difficult to obtain high-precision values. Through this course, I can understand the steps done in past experiments, and learn some physical quantities, which is very meaningful to me, because these physical quantities can be related to life, such as speed, position, these are all moments in life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2632,"To answer the question, ‚ÄúWhy am I here?‚Äù I feel like it's such a broad question, it‚Äô s almost difficult knowing where to start. I would say that I‚Äôm here because of my parents who decided to have me after my three older brothers. I believe that birth is a very hard process to go through which has a high chance of complications happening, but every birth is dif ferent and in a way can be a miracle. When I think of this question, I like to think that the reason I‚Äôm here is because of luck and that the cards were in my favor . I think that there was a reason for why everyone is born and put in the place they were in for a reason. Although everyone‚Äô s situation is dif ferent, we all can be living the same lives with the same thoughts and beliefs but being your own individual person is what sets you apart from everyone."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2634,"I am taking this lab class because it is a prerequisite for a class I need to take for my major . I am also here because I am somewhat interested in the subject of physics and I really think that this subject will help me understand my major , kinesiology , more. I took a physics class my sophomore year and I vaguely remember some concepts, but overall I remember that class being somewhat interesting. I hope to learn a lot in this class, be interested in what I am learning, and try to apply these concepts to what I will be majoring in."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2635,I am here in this class not only because it is one of my requirements but because I want to   expand my knowledge. Growing up in a community with less opportunities and resources I   tried my best in my education in order to gain a higher education. I am now in university and   even though sometimes it is hard I always try my best to keep on working hard and learn   new things everyday. I want to expand my knowledge to the best in this class and keep on   learning and challenging myself especially in a class that I would have never thought of   taking which is physics. This semester I am taking two physics lectures and two physics labs   which might be hard for me but I will work hard everyday In order to get good grades but not   only get good grades but also learn new things everyday in class.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2636,When life gets challanging I focus on what my lifes purpose is and that all the things in life are temporary and we should only foucs on being happy and bringing joy and peace in all peoples lives.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2637,"Reflection 1 I‚Äôm here to complete this class as a requirement for my major and I also want to learn more about physics. In this course, we explore physics phenomena and learn how physics works through digital simulations. Labs are a way for us to work with other students to test, explore, and learn about the different physics topics that include: forces, motion, sound, circuits, and radiation. We learn the scientific method, concepts of hypothesis and experimental controls, and why all of these are essential to the physics that we are learning in class this semester . This should also help us greatly in applying critical thinking in the laboratory and recognize whether results and conclusions make sense. Physics shows us how the object and motion in our daily life function and the purpose behind why they work."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2638,This class is accompanied by another physics class I am taking. They are both for my General Education credits. I am currently at San Francisco State University to get my bachelor's degree in English education. Everything that I do now will allow me to become a teacher in the future. I am here to get a good grade so I can be accepted into on year master's program so I can become a teacher faster. My effort today is what is setting me up for the future. I am here to make my family proud because I am a first-generation college student and I want to give myself the best opportunities I can. My parents didn‚Äôt have many opportunities so I have to do the best I can to give myself and my family the most opportunities we can get. My career as a teacher will pave the way for my family to see all of the potential we have. I am here to open doors.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2639,"I am here because I want to continue my path of my future career. Physics is necessary for my major and because I enjoy learning. Ever since high school, I wanted to pursue a career in Kinesiology and I think physics and Kines are very similar and correlate to each other. I think physics should be a subject everybody should learn because it relates to so much of our everyday lives such as driving, running, nature, etc. another reason why I‚Äôm here is because I generally like learning about physics and the many interesting ways science can be manipulated. Since I like watching fighting anime, there are lots of physics that go into character databases and when watching, they do mention concepts of physics, so that‚Äôs why I enjoy physics. Overall, if this is my last time learning about physics, then I really enjoyed learning and hopefully remember most of the subfields of physics."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2640,"‚ÄúWhy am I here?‚Äù is a question I ask myself all the time. Sometimes I have and answer and sometimes I  don‚Äôt. Reality is I am still trying to figure it out. Starting off with the now I am here at school to trying to  take classes so I can get one step closer  to my degree. Why am I here in this school in this city? I wanted  to be here because I wanted to experience the northern California lifestyle. I wanted see the difference  between the bay area and southern California since this state is so big. Why am I he re in this state? I‚Äôm  here because I love this state after traveling, visiting, and living in others I always come back to  California. I love the lifestyle, the people, and the energy that can be experienced here. This question  continues in so many ways. M y best answer is to live, to learn, and to experience everything the world  has to offer."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2641,"Why am I here? I‚Äôm here in this physicis course because it is a requirement for my major. I‚Äôm not particularly preferential to solving math problems so this course is going to be a challenge for me. I have hope though because I know physics can be applied to our everydays lives to explain the world around us which will add another level of interest to the subject for me and possibly make it easier to learn. If I think about why I‚Äôm here at SFSU, I think back to why I chose this school. One of the main reasons was for the cross country and track teams. After I camer on an official visit to come meet the coaches and team members, I knew I wanted to come here and be apart of something special like a collegiate running team. I also knew this school offered my major of interest, Kinesiology and have applied recently and hope to know if I got into the program very shortly. I‚Äôm grateful to be here at SFSU and to get to have such an awesome experience so far!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2642,It was a difficult decision when applying to college to decide what I wanted to study and what kind of profession I wanted to work as. I was trying to choose between engineering and physical therapy. I am here so that I can study and graduate college with a bachelor's degree in kinesiology. This is one of the necessary classes that I have to take in order to graduate with my major. I plan to do some volunteering or internships that are in the fields of physical therapy to gain some experience before applying to physical therapy school. I then will go on to become certified as a physical therapist and work in rehabilitation at a hospital or rehabilitation center. It‚Äôs going to be difficult to get into physical therapy school and it will also be difficult but I think it is a great profession to be helping people that have received injuries.
