2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2632,"PHYS LAB Reflection #4 ""How have the values of my community or my family (of the origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" As I get older, I realize the immense impact my community and family have on my work ethic while navigating through college. Growing up in a hardworking household, I had to adapt to a mindset of always trying my best and putting my best foot forward. I look at it as a lifestyle that would get me far in life. Specifically while navigating through college, I notice how I picked up my parent‚Äôs work ethics where they displayed to be an example of how to reach for your successes through time and dedication. I find it to be very useful for my future and I can apply what they taught me through the obstacles I encounter during college. As for my community, I see their motivation to always reach for their goals and I implement that kind of mindset into everything I do. Being in college means I will encounter new experiences and people while also experiencing problems and issues but through motivation and resilience I know I can rely on my community to be there by my side. Their big impact on me is displayed through my thoughts and actions."

The values I was exposed to as a child growing up, especially the ones I learned from my immediate family and parents are a large factor in what has helped me be successful in college. I‚Äôm luckier than most to say that both of my parents are college-educated and that I have always had their support on my road to college. Specific values pertaining to my success in college that I learned from my parents is the value of pursuing higher education to secure a fulfilling life career. Both of my parents were also educators and that has also influenced my value of education."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2638,"I am a first-generation college student and with that, there can be a big feeling of not knowing what to do. The college application process is not only long but is complicated. If you have not experienced it before you will be lost. My parents have guided me to resources that are geared toward first-generation minorities who want to pursue college. AVID was a big part of my college application experience and without my parents encouraging me I would not be where I am today. Being the first generation is a big deal because it means I have set the standard for my family that they didn't get the opportunity to do. I am going to be able to provide them with a better life and give a better life to the younger generation in my family. My community continues to encourage me to break barriers. I intend to get my Master's degree and I will be a part of the 7% of Latinas that hold a Master's degree."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2639,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" Through my first two years in college, my family has been very important in guiding myself to my future. Over these past couple years, there were many times where I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with online learning or events that mentally took a toll on me. The most important part of my time in college has been my family motivating me and pushing me to be the best I could. Whenever my family and those who care about me support me when I‚Äôm down, I tend to work harder and willing to do the best I can to succeed in my vision. Whenever there is somebody thinking of you, that‚Äôs where your home is and we can always find that hidden will to always try hard and the guts to never give up."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2640,"Reflection 4 I have learned values through my family and community which helped me become the person I am today. These values have helped me navigate through where I am in college by letting me explore the vast options available. Integrity has gotten me far by always trying to do good even when no one is looking. This may be difficult at times because sometimes I wonder if no one has done anything then why should I and there is the one where if I don‚Äôt do anything maybe someone else will. However, the whole point of integrity is, to be honest, and have strong morals. Another value that I still follow to this day is being kind to others. I know that everyone has their own thing that they are going through and showing kindness to other is a way to help them."

My father had always instilled in me that a man is only as good as his word.  This means that you have to honest and never lie.  It means that when you say something or promise to do a certain task or action, that you do what you said you were going to do.  My father also said:  ‚ÄúDo a job right the Ô¨Årst time or don‚Äôt do it at all.‚Äù  What he means is that strive to get the job done right or correctly, basically, don‚Äôt half-ass it.  Don‚Äôt just try half way, try fulling and get it done RIGHT.  A hard work ethic has also been instilled in me from my family and friends.  To work hard and diligently gives many rewards and can be gratifying.  ‚ÄòNo pain no gain‚Äô as they say.  I really like this one:  ‚ÄòWork hard so you can play harder‚Äô.  Yep, if you work hard you get rewarded with the time, energy, and money to play hard in leisure, i.e. travel, go dancing, read a book, or just enjoy a free day to do nothing.  It feels good to do a honest day of work	 .   	 These values of honesty and a hard work ethic, is what allowed me to pursue an A average with honors in college and allowed me to become a Bachelors of Arts scholar."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2634,"The values of my community/family have helped guide me through my whole schooling career from the experiences they‚Äôve been through. I am the youngest person in my family , and many of my aunts, uncles, and cousins have been or are currently attending college. They have given me some really good advice on school and college in the past years and I am super grateful for them.

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2644,"What I do when life gets challenging is to keep doing what I‚Äôm doing, but it won‚Äôt be in the path I wanted to go in. It‚Äôll be slower because of my challenges but that won‚Äôt bring me down at all. Ever since my adult life has started, at the age of 17 for me because that‚Äôs when I started working and having to pay bills, life has been challenging. Every day is something new, but I don‚Äôt let it get in the way of what I want to do. It might slow down me down because I have things to face but I will still continue going forward. Here and there I will get help but only for support or as a second opinion. I like to do stuff my way when it comes to me, which is why I don‚Äôt let anything that‚Äôs get thrown at me, like life, bring me down."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2635,"Usually when life gets challenging I try to think of a plan on how to resolve the problems that   I have. I also try to take some time to myself. First I calm down by listening to music, taking   naps or going on a walk to take my mind off of my problems for a minute and not be   completely stressed. I procrastinate a lot so doing work on time and getting things done is   hard for me but I try my best to get my work done. If life is still challenging I talk to my family   or friends and ask them for advice and support in whatever I am having trouble with. Overall   I think those are the steps I take when I am struggling, I try not to give up easily."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2637,"Physic 102 Reflection #3 When life get challenging I always remind myself that it will change and take any fail or hardship as a learning experience. I take these hardships as a turning point and do things better to overcome the hardship I encountered in the semester. Another thing that I would do is take care of myself, ignoring your mental and physical health causes my ability to study in college to diminish. A way to improve mental health is to find some time to relax yourself during these college hardships. Everyday after I finish my classes I go to the library to chill and read my favorite books on my laptop. Everyday I would head to stonestown to get lunch so that I could better focus on listening to the lecture in class. Starving yourself is not the way to go, since you won‚Äôt have the energy to focus in class. After every class, if I had a question on the material I would ask my teacher a question that I acquired about the material. For example this class, I would ask the instructor after we finish the lab to clear up any confusion that I would have."
