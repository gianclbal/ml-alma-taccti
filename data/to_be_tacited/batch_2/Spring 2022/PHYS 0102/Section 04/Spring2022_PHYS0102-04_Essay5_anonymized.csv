2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2641,"Reflection #5 ""What resources do I have to support me?"" Resources I have to support me include my family, friends, coaches, professors, advisors, and many more. I think for school-wise support, being a part of a sports team here at SFSU has helped tremendously because I have a support system I can rely on. I have coaches I can get advice from, I have quality friends with the same goals as myself, and I also have access to athletic advisors that check in on us and make sure we are on the right track."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2639,"""What resources do I have to support me?"" A resource that I have to support me is my family. No matter where we are, how much we are struggling, family is always there to support us. The whole point of family is to always be there for one another. Another resource I have is my classmates and teachers. This is because classmates are in the same boat as I am and we go through the same amount of work day by day. Moreover, we always have teachers and professors that support us, it is their job to help educate students in a respectful way and they are essentially the masters at knowing course work. Outside of the education standpoint, I think the best resource besides family is yourself. I think setting goals and believing in ourselves motivates us and gets us through anything, anytime we feel uninspired, we always have our goals to support us and that will of fire to overcome adversity."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2632,"Reflection #5 ""What resources do I have to support me?"" When I think of this question, I think of all the support systems I am lucky to have in my life. I first think of my parents who are able to support me in terms of paying for my tuition which I’m aware is very lucky to be saying, I realize everyone’s situation is different. In this way, I am able to have resources for school like my laptop which I use on a daily basis to get me through school online and offline. I basically take my laptop everywhere to help me input all the information I need to contribute to my future as a P.T. While doing school online too, I’m fortunate enough to be living in a dorm on campus which helps me get to class easily and efficiently whenever I have in-person classes. These resources are definitely things that I won’t take for granted, every day I am reminded how fortunate I am to embrace the people and resources I have to support me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2642,Some resources that I have to support me for school work are the internet and the library databases. They are tools that I use often when conducting research for any homework or projects I am working on for my classes. It’s also a very convenient tool to have so that I can just find what I need whenever I need it. I also have a phone that I can use to contact other classmates and teachers for my classes. Contacting classmates is useful for finding out and sharing information that we discussed in class if someone was not present. I can also contact professors to let them know if I will be late or will miss class or if I have any questions about any class work that I am struggling with. I also have a computer which is mainly where I do a lot of my classwork since nearly all of it is being turned in digitally.

I have good book resources to support me in doing some research. I think these are very helpful to help me improve my experimental awareness and understanding.

I have a partner that supports me in my educational endeavors.  The Federal Pell Grant is very helpful in paying for college.  Other things I have to support me is my friends who are encouraging and my family that is very supportive in my education.  There are great resources here at SF State like the Career Services and Leadership Development department.  They help with making resumés and C.V.’s or with the interview process.  There are numerous advisors that greatly help in my scholarly issues and help to help in giving academic advising not just for what class to take but real tutoring in helping edit and put together a term paper.  The tutor, Julia Cover, is amazing and has been a great help in my organizing a revision to my GWAR term paper for our 690 class.  The food cards from the University for the cafeteria is very awesome and useful.  The library probably is the greatest resource, allowing us plenty of study space that is safe, clean, and very useful."
