2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2635,My goals are to understand every lesson in this class and represent that through my work as    well as become a physical therapist. My goals are also to actually understand the work we are    given and not only do the work to pass the class. This class is one of the requirements so it is    helping me fulfill my credits. This class also helps me understand physics clearly by using lab    explorations that help me visualize how everything works. This class is also helping me stay    focused on this subject which is important for my major . Meanwhile taking this class i    actually understand the work we are being given and don‚Äô t just do the work for credit.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2642,I am in this class to help me learn about physics and how it would be applied to the real world. The labs help me gain the experience that I need to further increase and understand my knowledge of physics and to apply what I learn in my other physics class. I am here taking this class to further pursue my goal of becoming a physical therapist and to hopefully graduate college on time. This class is not only one of my required classes but can give me some knowledge that I might need in the future when pursuing a higher education in my field of study. This class is also a good class to take in general because I did not have any prior knowledge of physics before taking this class and this class has so far made it very easy for me to understand the different concepts of physics.

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2644,"My goals are to be able to become a physical therapist for a football team and to travel. Even if I don‚Äôt end up working with a professional football team, I would be happy to join any other sport on being their physical therapist. This class will help me achieve my goals by helping me learn about physics since I will be working with movement. This class also is a pre-requisite for my major and I‚Äôll need to pass this class to continue with other classes. Hopefully I can apply this class onto my goals."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2634,My goals in general is to have a successful career as a student and graduate on time. My goal is to graduate and find a job/internship that I enjoy doing. This class is helping me achieve these goals because this class is required for my major and also fulfills a general education requirement. I also believe that this class will also help me learn and understand concepts that will be helpful to what I will be doing. I hope to learn more about the subject of physics but my goal out of this class is taking the knowledge that I‚Äôm learning about physics and relating it to the human body . I would like to learn more about how the human body moves/how it works and how physics af fects the human body and its movement.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2639,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?"" My goal as of right now is to graduate in 2024. I am planning to pursue a degree in Kinesiology and become a physical therapist. It‚Äôs always been an interest for me to work in the fitness aspect of health. I grew up watching and playing sports and had a passion for physical activity and exercise. I play a lot of basketball so I‚Äôm always physically active. I think it‚Äôs important to learn about physical health because it is a common necessity for our everyday lives. Also, it is an emerging  field of study in recent years. This physics lab is helping me because it is required for me to complete it for my degree. I also enjoy learning about physics so it‚Äôs a good situation for me. So far, this class is helping my goals by learning about motion because it‚Äôs important for sub fields of Kinesiology such as motor learning or exercise physiology."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2641,"Reflection #2 ""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?"" My goals in life are to pursue a career in Physical therapy and possibly start my own practice. I want to be my own boss and work when I want to work. I want to help people to achieve a physically fit and healthy body, and I especially am interested in helping athletes achieve their goals and helping to motivate them. I love being physically active and learning more about the human body and how to take care of it. I also like to push myself physically through intense exercise. I like running cross country and track because the training can be very mentally taxing and develops my mental strength in ways that benefit me beyond just running. Physics is just another course along my journey in becoming a physical therapist, but I also realize its importance in learning how the body moves and interacts with the world. A good understanding of physics can be beneficial to many other fields but especially in the sports medicine field. Learning how the body moves efficiently and optimally is essential to treating patients in physical therapy."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2632,"To answer the question ‚ÄúWhat are my goals?‚Äù My goals are to graduate college with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in science, specifically in Kinesiology. After that, I hope to get accepted into a good Physical Therapy program so I can complete graduate school. As I do that, I would get to have an occupation at a Physical Therapy clinic or children‚Äôs hospital so that I can achieve my goals as a pediatric physical therapist. Recently, I realized what my set goals are for the next few years, and in some way, it is a motivation for me to keep up my hard work as a student at SF State. As for the question, ‚ÄúHow is this class helping me achieve these goals?‚Äù this class is helping me complete my requirements to enroll in my major requirement classes for next semester since I‚Äôll be a third-year. Enrolling in Kinesiology courses next year is needed for my major since it would be introducing me to the field of many subfields that Kinesiology has to offer."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2637,"My goal in this class are to learn about physics since it is important for the career path that i'm choosing. Goal are getting my major, my dream job, and developing new knowledge and skills. This physics is allowing me to learn more about physics and how it plays a functioning role in the way things work. Like the previous week we got to learn about how the force of newton and movement play an interacting role with each other. Being able to take a lab is able to improve my critical thinking about how to apply the material we are learning to the problem we come across. The group function is a good way to prepare me for the further where I have to work with fellow team members. I believe that post college life that I will use everything I learn from this class in my job and also in anything I will do in my daily life. Learning how movement are affected by the difference forces in physics can help with better completing task and other objectives."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2645,"My goal is to get a better understanding of how things work in the world and universe.  This class is helping me in discovering my goal to understand, by showing me the ins and outs of how things work in the physical world.  By learning the differing forces, systems, concepts, philosophies and theories of physic I will have a more well rounded knowledge that can help in many ways.  I am taking this class basically just for the knowledge of it and knowledge for knowledge sake.  I Ô¨Ånd it very interesting how complex the world is and Ô¨Ånd it totally amazing how such things in the universe can be deÔ¨Åned, explained, and understood.  If I was a science major this class would really help in understanding that science major more.  As all science is correlated, physics is what I feel is a basic knowledge that need to be understood to fully understand those other sciences.  Its like physics is the underlining foundation to science."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2640,"Reflection #2   ""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""   I am still trying to figure what my goals are, but I do know that I want to finish school. In order to finish  school for my kinesiology major this class is a requirement for me to take and pass. This class is helping  me achieve my goal by helping me unders tand how physics is applied in our daily lives. It goes through  applied theories and application to help get a better understanding on why it is important. It gives us  new ways to look at how things work and gives us ways to change it. By learning and unde rstanding  fundamentals of physics it helps me see things in a different perspective allowing change on how to  doing things. Physics gives us tools in the medical field to helps us understand more about the human  body, medicine, and technologies. My goals m ay continue to change, but as long as it is to continue to  grow then it is fine."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,2638,"Why am I here,  is a loaded question. It can be about anything. I am here on this earth because my parent decided to hook up one night. I am in this class because I need a Lab requirement. I am at this school to get away from my parents who decided to hook up one night and ended up having me. And I am now an adult making my own decisions and I have decided to enroll at this school and I decided to take this class. In the end, this all goes back to my parents, but ultimately these choices are nothing but my own. I also decided to show up to class today, which is a thought I have very often with all of my classes. I also decided to be attentive in class. which is something I don‚Äôt decide to do often. Usually, my head is filled with other ideas or problems I am having at the moment, and sitting in class is just the place to process what I am thinking. But today I am here in this class because I decided to be for my own good."
