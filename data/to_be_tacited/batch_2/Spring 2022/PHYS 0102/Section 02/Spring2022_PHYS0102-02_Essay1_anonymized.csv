2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2594,"Emerita L. Vandana PHYS 102 February 9th,2021 Reflection: Why am I here? I am in physics 102 because It is a requirement with my major Kinesiology . With that being said I am a little nervous about this class because I do not like numbers, or conceptual mathematics because it is one of my weaknesses, But I am excited to learn and see what I can use from this in my future career path. So far it has been okay and not so frustrating, I do like that we do discuss with our group members and are able to help eachother out, it makes me absorb the information a little bit better . I’m also here to maybe find a like in physics considering it does with some sciences, and I like some science classes like chemistry , and Biology . So I’m hoping from my knowledge about those things will helo me in this class. I think this class will allow me to be more open minded to certain things and be useful in my daily life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2595,"Mitiana Williams Ms. Vandana Kaushik PHYS 102.02 02/09/2022 “Why Am I Here?” In all honestly, I am in this solely because I wanted one more credit on my transcript for this semester to add up to 16 credits for this semester. Since I am in the class, Iwant to be able to learn as much from it as I can to not waste the money I am putting into it. I hope to learn the fundamentals of college physics that I may not have learned in my high school physics course. I also hope to gain the skills of group working in this class since it is going to be based around group work labs. Growing my group work skills will be very beneficial for my life as a college student and in the career field. I hope to be able to rely on others in group projects that are more than me doing all the work and not collaborating. I hope to experience a collaborative group setting to grow and spring off of for my future growth."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2596,"I am here in Physics 102 lab class because I need the class. It was recommended that I take this class on my degree planner . I am majoring in Kinesiology and Physics 101 and 102 are some of the courses I need to take before I can take any upper division courses. I am currently taking Physics 101 right now so taking 101 and 102 together will be easier for me. I wished the lab class was in person because I like doing labs. I also get to meet new people and make new friends. I haven’t taken any in person classes in over 2 years. My last day of in person classes was on March 13, 2020. It was my second semester at City College of San Francisco. I am glad that I have some in person classes at San Francisco State University this semester . I can’t wait to meet new people and make new friends."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2597,"Ramil Rodriguez Junior PHYS 102-02 2/9/22 Reflection #1 The intent for enrolling into PHYS 102-02 was to fulfill a prerequisite for one of my Kinesiology classes. I do see the importance in taking a lab because it tests an individual’ s understanding and applies the lessons to real life. Oftentimes, the concepts being taught and applied to the real world are conveyed through words and images. But, labs provide students the opportunity to see these concepts happening with their very own eyes. Despite the virtual setting, some of the importance of labs that I have mentioned earlier are still upheld. However , the various concepts of physics fascinates me because of its application to physical activities and it’ s approach to better understand how the world works. I am currently taking Anatomical Kinesiology , in which a few physics concepts are applied to human movement. This class has further piqued my interest in physics and hope to learn more on how physics applies to human movement. I hope to learn how physics can improve athletic performance."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2598,"Nataly Cauich Physics 102-02 2/12/2022 Reflection #1 I honestly do not know why I'm here, but I guess God has something to do with it and wants me to live life. But if I were to be the one in charge of why I am here today then I would say because of my parents. I know my parents have done everything in their power to give me so many opportunities to succeed in a place where everything is possible. I decided to go to college because of them, they never got the chance to attend college because of certain responsibilities they had at a young age. Knowing that I’m the first in my family to attend college makes me a bit anxious because I do not want to fail in whatever I put my mind to since I don't want to disappoint my parents. I know they have really high expectations when it comes to me because my younger sisters look up to me. But truly I don’t really know if I can live up to those high expectations, I’m navigating the world of college alone because they have no knowledge of what I have to go through everyday. But I hope I can make them proud."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2599,I am honestly here just to finish a requirement for my major . I don't really like this kind of science mainly because of math. I took the lecture last semester but I didn’ t really enjoy it because it just seemed boring. Hopefully the lab is more interesting. I am here and I am open to new knowledge and who knows I might actually enjoy it. School had been really terrible since covid happened. The student inside me has died and I feel like I'm just skating by . I want to enjoy it but I am just over it. Hopefully when it is back in person I will enjoy it. I want to actually learn something in college and online has made it hard.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2600,"Wow, what a question! I'm here because I want to be a teacher and passing this class/being here at this moment will get me one step closer. On a grander scale, I could also just answer, “who knows?”. Does anyone know why we are here? We just sort of exist one day and from that point on we are trying to figure it out and the answer changes constantly as you grow and begin to understand yourself more thoroughly. I can not say that believe that we all have one purpose and that is what we are meant to do with our lives, I more so believe that we are here to experience life itself in whatever way we choose, almost like one of those choose your story games where you just pick random outcomes and see where they take you. So, I'm in the class because in the future I hope to become a teacher and this is a general education requirement but why I'm on earth? I have no clue!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2601,"“Why am I here?” I believe that I'm here to be able to spread my love to other people and bring some light to the lives of the people around me. This is a tough question because it seems so simple yet it's hard to come up with an answer on why we all are here. I think I'm also here to continue my family’s legacy and to achieve something that they weren't able to which is to pursue an education and make a career with it. My parents immigrated from Mexico with nothing and I know all they want for their children is to be happy and healthy, no matter what they were doing because they would love them unconditionally anyways. This pushes me to be the best version of myself, it pushes me to be a good person and to be able to spread positivity. Like I said it's a hard question to answer but I think I'm here to be successful."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2602,"Hamidh Abdul Gafoor PHYS-112-02 Vandana Ganesan Kaushik 9 February 2022   Reflection #1 ""Why am I here?""  This class is part of my GE Area B3: Laboratory Science requirement. A minimum of 1 unit is required. Moreover, I believe lab work will give me a deeper understanding of physics concepts (for the most part) by enabling me to apply them to real-world situations. It will help me think critically about physics theory. Having a clear understanding of the subject will be very helpful to me. By the end of the course, I will be able to distinguish between theory and application. I can improve my approach to physics by working in a physical laboratory. Getting a glimpse into what it is to be a scientist occurs in this Physics lab course, where the students learn what it is like to be a researcher. Physics laboratories are places where experiments are conducted in Physics. I will be able to learn course concepts through laboratory classes and explore the methods used by scientists in the field of study. Laboratories offer a unique set of challenges and opportunities compared to classrooms."
