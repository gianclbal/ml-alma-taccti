2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2600,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" I honestly grew up in a community that did not value education, most of the people in my neighborhood had probably never stepped foot onto a college campus and a good chunk of them also probably never considered that it was even an option for them. With this in mind, I was lucky enough to go to schools that pushed for education and I took them seriously. You could say that I learned from my community the things I did not want for myself and then I learned at school how to take opportunities and shape the life that I wanted for myself. I am the first person in my family to go to college so navigating it for me means that I am making decisions for a future, better version of myself rather than making unsound decisions with no clear idea of what my future will look like."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2604,"All throughout my life in school, my parents as well as people outside my immediate family have made it clear to me that school should always be put first before anything else. That mindset has been with me since high school started because that is where our education became more serious, and benefitted us towards our future. Following along after high school, that same mindset has been with me through these past few years since I started college. As hard as college classes can get, I always like to think of how beneficial this education is to me and to my future. Everything that is accomplished from now and the next few years will be because I kept the mindset of having to put my studies first. By putting my education first, I have also managed to learn how to balance everything else in my life like my family and friends, and especially myself."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2603,"My values from my family provided me with understanding of how to approach life in a way to enjoy the process. As many people who are important to me, there are some that gave me honesty of what I can do better to improve. When it comes through college years, I’ve learned to adapt to different situations and take the initiative in what my strengths and weaknesses are. To be where I am at right now, sometimes mistakes are part of the process that makes me rethink about my values at times where I’m struggling with solutions, but I think about my mom at times when it comes to getting myself together and finish what I should be doing as a student. The values of my family and peers who have been supportive of me brings a certain side of me when it comes to transitioning to fixing my behavior and maturity when life gets complicated"

The community that has impacted me the most in navigating through college is my martial arts community . In both boxing and jiu-jitsu, I would normally train with people who are about five to twenty years older than me. Despite this age gap, I was able to develop many friendships and a mentor mentee relationship. This community also impacted my decision in majoring in Kinesiology . In addition, this community has implemented various values to help me in college, both academically and mentally . An example would be school above training. As much as they would love to have me train, getting my education is much more important to attain a bright future. One of my instructors told me that the mats will always be there waiting for me, even if I took a break. However , above academics is my mental health. It is important to pace yourself or else you may end up burnt out. I struggled with my mental health during my second year in SF State, which in turn af fected my academics. This led to decisions, such as what class to drop or who to talk to about my depression. Overall, sometimes you need to sacrifice time for school, but it is also important to put yourself first."

The values of my local area and family have helped me all through school because of the help they have accommodated me since the primary day I began my freshman semester. I would agree that that local area has been significantly more strongly contrasted with my family aspect because being the first child to go to a college that isn't local area, it was nevertheless is difficult to cause them to comprehend the things I do since my two senior sisters did nothing like that, they were never dynamic in extracurriculars, so they were simply used to a way of life of working, going to class and returning home. I wasn't like that. Furthermore, I was generally involved in leadership roles and sports, and this carried on in college. The point when I began joining associations in school, I feel like that is the point at which my life changed totally. The way of life I was so acclimated with came from a shielded form to a friendly and social adaptation, and I was unable to thank college enough for transforming me into the individual I am today. The assets I made continue to help me right up 'til today, and the companions I've met have changed into better individuals through the veritable connections we have made together. Overall, I doubt I would be near the man I am today without the family and local area that I have."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2596,"My family has always wanted me to go to college. Ever since I was a kid, everyone in my family told me to go to college. They would say that college is important because it can help you get a higher paying job. Almost everyone in my family that went to college became pretty successful. That has made me want to finish college. My cousins also tell me that in college, you will meet a lot of people which can lead to future connections. Connections are important for your future because it can lead to jobs. You can also make many new friends. I think I will also tell my kids in the future what my parents and other family members told me. I won’t be as strict on them, but I will just tell them about it. If they don’t want to go to college and have other plans, I will support whatever they want to do."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2598,"Nataly Cauich Physics 102-02 4/6/2022 Reflection #4 My family has always been there for me. They have helped me in so many ways to achieve higher education. If it had not been for them I probably would have gone to a community college instead of a CSU. Although my parents have no idea about college because they never got the opportunity to attend, they always tell me that if I have questions to ask people on campus. The way they raised me was to achieve something better than they could not. This is why I push through college,but also for my younger sisters. My parents want them to see that anything is possible if you are determined and willing to follow your dreams. Both my parents and my two sisters push me to do better and achieve something so great. It has been hard living at home and attending college because I am surrounded by  my family 24/7 when I wanted a bit more independence. But I do not think I would have thrived without them because they show me support and they motivate me everyday."
