PHYS LAB March 9th 2021 Reflection When life gets challenging personally I like to pause my task or try do something that doesn’ t stress me out like doodling,Painting, coloring. Just recreational activities that allows my mind,body and soul to relax and unload especially when you so much on your plate you have  a tendency to for get personally to how to take care of yourself and allow yourself sometimes to unwind. Sometimes I also do Words of af firmations. For example, saying “ I am beautiful, I am smart, I will achieve my goals.”  those words not only encourage me but motivate me to keep going and remember the importance of why im still in college/living. I also like to physically take care of myself so like doing face masks at home or doing my hair (I have long hair So I get lazy to maintain it), or doing my make up and putting on a nice outfit. Its just fun and I feel much better ."

As an example, I am aware that things will change, hardships are inevitable, so I choose to find the positive in everything, there are no failures, only lessons, and God has a better plan for me. In times of difficulty, it is extremely important to keep in mind that things won't stay the same forever. I tell myself when things are tough not to worry because nothing stays the same. A difficult time, a challenge, a failure, or defeat are essential parts of life. This is the common process I need to go through regardless of what I hope to accomplish in life. It is just the way things are. As a challenge, a test from God, and a stepping stone towards success, I take it on. From a positive perspective, I approach the problem with an open heart and welcome frustrations. It is obvious to me that every difficulty and problem is an opportunity for growth and learning. A failure is merely an opportunity for growth and learning. No matter what, as long as I use the failure as feedback and move forward, it is okay whether I cannot find the opportunity hidden within the problem. Learning something is the only thing that counts as success. I only fail when I choose to accept it and call it to quit. In hard times, it's good to remember that God may have better plans for me. The point I'm making is not to give up or quit, rather, to choose to believe that God has something even better for me in store for me. Possibly God wants to teach me something that will forever change the course of my life. I might be being tested by God to see what my true desire is. Maybe God is showing me a better way to achieve what I want. It's just a matter of believing that there will be something better."

It stresses me out too much. After a while, I will sit down and think about why life is so challenging. I think about what I can do to make it less challenging. If I am struggling to find a solution to make my life less challenging, I will ask a friend, and listen to what they have to say . I will listen to their advice and see if it will make my life less challenging. If their advice works, I will be happy . I will then find something else in my life that’ s challenging and try to work on that. I will repeat the same steps over and over . I will also try to help my friends and family with their challenging lives."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2597,"Ramil Rodriguez Junior PHYS 102-02 3/9/22 Reflection #3 When life gets challenging, I tell myself to stop what I am doing and breathe. Based on my experience with stress, it is easy to get swept up with what seems to be a chaotic scenario. This can potentially lead to me for getting about something important for school or in my personal life. I would also remind myself about the importance of pacing and to give myself more credit on what I have accomplished. In addition, I tell myself that there is no need for me to always get a perfect grade, and that it is natural for life to have its ups and downs. During this pause, I would recollect the details of the trial(s) I am facing and write out a plan on how I should approach this scenario.  This method has helped me to stay diligent with my assignments at school and things that  I need to do in my daily life. I make sure to spread things out rather than working non stop until I complete all of my tasks."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2601,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" What I do when life gets challenging is first to express my feelings to someone I care about, in this instance, I always go to my mother because I trust her the most with anything I need help with. I also like to meditate if I'm feeling stressed out with things that are going on with my life. In terms of school, I try to just get all the work done and if I need to, I also contact my job to schedule me fewer hours so I'm able to tackle challenging points in my education. I really think my family helps me get through challenging times and I appreciate them immensely for it, life gets really challenging, and if I'm able to get help through it, it makes it a lot better."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2598,"Nataly Cauich 3/9/2022 Physics 102-02 Reflection #3 Whenever life gets challenging I usually try to take time for myself. I avoid talking to people since I do not want them knowing my business. But I also listen to music and try to distract myself with other things whenever that certain thing or situation is making my life challenging. When I listen to music I feel like I am part of a different world, and I forget what is making my life hard. I also try watching shows or doing different activities such as puzzles since they help me get my mind off the situation. Like I mentioned before, I do not like sharing my business with others, or generally telling them what is bothering me because I would like to deal with it myself. Although talking to others would mean that they would help me out with some great advice, I just sometimes have trust issues and it makes me afraid that they will go ahead and tell others my problems or what I am going through."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2604,"Throughout our lives, it is bound to happen that we run into something challenging. Whether it be personal or in school, both are still a challenge. I have gone through some tough times academically while the pandemic was still new , and everything was changing for all students. While I was going through these dif ficult times I tried my best to remind myself that I am not alone in the situation, and that there are probably other people going through the same thing. I also kept myself around people that uplifted my mood and kept me up. I surrounded myself with all good things to keep me pushing and motivated. Having myself in a good area helps clear my mind and helps me push through the challenging moments."
