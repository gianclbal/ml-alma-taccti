2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2598,"Nataly Cauich 4/20/2022 Physics Lab 101-02 Reflection #5 Some resources that I have that can support me financially are my parents, friends, family and the faculty on campus. But when it comes to school stuff I guess I can say the professors and my friends from that class. Both of these are great because they are the ones that are learning about this subject and may know or understand certain things I do not. When it comes to my personal life, I can get support from my parents since they know a lot more about how to navigate the adult world. I know they will be there to guide me and give me good life information that can be useful, maybe not at this exact moment but hopefully in the future. I know they will always be there to support me because I am their first daughter and they will do anything for me but besides that it is their job as parents to guide me to have a successful future of my own."

I have the experiences of those older than me who have had their own personal experiences in university who can aid me in how to approach my studies. I additionally have physical resources such as textbooks, laptops, etc. that assist me in my studies at university for each of my individual subjects that will eventually help me reach my goal of gaining a job in the field of work that I will enjoy by completing my degree. Also, sometimes I find that some classes are a breeze while others might not be so easy. Whether it is the material or how the material is presented, some classes may be more difficult than others. Instead of struggling over a difficult class, I consider seeking the help of a tutor. I Find out if SFSU campus offers tutoring in the subject or look for tutoring classes that help with test-taking or reading complicated material in general. Some tutoring will be offered as one-on-one while others might be done in group sessions."

PHYS 102 Laboratory April 20th, 2022 Reflection: The resources that I am able to have in an Academic Setting are my instructors of fice hours, The library , and my fellow peers. In an outside setting, I have my family ,c lose friends, and an outlets that are able to ease my mind when i'm not stressed like taking a walk or coloring. These different types of resources are very valuable to me to help me succeed in my path. These resources are of fered to help me, so I am going to use them when things get tough and or when I have doubt about anything. These resources are also very reliable and dependable. It’ s a system that most people I believe should value more than just resources. Resources that I am able to then have a reason to continue to keep going to where I need to be."

When it came to the last few weeks, I was struggling to keep up due to a loss of my grandma who passed away a few weeks ago. I have the TRIO support program as part of my school resource needed to be able to overcome the circumstances. In my friend group, some of my friends support me through spending time with one another and establish close relationships towards what we want to accomplish in our lives respectively. I do want to say that I’ve struggled with a lot of anxiety and not coming to class because of anxiety kicking in when I come to class virtually or in-person, but throughout the years, I am trying to be better in my own work and make sure I keep up with everything from school to work situations."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2600,"""What resources do I have to support me?"" This is honestly a difficult question because I definitely feel alone in my academic and personal struggles from time to time. For me personally, I am lucky enough to have a DPRC specialist and accommodations that allow me to ask for support more confidently when I need it. With that being said, regardless of my accommodations, I am sure that I can reach out to my instructor or my academic advisors for help in what ever ways I need. I also know that I have classmates that are willing to support me and help answer any questions I might have. I am also lucky enough to have the loved ones that are willing to support me in any way I might need, as long as I am able to state my needs, there are always people willing to help me. I have an abundance of recourses for support, I just think that It is a matter of willingness to reach out."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2597,"Ramil Rodriguez Junior PHYS 102-02 4/20/22 Reflection #5 Resources that come to mind are my gym, my family , Metro, dance instructors and much more. A majority of these resources provide me with some emotional support, but also act as an advisor to help me navigate through life and college. In my gym, the people there value both physical and mental health. I have lost track  of how many times they were willing to lend an ear and do what they can to help me overcome my darkest moments. They taught me to put myself first, and to accept who I am. This applies to my family as well. While my family tries to support me financially , I try my best to rely on my financial aid to help me throughout the semester . Metro has made the hugest of impacts when I started college. They provide advice on what classes to take, and I get an advisor whom I can see regularly . This helped make the transition from high school to college more smooth for me. I am currently an alumni in the program, but their doors are still open if I need additional help. The majority of people whom I interact with in these groups are older than me. People who have already graduated college, married, and/or have children. As an older brother , it is nice to have mentors who can guide me, rather than trying to navigate on my own."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2604,"Ever since high school I have always had my parents supporting me. They made enough money to lend my siblings and I pocket money to bring to school and be able to buy our own food there. During senior year is when my parents and I realized the money they make together would not be able to pay of f my college tuition and fees. Luckily my high school was able to educate us students about our future into college and financial aid. My high school set up a kind of school night dedicated to help students and parents sign up for financial aid. Therefore for my years attending here at SF State, I have been supported by having financial aid to help pay for tuition and the other fees that come along with it. But recently I have not been able to sign up for financial aid, which came to my parents supporting me on their own."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2596,"I think that I have a decent amount of resources that support me. My family and close friends are always supporters of mine. I feel like every time I need some kind of support, either my close friends or some family members are there to help me out. When they need support, I am also there to help them out. Without my family and close friends, I don’ t even know who I would be. It would be really hard without any of those people. I think I would still have some support, just not as much. My family and close friends are always there for emotional support. They care about me. They are there when I’m feeling down. They are there to keep me company . When I have something in my mind I just need to tell someone, those are the people I would tell. I tell these people because I trust them."
