2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2594,"Emerita L. Vandana Reflection: My goals in this course are to get a better understanding of the basics of physics and develop strategic skills when answering the questions, or doing the activities in these labs. This class is helping me achieve these goals as it asses my ability to understand and try new solutions in each lab. For example, in this past week’ s lab, we learned about acceleration through the simulation activity online, This help me understand better what acceleration controls/alternates the position or velocity portion of the character . With the simulation I was observing the motions and numbers were being either changed or stopped at the rate of the character simulation. So far in the course, this has helped me find solutions to the errors, and or Figure it out on my own and trying to progress my learning through this class. As well as using my teammate skills to help my peers out as much as possible if they’re struggling as well. It allows my communication skills to get better ."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2600,"In general, my goal is to be able to learn ideas and express those ideas to others. In order to do this, I need to ensure that I have a thorough understanding of the topics at hand first, and I think that this class is helping me reach my goal by teaching me skills such as communicating my ideas. I never feel that I have a hard time understanding topics, but group work has always been an area of reluctance because of the anxiety surrounding my inability to adequately express my ideas and this class has taught me that it is ok to think out loud and figure things out together. Mistakes are ok, showing that you might be unsure is also ok. But as long as you are trying then it is likely that you are learning and someone else could even be learning from you, although you are not directly “teaching them."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2596,"A few of my goals for school this year are to pass all my classes with a B or higher , and to stop doing everything at the last minute. So far , I have passed most of my classes with at least a B or higher . In the classes where I had lower than a B, I passed but it was a C, which I’m not satisfied with. This was also when the pandemic happened. Everything became online. I had some trouble adjusting to online classes. I never liked online classes. I liked in-person classes. I liked having to get up and go to school, sitting in a classroom where I get to talk to other students. I want to stop procrastinating. When I procrastinate, the work is never the best. I just try to do everything so I can turn it in. If I don’ t procrastinate as much, I won’ t be so stressed out. I would have more time to do other things on the day that the assignment is due."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2603,"Reflection #2   My goa ls are to gra duate with a bachelor’s degree in Kinesiology and to w ork for sports -related therapy  in the  future. This class is helping me a chieve these goals is by staying active and keeping my self in check  to take full accountability  to w hat I need to finish regarding to schoo l, work, and p ersonal life. I am on a  mission to finish the repeated classes that I ’ve failed on because of the requirements I’ve needed to take  those classes and gra duate. Physics would be a factor in my mind due to working with people based on  the human development  and how the human  body functions relating to bio mechanics.  As I’m learning  through this course, it ’s been helping me reflect on the mistakes I’ve made the last time I took this class .  Although I ’ve been working in dividually, it ’s another reflection towards how I can work on a lab without  any setbacks in mind to  finish the ta sk."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2597,"Ramil Rodriguez Junior PHYS 102-02 2/23/22 Reflection #2 My goal in regards to this class is to pass, which in turn will fulfill a prerequisite for one of my Kinesiology classes. However , this is not the only goal I have for this class. My other goal is to understand the relationship between Kinesiology and Physics. I have often heard terms such as force, friction, and weight used to describe an athlete’ s performance. There have been cases where a person was having knee problems because their legs are having a dif ficult time supporting them during a workout. A solution that was proposed was performing certain exercises in a pool to lessen the load on the knees. Recently , I have learned that the muscular system acts as the force that allows people to perform various exercises. As someone who strives to become a personal trainer and a physical therapist, I hope to understand and explain to my client the reason why they need to make certain adjustments to their form and what caused their injury during training."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2599,"My goal is to finish out my degree, I have honestly lost my love for learning so hopefully this class helps it come back. This class required me to graduate but so far it has not been so bad. My goal beyond school is to be a well educated person that is understanding of all kinds of people and backgrounds and I feel like school has helped me see and meet many people from dif ferent environments so I am grateful for that. I only wish school taught us more about things we would actually need in life. Like I still do not know how to do taxes. My last goal is to be successful so I can live out most of my life happy and stress free."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2602,"Hamidh Abdul Gafoor PHYS-102-02 23 February 2022 Reflection #2  ""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?"" I have several personal goals that can relate to professional skills, life skills, or relationship skills. During this academic year, I plan to take an elective course outside my comfort zone. I would like to master specialization in Computer Science such as learning programming languages. Setting a goal to improve or learn specific skills helps me focus on the exact skills I might require earning a job after graduation. Also, I want to achieve top grades to attract better job offers.  For example, some of the most prestigious companies only hire students who graduate at the top of their class to maximize their talent pool and competitive advantage in the market. Then I need to develop a strong professional network. The connections may provide job opportunities or recommendations for future job prospects. Lastly, I have to find an internship in Computer Science. Setting a goal to gain an internship is a great way to establish a career path and explore local companies.  	This class is helping me to achieve my goals as follows. I am learning a time management technique. I am dividing my daily activities into four separate quadrants according to their urgency and importance. This way I can leave out the things I do not need to do urgently."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2604,"My goals as of right now during my school years, is to be moved from Pre-Kinesiology into just Kinesiology . For the past two years that I have been attending SFSU I have been working on my prerequisite classes, as well as my GE classes, to get into the Kinesiology program here at SF State. Another one of my goals is to be able to pick up and learn new things during my time studying. By taking this class, it has been able to help me reach these two goals that I have. This Physics Lab is helping me reach my goal for Kinesiology because this is considered as one of my prerequisites for my major . After completing this class with a passing grade, I will be able to move on to the next prerequisite of my major . As for my second goal of picking up new things and learning, physics is something very new to me. I have never taken a physics class in my years of school, and taking this class right now has actually been really interesting."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2598,"Nataly Cauich Physics 102-02 2/23/2022 Reflection #2 My goals are to graduate on time. Obviously being a first generation student I want to be able to achieve something that my ancestors and my grandparents and parents couldn’t. I feel like they are achieving this dream of attending college through me and I always keep that in mind and in my heart, that I shouldn't only be doing this for them but also for myself so when I look back I’ll be able to say I did that. This class will help me achieve my goals by getting one step closer to my degree because I do need this class for my major. But also I’ll be able to apply what I learn in this class to my life in one way or another. I’d also be able to help my younger sisters with their school work if they are taking a physics class. Again I just feel like this class will help me better understand the world through a physics lens that will help me guide others with this information so they are able to succeed as well."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,2,2601,"What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?"" My goals are to strive in my classes and turn in the most high-quality work I can. On a bigger spectrum, I want to be a lot healthier which is something I've been wanting to practice. My goal is to be the healthiest version of myself and through this, I have been trying to work out more consistently and eat a lot better . Another goal of mine is to be more mentally healthy not just physically and I'm trying to achieve this by a lot of meditation and doing a lot of self-care which doesn't always involve Beauty care I mean it is more of listening to music and doing yoga kind of care I think it really helps and I've been seeing a big dif ference in my mental health since then. But on an education level I believe that this class is helping me achieve my goals because I'm also trying to participate more in my classes and in my breakout rooms because all my classes are online it's hard for me sometimes to make friends and to be more social so this class is testing that by doing group Labs every week"
