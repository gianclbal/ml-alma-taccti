2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2028,"When air is compressed quickly and doesn't have time to have the energy dissipate into the surrounding environment. That state where the gas trapped inside, heavily compressed, and very hot, can be used to ignite things. Fire typically needs 3 things to burn and those things are 1. Oxygen, 2. Heat, and 3. Fuel, of which the piston with compressed air has 2 of. If fuel is injected into the chamber and the temperature is high enough the fuel will begin to burn. This is the basic premise of a diesel engine as well as an analog form of firestarter called a ""fire piston""."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1966,"One question I have is whether or not all types of waves that we have gone over can be detrimental as an earthquake? And are the waves we have gone over earthquake waves?       In the first example we did as a class, we had two seismic waves (one being a Rayleigh wave and another being labeled as ""earthquake"") heading to a point B. we were able to calculate which wave would arrive first. In this example the earthquake arrived first at location B. Next was the Rayleigh wave. Due to my knowledge of earthquakes, often the second round of waves is more harmful than the first. Therefore to answer my question I think that the Rayleigh waves will do more damage at location B than the earthquake.      Given the examples of waves on a string, I do think that all of the waves and formula we have covered apply to calculating earthquakes. For example, the way I think about it is the top of the earth (where the earthquake waves are reaching their amplitude) can be represented by a string. When you send a pulse through this string, you create a wave! Hence, when the tectonic plates shifts slightly and by enough force to send a pulse, it cause a a wave to be sent over the earths top layer. This formula for calculating the distance, velocity, and acceleration, are much the same as those ion a sting. The only discrepancies would be air resistance, material of the earth, and possible structures, that is where more complex calculations need to be done.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,3030,"Question: How does fluid mechanics relate to your life? Fluid mechanics related to my life because I grew up playing basketball. To play basketball you need a ball with air in it. In order to get air in the ball, we use air pumps. Air pumps are literally just a basic piston that pushes air into the ball. Concepts surrounding fluid mechanics include Pascal’s Law, Archimedes Principle, and Bernoulli’s equation. Pascal’s Law is discussed in several sections throughout Chapter 14 titled “Fluid Mechanics” in our textbook. Fluid is used to describe liquids and gasses. The textbook’s definition of Pascal’s Law is as follows: “Pascal’s law states that when pressure is applied to an enclosed fluid, the pressure is transmitted undiminished to every point in the fluid and to every point on the walls of the container.” When we use our bodies to push down on the piston of a pump, we are forcing fluid from the piston chamber into the basketball. As an expression, Pascal’s Law is described as being equal to pressure plus density times depth times force of gravity. It can also be described as being equal to force divided by area. The text describes Archimedes Principle as “the magnitude of the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.” As it relates to basketball, the amount of air pumped into the piston chamber should equal the amount of air entering the basketball. Bernoulli’s equation represents how “The sum of the pressure, kinetic energy per unit volume, and gravitational potential energy per unit volume has the same value at all points along a streamline for an ideal fluid.”"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1853,"What is the difference between damped and undamped oscillators?An oscillator can produce a sine curve or non-sine curve waveforms. Oscillators are basically categorized into two groups; sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal oscillators. Oscillators generated by sinusoidal oscillators can be classified by damped and undamped oscillations. A damped oscillation is an electric oscillation whose amplitude decreases with time due to the losses inherent in the electrical system. Basically means an oscillation that fades away with time. An example of a damped oscillation would be a swinging pendulum, where the vibrations slow down and stop over time. An undamped oscillation is when the electric system could be compensated, the amplitude of oscillation would remain constant and the oscillation would persist indefinitely against both outer disturbances and changes in the conditions. To put it simply, it's when the amplitude remains constant with time. If the oscillator produces undamped oscillations, there aren’t power losses or provisions to compensate for the power losses. An example of undamped oscillation is a spring-mounted horse with no interior restraint to resist the movement."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1873,"Recently we have discussed lenses. They are used in many everyday applications and for me in glasses. It is very important to understand how they work and how light passes through them. We looked at how most lenses are looked at as 2 surfaces that light passes through, thin lenses, without having to take into account what material is between them. We calculate the difference when light goes from the lens to air. Looking at them as thin lenses can give us a good understanding of the lens while making them simpler to understand and make calculations with. We also see lenses in many things everyday outside of glasses. Cameras, flashlights and other tools also use lenses. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1868,"Reflection #3 One of the topics that interested me in class was about seismic waves. It was in our lecture section that we had gone over it. It is interesting to me, because it has to do with earthquakes and I find that exciting. My question is which part of a earthquake is more devastating to structures, the P wave (primary wave) or S wave (secondary wave). From what I have learned the P wave weakens structures from the intense shaking, but the one that takes down those structures is the S wave. The shaking from the S wave is a little bit different from the primary wave, because the shaking can go through liquids in the soil. Which makes structures move in odd ways making it easier for the building to collapse. This was interesting, because I didn’t even know that earthquakes had two different types of waves and they act differently too. Theres an example of this type of destruction in the 1989 San Francisco earthquake. The primary wave did not take down that many buildings and structures, but the S wave did a lot of damage. It is the earthquake that took down a part of the bay bridge. So, from what have learned is that S waves are more destructive than P waves."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2025,"One concept that I initially struggled with understanding was how the energy switches between potential and kinetic energy in vertical springs. The thing that confused me was how the kinetic energy would zero out but the potential energy wouldn't always zero out, and this left me wondering, ""Why?"". This was because of the gravitational potential energy and how it would typically never reach zero. The reason for this is because of the reference point the spring was being compared to. The farther the spring was from the reference point, the larger the gravitational potential energy."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2067,"Entropy is the natural tendency of things to lose order. Left to its own devices, life will always become less structured. I find this fascinating because I can see it in daily life and I wouldn't have thought about it if it was not for this class. You can always find things breaking on there own but never resembling themselves on their own."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2004,"First Law of Thermodynamics   What is the First Law of Thermodynamics and how is it present in our life. Well, this concept is essential in our daily life in which we depend on to survive. We think about it as a system of energy that can be changed from one form to another but never created or destroyed. This change in form can be caused by either work or heat. The main equation that we use is ΔU=Q+W which includes: the internal energy in the system, heat, and work. Different states of gas are seen by drawing a PV diagram which helps us visualise the changes. On the other hand, we have 5 special cases of the First Law of Thermodynamics, all of which are: Adiabatic, Isobaric, Isothermal, constant volume, and cyclic. Examples of this concept are countless, we can think of things like car engines, eating, changing chemical energy into electrical energy and many more. I believe this concept is very interesting for me since it revolves around various changes in energy that we experience in our daily life. As a final thought those kinds of theories are a definition of our existence and how things around us function."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2043,"I remember during the entropy unit, we learned about the heat death of the universe. I feel like this provides people with a sense of dread, as it basically says the universe is doomed at a certain point. However, this could be used to motivate people to do things to make the world a better place, to prolong the ability to enjoy the world as it is. For example, the application of electric vehicles recently can definitely help to alleviate the fossil fuel crisis, as well as provide cleaner methods of transportation"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2383,"The concept I will be talking about is wave interference. According to my class notes, there are two types of interference: constructive and destructive. In order for constructive interference to occur, the scenario would require there to be two pulses, both with the same orientation, traveling towards one another. Once the crests of the two pulses align, the sum of the individual amplitudes become a new and bigger amplitude. For destructive interference to occur, the scenario would require there to also be two pulses, but instead have them be opposite orientations traveling toward one another. So, once the crests of these two pulses align, the difference between the individual amplitudes become a new and smaller amplitude. With this information, I'm curious as to how constructive interference is used in real life? After thinking about applications of this type of interference, I thought of having two different speakers playing the same exact audio at the same time. The outputted volume would be twice as loud compared to if there were only one speaker playing, assuming in this scenario that both speakers are of equal distance to you. For a real life example of destructive interference, I'm curious if noise-cancelling headphones would be an example of it? I'm not sure what the pulse of sound that cancels out the sound around the observer would be, and I doubt that they would be perfectly out of phase in order to create an amplitude of zero."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2013,"Through these past 10 weeks, I have learnt a lot about physics, a lot of different concepts and equations. Almost too many, honestly the variety of the different concepts is almost overwhelming. I've learnt about buoyancy, thermal theorems, ideal gas laws, heat and calorimetry, Thermodynamics laws, entropy, Simple Harmonic Oscillations, Forced Oscillations and Waves, and Sound Wave, and maybe even more. I feel like all won't be useful for normal everyday routes, but I believe that it will help me with my future career. I feel like any job that I go into, having this knowledge would allow me to understand what is it that I am doing at my job. "
