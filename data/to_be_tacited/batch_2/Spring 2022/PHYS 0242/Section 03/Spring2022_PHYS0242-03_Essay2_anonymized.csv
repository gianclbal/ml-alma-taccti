2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1853,"I have long and short-term goals. Some of my short-term goals are to pass this semester, learn how to high jump and jump 40ft in the triple jump and 18ft in the long jump. Some of my longer-term goals would be to buy a house, find a job I enjoy going to and become a better me. I think this class can help me with passing my classes this semester. I’m not sure if this class can help with anything else though. I think most of my goals are something that I have to work for and work on. I think this class will be great towards working toward my dream job and making money to be able to buy my dream house. I feel like the little things in life add up and make a difference in the long run. As long as I have confidence in myself I think I will be to do what I want and dream."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2004,"My goal and dream is starting up my own electrical engineering company. I am striving and  will continue on working hard to accomplish this lifelong dream. I have built up throughout my life the love for electricity and managing skills. So, starting up my own company is the perfect combination of both of my hobbies and interests. I know it is very tough and needs a lot of work, and that's why I'm in it till the end! There will be ups and downs, but I am confident that the perseverance that I carry by nature will allow me to reach my final target. As a matter of fact, this journey has already begun through my highschool years. I have already started picturing and designing the perfect company in my head and started researching and pointing out what needs to be done. This class will definitely help me reach my final destination. This is because the core of this class is learning how to solve problems efficiently in physics and also in situations that I may come across in my daily life. It made me look at things from a different perspective and angles that enhanced my thinking skills. No successful company can run without the owners having these complex thinking skills."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2383,"My goals regarding my physics classes are too simply get a better understanding as to how things work in the physical world around me, and to hopefully pass the main PHYS 240 class on top of this one with high grades and more knowledge. This class can help me achieve my goals by teaching me in a more visual and often more comprehensible manner, the concepts from the main PHYS 240 class, on top of more real-world examples of these concepts. Hopefully by simply exploring the labs and understanding the lectures prior to them, I will achieve this goal of understanding physics in a way the main class may or may not teach me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1848,My main goal is to finish up schooling and have a career in the civil engineering field. This class helps me achieve this goal through learning basic physics and mathematical concepts. This lab class actually helped solidify concepts that were gone over in our lecture class. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2025,"To be completely honest, I’m not completely sure what my goals are, but I do know that I want to be involved in some sort of engineering. As of right now, my major is Civil Engineering, but I am thinking of switching to Mechanical Engineering, or maybe even Computer Engineering. This class is important to helping me achieve my goals because whether I major in Civil, Mechanical, or Computer Engineering, I have to take this class not only for each major, but to deepen my understanding of physics, and how the world operates as a whole."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2028,"my current goals in life are to pass my classes to get my degree and to later get a job. sub goals are to stay healthy while getting my degree, both physically and mentally. I don't know if I want to go on to get a master's degree, i've heard conflicting opinions on the matter. some people say a master's degree never helped them and they got their dream job with a batchler's and others say a master's is essentially manditory for moving up the ladder."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,3029,"One of my main goals as a student is to graduate as a Mechanical Engineer here at SFSU. By being in this course it will help me understand, as well as practice the concepts of PHYS 240. By being in the lab sessions, it is a great way to see how the topics we go over in class is translated into the real world through our experiments. By passing this course it will bring me one step closer in reaching my goal while giving me more knowledge about physics and how it can be connected to the world."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,3030,"Currently, my goals are to get all A’s this semester and finish off the semester strong. I am also working on my consistency throughout the span of a semester. Often times in the past I start off strong and slowly get weaker and weaker. This semester I want to go strong all the way until my finals are complete. This class will help me with that because participating in lab every week is very engaging and it requires that I understand the concepts of our laboratories, which keeps me thinking and expanding my mind. This class is also very structured when it comes to assignments and weekly expectations and I appreciate that because it creates a foundation for me to build my schedule around. Lastly, this class helps me understand the world around me better. The study and practice of physics at its core really is just studying our four dimensional world and how each molecule interacts with another."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1868,"my goal is to become a civil engineer. I would like to be very proficient in the STEM field and physics is a big part of it.this class can help me in many ways, first id like to talk about to lecture and then the lab. with lectures we learn about all sorts of things such as thermodynamics. yes, it may not be easy to fully understand in the lecture, because we only go through explanations, formulas, calculations and drawings. it is not easy o fully comprehend what we are trying to figure out because we cannot see what we are even doing. With this class it is very hands on, we read of our objective and how to do it. then we actually do what is needed for example in this weeks lab we tried figuring out how long it would take for boiling water to get down to room temp. we can do it physically and take down calculations to fully understand how to find the objective. this will help me in my goal because I will get a better understanding on physics and how things really work around me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2013,"I don't have any solid goals for my future, but I do have some goals for the present, and this class can help me achieve these goals. Currently the only goals I have are to pass all more classes and graduate from college and get a good job that I can help support my family with. But to achieve that last goal of mine, I have to achieve that first goal, which is to pass all my classes. This class is going to help me achieve that goal by helping me review what I should be learning in my physics class and applying what I am learning in real life and seeing how it actually works. Hopefully everything that I am learning in this class will help me in the future. I hope that I can use what I am learning in class to apply it in real life situations."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2067,My main goal is to pass this physics class so I can keep on track in  college.  Passing this class will allow me to move on to more difficult  and advanced courses at SFSU and ultimately graduate from SFSU. I hope  to be challenged by the course and learn from the course. This class  will give me the tools and knowledge to move on to more difficult  classes by practicing relating difficult concepts to the real world.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1966,My goals are to become an engineer and work for a research company developing helpful macheinery for the world. This class will help obtain these goals by being able to obtain my enginerring degree and take the first steps towards grad school. This class will also help me to further develop my commnuication and collabrotion skills with my peers and colleges. As well as my networking skills by forming new relationships with my teachers and professors. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2043,"My goals for this semester are to pass my classes first of all, and to get a better understanding of my courses so that I can do well in my future classes. This course can help me achieve those goals because paying attention in this class will hopefully help my overall grade in the lab and lecture portions. Understanding this material will also come in handy when I take my future courses of Civil engineering when I need to apply what I learned in this class to something else."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1873,My goals are to have the knowledge to work in my desired field in civil engineering. For this class specifically it is to gain a better understanding of what we talk about in lecture. Through experiencing what we talk about in lecture in a lab and being able to see it really work in the real world is a great way to understand what we are talking about. Through these understandings I can continue my academics to different classes that require an understanding of what we learned in this class. The understanding of physics 3 through this class will help lead me into the higher classes that are required. It is one step to understand civil engineering and what is needed. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1936,"My goal is to get my P.h.D in either in physics or philosophy. This class is a stepping stone to me figuring out which area of study I enjoy more. So far this simester has been exhausting and I feel fairly helpless. I bit off more than i could chew and thus far I haven't had the drive and work ethic to compensate. My mental health has deteriorated resulting in the accumulation of stres across all areas of my life. But, atleast I realize that, so im trying to eat better, get rest, and get as much work done as I can. "
