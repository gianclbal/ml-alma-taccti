2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2383,"Online classes have impacted just about every aspect of my learning, with certain aspects being affected more than others. Unfortunately, there seem to be more negative effects of online learning in comparison to a normal in-person learning environment as when it's online, I'm home all the time and can be easily distracted. I've gotten better about this distraction thing since we first moved to online, though motivation always seems to be lower when online (especially during the second semester after spring break and before summer vacation). Thankfully, though, classes are back in person, so I once again feel like a real student. For self-care, I've been taking any time that I can to relax and engage myself in activities that make me happier and put myself in a state where I don't worry about school. Whether it be streaming a show/movie, playing a game with friends, or hanging out with my friends, all of these are ways I take care of myself. Some concerns I have for my learning are the seemingly never-ending work that can swamp me and cause me to get a little overwhelmed at times. This, along with the repetition that every school days feels the same doesn't really help, though it does make time fly by for better or for worse."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1966,"Online classes has been good and bad for me. I enjoyed The accidability of being able to just hop on a zoom call and learn rather than having to get ready and walk to class. As far as Slef care, I did a lot less while classes were online. I think having that time away from home has been good for me. Concerns for my learning include not holding myself accountable for all my homework and studying that needs to be done. As the semester ends, this becomes more and more prevalent. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2028,online classes are a lot less stressful in the fact that i don't need to comute to campus and wake up early in the morning to do so. There is also the matter that online classes make it harder to study as i'm not pushed to study as much
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2004,"Online classes have impacted me positively in numerous ways. It helped me be a visual and creative person. However, it impacted me negatively too by not being in a social environment and socializing with classmates. Moreover, not being able to experience the real college experience has been a tough one. On the other hand, virtual classes have been to my advantage somehow in which I'm working at my own pace. Online classes made me feel less stressed and worried. It made me stay living with my family since if I were to go to campus I had to leave my family to live near the campus. This helped me mentally and psychologically which made me the person I am today assisting me in having a great semester. With that being said, I’ve been able to set a healthy sleeping schedule and some time for sports aside from my studies. Another aspect that has been positive to me is quality time with my family; this made me come closer to them and has impacted my grades big time. In conclusion, this experience has benefited me in many ways but I’m definitely waiting for the day we could actually go back in person."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2067,"Online classes are not bad if you choose to do them because you have time to prepare. The worst part for me has been transitioning between online and in person class because of covid and other causes. I try to spend as much time as I can outside of class to balance out the amount of time we are inside on our devices. I like taking photos, going on trails, being outside in general, and playing soccer to relax."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1873,Online classes have greatly reduced the passion I have to learn. It is very difficult to stay attentive through the class while online and makes learning difficult. I have found that taking less class load while online helped me focus on the ones that I was while online. Knowing that I would be back in person later in the semester really helped me to put more effort into learning. A mix of online and in person also helps with staying involved and  getting to see people in person. Learning while online is difficult because it is hard to connect to both the material and the professor teaching it. Being in a classroom is much more useful to learning than I think I gave it credit for before going online.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2013,"Online classes has both positively and negatively impacted my learning. I don't have to worry about leaving some work at home and tests are easier, and finding the materials for class are easier to get. On the other hand, I have no idea what classes offline is like. I haven't been on campus once yet, I don't know where anything is nor do I know how classes would work. I also haven't felt like I am in college because most of my time is online, and the time when I'm on campus, there's nothing going on to make it feel like college. I'm with doing work online, but I feel like I'm not connecting with other people that I would be helping or getting help from. In all honestly, if I wasn't so close to my family and visit my grandparents every other day, I feel like I would get bored same in my room all day. For now I'm fine, but I feel in-person and online classes really depend on the professor, whether it's a good class is if the person teaching the class a is good or bad professor."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,3030,"Online classes don't affect whether I'm learning or not. Although, being in person is far more motivating than being online. I will say that a benefit to online classes is that they're typically easier to get through and allow me to have a more open schedule. The benefit to being in person is access and relationships with our professors that is not possible over Zoom. This is a major benefit. One way I practice self care is through smoking marijuana at night time. This allows me to get my mind off of school when I need to and focus on something I genuinely enjoy. This is beneficial because the daily escape or meditation (whatever you want to call it) not only gives me something to look forward to after I finish my work, the release of stress helps me to not get burnt out throughout the semester. It definitely brings balance to my life as a studying Civil Engineer. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2025,"Online classes were somewhat difficult at first, but now it’s not that bad. With online classes comes alot more time to actually do school work, along with chores and other things as well. What I’m doing for self-care is getting more sleep than I was ever able to before, because now I can wake up with less time before class starts because I don’t have to go anywhere for class. Another thing that I am doing for self-care is going on walks as well as other things as a form of exercise to make sure that I don’t worsen my health. Some concerns that I have are whether it will be easy to go back to normal classes, and will the online education have impacted any of my learning and therefore my potential success for the future.

2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1853,"This year has been very off for me because of this whole pandemic and I’m pretty sure many people can relate. The online class has been a struggle in itself. Luckly things have gone somewhat back to what it used to be so it isn't that bad. For self-care, I usually just sit on my coach and watch a movie or show, or find some other ways to relax. most of the time I'm tired so I just take naps to pass time. I know that school will be good as long as I say on top of my work. There are 2 classes I'm kind of worried about but other than that I'm pretty solid with my learning. As for my well-being, I'm just taking it day by day. I try to stay as positive and motivated as I can be. I try not to worry too much about the future and just focus on the present. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1868,"Reflection #4Online classes had impacted my life pretty drastically. It was a new way of learning, but honestly it tougher to learn online. Harder to retain information through a screen. I felt like I was not learning well enough and it showed when we go back to in person. I felt so behind on things I was supposed to know. In person helps me learn a lot better, but online classes had their benefits too. Especially when it came to mental health. Yes, online classes are a lot less stressful. We go to a commuter school my average bart rides on the daily are about 3 hours long. 3 hours of time that I can be doing homework or studying a little bit more. Online classes made it easier to find time for ourselves and also have time to get to our work and finish it on time. Rather than feeling rushed because you lost so much time already throughout your day."
