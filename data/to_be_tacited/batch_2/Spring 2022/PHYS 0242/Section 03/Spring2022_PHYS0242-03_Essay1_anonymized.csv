Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2028,as a kid i always saw people as just really advanced machines. arms? meaty servos. heart? a pump. a liver? a filter. I always believed that its possible to bridge the gap between meat suits and circuits and being a step towards full on bionic people sounds rad as hell. Aside from the cyborg street samurai future i want i always loved analog little gadgets and toys. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,3029,"I want to be in the STEM field because I've always been fascinated with the fields of science, technology, engineering. I find it interesting to see how the inner/external workings of things we see and use everyday work. Comparing new innovations with old ones is also cool to look at because it shows our progression in these fields and what improvements we have made. From what we learn from the comparisons we can see what else we can improve on modern tech which makes me excited for what the future holds. I guess I like the types of work available in this career, the thought of being an engineer where I could design or create something for the people around me can use to make life easier is something that I find satisfying. Making systems or machines more efficient and eco-friendly is also fulfilling. A bonus to this field is the salary, it will be enough to provide for myself and my future family."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,3030,"I want to go into the STEM field because learning math and science is learning how our external world works. I believe that we live in two worlds, the internal world (mind) and the external world (body, environment). I spend a lot of my time learning how my internal world works as far as what I can do to trigger certain emotions or get rid of certain emotions but when I'm studying STEM academia, I learn how matter interacts with itself and I learn how to predict certain material events. Additionally, while studying STEM is a rather rigorous activity, it will inevitably set me up for a better future. One of the main reasons that I chose Civil Engineering specifically is that I really enjoy the video game, Minecraft. Civil Engineering is kind of like Minecraft in the physical world. I love the process of visualizing an idea in my head and manifesting it into the external world. This is the process of creation and I feel that's one of our purposes during the human experience. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1868,"the reason why I want to be in the STEM field is because I want to become a civil engineer. My father back in our home country was an engineer, but he had to let go of it when he took our family to the states. the requirements from our country and the US was different and he didn't have time to go back to school, because he needed to provide for his family financially. So I am following in his foot steps and becoming an engineer myself. I use to have a different major before this but even though this is a tough major I enjoy it more than my previous one. That is the reason why I am in the STEM field and even though it added more time to my school career I do not regret anything, because I will finish with my bachelors in science. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1942,"The main reason why I am in the stem field is because of my major, my major is civil engineering which has a lot to do with science, especially the physics of everything in life. To be able to build a tower, building, bridge or any construction there is a lot of physics implied in every step along the road. For example, when building a an exit on the high way we have to measure the centipedal force of the car turning on that exit to be able to put a speed limit so that when cars are taking the turn they don’t exceed the speed limit or else the car would crash.  However, the reason why I chose this major was because I was very good in the stem field since high school. To the extent I took college level of math and physics when I was still a junior at high school. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2067,"I want to go into the stem field because I enjoy creating and designing  things. Since I was younger I have always liked working on cars and  other mechanical things such as tractors, bulldozers, lawnmowers, etc.  This got me interested in engineering and ever since majoring in  engineering has been my goal. I also simply enjoy doing almost anything  in the stem field. I enjoy being outside so I have also enjoyed being in  science and biology classes in school. I also believe it is the most  challenging field you can choose which I like because it means I will be  always learning."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2025,"Why did I choose STEM? The main reason is that I happen to really like math, it was my favorite subject growing up, partially because, for the most part, it just made sense to me. I saw that a lot of people struggle with math as a whole, while I usually found it pretty easy and straightforward. But I chose to go into civil engineering because I also really liked to build things and solve puzzles as a kid, such as legos and rubik's cubes, so engineering felt like the perfect way to be able to have fun with my work while still securing my future financially."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2383,"The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is that it is a good mix of challenging and rewarding. Once you really start to learn more and more about certain topics or methods of doing something, it becomes all the more rewarding to finally understand and apply said knowledge to something else. Some of the courses I'm taking for my major are definitely harder than others and can also make me feel a little overwhelmed sometimes, but in the end always make me feel proud of myself for overcoming these challenges to further my knowledge and practice in the broad field of engineering and STEM. These courses I've been taking all interest me, especially when able to physically collaborate with others in lab classes. With these experiences, I hope my choice of major and deciding to be in the STEM field all pay out and will hopefully make me find success in the near future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,630,"I always loved STEM. The multiple variability and its own significance in the lives of the human gives me motivation and joy to study STEM. I want to explore all aspects of the filed for the hope to find myself and recognize the cool things that might be new or more in-depth to appreciate the world I am living and my interactions with other beings. Furthermore, I am confident that my professional job will be related to STEM as I am majoring in biochemistry. The other fields of study is not less important than STEM but I believe that they connect with STEM because STEM is a collaboration of multiple fields. When people of different expertise and unique experience come together this leads to something creative and useful. I know that sometimes science might not have a clear answer or it's totally the opposite of the perceived. That's how the science or even life works. So, persistence and courage is a big characteristics that give a great opportunity for people to succeed. I want to succeed or if not just love what I do. And so far, I can say that I do like all my courses especially all the science and comp classes that I am taking my second year in college. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1966,"I want to go into the STEM field for a variety of reasons. One, is that I enjoy how fast paced the field is, constantly changing and innovating is something that I think I will never get bored/ tired of. Another reason why I choose the STEM field is because I think that understanding the way the world works (i.e. physics, math, etc.) has always been so intriguing to me that I decided to make a career out of it. Lastly, I enjoy the people in the STEM community mainly because we all share the same passions and It is resay to relate to such a large group of people. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2013,"I want to go into the STEM field because ever since I was little, I heard from my parents I should learn to become a engineer, and it just happens that engineering was a part of the STEM field. Yeah, that's right, I, along with my parents, didn't know that engineering was a part of the STEM field until a little while later in life. When I was young, I enjoyed math so I learned to my parents when it came to my career, which was in the STEM field. As I got older, I learned that being in STEM field means being a part of a community that is for the purpose of helping other people and bettering society. I want to be a part of something that is bigger than me, that's why I chose to go into the STEM field, I want to improve how everyone lives and helping other people because I want to see people enjoying life, not struggling to get through it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,3031,I went into the stem field because I want to design new performance parts for cars. Originally I was going into the business major field but that wasn't interesting to me and once I got into the STEM field I thought about what I could do and since I can remember Ive always liked cars. So that is my goal in the STEM field. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2004,"For as long as I could remember, I've always wanted to follow my dad's footsteps in becoming a successful Electrical Engineer. The primary reason was because Engineering consisted of my favorite subject which was physics. When I was in high school, I would always get eager to gain more knowledge about physics since it strengthened my critical thinking and problem-solving skills which were the core of being a successful electrical engineer. As I matured, I started accompanying my dad to the power plant he worked in. My eyes were always amazed by the flow of electricity and specific organization of complex circuit breakers in the plant. These were real life examples of the physics lessons that I took in school. I always tried to explore my school subjects even more such as Biology and Chemistry; however, my heart always went back to my day one passion: Physics. It was indeed a no brainer when I started submitting my college applications and decided majoring in Electrical Engineering. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2043,"I want to go into the stem field, specifically civil engineering, because I feel like a lot of inconveniences in society could be worked out. For example, parking lots with poor design can be a really big hassle for people in the community due to car accidents happening pretty frequently in parking lots, so being able to design something like that and have it be efficient would be really convenient and it would also be somewhat satisfying knowing that something you designed is making other peoples every day lives easier."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1999,"I want to go to the STEM field because of many reasons. One reason being is job security. Most STEM jobs offer job security and job security is really important in today's world. Another reason I want to go to the STEM field is that my math and science skills are my strongest skills in terms of educational skills. I find math exciting because there is a definite answer. Unlike the subject of English, in math the answer is not up for debate- there is only one correct answer. I find science classes exciting because it helps to understand everything little thing that surrounds us. Also, it would be really cool to build something that so many people in this world would use- like roads or buildings. Being able to admire my work on a daily basis is exciting. My dream is be part of a project that is a landmark. I had one engineering professor who was the project manager for the Bay Bridge and I aspire to work on a project that is so grand."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1853,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field? It all started in middle school when I decided I wanted to join the MESA class. One or first days in class, we got to build the straw towers. This was the start of my interest in STEM. Our next assignment was the popsicle stick bridge. This was so fun making a sturdy bridge out of sticks, wood glue, and sandpaper. The next year my partner and I made it to compete for our bridge and it lasted a long while. This class was where my interest came from. Seeing people building and just having fun with whatever engineering they were comfortable doing. I love to build and create things. STEM is a safe place for me to think and relax. It’s a place where I don’t have to worry as much and kind of just have fun with it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1873,Stem has always interested me more than writing or other fields because of the objective nature of it. Different from other subjects there is one correct answer. I dont like talking about different opinions with people I dont know and that isnt very important in engineering unless it is sharing ideas. I have also just been interested in physics and how it is part of almost everything we do daily. I dont like having answers that might be correct in the right context or almost correct. I want something to either be right or wrong when finding a solution. While there are different ways to get to some answers there get to the same answer unless something was done incorrectly that can be found and corrected. Im more interested in the mechanical side of engineering and chem is difficult but calculus and other physics are still very interesting. Civil engineering is also just something that im very interested in.
