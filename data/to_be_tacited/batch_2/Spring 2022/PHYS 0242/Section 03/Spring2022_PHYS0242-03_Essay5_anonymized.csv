2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,3030,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that although a problem may seem way too difficult at first, if you stick to it and use team work, you can figure it out. Often times at the beginning of labs I was very confused on what we need to do in order to complete the assignment. When my lab group worked as a team, we were able to slowly but surely figure out the lab together. Everybody had different contributions to make each week. This class has definitely been a lesson on strength in numbers. There are a few labs that I would not have been able to complete on my own. I suppose the lab environment is a more accurate depiction of what work will be like in our career field. We will be working in teams and must learn to work cohesively and effectively. In that sense, lab classes are very valuable when it comes to social skills as opposed to just academic skills."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2383,"My greatest takeaway I had from this class was the ability to actually work together with my peers in order to do lab experiments. Prior to this semester, due to COVID, none of my physics labs have been in-person. Everything was online, so we had to rely on simulations of labs rather than using actual lab equipment. I wasn't too sure how this class would go as I felt like I would be going in blind and unsure of how to use certain equipment and what the proper ways of doing things were, but with the help of our lab instructor, Amir made everything sensical. There were definitely more than a few hiccups along the way, with the lab equipment being old, sometimes unreliable, causing a lot of frustration and confusion as well as prolonging the lengths of our procedures. But, in the end, it seemed to work out, and I got a good taste of how our physics labs were always meant to be had it been in-person the whole time."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1848,My greatest take away from this class is that working with other people can help me understand more about different concepts being taught in class. Sometimes having people just throw out ideas can lead to progress. This is what happened throughout the labs when the lab instructions were vague and hard to follow at times. Thinking out loud with our whole group helped us understand the labs more.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2004,"My relationship with Physics has been an awesome journey throughout high school and continuing on to college. I have been relatively on top of it from day one being able to get assignments done on time and grasping the concept properly. I have always found Physics a fun and interesting subject for me to learn. I consistently try to further my knowledge by researching more about the topic we’re talking about in class and how it actually works in real life. From past experience with Physics classes teachers usually make us read off the book which is not very useful in my opinion. However, this class has been a whole other experience to me, every assignment that I've completed has actually helped me understand how it works in real life and not only theoretically. In addition, being able to work with actual equipment really helps understanding the concepts being taught in class. As a final thought, this class has developed my physics skills to another level and made me a visual and creative person."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1873,One takeaway from this lab is the amount of error that can result from a small change in a variable. For example in our calorimetry lab if we did not take. Our time increments and temperature readings very carefully and accurately show that our final data is not what we should have expected. Being able to precisely manage our different variables in experiments and recreate them to be able to take the same measurements twice is a very important part of getting accurate data in these labs. This was not as important while online since it was in perfect conditions with variables that we could type in or make sure were perfectly accurate. Once in person we had to make sure that we were doing the lab correctly and that our data is within our accepted error percentage
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1966,"My greatest take away from this class was being able to better understand hand on physics. Before coming in to this lab, the only in person physics lab I had ever had was in highschool and we really did not do much hand on activities it was more watching the instructor. So when COIVD hio9t my first three semesters of college were all online and I had not had a single in person physics lab. Being able to take my final physics course and have the lab in person was extremely beneficial to me. Seeing how the equipment works and being able to easily ask questions to an instructor truly made all the difference in my learning. This physics I thought was going to be difficult as it is my last required physics course to take, but in reality it was quite easy mainly because I really grasped the concepts working hands on in the physics classroom. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2043,"My greatest takeaway with this class will definitely be to keep an open mind when facing challenges. I remember one of the first experiments my group did, we had over 300% error with the data we obtained. It was funny looking back at it now, but we have since gotten very close values in other experiments. I also remember the lab manuals and how wrong they were most of the time, whether it was poorly written or wrong equations, it was definitely good to experience these as I am sure it will happen in the workplace as well"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2028,"In the world there will be times you will be given faulty tools and instructions and still expected to achieve optimum results. Even when you don't know how to get what you know is correct with the tools you're given don't stew in it but rather still turn it in. Explain why you think the answer you got is wrong, explain why you think you got that answer.Frankly what i learned most in this class isn't the actual physics or how to properly work a graphing calculator but rather a bit of life experience and that i shouldn't wait for mommy to fix my problems, but rather try to fix my problem and if that doesn't work proactively go get mommy to fix my problems."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2013,"I think my greatest take away from this class was that the lectures that are in the beginning of the lab are really important and helpful. At the beginning of all the lab, both online and in person, there is a mini lecture that summarized the important parts of what we learnt in the lecture or what we should have learnt during the lecture time. These lectures was helpful to getting a better idea of the material we learning by using real life examples and how the theories and ideas of what we're learning can be implied in real life situations. I've also learnt that the doing labs without knowing the concept behind it is really difficult."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1868,"Reflection 5     My greatest take away from this class is that I now have a better understating on how physics work. Even though the equipment at SFSU is pretty outdated, which made our labs a little bit more difficult. I feel that even with faulty equipment, we as a class have learned a lot more than what we would in a lecture. Hands on work in my opinion is always better than listening to a lecture and not fully understanding how certain topics work. Such as light refraction, that was one of my favorite labs because it was so visual and were able to see the bending of light. It made it a lot easier when you have a very knowledgeable lab professor which guides us through the whole way, making it easier to understand the things we do. Overall this lab was really fun, it made physics seem even more interesting. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2067,My greatest takeaway from this class is being able to write out the process I have done in an experiment in such a way that someone who has not done the experiment could recreate the same process I did. I think this is a valuable skill outside of physics. Being able to list information clearly and give accurate instructions is a great skill to have.
