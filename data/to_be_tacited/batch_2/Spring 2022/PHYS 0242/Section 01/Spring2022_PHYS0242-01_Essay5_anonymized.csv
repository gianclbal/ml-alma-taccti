2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3022,"My greatest takeaway from this class would have to be the importance of group work and working or learning in a group. Having to transition from online labs to in person labs has really stressed the importance of working in a group setting. Specifically using the technology and tools both in an online lab and in an  in-person lab. I found this to be somewhat difficult as the tools needed to edit PDF's and work online in a group are really only suited for business use and there really aren't any good or free alternatives for student use. However, I found working in a group, in person, to be substantially more intuitive. I enjoyed the ability to verbally communicate with my group and to have their hands-on help as well. Typically, in a lab, mistakes or misunderstandings can arise and it's very convenient to work in a group setting where these can quickly be resolved. I personally found this to be helpful numerous times throughout our various labs, where either I helped my group or my group helped me. As a result, we were able to complete all of our labs successfully. In addition, we also performed the experiments correctly and were able to generate a better understanding of the material as a result. Overall I found this process to be not only intuitive, but convenient and useful. Therefore, my biggest takeaway from this class and the labs would have to be the importance of working in a group dynamic."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3024,"My greatest take away from this class is how much better and actually easier it is do work on experiments and work in a group when we are in person. During the online COVID times I thought that I liked it better than being in person, but after this semester finally being back in person I definitely like it better than being all online. Being face to face with group members and actually being able to see what we are doing in front of us and have discussions on what we are seeing was much more helpful than online. I feel like it was easier to see mistakes and catch them versus online, and overall I just felt more energetic and paying attention more to the work we were doing, which in the end helped me learn more and understand what we were doing better."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3021,"From this class, I have learnt a lot.Compared to the virtual lab, the in-person is way more engaging and interesting. I have learnt to take the lead and follow the instruction carefully. I figure out what part of physics I am more interested. I tend to like quantum mechanics (like the wave particle experiment) than the classical mechanics, especially those related to machine. I like the lab because it is taught in way that is easy to understand. We learn the theory of the experiment first, then we do the experiment to prove the theory. In addition, I have learnt that experiment dealt a lot with approximation. The level of accuracy really depend on how meticulously we conduct the experiment. Furthermore, I’ve learnt how to communicate with others in a more efficient way."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1864,There were so many takeaways from this class ranging from how the in person environment is completely different from the online environment. This semester I learned a lot about what it is like to be on a team with people and how we should communicate with each other. It was super fun to be in an in person environment with other people you can interact with and to add on to this amazing experience we had an amazing lab professor who really cared about all of our learning. To really summarize everything in order for one to succeed it is not only about self resilience but it is also with the help of other people who have common interests or goals. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,305,My greatest takeaway from this class was being able to conduct the physics labs in person. This really helped with my understanding of each of the topics that were taught in the lecture. The simulations that we did in class over previous years were okay but I think I just learn better when I can see the concepts unfolding in front of me which I'm then able to interact with. I felt a lot more confident this year in my physics class than I did last year and I think having in-person labs played a big role in that. My biggest hope is that I get to continue taking physics labs in person in the future so that I maintain the confidence that I gained this year.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1984,"My greatest take away from this class is that working with other people is better than doing some labs online. Granted, some labs are easier online and easier to follow but for the majority, when there are other people helping you then the lab can be easier. Another thing I can take away from this class is that physics is everywhere and in every aspect of our lives. I never really thought about how to relate physics to real life until I got to college. Since this is my last physics lab, I can say that physics was one of my favorite science classes compared to chemistry and other classes. In this class I was able to learn more real world stuff and even though classes like chemistry are important, physics was definitely more fun. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1834,"The greatest takeaway from the class was the ability to be back in the classroom and fully interact with other students again. I have missed being able to talk to other students while in the classroom and the labs have definitely helped out with that. Plus, I really enjoyed being in the lab and the labs themselves. Being a hands-on learner, I really enjoy the labs as I can better understand the topics that we have been going over in class and the labs were actually fun to do. I really enjoyed this class and hope that my future in-person labs will be like this class."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2061,"My greatest takeaway from this class was that no matter what you learn through a textbook or sitting through lectures you will never have a good understanding of how the physics concepts, laws, and theorems are actually applicable to our everyday lives. You need to physically see the concepts being played either in a simulation or in real life. Because of the switch to in-person classes, the in-person labs were of great help to further my understanding of physics.  Before I took this class I always used to think that physics was just used by rocket scientists and high-level manufacturing engineers to prevent injuries and assure safties but that is not the case at all In fact, the deeper we went into the semester we went the more I started to realize that physics is just the study and observations of how our world works. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1962,I learned that being able to do in person labs are much more effective for my learning process because I am able to visualize and set up the experiment with my team. I also liked the topics for PHYS 242 as they had experiments that were much more interesting than the previous physics labs I had.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,156,"My greatest take away from this class was being able to expand my knowledge of physics. This is my final physics class and I glad to say that I have learned a lot, especially from this class. At first, I didn't really like physics, but I finally have a greater understanding of physics and how it is used a lot in my daily life. I'm able to understand things in a physics perspective which is very interesting and sometimes I catch myself realizing how things work in a physics aspect."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1850,Overall I learned a lot and I was glad to have taken this class. It gives you a hands ok experience as to what you are learning in the lecture which is personally my favorite way of learning. I would say the most I took out from this class wasn’t anything I learned but the experiences I had with my classmates and working with groups to get the lab done. Fun fact but this was the best in person class I had since my senior year or high school. Great experience and a great class to take 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2069,"My greatest take away was the different ways that people can see physics but how eventually we all get same result, evenif our data is different. I learned that phyics is about patterns and concepts once you understand them it will be easier to solve problems. And seeing how they all connect. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3023,"My greatest take away from this class is that when group work is done effectively, it is easy to complete the course work. That seems very trivial but one of the major downsides to group work in some of my classes has been having to do much, if not all of the work on certain assignments. Communicating with other students to complete the labs within the time frame was a good experience. I think I was lucky to have group members that participated in the lab activities. In one of my other courses I changed sections because a group member did not participate in any of the lab activities. There is of no guarantee that group members will show up and participate, so I feel fortunate that my classmates did. I don't really think this has a solution. I think that this issue has only gotten worse due to labs and courses being online for an extended period of time."
