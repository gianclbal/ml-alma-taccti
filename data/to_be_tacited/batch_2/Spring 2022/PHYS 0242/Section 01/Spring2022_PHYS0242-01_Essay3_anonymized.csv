2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1850,"So far We’ve done a lot, it’s been fun to finally have a class in person and cool to interact with others and working on physics labs. Overall each and every lab has a lot of concepts to them which are very interesting and cool to learn about. With that put one lab in particular that I remember about has to do with the gas lab proprieties. As Four properties of gases were investigated which has to do with pressure, volume, temperature, and number of molecules. Overall cool to see. With that put some examples from this lab that can relate to the real world could be A flat tire which takes up less space than an inflated tire, Lungs expand as they fill with air and Exhaling decreases the volume of the lungs and A balloon filled with helium weighs much less than an identical balloon filled with air.﻿"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1864,"The specific lab I wanted to focus on was the Thermal Radiation lab, specifically for the part where we were checking the different sides of the cube. Why would the different sides of the cube affect the numbers of thermal radiation? While looking at different YouTube videos and understanding the numbers from the lab we got it looked like that the black side had the highest thermal radiation compared to the other ones. This has to also do with what type of material something is and what color the side is. For example the side for white would not emit is much thermal radiation compared to the black side of the cube. Generally speaking for the people in the world who hate the heat they could be wearing something like white instead of black. Black would absorb the heat but than emit it much better than the white material which is the reason why many people feel a lot cooler in white colors. As for materials that have shinier surfaces they tend to reflect heat which gives less thermal radiation in general when it can be absorbed to begin with. Eventually when learning about light and understanding why different surfaces reflect light would be something that could further added on to thermal radiation. That explain during the lab why some sides were hotter than other sides. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2061,"One topic that we covered in our labs recently that I would love to talk about is thermal expansion. Thermal expansion is an important topic to understand because it plays a role in our everyday lives and it is even more important for engineers. Thermal expansion is taken into account in every piece of architecture and infrastructure. For example, engineers need to calculate how much cms the railroads will expand during the summer using the thermal expansion coefficient, with this, they can ensure the safety of the train passengers and their cargo by preventing the buckling of train tracks which causes train derailment. Thermal expansion is also used in sidewalks, you have probably noticed the gaps in sidewalks, do you think that is there for design aesthetics? thinks again, it is there to prevent the sidewalk from cracking during hot summer days due to thermal expansion. My favorite application of thermal expansion is probably one you might not have heard about, in Formula 1 the race engineers and mechanics use a heater blanket and wrap the tires before the start of the race to keep the tires as warm as possible before the race start often at around 80 C this done because the tires expand when heated which gives the drivers more grip when driving thus letting the drivers go faster around the track overall."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,305,"How can we be sure an object is expanding due to thermal expansion? We can tell an object is expanding simply by measuring its length at one temperature and then measuring its length again at a higher temperature. The difference in temperature will determine how much an object expands based on its material. This concept is important to consider whenever you're working with a problem that needs to consider changes in temperature. For example, a railroad track that's built in the cold winter will expand when the warmer summer comes around. If not accounted for, the metal track has the potential to expand and then buckle, leading to a railroad track that is no longer straight. This is very dangerous since it can derail the train and cause a train accident to happen. To prevent this from happening, railroad tracks can be trimmed during hot summers and then refitted for the winter. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3022,"One topic that we have discussed in class are the ideal thermodynamic cycles. Specifically one that has earned my interest was the theoretical Carnot Cycle. My interest in the idea is primarily based around the fact that it is an ideal thermodynamic cycle for a heat engine. I am assuming this would imply that most heat engines that we find today are not ideal, therefore there must be an incredible loss of resources on scale. I believe this loss of resources would have a profound impact on our lives as most of our transportation and energy generation is based around engines and heat cycles. Especially now it could be more evident considering how gas prices are seven-fold what they used to be and how this even impacts our food supply by making it more expensive. I suppose if we were to have more efficient heat engines we could reduce total consumption of petroleum and satisfy demand. This would be opposed to the inverse of simply harvesting more petroleum to satisfy the ever increasing demand. Of course, the more efficient designs would have to follow the theory set by the Carnot Cycle. However, I have yet to understand why auto manufacturers have yet to devote much of any of their resources to this research. There seems to be no discussion of the Carnot cycle or better engines in public, at least from my understanding. I’m sure the profit for creating such a heat engine would be tremendous and would radically transform our lives for the better."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1866,"One concept that we have learned in the past few weeks that I would like to learn more about would have to be sound waves. My question would have to be how does the physics of sound waves applies to music. For example, is there physics involved in the rhythm and beats, and is there physics involved as to why humans enjoy music so much? I know that it is all personal preference and some people may not even care for music much and I figure that the physics involved is probably is more on how we can hear music from instruments, but I think it's an interesting question to ask. Now I know that sound waves are longitudinal and sound has to do with different frequencies, so I guess I just wonder why we find some sound waves and frequencies appealing while other may be unappealing. I think answering these questions if they haven't been already could potentially help musicians and artists make music. I think even new instruments can be made if we can better understand find ways to create frequencies with different things. An example of this is when I've seen people get creative and play songs from the rim of cups filled with different levels of water to create different notes. In the end, I feel like I'm curious about the physics of music and sound waves and would like to learn more."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1834,"Will an object at absolute zero produce a sound?No, an object at zero will not produce a sound because the sound comes through as compression and expansion if an object that then flows through a medium. The medium of an object at absolute zero cannot have sound travel through it. At absolute zero, molecules are the closest that they can possibly be to one another. Because of this, the molecules can not compress closer to one another at any point in the object, they can only expand. Despite the fact they can only expand, the amount of energy needed to make the molecules expand is too great to come from someone trying to produce a noise from the object."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2069,"Sound WavesHow are they effected when traveling through different liquids? What makes the waves different (what property of the liquid). Based on what we learned in class, different types of liquid depending on the density of the liquid will effect sound in different ways. For example if we were to ring a bell in air versus water, the sound that we would hear would change, would be more lower so we couldn’t hear it then compared to in air as to liquid. Density as well temperature make an impact on how we hear sound, and that’s why we have to keeop these in mind when thinking about producing sound. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1973,"A concept I would like to talk about that I learned in my physics class would be temperature, Temperature is a physical number that describes how hot or cold something is. When a body comes into touch with another that is colder or hotter, it is the manifestation of thermal energy, which is present in all matter and is the cause of the occurrence of heat, a flow of energy. Heat should not be confused with temperature. Which introduced us to thermal energy, thermal energy is is the internal energy existing in a system in a condition of thermodynamic equilibrium. The energy of systems that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium cannot be transferred to meaningful work as easily as thermal energy can. in our physics lab we did have an experiment regarding  temperature we used several materials a light bold and also water that we would heat up."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3023,"I think that the topic that is most relevant to real life is the lab regarding thermal radiation. It is something that we experience daily in a wide variety of ways. The way we cook food, to the way heat transfers from the sun to the earth can be partly described by the properties of thermal radiation. Differing materials absorb and deflect heat in different ways. This is why pots and pans are typically made of metallic materials that can conduct the heat more effectively. Another daily example is the way the sun emits light. It can roughly be described by a spherical representation, where the further the light gets from the source the dimmer and more spread out the light becomes. Furthermore, the angle and spread of that light on the Earth is one of the main contributing factors to the Earths weather. The earth is usually the warmest where the rays of light are perpendicular to the surface of the earth, and coldest at the poles where the angle is greatly reduced."
