2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2061,"Online classes during the fall of 2020 were not too bad in fact for a while I think I actually preferred it over in-person classes as we had more freedom on when we could complete our assignments. While taking online classes realized that I had much more free time because I did not have to commute to the physical classroom. But however, as the semester progressed I realized that I was getting very agitated just staying home all day every day during quarantine. As the school year progressed I just lost the motivation to learn and study and almost made the courses that I had a passion for a painful experience just learning the course curriculum. As far as self-care is concerned I try to exercise whenever I have free time or just go on walks around my neighborhood for some fresh air. Since school is back in person I am still adjusted to the change in teaching."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1973,"This semester we are not taking class online no more but it did have a huge change in my education since it all changed over again. perhaps I joined this lab late which the first 2 labs I missed and I am afraid it will be affecting my grade. so far now working on the labs with my lab partners make everything so much easier, I am able to understand the prompt more and engage on the lab rather than working on it by myself at home, especially since we have all the materials it makes it so much easier."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3021,"For me, there are advantage and disadvantage for online classes. The good side of online classes is thatthe lecture is recorded. So, I can go back to rewatch it if the pace is too fast. However, it can also be negative effect this. I might tend to skip the class and watch it later. So I might miss out the virtual interaction during class. It is even worse if I do not watch the lecture at all. In addition to this, online class same me a lot of time and budget from commuting to the university. The disadvantage of online class is that I miss out the physical interaction with my classmates. It is veryto communicate virtually especially when we want to study in group. Furthermore, I feel that online class is not effective for learning as we are more likely to passively study.From virtual learning, I do gain a lot of experience to adapt and broaden my studying method. Since, westart online class, I completely convert to electrical note taking. My backpack becomes less heavy and easier to commute. My note is organized, accessible and easily customized. In general, I try to maintain consistency for healthy life style via good diet, exercise, and adequate amount of sleep."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3022,"Online classes have really impacted my learning both for better and for worse. At times I like being able to just log into zoom and go to class without the entire process and cost of going through a commute. However, I cant help but feel isolated in my learning where I don't actually get to interact with most of my classmates on a personal basis or even my teacher at times. I've found the quality of learning material to be about the same when either in person or online, but I can't help but notice I retain information better when presented a lecture in person. I don't mean this in a strict sense whatsoever since I've spent nearly the past 2 years online and have even go on to transfer to SF state, but I guess this has to do with humans simply being social creatures. Regardless, I still found myself forming self-care and maintenance habits or routines when my classes were online. I think the most obvious one even most people have is exercise, I spend a few hours a day in the gym and I found it to really help de-stress me. I found it really helps me to focus on my studies and stay on my routine. Other students and I too have personally found study groups to be a useful tool since we can all give input on our class and keep each other in check. Personally, I would say the best thing you could provide to students would be to give them a nice place to study and interact with one another. Or at the least find others that wish to interact with you and share common ideas or goals. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1864,Online courses were more time saving for me because I would be home rather than needing to travel which I thought was really the best part of online courses. I got to sleep in all the time I didn’t really have much stress of waking up early. Learning online on the other hand was really hard because sometimes I would get lazy and not learn much from being online. Now since we are in person I feel like I get to learn better. What I enjoy a lot more is having labs in person which are amazing because I actually get to see what’s happening in person than watching a video of what’s happening. Like there are some aspects to online learning I miss like sleeping in and what not but now I think about the pluses of being in person. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1866,"This semester most of my classes are in person, but I do have one online class. Last semester when I took mostly online classes I felt as if it was harder to learn and pay attention compared to being back in person. Being in person I definitely try harder and feel more motivated than being online. I definitely really felt the impacts of being online such as being lazy, not motivated, and lots of procrastination. I'm kinda glad that we are back in person but online doing has some perks such as not having to actually go to school lol. For myself care, I try to spend the time that I'm not doing any school work with my peers. I love to socialize so I feel that keeps me pretty sane. Lastly, the only concern I have now being back in person is the anxiety of taking finals again in person. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2069,"It’s hard for me to learn online, but now that we are back in person I feel a little more confident. However, some of the classes that are hybrid are harder for because I cannot have time to get to know peers well enough to feel comfortable to use them as a resource for homework. However, for lab its complete opposite I got know these set of people and its really nice I feel like I could talk to them very easily and they are very supporting. My mental health in all honesty is going down hill because of pressure I’m feeling from all sides, school, work, finically aid, and home. So its been hard but trying to keep good attitude and hopefully I will get passed through it. It does make it harder to focus and sleep, so really lacking energy especially  since I’m fasting. But everything will be ok. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,156,"When online classes started I really liked having these online classes because I was able to stay home and relax while attending school. For practically 2 years , I never realized how much I enjoyed having the classroom environment. It is also hard since I missed 2 years worth of being ""in"" college. Learning overall is becoming more difficult because courses like lab aren't hands on anymore so I can't actually experience actual lab. But with that I'm still able to learn through these current labs, I just wish that I'll be able to experience an actual lab hands on in the future. Even though it is tough, I'm still able to do things I can do at home like working on my car as well as learning new skills. I recently picked up building model kits to take up some time off of my day."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1850,"To be honest this class was in person. It was only online for 3 weeks! But it has an impact as learning online and in-person is different. They both have many pros and cons as it's good that you can do zoom at home in your bed all warm but at the same time, you may have many distractions, while in person you are kinda forced to focus on your work. Overall my learning and well-being has be fine. I have a mixure of online and in-person classes and to be honest, I like it that way. I enjoy both and i look forward to finishing this course in a strong manner. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3023,"Online learning has actually been helpful for mental health reasons. During a time where contact with others could lead to a potentially deadly disease, having the option to work online has been beneficial. It has the downsides that students do not interact as much for the most part and teachers can have a difficult time dealing with the online courses. Most teachers were used to doing things in a more conventional manner.  Going back to school after requiring everyone to be vaccinated was a good change to renew interactions that would otherwise be impossible. The convenience of being online and then switching to in person made it a bit more taxing on my schedule since I now had to factor in commuting. Additionally I needed to plan time to do day to day things. It was my first semester at SFSU since I was a transfer student, this made things harder for me because I did not have very much freedom to have the schedule that I wanted. The registration period was late. The registrar or department that would give me course credits, to date has not given me the proper course credits. This led to me having to email my professors and advisors to have to manually get into most of my courses. My schedule overall was very inconvenient for me and I ended up deciding to fail a course in order to maintain a reasonable schedule and focus on my other courses. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,305,"Online classes haven't affected my learning too much. For self-care, I make sure to take breaks often so that I am able to focus better when I come back to my computer. My only concern for my learning is whether I'm retaining the information from PHYS 240 well enough since there are a lot of concepts to digest and I'm also very busy with other classes and work as well. I feel like I just need more practice with each week's concepts. In other classes, the homework we're assigned gives me a lot of practice and the lectures consist of the professor going over examples of each week's concepts which helps me a lot."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1984,We are in person class now but I still think online classes would have been worse if we stayed online for another semester. In person classes have been beneficial to my learning because I am able to focus more and ask questions easier. I do think it was easier being online but now I need to be more time efficient and on top of assignments.
