2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3021,"My goal in this class is to apply theory in physics into practice. We want to learn how to convert something that is conceptual (mathematical equations) into physical. One of the goal is to validate the theory by using experimental data.To achieve these goal, this class can teach me how to use experimental apparatus (Ex: mechanical balance, thermometer, thermal expansion meter...). It help me to learn to follow the procedure step by step. In addition, I can learn how to solve the problems whenever the lab does not perform smoothly. In addition, I improve my critical thinking skill to visualize and follow the procedure. Also, I can interact and work as a group. I also learn to listen other's opinion and share my own about how to figure out the way to perform experiment more efficiently and in timely manner. Lastly, the class help me to be more meticulous to get smaller % error which is very important for my future career."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1866,"Some of my goals in life are to graduate with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering, get a job in the city, and hopefully be able to stay here in San Francisco. I like this city and it's my dream to hopefully be able to stay here. Being in this class will help me graduate and achieve my goals. It will by giving me the knowledge of physics I need in order to become an engineer in the future. Expanding my knowledge of physics will allow me to succeed in the future when I start designing buildings or whatever construction or designs I need to do for them to be safe and solid. Another one of my goals outside of just work and school is to eventually buy a home and raise a family and I hope by obtaining a Stem degree like engineering will allow me to do so and be financially stable. Again I really enjoy the city so I feel that one of my most important goals is allowing me to stay and live here and raise and family comfortably. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1850,My goals in this course is to grow and learn more and more throughout this class. I can do this by working hard learning and by doing my work. this class will be hard and challenging but I'm looking forward to learning and doing the best that i can to pass this class. This class can help me reach my goals by learning and reaching those goals. has it will give me a better experience that is in person which will be helpful and im looking forward to taking this course 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2061,"Similar to every person in my age my goals continue to change as I grow and come in contact with new people and experiences. I have many goals in my heart I want to graduate with a good understanding of my major ( computer engineering ) and figure out which specific area that I want to get a job at and master. I think this class will help me reach this goal as Physics is the study of reality and when designing computer hardware you need a good idea of how the world works. This class will also help me get better at problem-solving as essentially physics is just solving the question about our complex and unique world. I am also looking into getting into motorsport engineering and for that, I will need to learn and master the ideas of heat transfer, newtons law of cooling, and how engines work"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1864,"My goals for now is to pass all my classes and eventually get into a job for civil engineering. I want to take everything a step at a time and currently just getting enough sleep and studying is something I need to pass this class. I probably want to focus more on the semester instead of thinking about the future. I want to be able to retain a lot of the information I have acquired which means I need to do a lot more studying which is fine with me. This class really pushes me to understand the information I have studied and keep it in my head, as well as being able to visualize it is important for me too. I know as well in my life I’m gonna need to work with people in order to pass and understand classes. So this class really helps me with the teamwork aspect of things and making sure that I decide to rely on others as well."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3024,"My goals are to graduate with my bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, get a good job learning how to be an Electrical Engineering in the real world. This class can help me achieve those goals because instead of just learning on paper how to do certain things, this class will help apply what we learn in class and how to apply these to the real world. I have worked in the military and as a technician, but this class helps more put equations you have learned and other items to a real-world experiment and how to get certain variables you are looking for and what they can do for you and why you would want those values. The tools that you learn in labs on how to apply things we know and have learned are so valuable in being able to transfer what we have learned in college into the real world when we end up getting a job after college."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1984,My goals for this year are to adjust to in person classes and this lab/lecture have really helped. I am able to work with my peers again and talk face to face. Hands on learning with the lab have also helped my understanding of the topics learned in 240 lecture. The labs have also helped me in the tests and quizzes in lecture 240 because we are directly implementing the techniques and formulas in lab.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2069,"My goal for this class is to understand everything to the best of my ability, even if that means not passing the class fully, which makes it easier for me to learn. I am just hoping to not fail and understand everything I came across. I can get help by asking questions when I am unclear about things, asking my groupmates, as well as my lecture instructor in order to get the help I need to learn about something. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,305,"After I have completed my education at SFSU, I plan on attending graduate school in pursuit of a Ph.D. in Astrophysics. My long-term career goals involve pursuing observational research at institutes like NASA and then teaching at the college or junior college level. I've been inspired to follow in the footsteps of my Astronomy 115 professor, Dr. McCarthy. I loved every day of his class and it is what sparked my interest to finally change my major to Astrophysics. I would also like to inspire students to pursue careers in astronomy just like he did to me. Taking this class will allow me to further my academic pursuits and change how I view the world on a physical perspective."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,156,"My goal for the future is to work in the mechanical engineering field. Specifically, I want to work with cars because I was around cars growing up. I loved building which sparked my passion for engineering, but I fell in love with cars back in high school. After seeing videos of people bringing cars back to life, I always wanted to build a car from the ground up as well and now I’m starting to rebuild my own car back into a working state. Currently, I have a car that I'm working on and finally bringing back to life slowly. For example performance wise, I'll be able to see how the acceleration of the car is working with different parts that I put into the car or how I can reduce the drag of the car by calculating different methods I learn in physics."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3023,"If I ever pursue a career in research, the processes used in labs can be very helpful. Gathering data and drawing conclusions analyzing the data. It is an important set of skills that could transfer to other fields. Listening to people that are more experienced, working with others and meeting objectives. The labs pose certain challenges that need to be solved by the lab group. When we work on the labs we take certain roles to make the process efficient and effective. One person will usually gather data while others note the data. Then we do the calculations and analysis as a team. I imagine that these team roles and experiences could transfer to jobs that involve teamwork."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3022,"My main goal as a student in mechanical engineering is to gain a practical knowledge of engineering. I believe having a hands on approach to learning will benefit me the most in my job or career after college. I have found the labs to reinforce the concepts I have studied but to have also help me work in a group hands on. Working in a group has also better enabled me to understand the concepts as my group members can explain and help one another. In addition helping my group members, hands on or verbally has also furthered my learning. I find these to be the main reasons as to why my practical knowledge for mechanical engineering to be more developed. Therefore, I find that I am completing or furthering my goals during these labs and find them viable and practical. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1834,"I want to get a good grade in this class and get a better understanding of the subject matter. The labs are very helpful in understanding the class as the hands-on approach is much more to my learning style. Plus the labs are very informative and pretty fun. For the lecture part of the class, studying and applying the topics that I learned in the lab will be helpful towards getting a better grade. Because I am a social person, doing the labs in a group is very helpful and feeds my social need."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3025,"I have short-term and long-term goals that I set for myself so I could see the progress that I have made. My current short goal is just simply passing my class and getting better grades, which this class will help in improving my GPA. My long-term goal is to become a better engineer that can help the public. This class will help me obtain a better understanding of our world so that someday I could use the knowledge that I gathered over my time in college to help the people I care deeply about. There is lots of information that may come from this class which will help set a path for me to continue and find a better understanding of the information. Overall I hope I will get enough of the materials that are presented in the class and that I can understand them if not I will put in enough time so that I can understand them."
