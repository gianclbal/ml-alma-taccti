2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1973,"I chose to study civil Engineering, the reason why I wanted to go into a stem field is because I wanted to be able to learn how to express my designs and learn how roads, buildings etc are build in cities I find that pretty interesting! perhaps in hisghchool I never really took a lot of math class or physics so I wanted to expand my knowledge and learn other subjects I was not as interested in in high school. Another reason on why I wanted to go into the stem field is because I have learned and seen in my classes that not a lot of women are interested in going into these fields, which made me feel intrigued to continue studying civil engineering."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1984,"I actually didn't know I wanted to be in the stem field until my second year here at SFSU. I originally didn't have a major and I was back and forth about majoring in arts or kinesiology. After much though I kept debating with myself but for some reason on the SFSU pamphlet of majors, I saw mechanical engineering and decided to major in that. I had no prior thought to majoring in mechanical engineering but I thought it would be a good use of time and I wanted to learn about this totally new side of STEM. One specific thing I am interested in is automobiles specifically cars and the balance between aerodynamics and the engine. I am also intrigued by the step forward to electric automobiles and the future of things like motorsport and everyday transportation. I have some experience working on cars and also 3D printing small objects/toys. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,663,I want to go into stem because it looks really interesting to work on projects. I'd like to work in the automotive industry because I like to work on cars and improve them with parts! So being able to be in the field to work on that would be awesome! 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2069,"I want to go into the STEM field because of my interest in math and science, I love to ask questions, and finding the answers is just as existing. They are like puzzles to me, trying to find the answer, and why that is working my brain in a way that I enjoy. I chose mechanical engineering specifically because of my desire to go more hands-on approach to solving these puzzles, and problems in our daily life. I also like to help people, which gives me the opportunity to do. Even if I have to do that through school I am willing, but I am more wanting it for the experience of the major, I would like to do some of this work we learn in school in life situations so that I can understand it better as well as fulfill that hands-on desire I want. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3021,"I want to go to stem field because I am interested in scientific research, particularly in medical field. Science logically explains natural phenomen which is very fascinating to me. I first got very interested in microscopic world when I first studied about the quantization of energy of electron. Then, I am very curious about quantum physics. The chemical interaction at molecular level makes me fall in love with chemistry. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2360,"The reason why I wanted to go into a STEM field is because when I was in high school I was inspired by my friends who are into fixing cars and other mechanics such as machines. Plus, it's also because my dad graduated college in the Philippines with a degree in Civil Engineering so I thought to myself ""I might as well major in Mechanical Engineering."" But joining at first was mostly because I was really into cars and I wanted to go in the automotive field in the first place. I'm hoping to join a group where I get to modify cars and make them even faster just like Fast and Furious. But also, since I have found another passion in fitness I'm planning to graduate college with a degree then maybe go into a different field into fitness. I'll have the degree but I have the option to choose what career I want after college."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3022,"Rahman Eshpari The STEM field and sciences have always been something that have held my interest. I consider myself to be a hands-on learner or that I enjoy working with my hands. Having a greater understanding of what I’m doing and why has always given me a sense of purpose, direction and confidence. One personal experience that I can recall was during my childhood and how much I played with Legos. I really found them to be my favorite toy and in hindsight, demonstrates human’s intuitive understanding of physics. Having to build, stack, and organize them according to the direction, to be specific, clearly demonstrates the principles found in basic physics. I believe engineering embodies a lot of the values related to these ideas. For these reasons and my past experiences-along with the job or career itself-is the main reason as to why I’m pursuing engineering and would enjoy working in STEM."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1850,"sorry professor I did reflection 2 instead of reflection 1 which is why this is late. This is a great question as we went over this question in phy with cal 1 and 2. Overall I want to go into the stem field because I feel as if it's an area where I can grow my math and science skills as well as grow as an individual. I personally feel as if its a good area for me and I also believe its an area where my skills are solid at and I could possibly do good things if I follow through with this process.  In short, it's something that I enjoy although it is very hard I still feel like I can strive in this environment.   "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3023,I am interested in design and manufacturing. A lot of what is involved in STEM are things that I feel comfortable and interested in. One of my main hobbies has been working on cars. Components and design are very important when it comes to vehicles. There are many aspects of STEM that apply to automotive systems. I am interested in the future of automotive design because we are going into an era of electric cars. Advancements in computer technologies will allow for great advancements in designing more efficient vehicles. It is the job of engineers to build better electrical systems and components for this purpose. I think that after college this might be a field that I would pursue. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1866,"The reason why I am in the STEM field is that I am a civil engineering major. I choose the major because when I was young my parents always told me that I should become an engineer when I was older. This is because ever since I was young I excelled in my math and science classes. I also showed a lot of interest in those classes and always enjoyed doing the work because it came pretty easy for me. Another reason why I choose a STEM major is that I know the jobs with a STEM degree tend to pay more than other degrees. I think it is very important when I am older to make enough money to live comfortably. Lastly, I choose civil engineering specifically because it has to do with construction. I have always loved designing and building things. My Dad also has been an architect and is now project/construction manager and my grandfather worked in construction as well. Their work has always interested me and I hope to work in that field one day as well. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,305,"I wanted to get into the STEM field for Astrophysics. Math and science are the two subjects that I feel most comfortable with and I've always had a love for space. I never really discovered how interesting I thought astronomy was until I took Introduction to Astronomy two years ago. Every day I went into class always asking questions and learning about so many aspects of the universe that I found to be intriguing. Taking that class truly inspired me to switch my major to Astrophysics where I hope to pursue at least a master's degree. Talking to my astronomy professor and upperclassmen who were already in the major really helped me to decide that majoring in Astrophysics is totally something that I can accomplish. I also believe in myself and I believe that I can continue in this major solely because I have a lot of passion for math, physics, and astronomy. I also really like the research group that I'm in here with Dr. Sakari so I'll probably continue on to grad school after this."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3024,"I wanted to come to the STEM field because of my love for Math and wanting to pursue that love. Also, I feel like the STEM field is where a lot of people can make a difference in this world in some of the things they create or do. I believe a lot of the work that is done in the STEM field is meaningful and can impact many people. From my time in the military, I wanted to pursue something that had meaning and impact."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1962,I decided to choose the STEM field because my father would make electronics projects at home and show me how he repaired his own electronics without the need of a repair shop when I was a kid. I initially thought I wanted to be a music producer but I later realized that my inspiration was not music itself but how hardware created could generate sound. I also grew up in a family where I was a first generation college student.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1864,"Honestly there are a variety of reasons why I want to be in the STEM field. I think throughout my life I wanted to do something that was related to STEM. I always enjoyed Math and Sciences, and it was just almost about 3-4 years ago where I told myself I wanted to do engineering. One of my teachers in high school really made me want to pursue something in Engineering. I understand that engineering itself is already hard but I want to be able to apply many things I have learned and apply them in real life situations. In my case as a Civil Engineer, I would want to understand what materials are best for certain situations and how could one minimize the cost of certain items. I just know that I wanted to do something that I was going to be happy doing rather than doing something I did not want to do. That passion so happened to be in the STEM field. As well as thinking in the future STEM careers are something that allow people to live a content life and I personally would want that. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2061,"Since I was a high school freshman I knew that I wanted to pursue a degree in the STEM field but I was not sure which particular major I wanted to pursue a degree in. As time progressed Heading into my sophomore year I was focused on becoming a sports medicine doctor because I played football and battled through many injuries and our football team had a sports doctor that rehabilitated me through my injuries, so I became really interested in the sports medicine field. But in my Junior year, I took a computer networking class and fell in love with the class, mastering that course's material was like second nature. The class not only worked with the software but also had an emphasis on working with wires and hardware, rewiring the whole classroom to improve network performance and speed. It was then that I decided to become a computer engineering major because it's the best of both worlds the major teaches about hardware and software. Also, the fact that I lived in the Bay Area I knew I couldn't pass up an opportunity to join the tech Industry as It is the perfect place to reside in for my major.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,156,"I have decided to go into the STEM field because I have always wanted to major as an engineer, but I was unsure what type of engineering I would pursue. I loved building and working on cars which made me decide on mechanical engineering, but I always enjoyed working with cars since my dad worked and built cars when I was a kid. Even in school, I tried to be involved with STEM related activities because it had always interested me. Working with cars specifically made me decide to switch to mechanical engineering and pursue that as a career goal."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,3025,"My reason for wanting to get into the STEM field is quite simple. I love to change the world with my two hands. Having to build computers or robots that can do a task humans have a hard time doing can do a whole lot and can affect people's lives. Ever since I was little, I loved building Legos. When I became a teenager I joined a lot of STEM programs that showed me all the different aspects of STEM. I got to code, build robots, wooden planes and talked to STEM workers. All these experiences that I gathered have led me to my current major which is computer engineering. It was the only major that included software and hardware aspects to a computer, which I’m excited to learn more about. I hope someday in the future that I will be able to use what I learned to help the world for the greater good."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,1834,I want to go into the STEM field because I've always enjoyed math and science. I want to be able to continue doing what I enjoyed during school as a career and engineering is the best way to do that. I've also had a dream to be a rollercoaster designer since I was a kid and being in STEM allows me to pursue this dream.
