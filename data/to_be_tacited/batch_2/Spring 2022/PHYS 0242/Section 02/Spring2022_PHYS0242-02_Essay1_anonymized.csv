Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1842,"So ever since I was younger I've always enjoyed main things, I'd collect scraps and broken coat hangers on the floors on department stores and make little marble tracks with them. Overall I'm really artistic and creative but I'm really bad at art so that kinda led me down the road of engineering. I also know that engineers are in high demand which is always a plus."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2002,"Growing up, I was raised by my mother and Bibi (Swahili for grandmother) for the most pivotal parts of my childhood. They did not want me to grow up thinking that all I was meant to do was fulfill the woman stereotype. As an African-American daughter of a teenage mother, they did not want me thinking all I was meant for in life was to be a mother and caretaker that only knew how to cook, clean, cater to a man, and take care of kids. So in third grade as a birthday gift, my Bibi got me a set of the small Legos, and I fell in love with building things. After years of playing with Legos, I decided I wanted to be a Mechanical Engineer, and after taking ENGR 100, I decided to add Civil Engineering. I want to break stereotypes while making the world a better and more productive place. I want little girls and even my peers to look up to me and be like, “Wow, we can do it too, nothing is going to keep us down.”I want to change the world, and I’m using this as my first stepping stone. I plan to change a lot of things and hope I get to help make these changes soon."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,3026,"I want to go into stem because I've always wanted to go into stem. I've known I was going to be an engineer since before I could remember, so I don't know what got me started on this path. I've wanted to do design work on buildings, machines, airplanes, etc. forever, and now I'm working towards doing that. I'm probably going to go into transportation logistics, as that has become a recent passion of mine, preferably working on mass transit. I also recently developed a passion for history (hence the plan to double-major), but that doesn't seem to be a sustainable career prospect in the economy nowadays. So I plan to work in my first passion to be able to afford to work in my new passion. Weird how that works out. My path through engineering has been weird, since what I want to do in engineering changes. I started as a Mechanical major, hoping to work in aerospace. Now I'm a civil major, hoping to work in logistics. Big switch, but that's my ADHD scatterbrain working."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1860,"SInce I was little I always liked numbers. It feels like a natural place for me so that is probably why I have always gravitated towards doing something that involved numbers. Also, I grew up in a family of construction workers so one of my first dreams was to become an architect."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1905,I join the stem field because I took a electrical Engineering class during high school and it was the only class that I enjoyed during high school. I actually look forward to walk into class and get ready to learn all about it. I remember through out my high school year I really hated math and never wanted to do anything with it but for some reason I enjoy learning new equations and trying to solve examples in my engineering class.That's when I realized that I wanted to work into this field for the rest of my life.  
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1967,"I wanted to go into the STEM field because I have always had an interest in engineering. As a kid, I liked seeing shows that had to do with science or engineering and was always marveled at the things that humanity has accomplished through engineering. I myself first done an engineering project in middle school where I tested the strength of different bridge truss designs. This inspired me to learn more about engineering and is one of the things that lead me to go into the STEM field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2036,"A reason why I wanted to go into the STEM field is because I enjoy tinkering and understanding how things work. I really enjoy using my knowledge and having it translated into structure I build or things I do like just creating things from nothing. I really enjoy thinking about and understanding large mechanical objects like planes for example, I really enjoy the idea that this object or creation did not exist until someone thought about it and created each moving part so that they worked in synchrony so well that it becomes one large function thing. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,602,"I want to go into the STEM field because mathematics has been my favorite subject in school. I want to make sure I like doing something in my every day life. One way to achieve this is to pursue a career in the STEM field. Also, STEM education teaches you how to solve problems in our daily lives. You never stop learning new things and it challenges you to think bigger. My goal in the STEM field is to be an engineer and help others in the community. I'd like to begin working for a company and get experience working with engineers, with the goal of eventually owning my own company. I know it won't be easy at first, but if you set your mind to it, you can accomplish it. If I’m not able to do own my company, I would like to work with a company that I would like to be part of. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1876,I want go into the stem field because I always wanted to become a civil engineer. Since middle school I've always been apart of the engineering academy up until high school and those elective engineering classes have always been fun and super interesting. I have always wanted to be apart of a construction management team and plan over the course of a few months of how the construction cite will be looking like. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2456,"This is not the first I answer this question and what I like about answering it, is the fact that it makes us or me at least think of why we're here? I myself got into the STEM field because when I  was kid I was soo interested in the science classes, I joined different groups we worked on real chemistry experiments, studied deeply about geography, and then I joined the science class on an electrical circuit project, I was sooooo interested, and we explained it, to the whole country. I knew since then, I loved science, loved electricity, loved engineering. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1907,"When I was in my junior year of high school, I did not know what I wanted to study in college. I chose mechanical engineering mostly out of curiosity and because I enjoy solving puzzles, building things, and fixing things. When I was little, whenever I got a new toy, I would take the whole thing apart just so that I could put it back together. I was always curious about how the things around me worked. This is pretty much what sparked my interest in engineering. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1936,"My major is physics, and I am facinated by concepts that feel near completely out of reach. My hope is to come closer to undesatning the mechanics of our universe in the highest sense of truth. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1839,The reason I wanted to go into stem is I watched all the episodes of MythBusters and saw how they build crazy contraptions. They used there hands and blueprints to create devices. I took all this in and thought I could do it too through acquiring a degree in mechanical engineering. Few years into the degree and now I am realizing the struggle of becoming an engineer.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1902,"One of the biggest reasons why I want to go into the STEM field is because of my childhood hobby of building Lego’s. Along with that, I was not very interested in many topics, but I worked very well with math. Along with many other factors, they all pointed me towards the field of engineering which is a great field to be able to create amazing things along with a good salary to come with it. I feel like going into this field would be fulfilling but it would be a great achievement for my family as I could be the first person in my family to graduate in a STEM major. I would also love to be a part of a group that creates something that is extremely beneficial for everyone."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1098,"I want to go into the stem field, Civil engineer to be specific, because I have always loved building things, with legos or paper, or even just drawing buildings. I also love to travel. And so I want to be able travel around different location, and design bridges, roads, buildings, and contribute to the community in different ways, which I think is pretty cool. Also innovating things that will help improve the way we live, also improve the environment by using sustainable or environmentally sustainable systems, etc.. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2009,"The reason why I wanted to join the STEM field was that I had a passion for creating things and understanding how things work. When I was in elementary school, I would always play in the sandpit and create dams or structures from the sand. Later in life, they would still be creating things from paper or cardboard and fixing things around the house. My passion for building things has stuck with me as I grew up and this passion aligned with STEM. I decided on majoring in civil engineering because of my passion for creating things and especially working on things like the infrastructure of roads, pipes, bridges, etc. This is because I found the projects that are about infrastructure interesting, especially projects like bridges and dams because these were things that I have always liked to build and read about. These are the reasons why I wanted to be in the STEM field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2040,"As a kid, I would always ask ""why?"". Why things look the way they do, why we go about doing certain things, just why things work the way they do. Many of my questions went unanswered until I was in science class. There I saw that there was an explanation for the questions and wonders that I've had. I found it cool that things I learned in my science class, I could immediately start making connections and seeing applications of the subject in the real world. I chose to be an engineering major is because it is the application of science to solve problems. So new questions that we have can be answered, then applied to help make the world a better place. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1931,"I want to go into the STEM field because I want to create things and be known for creating things. In particular, I want to do Ocean Engineering to create water drones or submersibles to travel the oceans More. Most of our oceans have not been explored so I would like to be a part of the discoveries by building more advanced tech for them. I have been interested in this since High school and I hope to get some experience with it. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1953,"I guess math has always been my thing ever since I was a kid. I was always really quick to learn my pemdas which to me was always something that I looked forward to, unlike other subjects like english, history, etc. I guess that throughout the years I grew to love math more and more but I knew that building things was also something that I loved doing. I LOVED legos as a kid, taking the time to build something amazing was something very satisfying that I loved doing whenever I had free time. As time went on, buildings and bridges have always intrigued me and I always asked myself how they could make such sleek and modern designs, how the heck a bridge can be made if it's soo long and stuff like that which was a big influence into why I went into civil engineering as it has to deal more with construction and applying solutions to problems like building material, forces, static equilibrium and all that good stuff. I still however don't know exactly where I want to specialize in but I think surveying, structural and transportation engineering are all things that intrigue me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2017,I want to go into the STEM field because I want to make things that will last for generations. When I started working in construction I always liked how I could drive around and remember what stuff I worked on and see what I did. I want to continue doing this as a civil engineer. Also I enjoy building stuff and I like art and drawing and I think engineering is a good way to do that for a profession while also making good money. Also I really enjoy math and physics and I want to do those things in a future job. Also I think its important to rebuild in a sustainable way and reduce our infrastructure reliance on fossil fuels and as a civil engineer I can help do this.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1861,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field?Since, my childhood I have a great interest for cars. I just love cars. I attend Auto Expo every year to explore new ideas, concepts, designs, and technology. I like to learn about electric cars, sports cars, hyper cars, and formula-one. My aim is to become a car engine designer. I was so impressed with the movies like Pixar Cars, Tarzan the wonder car, and Ta Ra Rum Pum that boosted my interest for cars. I also have approximately 200 hot wheels cars collection, other than hot wheels I have many R.C. cars and even many characters from the movie Pixar Cars. There are many new concepts that are getting discovered day by day that may help to totally improve and change about cars. I practice on Solidworks to improve my designing skills. My major is Mechanical Engineering.  I have many new concepts and ideas in my mind. And that’s the reason I took the STEM field to achieve my dream of becoming a car engine or powertrain engineer."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1986,"I want to go into the STEM field because I am fascinated by how objects work, such as a building, car, train, etc. I have always liked math and am very good at math. The STEM field would not have me sit in a room most of the day when I work. I get to see the world and make the world a better place with efficient things. I want to know how buildings are stable and how they are built. I would like to learn about the stability of a building so we can build buildings that can stand up to very massive earthquakes or any natural disasters. I want to learn alongside other people that have the same goals and interests as me. I have always been interested in how buildings stay up holding their own weight and withstand earthquakes and strong winds. I also have been passing by very tall buildings and construction sites when I was a little kid which made me curious and made me want to get into this kind of field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2062,"I want to go into the Stem Major in order to improve humanities relationship with the environment, notably through the creation of clean renewable energy resources. This is the reason why I chose electrical engineering, since the major focuses on power generation which is pivotal to the how humanity organizes its infrastructure. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,3027,"I wanted to go into the STEM field because I was born a squishy delicate bag of meat in a complicated world. It was in that complicated world where I noticed representations of fearless and powerful beings. It wasn't the fictitious superheros flying around, impervious to bullets, but the mad scientists, mere humans, competing with conveniently mutated super beings. Their wit was their weapon and their hands had the power of creation. They could construct robots to take down superman or create viruses that rendered the bat computer a brick. They are the closest any mortal can get to stupendous ability, radioactive spiders just give you cancer, but education... that gives you knowledge, and knowledge is power."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2018,"I got into the STEM field because engineering caught my attention back in middle school, when I found out what career paths required those who are well educated in math. Since I was in the advance classes for math throughout high school, I believed engineering would be a good goal to seek after. During high school, I took engineering classes all four years and enjoyed them. I also got an award for being the top student in engineering for my class. It only made sense for me to apply to college and major in engineering. I decided to take the Electrical Engineering route since I enjoyed Robotics, working with circuit boards, and also filling out schematics during the electricity units. All in all, I see STEM as a great fit for me to continue studying in throughout my educational path!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2026,"Why I want to go into the STEM field is because of my passion back then from high school, I was put into the automotive program and spent a lot of my time there and my teacher at the time really pushed us to pursue a higher education as he was an AVID teacher. But going into college I had no idea what I wanted to do so I just chose something that was as close to automotive as possible and I found that to be mechanical engineering. But after being a student for a few years now I can really see the difference between engineering and just automotive repair itself. But having gone this far in I decided to keep pushing further in my college education."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1930,"I think it is pretty funny how I got into the STEM field. Originally I started my college career not deciding what major I wanted to pursue. I kept bouncing back and forth between asking people just majors they picked and asking how they came to that decision. I later got tired of asking my friends and I decided to ask my uncle afterwards, who was a civil engineer at the time. Later he showed me his work and how a typical day was, then I just said that I want to purse this major. I have stuck to it ever since and I am very happy with my decision."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1852,"I got into the STEM field when I was in high school. I noticed and thought to myself that I'd rather do math and science than any other subjects. After this realization, I have started joining summer engineering camps which I was greatly interested in. I've loved building things, solving math problems, and working hands-on. For this reason, I chose that I wanted to study civil engineering because it is in the field that I think I'm really passionate about. Therefore, I want to go into the STEM field because I believe that it is one of my greatest strengths. Not only that but I think that I would also be helping a lot of people if I am in the STEM field which I would really love."
