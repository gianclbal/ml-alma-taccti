2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2456,"What's the greatest take away from this class is actually this semester was my first semester doing real labs I had 242 for physics and 206 for Engineering, my greatest take away is the fact that I actually encountered some of the real lab materials as well as it was the first time applying what's in the class room physically into the lab.. we did several experiment online yet, in person is much better.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1930,"My biggest take away from this class during the semester was how this class would force myself to stay up to date with each topic and learn certain study habits that work for myself. The labs during the semester have been one of the most interesting labs that I have taken during my academic career. I believe that the majority of these labs have a more interesting connection toward certain topics that are being discussed during lecture. I think that during this semester, experiencing going to the campus in person and seeing the amount of resources available helped me become more productive and more on track with my studies. I felt that coming back from being online on zoom for over 2 semesters, I thought it was just overall a better learning experience than just looking at a zoom window on your desktop and just listening to someone without the physical connection to learn something new. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2040,"Physics is a very deep subject, and though there are many formulas and variables, nothing is random. During this lab, we did experiments that helped us understand where variables come from, why we use certain constants, and explored serval ideas through formulas. This lab also helped reinforce ideas that may have been hazy in the lecture portion. Truly what this class did was help me find connections between the lectures to the real world. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1098,"My greatest takeaway from the class was being able to learn about different types of equipment topics of physics and comparing how we use them in the real world. Working together in groups and switching roles to get used to different roles like working with equipment or working on the analysis, conclusion, and procedures, and adding data. Additionally, troubleshooting problems and collaborating and sharing different ideas to approach problems. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2017,My greatest takeaway from this class was the physics learned and how I was able to see how it could be applied to real life through the lab. In previous classes during the pandemic all the labs where through online simulations and these never really helped me understand the concepts that the labs helped show. With in person labs you can physically see the experiment take place in front of you and you set up the experiment to show certain physics principles. Also being with an in person group increases the collaboration a lot while during many online labs people would just stay silent and do their own work. With the in person format you need to collaborate more which is a good skill for the workforce. Also being in person prevents people a lot of people from cheating so it makes the grading more meritocratic. Overall I feel like I've learned a lot more out of this class than prior physics class due to it being in person and having good lectures that where easy to understand.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1907,"Since this class was my first in-person lab on campus, I have many takeaways from this class. I feel like I have been exposed to so much cool lab equipment that I had never worked with before. I also learned how to work more efficiently in a group. I used to dread doing group work because it always felt like the work was distributed unevenly and some people would always do more work than others. But this was not the case with my group. Each week, we collaborated in and out of the lab and with each person doing an equal amount of work. This process made labs all the more fun to complete. Another big takeaway from this class was how to write a good lab report. Since we had to write one each week, we had a lot of practice getting down a good ""formula"" for our lab reports. I learned that less is more when it comes to lab reports. I will continue to use this class as a reference for future labs. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2062,"My greatest takeaway from the class is basic knowledge of how to complete a lab report and how to use lab equipment. I had not used lab equipment since highschool, so it was good reacquaint myself with how to use it. I also like that I got to practice creating lab reports and learning what to look out for when I make them."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1905,"My greatest take away from this class is that i got to see how physics can be applied to the world around me. For example, the Calorimetry lab, we learned how heat transfer worked between copper and aluminum. Which we found out the best heat conductor is copper. Which is why they use copper pipes to cool CPUs and GPUS in PC. One of the recent labs we learned how waves work. Nurses use sound waves for ultra sounds to help them see inside a stomach. They use the sounds as echos which bounce back to the machine. Overall, these labs helped me see how everyday activities use physics which then im able to explain. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1852,My greatest takeaway from this class is that I can effectively write a lab manual without needing help from an instructor. I am also confident in following instructions when doing a lab and effectively doing an experiment with the help of my peers. I was also able to boost my skills in collaboration and problem-solving because this class mostly tackled these two skills in working with groups.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2002,"My greatest take away will be that I learned how physics is related to everything. I'm not sure how much physics I will use directly in my furture fields, but this class helped me gain a new perspective on how things work, which will be very helpful when I make things later on. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1876,I learned how to work better in groups. A lot of the time the group can be focusing on unessesary classwork that can be done later instead of the important experiement that is infront of us at the time. I also learned how go slipt work into the peers better and what parts I am best at.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1986,"My greatest take away from this class was learning the concepts of physics more, such as getting more in depth with the topic because we got to experience them through equipment. Even though the lab format was repetitive, I think it helped us understand the concept more and got us ready for future lab reports. I liked how some labs did not take too long and not over our lab time because I will have time to do other assignments for my other classes. I will miss the physical interactions with the lab equipment and with lab mates. I liked creating the graphs for the lab because that is another way for us to understand the concept. I really liked the equipment we used because they were all not too complicated to learn how to use them. I was able to leave the lab with the knowledge of how our lab experiment was able to relate to our daily lives."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,602,"My greatest take away from this class was that this was and is flowing very smooth. I think the reason for this is because my professors have done a great job explaining all the materials we have goal through the whole semester. Another thing is that the material that we have gone though the whole semester has been very fun and interesting that makes the class/course interesting. Even though many would say the opposite I would say that it also depends on the people you are doing your labs with, even though sometimes you don't decide who you wait to be with. Overall, I'm glad that we were able to come back in person to du all the experiments just because you don't fully understand how the simulations work."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2018,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that mistakes will happen during experiments, but those mistakes matter a lot for students to learn. The fact that we take notes of all things that basically happen during the experiment, especially disreprencies, help us reflect on what we need to work on/redo or how those mistakes may tamper with our results. I also experienced how asking questions on why certain things happen during the experiment helps me get a better understanding of the concepts. There were times where I did not understand how certain experiments correlated to the concept we were learning during lecture, but after asking my lab partners or the professor questions, I was able to understand."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1953,"Overall, my greatest takeaway from this class has been that doing things by yourself is never going to help you succeed especially as the classes get much more difficult. I found this statement to be more more true once you start opening up and asking questions which ultimately more brains combined means work will be much more easier. That also brings me to my next point which is switching to in person made such a huge difference in terms of understanding, reconnecting your social life, and overall felt much better than sitting behind a computer screen and having to constantly do labs online which didn't really help understand the material."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1860,"The greatest takeaway from this class was how stressful it could be having to rely on others. I was left alone for some of this lab and it was kind of hard either jumping through groups or just being stuck doing a lab on my own. It was a self dependency thing I was not ready for actually having to do. Nonetheless, the class was still pretty fun. I just had a hard time getting over how the situation I was in and it didn't help stimulate my drive to complete anything. I felt back a little by all the things that happened with my group and it was a bit messy and hard to manage. It was weird being in that environment but it happens in life and I just did not manage it well."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,3026,"I have a few takeaways from this class. The first is that I'm not the biggest fan on non-mechanics based physics. I've found that most of what I've found interesting in this class was stuff that I could relate to mechanics (that mostly being thermal expansion). Alot of the other labs were interesting and fun, but they didn't grab me. The second is that bad communication ruins group projects. I liked my groupmates, but when we didn't have proper lines of communication, both in and out of the classroom, Our work suffered. The worst part was when one person handled one thing without coordinating with the others. This often resulted in us having to redo that particular one.The third takeaway I had was that you ALWAYS TYPE YOUR REPORTS. They were so much nicer when typed, I'm proud of those ones.Of these, I think the most important one is the second, but the most meaningful to me is the first. The second is something that I knew, but it was just helpful to have reinforced. The first was far more actionable for me. I can use that to help me find internships/jobs that actually interest me instead of just resume-padding."
