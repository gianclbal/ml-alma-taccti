This class can help me achieve these goals my explaining the concepts in a lab scenario to reinforce the ideas learned in lecture. So far, the class has explained the difference between physics 240 and thermodynamics. Thermodynamics mainly looks at the everything regarding heat, while physics 240 looks at everything regarding heat and cooling. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1852,"One of my greatest goals right now is to be able to graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in Civil Engineering. Once I obtain my degree, I want to have a good job that pays good money. In this way, I want to be able to pay back my parents for their sacrifices by bringing us here to the US. Living here has been a struggle, especially in the first few years. I also want to be able to go back to my hometown in the Philippines and visit my family there whom I haven't seen for almost seven years. Once I have a stable job, I would also want to be able to travel the world!In the present, I should be able to pass all my classes. One of the things that this class can help me achieve my goals is by learning during the lectures and doing all my homework. When I do my homework correctly and understand the concepts for this class, then it'll allow me to take the next step which is to take a class that requires this course. Since my classes build on each other, it is important that I succeed in my current classes first. If I succeed in my current classes, I am able to move forward with my next classes faster.In conclusion, I need to pass this class so that I can move on to another class that could lead to obtaining my degree."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1842,"To got he ling way around, my very end of live goal is to build up a nest egg of sorts and move off to Rwanda or something of the sorts and design irrigation and other things to help local areas. The number one killer of people in the world is dirty water. Some of the deadliest diseases live in the worlds most populated areas' water canals. Its mostly due to the fact that a lot of places don't have working sewer systems. This class is part of my education which will facilitate that dream. With a lot of hard work I know i can reach it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,602,"One of my goals is to get good grades in all my classes so that I can graduate on time. Anther thing I've always wanted to do is able to be involved in school organizations and activities. Even though it won't be that easy with the pandemic I will try to find something that will be convenient. Despite the fact that I only had one year of college experience, I attempted to keep up with the events at San Francisco State, but you can't always keep up with everything. This class has helped me by keeping each other informed about what is going on in and outside of the classroom. Communicating with your peers might make you feel as if you're a part of something. It doesn't matter if it's for homework or school events. I believe that with enough time, I would be able to achieve my goal."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1986,"My goals are to graduate college hopefully in two years, find a stable job that makes me happy, and take more time enjoying the Earth and nature by going on walks, hikes, and vacation. This class can help me achieve these goals by getting me ready to understand the concepts taught in this class and help me understand why and how things work in life which may be related to my future job since I am majoring in Civil Engineering. I never really had a good understanding of physics until now because this class is combining physics and calculus 3 together which helps me much better than learning physics itself since I am good at math and understand math more than physics, but hopefully that will change after taking this class. After taking two physics classes and this being my last one to take hopefully, I will definitely miss physics because physics is everywhere in our lives, but we are too busy to realize that."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1860,"My goals are to become a civil engineer and this class is a stepping stone that I need in order to get my dream job. From learning how to work in groups to the actual properties of the class, I know that all the pieces of information I’m going to get and every aspect of the class will eventually help me perform in my professional career, as much as it is helping in my collegiate career. For example, being able to manage our time and such because we do not have forever to actually perform the experiments is a vital skill I have been using to excel in this class. Not only that but I have also been adapting to the various different topics we have been using to learn and perform said experiments. It is important to also keep in mind the voices of others and being able to disburse the work evenly."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2018,"My goal is to become a power engineer, but in order to do so, I have many subgoals to acheive beforehand. For example, I would first need my degree which requires to pass my classes. In order to pass my classes, I need a system of study habits and ways of solving different problems.

2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1902,"My goal is to make it through college and receive my degree in electrical engineering. This class will help me achieve that goal as it is a necessary class for me to take it, but it also helps teach me things that I might need for later classes. It will mostly prepare me for the calculations and problem solving that I need to develop before I reach upper division courses. Working in this lab class can also be beneficial as it teaches us how to work together as a group to finish the lab. It also forces us to learn group communication and how to put ideas together in an efficient way. Working in a lab also allows us to become familiar with experiment taking along with how to correctly write reports which will be beneficial to aspiring engineers. Overall, this class will help me reach my goal by preparing me for classes and situations I will most likely experience in the future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2002,"My goals overall is to become an entrepreneur and a mechanical and civil engineer. I plan to work in companies like Tesla, Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc., to gain more knowledge and hands-on experience, and then branch off into my own company. I know I will need to understand how things work with one another in order to achieve and be successful in my goals. My goals for this class are to learn more about physics while also figuring out how it relates to the world around me. I also know that physics will be a key component for me since I'm double majoring in Mechanical and Civil Engineering, and this class will help me grasp the real world examples and uses of the formulas used and given to us. Even though this class is not in person, it still helps me get an early idea of things and mechanics that I will need later on in my fields of work and occupations. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2009,"One of my goals for this class is to use what I have learned from this class and apply it to my major which is civil engineering. The ability to understand and analyze what I have learned in this class would mean that I can use different subjects in this lab and use that for civil engineering. The other goal for this class is to pass this class, so it would not slow down my college plans. To help this goal I would have to spend time studying and go over the problems to understand the subject matter and this would help me complete the work in the class. My overall goal for college is to have a career in civil engineering and this class will help me understand how physics affects the construction and the forces on a building. So understanding what I learn in this class will help me to have a career in civil engineering."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1953,"I aspire of many goals in life but one of the most desired that I have, is being able to be a licensed engineer as I really want to go into civil engineering and more specifically into structural engineering. In order to acquire such a goal like that I need to do many steps beforehand like having a strong resume, studying hard enough in order to pass my PE exam and most importantly, passing all of my classes which is precisely where this class comes in. In order to become an engineer I have to pass this and many of the other classes that I am taking which is why this class can help me achieve my goals. Besides this, it was also help me get a better understanding about physics as it isn't an easy class and i've always had a goal to try and understand physics better so by taking this lab and the non lab section, I will get a better understanding which will help me acquire such goals."

I enjoy how varied the topics are in this class. Another one of my goals is to get through this semester and come out knowing I’m can achieve my overall goal of getting an engineering degree and doing what I enjoy with mechanical objects and this class will help me add upon my pre-existing study skills and also get back into the routine of being back in person 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,3028,"My goal is to be a mechanical engineer. This class can help me to achieve my goals by learning to do everything on hands and every school has laboratories where students may undertake research, experiments, or even learn new things with the assistance of the internet facility. Laboratories where students can perform research, experiments, or even learn new things with the help of the internet facility. In a basic experiment to see which paper aeroplane flies the farthest, the advantage of conducting the research inside, in a controlled setting, is that variables such as wind will have less of an impact on the results. Engineers use laboratories to create, test, and improve technical devices. Scientific laboratories can be found at schools and universities, business, government, and military establishments, and even aboard ships and spacecraft as research and learning environments."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1907,"In terms of school and my education, my goals are to graduate with a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering. This class is just another stepping stone in achieving this goal. I have learned a lot in this lab class already and I hope to learn learn more in the following weeks. Not only am I learning about physics, but also about how I learn best as a student. I enjoy doing hands on labs as it helps me to better understand all of the concepts and theories that are discussed in the lecture. I have realized that when I just read a textbook or watch a video, I do not learn or retain the information as well. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,3027,"My goals are to achieve a maximum intelligence stat as soon as possible so that the rest of my life I can ride that knowledge all the way to wealth and fame. This class is a great source of physics fundamentals necessary for me to learn more complicated concepts in the future. Through my understanding of physics I hope to achieve many milestones and achievements. I would like to revive the Rocketry club here at SFSU, thats got a lot of overlapping concepts with what we are learning here. Unfortunately my goals dont particularly specify that I need to do all the homework thrown at me but I guess if I want the stupid degree and piece of paper I might as well do some homework. I have found that if I pass classes and participate in research I'll have an acceptable GPA and lots of publication, articles and papers and such, even github repositories with my name as the contributor. Is this a way to bypass the insane competition in GPA values and instead pass by all those 4.0 nerds and get a good job or grad student position without having a homework oriented life? Maybe, maybe its just more homework."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1931,My goal and future career are to become an Ocean engineer working with submersibles and water drones to explore the ocean more or to help with the environment. This class will help me gain the fundaments and knowledge needed to conduct my profession. Applying physics could also help me to identify situations that might occur in a lab or in the field of STEM. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1930,"My goals for this overall semester is basically just to get back into the flow of how my life was before the pandemic. I was going to school full time, working part time, going to the gym almost daily, and keeping up with my studies very frequently. This class has helped myself with its constant work and school schedule, so hopefully I can return to how I was before the pandemic started.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1905,"My goals are to be able to make a company of my own after graduating college. I am currently trying to graduate with my electrical degree. This class helps me to be able to reach these goals by showing me the physics behind the labs and projects. For example, for one section of my company I want to be able to provide solar panels to houses. Panels use conductive wires that uses the sun rays and turns it into an electric field. Then the conductive wire brings the electricity into the inverter that turns it in AC power that will help run the house. With the help of this class I was able to find out which conductor heats up the fastes and which one is most likely to lose heat. Also physics has sections of electric circuits which help me be able to understand how parallel and series circuits work. Also how the voltage and current drop throughout the circuit which will help me design electrical diagrams. "
