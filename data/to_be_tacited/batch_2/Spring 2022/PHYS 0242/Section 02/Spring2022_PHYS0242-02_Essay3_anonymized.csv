2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1967,"One question that I have is what the differences between a Y vs X graph and a Y vs T graph for harmonic motion. For the graphs, a good way to look at them is that they are related, but key differences are that the Y vs T is a representation of the oscillation at a certain point at different times. The Y vs X graph is a representation of the oscillation of a system as a whole at a certain time. For example, comparing the graphs, for the Y vs T graph, a point at t = 0 it will be at y = 1, (0,1). This point was measured at x = 2. When translating this to the Y vs X graph, when the whole system is being measured at t = 0, the point that was originally at (0,1) for the Y vs T will now be at (2,1), because that is where the snapshot of that point was at t = 0."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1876,"I learned that there are 3 types of damped frequencies, underdamped, critically damped, and over damped in week 7. Damped frequencies are the ones who maintain equilibrium. Underdamped frequencies move quickly to equilibrium. And finally over damped move slowly to equilibrium."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1905,"How can thermal expansion been seen in real life and why is it important? Thermal expansion can be seen in bridges throughout the different seasons of the year. During the summer, the heat would cause the bridge bed to expand and it will shrink during the cold season. This happens because when there is a high temperature acting on the bridge it causes the bridge bed molecules to move faster which causes them to take up more space. Then when its cold it gets the molecules to move slower and start to get compact and use less space up. During our lab we use three different rods(Aluminum, Steel, and Copper). Aluminum increased in length the most followed by copper and then steel. This was because Aluminum and copper had their molecules expand due to their high change in temperature. Leaving your car out in the sun causes the gasoline in your tank to heat up and expand itself in volume. During summer when I was working in construction, we had many calls where customers wanted us to redo their concrete that had crack over time. This was caused because concrete expands when the temperature rises and if you don’t space the joints correctly to allow the concrete to expand without hitting one another, they will crack. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2062,"One idea that we covered in class was the notion that waves are oscillators that move in more than one direction. An example is a pulse caused when someone pulls on rope and then swings one end up and down while the other end is held in place. I have a question about how do people use this knowledge of waves to impact how they design infrastructure. An answer to this question in my notes is the example of earthquakes, which cause different types of waves to ripple through the earth. The different waves cause different types of movements along the surface, such as the up and down movement caused by P(compression)-waves. This knowledge can benefit society by allowing people to design buildings within earthquake zones that can move with the different types of earthquake waves rather than collapsing by staying too rigid."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2036,"Using the information from the thermal expansion laboratory, where and when would the information of thermal expansion be of good use, where would it be useful not to have something thermally expand and lastly, where would it be useful for an object to thermally expand.During the lab we were able to see and test different metal rods and find out what happens when subjected to a semi-controlled heat source and from that figure out how much each metal expanded in length. In general this doesn't really help the average person on a personal scale but the knowledge when creating things that every day people use is immense where you don't want a car becoming an oven in the heat or making it so when its super hot, the car becomes 1.2 times a large basically breaking it. As well as many phones, computers and other electronical devices and not to mention anything that gets hot in general to have a heat-sink or something that is amazing at heat transfer to cool the object down. Just like aluminum foil which you can use for baking and when you take it out it cools down really really quickly. You can basically think of anything metal or even just any material and then think about what its being used for or in and you can realize that material has been handpicked because of its thermal expansion properties."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,3026,"Why is knowing the resonance frequency of structures important?The resonance frequency of a structure is when the frequency of an applied force to that structure is at the same frequency as any oscillations that the structure is experiencing and the force is in the same direction of the movement of said structure. This results in larger and larger oscillations as long as such a force is applied. If such a force is applied for long enough, oscillations within a structure may cause the building to suffer a catastrophic structural failure. Such a failure can result in the destruction of a structure, such as the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse (which has some lovely, if horrifying, footage). Understanding the resonant frequency of a structure and the tolerance of such a structure for oscillation can allow buildings to be designed to maintain structural integrity for many foreseeable instances where such a resonant force to be applied. Overall, structures must be designed to avoid collapsing due to forces from wind, seismic waves, oceanic waves, etc.; and knowing the resonant frequency of these structures in an important step in preventing unnecessary damage or collapse."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1931,"I wanted to review calorimetry Lab 9. My questions were 1) what is Calorimetry? 2) What is the difference between copper and aluminum Calorimetry 3) what is the main reason for the increase of Calorimetry in metal compared to others. When reviewing the lab and lecture I completely forgot about what Calorimetry is. After looking back at my notes and lab, I was lost and I had to ask google for a basic understanding of Calorimetry. Google says that ""Calorimetry is the process of measuring the amount of heat being absorbed or released during a chemical reaction"". With this information, I was able to understand and remember why my group created a chart and measured heat during our lab. Looking back on our heat measurement between Copper and Aluminum, it seems that copper heats up and cools down faster than Aluminum. this means it will take aluminum more energy to increase or decrease temperature. Copper has more calorimetry. We conducted our lab to find our equation and follow our lab manual. Even though we were off for copper and Aluminum by a decent amount, we were able to get a consistent result. overall our lab was successful and our chart and equation pretty much match our lab manual and procedure."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1930,"One topic that was discussed during class that could be applied to real life situations would be from the second law of thermodynamics. This topic would be seen in car engines and water heaters. We would notice that it would become impossible to make a heat engine that will produce an equal amount of work towards a reservoir. We would notice the transfer of heat from hot to cold and vis versa from different pumps and engines the we would notice in our everyday life. The coefficient of performance would be noticeable from either a heating mode or a cooling mode, where it can be calculated from the amount of energy transferred at the desired temperature divided by the work done by the desired pump. This idea of heat transfer can be seen in refrigerators, car engines, heat pumps, and more real life examples that we use in our everyday lives. Their would be a higher coefficient of performance that would reflect more on the efficiency of the heat pump."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1902,"How does thermal expansion affect the world?Thermal expansion is an important factor to consider when it comes to infrastructure. All building materials are subject to thermal expansion and this could affect how they are used or how long they last. One industry that deals with thermal expansion is the railroad industry. When installing the rails, they have to compensate for how the rails will expand during hot weather as they could buckle and go off alignment. Bridges are also prone to expanding and contracting with the changes in weather which can wear down the integrity of the bridge. In response to this, bridges are installed with joints that allow it to expand and retract to prevent it from deteriorating. Thermal expansion is also involved with the problem with global warming. This is because sea levels will rise as the weather gets warmer which will cause problems for oceanside civilizations. These are only a handful of examples of how thermal expansion affects the world and people’s lives. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1852,"In the lecture, I asked how are seismic waves and earthquakes related?I learned that seismic waves are actually caused by earthquakes. I also learned that seismic waves have different types which are P waves, S waves, and Rayleigh waves. P waves travel faster than transverse waves. S waves are perpendicular to the direction in which the wave is moving, while Rayleigh waves travel through ripples. Rayleigh waves are also often the ones that do the most damage after an earthquake occurs."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2018,"A lab I really enjoyed was the thermal expansion lab because I got to see materials actually expand due to the rise in temperature. After heating up the different rods, I also got to see which materials could withstand higher temperatures without there being a change in size. This applies to many people lives since traintracks or any sort of railing based transportation can be affected by thermal expansion. It is very important that materials chosen to build railroads can withstand higher temperatures without expanding or else trains can completely derail due to tracks completely changing in form from thermal expansion. People can get severly hurt or suffer fatal injuries because of this meaning understanding thermal expansion especially in terms of building railroads."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,602,"What are sound waves?Something that many people don't consider to think much of are sound waves. Longitudinal waves, also known as compression waves, are used to transfer sound through gases, plasma, and liquids. The wavelength of a periodic wave is its spatial period, or the distance over which the wave's structure repeats. There are even sound waves traveling through the air. It may, however, be transmitted as both longitudinal and transverse waves through solids. Longitudinal sound waves are alternating pressure departures from equilibrium pressure waves that cause compression and rarefaction in localized areas. Sound waves may be mathematically defined in the same way as a wave on a string can. The quality of musical instruments, stereos, and other sound systems is affected by temperature, not only how quickly sound travels. The speed of sound is a fundamental element of the material and is determined by the medium through which the waves move. For example, the speed of sound in gases depends on temperature. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2040,"For my paper I was thinking of writing about thermal expansion, and how it influences the design of structures. With the changing temperatures, certain materials also change in size, and how much they change all differ. This must have an impact on the choice of materials when designing structures with varying climate, they must account for the size which it shrinks during the winter, and the size that it expands during the summer. Changing the materials might also affect the initial design of the structure, be it due to the price or the nature of the material. These things are important to consider as an engineer, we design large structures that will be used by many people. We must take all these variables into account because we want to limit any errors may happen (ideally we want 0 errors), and be sure that structures are safe for people to use."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2009,"Why does copper heat up faster than water and how does this apply to daily life?The reason why copper and some other metals heat up faster than water is because they have a different specific heat. Water has a very high specific heat at 4.186J/g °C while copper has a lower specific  .385J/g °C. The reason why water has a high specific heat is that the molecules of water can absorb more heat than copper. This is why when boiling water it takes a while for the water to become hot while, a copper pan on a stove heats up quickly. Something that specific heat is used in is the cooling of computers. For example, some computers will use a copper base because it has a low specific heat which allows it to quickly transfer heat away from a CPU. Water is also used in some computers with water cooling and water because of its high specific heat is very good at absorbing heat but not becoming hot. This is used to carry the heat away from the copper base to a radiator where the water cools down."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1986,"A concept that was covered in class in the past few weeks in the lab was calorimetry. My question is how are we able to find specific heat of some element by going through a thoughtful experiment. I have thought about it and after having it being explained in lab class, it is starting to make sense. We were able to measure all the data in the calorimetry equation and just plugged in all the values to find specific heat, which we did in the lab for Week 5. This information might be used to benefit society because if we need to know the specific heat of a metal perhaps and see if we are able to use it in the process of constructing a building, we can do a short experiment and find the specific heat easily. A great example of a correct use of calorimetry would be finding any other values in the calorimetry equation if we needed to know the mass of an object that is being used in the experiment, and etc. Another example is finding the change in temperature also by using the calorimetry equation if the other values are known and being able to do this kind of experiment anywhere with the proper equipment."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1860,"One thing that comes to mind was our radiation lab. What will cause a bulbs intensity to increase or decrease. From what we saw whenever we allowed more power to flow into our bulb, the light radiated more and in turn its intensity was greater. Although, one aspect that mattered was the distance, or r, of the bulb to the measuring device. The further it was the less intense the light was. This could be used in every day life just based on the bulb we have in a home. Some may find it annoying or irritating if their houses lights are too bright. It may makes rooms hotter than they need to be but knowing about how the intensity of light works can help out with this problem. This was an issue in a tv show I watched where the main character could not pick out the right bulb for his building, as choosing thousands of bulbs may cause issues and such depending on how bright they are or how dim they are. Doing that lab reminded me of how true it can be that even light can be controlled in a sense by us if we choose to do so."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2017,The wave physics that we have been covering could be applied to communications  as radio waves are used throughout our technology to help us communicate with one another. Knowing how to calculate the intensity of a wave emitted from a source could help determine the quality of the signal received between a cell tower and a cell phone. The calculations for the longitudinal and transversal components of a wave could be used to calculate the predicted damage done my a tsunami so that engineers know where to build seawalls. One could also use photons to transmit large amounts of data through fiber optic cables allowing for undersea cables to allow for global internet connectivity. The equations for the power from a wave could be used to determine the power outputted by a piston in an engine that is causing a wheel to turn. The calculations we learned to determine sound intensity and conversion into decibels could be used to determine the level of ear protection needed for a construction worker operating loud machinery. A song writer uses the harmonic frequencies to write music that is pleasing to the ear and that the notes in the song line up with dividable frequencies of the chord being used.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1907,"During the past week or so, we have been learning about sound; everything from sound waves to how people perceive sound and loudness. I find this topic really interesting because I enjoy playing instruments and learning about how the sounds work and resonate. Understanding how sound waves work has helped me gain a better understanding of how the instruments work. I used to play the trumpet and saxophone which are two very different instruments. The amount of air needed to produce sound is different and the keys that produce the sound on the instrument are very different. The trumpet requires more air and is overall a higher frequency instrument compared to the alto saxophone which requires a little less air and is a lower frequency instrument. Frequency is proportional to the pitch of the instrument, so a higher frequency means a higher pitch and a lower frequency means a lower pitch. We also learned about the Doppler effect which is an increase or decrease in sound, light, or any time of wave, depending on how a source is moving with respect to an observer. When discussing sound, the doppler effect causes the pitch to suddenly change as the source is moving towards and away from the observer. This topic has been really fun to learn about! "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1842,"I feel like the most useful and impactful thing that we went over in class recently has been waves. A lot of things can be explained as waves. The question I have is since a wave is just a different expression energy, could we theoretically use waves to charge remotely over a large area and if yes, why haven't we?After some research, there is a company that is able to use radio waves to transfer energy to our batteries. Its a little startup called Guru. They use larger frequency radio waves and this allows more energy to be transferred. The biggest public worry is the general mistrust of wave technology and the like but, the reason that it doesn't matter in this instance is that the waves don't interact with you or your clothes or anything. They are targeted and only interact with what they are meant to."
