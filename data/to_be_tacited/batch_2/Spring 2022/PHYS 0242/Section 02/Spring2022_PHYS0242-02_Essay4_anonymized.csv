2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2009,"Online classes have not impacted much for my learning much. For example, in some cases, it has helped me relieve stress from commuting and from staying on campus doing nothing to burn time until my next class. For self-care, I am taking time to do things that I like and relieve stress like watching movies or playing games since online classes have given me more spare time to do things that I did not have time for during in-person classes. I do have some concerns because for some online classes it is hard to do things like labs. An example would be surveying where it is very helpful to be using the equipment and working with classmates to solve problems, but for online classes, this can not happen which limits the things that you can learn. My well-being and mental status I good since I adapted to online classes and in-person classes well since this semester started."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2018,"Online classes has certainly had a few benefits, but did negatively affect my learning experiences. To begin with, online classes allowed me to not have to worry about spending so much time commuting to school, since now I spend about three hours every school day commuting on BART and taking a bus. This led me to have much more time for studying and doing homework in the past, as well as have more leisure time on my hands. Grades were also a bit easier to keep up since most of my professors saw no point in closed note quizzes and tests because it would be too difficult for them to be able to prevent students from cheating, so quizzes and exams were much more easier for those that allowed notes to be used which was the case for most of them. However, there were a few negatives as well. Although I had good grades, the amount of information I retained was not as much as what I would have liked. I saw myself very distracted through zoom because of my learning environment and less motivated to interact via online with other students or my professors. This negatively affects my current learning experience since much of the courses I took online are the foundations of what I am learning in person now."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1839,"This semester I have one class online which asynchronous and it is a lab class. It hasn't impacted my learning at all because the concepts I learn in lecture are applied in lab. The lab class is electric circuits. The concern for learning is being able to apply the concepts in future jobs and being able to remember the information that is given. Knowledge is a powerful tool when it is used properly. I want to be able to work smarter with the knowledge I have and not work harder. My well-being is separate in learning varies depending on whether I am in class or doing work. When I am in class I will make sure I am fuel and when I am doing homework, I will take breaks as necessary. If I able to complete my work without any distractions or breaks, then I am able to take a longer break which provides much more satisfaction compared to taking 10 minute breaks. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1861,"Reflection #4I think online classes have their own advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are we can  learn by just sitting at home but, there are many disadvantages. I think the very first thing that we  lack in online learning is experience. When we are on-campus, we interact with many people.  Some students are busy creating some awesome project or some sharing their experience they  had during their internships. Also, we can take help from professors as I think when we interact  with somebody face-to-face, we have better understanding. In online classes, it’s not like that, it  feels like something is missing or we don’t get that feeling! In free-time, I try to learn some course regarding my aim like I work on Solidworks, Autocad and some  Python. Also, to remain fit I exercise daily. Everyone should remain fit and eat healthy food under today’s condition. Also, the covid condition is better now as compared to before but, still we have to be careful."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1907,"This semester is the first time that I have had in-person classes at SFSU. One thing that kind of caught me off guard was the fact that since the beginning of the pandemic, I have had only online classes and then all of a sudden, basically all of my classes were all in-person. Just when I was getting used to/adjusting to online classes, I had to switch gears again to adjust to in-person classes. Since this semester has started, I do find myself way more tired due to being at school all day and having to walk across campus in between classes (not something we had to consider when taking classes online). However, I do enjoy having classes in-person because it is nice to collaborate with other students and have easier access to teachers and other resources. When I am not studying or at school, I like to set aside time for myself to do things that I enjoy/need for my well-being including taking walks, working out, spending time with family/my dogs, and resting. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1842,"Well, as we havent been in online classes Im going to ignore that but I will say that I have been doing a decent amount of self care. Giving myself rest days and working out a lot. Making sure I can engage in my hobbies and not get swallowed by life. The one upside about ADHD is that it's kinda like your brain giving yourself free drugs every one and then so it helps a lot when trying to keep myself afloat. Ive also been trying to eat healthier recently and have been losing some weight which is great."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1902,"Online classes was not a useful substitute when it actually came to my learning. It was hard to focus on my academics and to pay attention during any online class as it was easy to be distracted. It caused my academic work ethic to decline and made me lazier than how I have been before. Since I am back in person, I have been able to focus much more on my studies and I am able to retain more information since I am more immersed in the environment. Staying active and having real personal interactions with other classmates helps my learning and personal life. The only thing I hope to improve is my ability to keep my social and academic life stable, while keeping my grades up. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2036,"There are many ways that online classes have impacted my learning skills, I would say the most being that it is never really hands on and even when it is hands on it will be alone and just yourself and not able to efficiently bounce ideas off of others. I feel that another impact of online classes on my learning is that most of the information is hand fed due to the lack of participation because of the disconnect I felt when having a person on a screen vs in person and I am guilty for not participating sometimes. Some self care practices for me was to do things like my hobbies or see my partner and friends to get the in person social interaction that was lacking in online courses. Another very important self care practice for me is to exercise and take frequent very short breaks every problem or two as a reward system and mental breaks or to quickly do something that wasn’t sitting like standing up and walking around my room or the house for a minute then coming back."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,3027,"Online classes have thrown me off my game a lot. They have made maths more difficult than necessary, it has made chemistry labs non interactive, it has caused for me cyrcadian rythm hardships. Its been terrible. The only upside is sleeping during zoom, which just drops my grade and causes more anxeity and stress down the line so all in all this plandemic has been trash and my education has suffered. I demand a refund and an honorary degree."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1905,"In my senior year of high school, it was half online and the other half in person. I remember getting a email saying we will have two weeks off around January 2020. But it change the way i learn so much because I always been better at hand on work and really bad with reading a textbook. But then my first two 3 semesters of college it was just all online classes. I really enjoyed it because it meant I didn't have to commute to San Francisco. I also was able to sleep in more or be able to work on homework so much faster because as soon as I was done with class I was already home. I remember after the first few months all I wanted to do was to go into in-person classrooms. But now I feel like I been doing online classes forever, that I rather just stay online than in person. But I also like how in persons classes allow me to be able to communicate with others and be able to feel like i'm actually at class. If I didn't have to commute and waste so much money on gas, then I would really enjoy in person class alot more. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2040,"In the beginning, online classes really harmed my education, classes were a lot less engaging and not as interesting. It has lowered my drive and motivation as a student. Though towards the end I began to adjust to the online classes and was able to learn in that environment, only for it to end and go back to in person and have to readjust to in person. The transition between online and in person was really what held me back in becoming the best student that I could. However I learned that I can adapt to the situation that I am in, and i think it will be a useful skill for the future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1852,"What a coincidence that I got this question when I'm doing the online lab while the rest of my peers are doing the in-person lab! One of the things that have impacted my learning for this online lab is that I don't get to have the lecture at the beginning of the class where I get the information before the actual experiment begins. I just had to work by myself and figure out each question alone. This is one of the cons of the online option. For self-care, I just make sure that I eat my meals on time so I could have the energy to be able to finish my lab. I also try to go out for walks and get fresh air for peace of mind. My number one concern is still COVID because we never know where it is and where we would potentially get it from."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2062,"Online classes made it more difficult to interact with my classmates and get to know them. I also find online classes more exhausting than in-person classes. The main way that I practice self-care is with meditation, which allows me to calm my mind and increase my concentration. I feel that online classes make it harder to learn many of my topics since I feel less willing to ask questions or participate in discussions. The reason for this is that I need to unmute Zoom rather than simply speaking. I have tried leaving Zoom unmuted, but there is the occasional sound at home that would annoy the class."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1930,I personally do not believe online classes are better than in person classes. Since we are just glue to the screen on the daily this would cause yourself to be very warn out of looking at the said screen. Also the interaction between everyone in a zoom  call does not replicate the same amount of interaction between student to student in a in person setting.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,3026,"I'm not sure how much online classes have impacted my learning this semester, as I'm not taking any. I guess I can just write on how I'm handling self care, and it sums up to two things: Procrastination and Gaming. I put off assignments (*cough* this one *cough*) until way later than I should, but it seems to be treating me just fine. I've been playing games (tabletop and video) with friends more and more since covid began, I guess, and that has been very helpful to my mental health. Mostly I've been playing/planning TTRPG's (Dungeons and Dragons, Shadowrun, GURPS, etc) and it's very cathartic. I've also been listening to alot of sci-fi fantasy audiobooks (YAY Expance Book 9!!!). Those help me keep sane when there isn't anything else to do, so that's a thing. Lastly, I learned to cook. Cooking is one of life's great pleasures (as I've learned), and If one does not cook, one misses out on that great pleasure. Nothing beats being proud of something you've cooked and serving it to friends and family."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,602,"Online classes have impacted my learning a lot since COVID-19 because we were not getting that one on one with our professors or classmates. Usually when you are in class you can turn around and ask a classmate for help. But now that we are in person it's a bit better, even though there are still some restrictions. Like before all you can do is send an email to the professor and ask them what you need help but when you think about it imagine how many emails they are receiving a day. There is a lot of students that do good on their online classes but in my case I feel like I do okay. What I do for self-care is wake up early and get ready to feel good about myself so I can start my day. I try to finish everything as soon as possible so that I would have some hours at the end of the week for myself but sometimes its hard since I have other responsibilities. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2002,"My senior year in high school was online so the change wasn't that sudden. I would prefer in person but online helps me a lot since I got to stay home and get extra family support. I have one in-person class this semester and it has helped me a lot, especially since it also is a lab. For my self-care, I decided to get back into creative writing, drawing, and I picked up a hobby of Brazillian Jiu Jitsu. I have made some friends but since I could not meet them yet we would have zoom game nights or facetime each other. I have fixed some bad habits as well such as, biting my nails, I fixed my sleep schedule and I gto better at time management. I think that is also something positive that came from having to take college courses online, is that I had to get better at time management because teachers can't/don't remind you as often as in person. I still can not wait to get back fully in person though."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2017,Online classes have made it a lot harder to learn the material particularly in labs. Labs where one thing that never really could be replicated well online and being back in person has helped a lot. While for lectures there isn't a huge difference between being in person and being online with labs it is a big deal since it is where we apply the things we learned to real life and we cannot do this effectively through online simulations. Online classes have made it a lot harder to learn and my grades took a bit of a downturn but I have since gotten them a back up while classes have been recently in person. I feel like being isolated in an online learning environment can work for some people but for myself it really just caused a lot of depression and anxiety which has since gone away being in person.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1967,"I feel like online classes have helped with some learning, but at the same time has negatively impacted my learning. It helped with us being able to study on our own time, but this also led to me having a harder time with procrastination and not being motivated to do some of the work. Last semester, I took a lot of classes, and it was really stressful, which I think negatively affected my health. For this semester, I made sure to take less classes so that I could reduce my levels of stress and made more of an effort put my mental health first so that I can learn to my fullest."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,1986,"Online classes have impacted my learning by making me pay attention in class less when I am tired which then makes me look at the recorded lecture on my own time when I am awake to have concepts going into my head, interacting and meeting people less because breakout rooms over Zoom does not feel the same when we are in person, and not getting the full concept because it is hard to communicate with the teacher if the teacher just wants to go through the lecture fast because they want us to cover everything that we need to know or learn, but teachers having office hours definitely helps a lot. What I am doing for self-care is finishing up all my homework as fast as possible so that I can spend time with my family and my dog, workout, take walks, talk to friends over phone because of quarantine, and do chores around the house. Concerns I have for my learning and well-being is that I will get uninterested in the topic in class and will doze off during the day because of having to learn online which is adding more screen time to what we had before which is doing homework on the screen and going on social media or watching shows/movies on our screens."
