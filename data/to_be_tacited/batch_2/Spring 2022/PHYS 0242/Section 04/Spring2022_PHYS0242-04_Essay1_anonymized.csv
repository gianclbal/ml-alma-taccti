2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3032,The reason why I chose to go into the STEM field is because the STEM field is all about critical thinking and being curious on how thing work and why things work the way they do. When I was a little kid my mom would always say questioned a lot of things which I'm sure many kids usually do but as I grew older I continued to wonder why on how things work the way they do especially bridges and buildings. I would often go with my father to work ( he is a contractor) and see what type of material he would buy and  for certain things and I also look at his blueprints and see why certain layouts would work out . Things like that really caught my attention so I think that is why I wanted to join the STEM field also STEM is all about innovations and I hope one day Im part of one that last for decades and makes history 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3033,"""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?""I want to get into STEM filed so I can have my own General Contracting company that self performs rebar, structural steel and concrete. My Scotland trip in 2016, is what truly inspired me to study civil engineering. I fascinated by the different buildings and how long the different structures in Dundee, continue to hold up. My main goal has always been to utilize a degree within my community. My other dream is to have a Bay Area Design Build Structural Engineering Firm: where I can design structural components of bridges, towers, and buildings that are pleasing to the eye in low income communities. Low-income communities don’t have to look like the stereotypical low-income community. The different skill sets, and concepts of this program compliments my dream massively. Community development is what my dream is exemplifying through civil engineering. My interest in engineering, stems from a desire to help others, and having love for technical aspects of everyday life. I grew up in San Francisco, I want to impact and improve the lives of people in my community.  People are very much impacted by the actions of those working to better the community around them. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1854,"When I was young exactly in grade two, my mom told me that I’m going to be smart in math because she was giving me and my older brother a math test one day before our exams begins. I finished the test so quick and having full mark, then I helped my brother on his test because I saw him struggling. I managed to solve a multiply problems and I’ve not learned it at school yet! When I was in high school, I was better than my mother in math and she is a teacher in math. All this story brought me to begin my journey on studying engineering which has to have a lot of math. On the other hand, having engineering degree in my country could put me on place to work that have a very good salary. I also wanted to be a dentist put I couldn’t get the scholarship for it. Engineering sounds fun too!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,603,"The reason I want to go into the STEM field is I was always interested in mathematics and engineering when I was a kid. The reason why I was so interested in my childhood because my dad works in trucking dirt, gravel and concrete back when I would accompany my father for example bringing gravel necessary to build a house there would be always an engineer or an architect with blueprints of how the house would look like. I was always interested in construction but I wanted to do more than just build I wanted to see if I could help layout a structure of building something that I helped do other than hard labor. I always knew that the STEM field is a really difficult field to pursue but I choose this field because science, physics, and mathematics were always interesting for me how can gravity on a force act upon it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3034,"The reason why I wanted to into the STEM field is because of my previous experience working as an electrician for helicopters and jets. I realized that I loved fixing and troubleshooting circuits and by doing so learned a lot about how they work and stuff. So I wanted to go into the electrical engineering to study more on this subject and one day be the one designing and testing these circuits instead of following a manual and fixing them. Working on circuits that were built maybe in the late 1900 and early 2000's, I could see how they could have been improved and made better using todays  technology. So naturally after I got my certification as an electrician, I decided to pursue and finish school in the STEM field. Even thought this major has been difficult so far, I really do enjoy everything I have learned from engineering and what it has taught me about the real world and how it relates to what we learn. Although I do not really enjoy the heavy conceptualization that this major involves and the math, I gotta do it  anyways if I want to make the big bucks. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1865,"I want to go to the STEM field because science and technology are responsible for the advancement of our society. Without these fields, our world will not be as advanced as it is today, where we enjoy many luxuries such as phones and computers. Specifically, I want to go to the engineering field since engineering deals with problem-solving and using creativity to solve real-world problems. It is a great feeling to solve a complicated problem since it grants gratification. With engineering, you have the potential to change the world. Additionally, technology is one of the most important aspects of our society. Without technology, we would not be able to utilize platforms such as Zoom. With STEM fields many new forms of technology can be made such as electric vehicles, which are all the rage right now and we are very close to seeing self-driving cars on the road soon. In the STEM field, there are many careers with great job outlooks in which you can pick one that grabs your interest."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3035,"""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?"" I want to go into the STEM field because I really enjoy the hands on approach to things, mainly engineering. When I was younger, I was extremely bad at math and it frustrated me that I could never understand the how to solve problems or even memorize a formula. So, it became a goal of mine to really study hard and understand the concept better and soon enough I was getting ahead in my math courses. I started working for Audi and I would talk to the technicians about their work, they had told me its a lot of numbers involved. I became so fascinated with how cars were built and how every engine component was meticulously planned for another component to work properly, I figured out that it was just a giant puzzle piece! I realized engineering was something I could really enjoy as a career, specifically the engineering of cars. Working with cars has become a passion of mine, so I decided to make a career out of it and go into the STEM field!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1836,"I want to go into the stem field because I want to be able to create new ways of transportation and decrease traffic and pollution in the air. I want to be able to help my environment be cleaner and healthier. I also found an interest in engineering because of the design part of it. I also want to create new buildings that would make cities look a lot more interesting, such as one day being able to build different buildings in the same area that are all connected by bridges and people can walk through. It would be a see-through bridge so people can look at the ground beneath them and have amazing views at the top when they look beyond. I feel like this will be something that can change the way people see engineering, People would see engineering as a way to make the world look better and more creative for all."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1091,"Why do I want to go into the stem field? Honestly the only reason I chose STEM was because going into college all that was really emphasized around me was “You need to make money, you need to get a job”. And that meant going into STEM because at the time, that’s all I knew that had “job security”. That’s basically why I chose STEM. But after some time learning about all the different possibilities that could come from being in STEM I could say that I want to be innovative. I want to be able to take on projects that are unique, be in a field where creative, intelligent and open minds come together. I might not know exactly where that is right now, but I’m sure I’ll find it. I think why it might be a little foggy is because there isn’t really a profession that catches my eye that I’ve seen so far. I think getting exposure to what STEM could be is really neglected. It’s not always shown what kind of jobs you can get, what kind of work those jobs do. There’s hundreds of professions that I might find interesting and enjoy, but getting enough knowledge to where I can confidently say that I would want to do that is a little hard."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3036,"People tend to choose STEM majors because they are popular with lots of jobs, so it is easier to find a stable job with good salary. Most people think that if they take the STEM field, they do not need to worry not to get a good future. For me, it is the same reason as many people that it is safer to choose the STEM field than other fields. Moreover, I am not really interested in liberal arts, and for me, it is easier for my life if I choose the STEM field, and STEM are pretty high demand nowadays as technology and science are become more advanced day by day. I also think myself that except the STEM, I am not fitted into any other professionals. Also, many parents want their children choose the STEM field instead of liberal arts, and same with my parent who think only the STEM majors gonna give a better future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3037,"the robotics field with all the new developments that have been happening recently has made me want to explore my major more try different aspects of it to try and implement better solutions to problems that we currently have. plus, I've always found an interest to everything science related since i was a kid. creating new Legos, learning how to code, and learning circuitry."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2020,"I want to go into the stem field because I want to be get my dream job. My dream job is ot be able to become an engineer for disney. I love the creativity, the eater eggs, and all the details that go into disney's themeparks and rides and I find that amazing. It made me so happy to find all the easter eggs and details that are hidden at disney so I beleive I can do the same work and make someone else happy. I wish to design my own section of the themepark and I decided Im going to get there by doing what Im good at which is math and science. Using my skills in stem I will work my way into disney and get my name put down as an imagineer and make some amazing changes that will make people smile like I got to."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,282,"I've been fascinated by the various STEM fields since I was little, and I've stayed just as curious since. I first fell in love with mechanisms and continually took things apart, always trying to figure out why design choices were made. I would build legos all day, and when I grew older I switched to hot glue and Popsicle sticks. Most recently I acquired a 3D printer and have not stopped printing since my Freshman year of SFSU. I now have gotten very interested in electronics, and have been working on many projects, 90% remain unfinished lol. I'm very interested in all these subjects, now I just really need to find a job that encapsulates them all, and doesn't make me hate STEM while I'm at it!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1886,"I want to go into the stem field because engineering has always had my attention. I have always liked working on cars and have always been mechanically inclined towards anything that moved or has some sort of engine. So growing up i knew i wanted to have a job that involved this. Mechanical engineering was the perfect balance between working on projects and also studying how they objects are designed , produced and manufactured. My goal once i am done with my undergrad is to work for an automotive brand and help design cars. Even though the stem field is really complicated and tough i have been pushing my way through plus being a first gen student only adds to the pressure. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1841,"""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?"" I really haven't thought about this that much but ever since high school I have always been interested in math and science, other subjects such as English, writing and history didn't interest me that much. It amazes me how much we are able to learn and progress with some understanding of math and science. Especially in the engineering world there are always some advancements that are going on and making life more and more interesting. One of my engineering professors mentioned some projects that are involving smart houses and having them detect people's health. As we keep moving on day to day, we are making new advancements every day. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,597,"I have several reasons why I chose Civil Engineering as my major. In the engineering field there aren’t enough Latinx people in the field let alone Latinas, I want to change that. I feel as though it’s important to inspire and encourage other young Latinas to be in the STEM field in order to have more representation. Representation of Latinas in the STEM field is important to me because I can help create a diverse professional field that will benefit our society in the future. On a personal note, I want to inspire my niece who I want to encourage her to be in the STEM field as well and be someone who she can look up too. I want to guide and assist when it’s her time to go to college since I know it was hard to get where I’m at. I would also want to leave a physical impact on my community such build and maintain roads, bridges, and dams that will support and make my community better in the long run. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3038,"Reflection 1: Why do I want to be in STEM?I am a young father to a beautiful 20 month old little girl with sparkling blue eyes and curly blonde hair. When I became a father, I had a profound realization that my daughter was growing up in a world I see as troubled. When I held her for the first time, I saw a being of purity and beauty surrounded by a world of chaos and distress. I am her shield, her guiding star, and her snow plow; clearing her path to a successful and joyful life. But how can I be this for her in all walks? Or, what if I pass? What would happen to my daughter? The best way for me to assure her safety and well being is to put my best foot forward at bettering the world around her. Having grown up building things and fixing things coupled with my natural knack for mathematics I immediately gravitated towards bettering the world through the use of technological innovation, more specifically, to engineer a better world. I walk into my first year at SFSU as a previous senior level student of mechanical engineering at Montana State University. After the academic break I took while moving back home to California, assisting with my family’s business and creating a family of my own, I take this stride with a fresh mind and a whole new motivation for academic and career success."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2480,"I want to go into the steam field because i find it a very interesting topic to learn and a very interesting career. As an astro major i find the topic very fascinating and i love learning about it. Wanting to learn something or a topic is not easily found so I'm happy to be studying astro. Another influence on why i want to get into the steam field is that my whole family is in the steam field and it has influenced me to go in it as well, yet not the same subject as them. I find steam field more stimulating and more entertaining than more artsy majors. i never liked art or reading and writing so those fields where a big no for me. i "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,186,"I wanted to go into STEM to make a difference. As a child I thought big about the kind of difference I could make but as an adult who has spent years in college now, I also care about the difference I can make for my family financially. STEM is the best of both of those worlds and no matter how difficult it has proven for me, I still have been pushing through knowing that I would regret NOT being in STEM later on in life. Now that I am beginning to understand the fundamentals of math and physics, I can really feel confident I made the correct choice and use this knowledge to be the best engineer I can be. I still have a lot to learn so the challenges that I face along the way are shaping me well and I would not have it any other way."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3039,"I wanted to go into STEM because I feel I have the skills required to work in this field. I can proficiently do the math and science needed without struggling too much. I also feel very interested in STEM subjects. Engineering is fascinating, and its hands on solutions to problems makes it a very satisfying field to work in. I will admit that I do love arts, especially 3d art, of which I have lots of experience in. But I know for a fact that this world is unforgiving, and I need a ""hard skill"" in order to succeed. That could be truck driving, lawyering, programming, nursing, and more. These careers are the kinds of jobs employers stumble over one another to hire people for. I know engineering is not the most guaranteed income, but I enjoy it more than the other careers I listed above. I know someone who is an artist and it is really just a cycle of endless poverty, so that's no path for me. I also feel my skills would be wasted if I went into the arts, as I have been able to perform really well in computer science so far (which was my previous major before switching to civil engineering)."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2064,"The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is because I want to be able to create and be a part of things that can actually create an impact in our world for the future. I want to be able to say that I contributed to the advancement of technology for humans by implementing and developing new things that can help provide better insight into how the world works. Another thing that I want to do is to use my math skills to achieve different things like solving real world problems when they arise. Whether it's a small problem or a big problem, I want to be able to solve it on my own without any help whatsoever."
