2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3036,"Thermal radiation is occurred when heated surface emitting energy to its recipients surface which is called absorption objects with the speed of light. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the total radiant of the heat energy emitted by the surface is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. The materials of the recipient surface determines the ability of absorption and black body is the best absorber and can absorb all the radiant that falls on it. One of the examples of thermal radiation that applies to our daily life is the heat from the heater that spreads out the entire room which makes the room temperature risen and makes us feel warmer in the winter. This is because the heat or the flames from the fireplace go directly to the objects that can receive heat which  exist in our room, so the objects absorb the heat and the air around that objects get warmer and warmer which cause the air circulation becomes warmer since there is intervention by the air."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,603,"A lecture that we talked about used in our lives is the wavelength and light waves and how we can see differently with different types of lenses. In the lab, we used different lenses in light and we check if you can see the picture from the other side. For example, a -10 lens is much more different than a +5 lens you can see better with the positive 5 lenses. We also did another lab where we used a magnifying glass and tried to get the right angle to look at the main colors in the light like red, blue, and green. Learning this helped me realize just how important it is to know what light waves are since you are looking at different colors and why lenses are so important when you have difficulty seeing."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1942,"What is sound?Sound travels in the form of waves. The waves vibrate their way through the medium they are traveling from to our ears. the waves can differ depending on the frequency and the volume of the sound coming out of the source. It can also be affected by the distance. When we hear a high pitch it means the sound wave has a fast oscillation frequency (which is measured in hertz) and when the pitch gets lower the oscillation of frequency is slower. The slower the frequency the shorter the wavelength is. There is a maximum frequency a human being ear can tolerate  20 Hz to 20 kHz. Unlike cats, the can handle 48 Hz to 85 kHz making it possible for them to hear things we can't. Moving on, the volume or the amplitude is determined by the intensity, or amount of energy, in sound waves have. the louder the amplitude is the more the intensity is in the sound waves. Finally, Sound intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the sound wave source. Since sound waves carry its energy though a two-dimensional or three-dimensional medium, the intensity of the sound wave decreases with increasing distance form the source. Which is way when we are closer to a sound source its easier for us to hear it more rather than when we are far away. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3039,"Dampened oscillators shows an important tool that can be used to help stabilize vibrations and oscillations in machines and structures. Wind and earthquakes put oscillating forces on structures, and finding a way to deploy a dampening mechanism to the structure would allow for significantly more stability. We learned how things can be underdamped, overdamped, and critically damped. Interestingly enough, critically damped oscillators cancel their movement far faster than overdamping. Society should research into dampers that can be fined tuned to help make damping even better than normal. I could imagine using micro dampers to help alleviate excessive vibrations from vacuum cleaners, fans, leaf blowers, lawn mowers, etc... These machines could be quieter and more reliable if they were not subject to such intense harmonic motions."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1886,A concept that we've practiced a lot in this class that I think has helped me a lot was the concept of teamwork in a lab class. this usually makes the lab much easier and if I have any question usually someone in the team knows the answer or breaks it down in a way that is much easier to understand. I think this is a good idea for a lab class as it teaches students how to work with others and also teaches them how most stem jobs could be since its a lot of team group work 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3038,From what we have explored in sound waves and resonance I begin to wonder what sound waves in harmony look like on a graph. One way to figure this out is to first determine what exactly harmony is. Harmonic frequencies occur when one note’s frequency is a constant multiple of another note’s simultaneous frequency. Another way to think about it is that the wavelengths of the two notes are constant multiples of each other. Note that amplitude doesn’t matter- notes can harmonize regardless of the amplitude because when it comes to harmony the determining factors are frequency.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,282,"In class we discussed the double slit experiment and its implications. My question is, what happens if we send water drops through the slits? Would it produce a diffraction pattern?From some research online, I cant find an experiment, but a lot of sources say that sending individual particles, one at a time, still creates the diffusion pattern eventually. I would want to try this experiment sometime, but I don't know if its feasible. For one, I don't understand enough about the topic, and have a lot of questions. How do these electrons not all hit the exact same spot?"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2064,"The information that we’ve learned from this physics lab helps benefit society by having us understand what’s going on beforehand so that if something like this were to happen in a work setting, we would already know what’s happening and we wouldn’t be stuck in the dark not knowing what’s going on. For example, in the thermal expansion lab when we put boiling water inside tubes that are from different materials, and then the metal tubes started to expand from the hot water. People can use this in a work setting by figuring out what steps to take after. Since the tubes might experience thermal expansion from hot water, they could shorten the tubes to take into account the hot water so that it can expand without creating any problems in the future. Things like this can help improve society by having to simulate real-world problems when doing physics labs so that when it does/could happen later on in the future, we would already know how to counteract the problem at hand. The point of the physics lab is to give students an understanding of how the world works in the laws of physics, and by understanding those laws, we would already know the answers to certain problems when they arise and need a solution as quickly as possible. If we didn’t do this physics lab we might not know the right information needed to solve the problem, much less understand what’s going on. So it’s better to have learned the information beforehand rather than not knowing about it at all."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2480,A topic I like to discuss is waves. There are different types of waves but a question I have is how does wave length of a photon determine a lights color. I understand a light with a high wave length will be red and a light with a low wave length will be more blue. why does color change at different wave lengths? My answer to this is that it haves to deal with the energy that the photon has that is then giving the wavelength and the color it would produce. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,597,"In a previous lab we did a lab about thermal expansion, more specifically thermal expansion with metals. This is applicable to our daily lives because the expansion of solids may damage the bridges, railway tracks, and roads as they are constantly subjected to temperature changes and each metal expands differently as well which is shown in the lab that we did. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1836,"Many of the things we do in class can be used in real life such as earphones because magnetism and sound waves are an electric source and the magnet in our earphones create an electromagnetic field, which results in sound waves. Another example of a real life situation is Doppler radar because the Doppler effect is nothing but a change on a pitch of a sound when the source is moving relative to the listener. it is because the frequency of the sound waves changes as the source of a sound moves closer to or farther from the listener. Walking also contains physics because their is resistance between the souls of our shoes and the ground and this is called friction and traction."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1865,"One concept we covered in class in the past few weeks that diverted my attention and focus was Newton's law of cooling lab. One question I would formulate is how this can be applied to the application of thermal systems found in the devices we use everyday such as our phones, computers, laptops, and many more. Many of these devices use copper and other metals since metals are good conductors of heat. In the lab, we determined that copper does indeed achieve a lower temperature compared to other metals/objects. This explains why we commonly see copper in the thermal system of the devices we use everyday. Water cooling is also an effective means of cooling the CPU of a device. Using the principles of newton's law of cooling to design a better thermal system for the devices we use everyday would make our devices more efficient and powerful since staying at a low temperature is optimal for devices. If they overheat, the device’s performance dwindles. I’m sure my phone and computer would be really fast if their thermal systems run at a cool temperature all the time. Having an understanding of Newton's law of cooling and how it applied to metals can benefit the development and improvements of the devices we use and thus, could increase our productivity if we use a faster device compared to a slower one with a bad thermal system."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3032,"One concept that was covered in the past few weeks during physics lectures that I wanted to mention is buoyancy. I understand that buoyancy is a force coming upward exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of the weight of something fully full or partially immersed in an object. Buoyancy is seen in many things around us for example a boat , buoyant force is the force being that pushes up against an object, then that's when gravity is applied which is what exerts a downward force on an object, That all applies depending on the object mass. What makes a boat float by its force exerted downward on the boat by gravity is less than the buoyant force. The question I have about buoyancy is how you can determine its density and its tension and how does knowing that help figure out an object bouyancy. I think its important to know this because us people like to be adventures and do things out of our nature like going on a cruise on a huge ship on an ocean its important to know how that ship well be floating with hundreds of people in it . or also i think its important to know how submarines are working , many people that are in the navy spent months in a submarine and i think its important to know how that's even possible"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2020,Why does knowing how different materials thermally expand relate at all to a real life scenario? Knowing how different types of materials thermally expand could actually save someone's life. When heated metals expand and when cooled metals compact. In small circuits the minimal thermal expansion could break the circuit causing the failure of a machine. For example what if a circuit in the tip of a jet expanded due to heat and break causing the jet to lose a gps. Knowing how the material expands and by how much at what temperature would allow the engineer to make sure to keep that circuit or material in the correct temperature or make sure to add a cooling system to make sure that material doesn't expand too much.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3035,"During the week that we were learning thermal expansion, I found it interesting that heat can cause expansion. But why does heat cause expansion? Well, when a material is heated, the kinetic energy increases, causing the molecules to move very rapidly, which makes the molecules take up more space. It reminds me of a tire, because if we filled a tire with about 35 psi of air and drove down the street, the friction between the road and tire would cause the temperature inside the tire to increase, causing the psi to increase. As an educated guess I believe that the psi would rise about 2 or 3, making the tire pressure 27-28psi. The concept thermal expansion, also reminds me of the time we did the experiment that consisted of 3 different metal rods and pumping steam through each metal rod to see how far they expand. Since each metal is of different material, they will all expand to different lengths. So, material does account for the maximum amount of expansion that can occur. Another, great example of thermal expansion is railroad tracks. During the building process, there should be room left for expansion, because when the steel heats up it begins to bend and/or stress, which can cause the train to derail. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1854,"what are the properties of thermal radiation?In contrast to conduction and convection, thermal radiation has two unique properties: (1) it does not require a medium to be transferred but being electromagnetic energy can interact with intervening materials; and (2) during the emission/absorption of radiation, there is transfer between electromagnetic energy and intervening materials. Although scientists have only known about radiation long time ago, they have developed a wide variety of uses for this natural force. Today, to benefit humankind, radiation is used in medicine, academics, and industry, as well as for generating electricity. In addition, radiation has useful applications in such areas as agriculture, archaeology (carbon dating), space exploration, law enforcement, geology (including mining), and many others.We also receive exposure from man-made radiation, such as X-rays, radiation used to diagnose diseases and for cancer therapy. Fallout from nuclear explosives testing, and small quantities of radioactive materials released to the environment from coal and nuclear power plants, are also sources of radiation exposure to man."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,186,"The doppler effect is something that was recently covered in our lecture and my first encounter of this concept was on the tv show, the Big Bang Theory. In that show, one of the characters, Sheldon decided to be the doppler effect for halloween and explain his costume as, ""the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer"". This is quite literally the definition we learned about in our classes and we even were given formulas to calculate the effect as from the perspective as the moving object and observer. We can easily observe this in the world by standing on the street and hearing a police car speed past, as a higher pitch as it approaches and goes to a lower pitch as it moves past. The same effect also affects the frequency of light, which scientists can use to model the observable universe by the colors of stars which by looking at the electromagnetic spectrum can tell us if the frequencies are higher or lower. Using this observation given the name redshift, the Big Bang theory can be proved, and also the expansion of the universe. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3034,"This week we learned about oscillation and springs. The one question I have is how are springs and oscillation useful to our every day lives? This is extremely relevant to our daily lives even though it may not seem obvious at first. I think the biggest and most important one is the suspension in our cars and vehicles. Without our suspension and the dampening of bumps from our drives, driving would be extremely unpleasant and uncomfortable. These springs and dampening forces are required to smooth out the jerking motion of the car as it rides along the bump, if it weren't for the spring, we would bottom out and hit the ground extremely hard, making it impossible to sleep or even sit comfortably while driving long distances. We also require the dampening forces that suspensions incorporate, which is controlled through the shocks of the suspension. Without dampening, the spring would rebound and oscillate for a long period of time, possible making the riders nauseous. The dampening forces makes it so that the spring has to travel less periods in order to reach back into its equilibrium position. You will notice it when going over a big bump, the car only bounces a few times after going over the bump, with each bounces becoming smaller and smaller until you do not feel it anymore and the car is smooth again. Lastly, the spring force constant decides on how soft or hard the bumps are going to be, with a higher spring constant force, the same bump will seem harsher, while with a smaller spring constant force, the same bump would feel softer but travel higher. Playing with the spring constant force will decide how smoothly a vehicle takes bumps. For example, many race and drift cars want higher spring rate suspension because of the stiffer spring, the tires take less time to reach back to the  ground, allowing for more contact time with the ground compared to a softer spring where the tire stays up in the air longer. Overall, springs and its many different attributes are important to many different things in our life, not just cars or transportation. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3037,"the concept I will be talking about is lenses mainly behind the concept of how our eyes perceive light. why can't we fix color blindness permanently? well as we all know the way we see color is due to the fact that certain objects absorb more than others allowing us to see color. people with color blindness have an issue when it comes to differentiating different colors because of a genetic defect or through injury, but they all have varying degrees. there aren't any effective treatments that fix this problem easily other than the color-blind sunglasses that have been developed recently that work by having special lenses that absorb more of what the person can't usually see allowing them to see color like how everyone does. the way lenses work is amazing whether it's to help with vison or with color blindness.   "
