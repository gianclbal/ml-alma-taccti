2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2020,"In online I observed that I cannot learn well in online classes. I cannot pay attention or find the motivation to even attend online class most times. It feels almost pointless attending an online class, as if no information can get through the screens to the students. But since in person has come around my grades and mood have sky rocketed. One way I would practice self care during the online classes was to go to the gym 5 days a week. This helped me get out of the dorm and away from a depressing environment. Online classes were definitly the worst and I have so much more motivation and confidence now that they are over."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,603,Online classes have impacted my learning because when online classes started it was really difficult to adapt to the new type of classes. What I did for self-care and for my well being I started to do exercise at home since I was stuck at home doing classes now that we have in-person classes I can understand more about the topic like having real labs because I learned so much more like frequency like listening to a different type of frequency.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3036,"The pandemic pushes all of us to the distance learning practices and we have a hard time at the beginning like hard to communicate with our classmates and our professors. But after we have gone through a few semesters, we all use to with the online learning and find out the efficient ways to support our education from the resources of university and professor. At the beginning of the pandemic, there was low vaccination rates and new variants were the obstacles for us returning back to in person practices and our well being was the priority for us, so distance learning was the best option for us and also for our family members. The positive impact of online learning are we can isolate ourselves at home and assess education via zoom without going to anywhere and that also reduce the spread of virus. Online learning also saves a lot of of our time especially for commuting, and we can do some other stuff for that commuting time. Also we have more flexibility in choosing the best time to study."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1091,"Online classes have honestly impacted my learning in the worst ways. In comparison to pre-covid times I was very consistent in my study habits and put in easily over 15 hours of studying per week. But when covid hit, my motivation and engagement in my classes hit the lowest they've ever been. I try to get as much school work as I can done, but learning online has put me in a bad position academically and is becoming very difficult. Also, some professors do not make it any easier as they are sometimes very strict and have little to no wiggle room for error. So, I appreciate any professor that is mindful of the students' well-being and emphasize efforts on the students' learning rather than seeing if they get the right answer. I do not do much self-care other than exercising 3x a week."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1886,the change from online class back to in person classes has had a huge impact in me. its been so difficult to re adjust back to in person . when classes were online I was able to work on stuff with my own schedule and now that we are in person I have exact days and have to manage my time way more than before. my only concern is not being able to pass my classes but with enough effort it should be possible. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3034,"Luckily this semester I only have one online class. I actually really enjoyed coming back to campus and interacting with both people and the material in person, it makes the learning experience much more immersive. Not only does the concepts and material stick better, it also allows me to see how they are applied in real life, especially physics and engineering. Coming back to in person classes has helped me set my schedule better in terms of studying hours and homework time. Before with online classes, my schedule would be all over the place, especially my sleeping schedule. Since I have 8ams, my sleeping schedule is back on track and allows me to maintain a consistent schedule. I think correcting my schedule was the most important factor to how well I do in school, since without a set schedule I am all over the place and don't get enough study or homework time in. I don't think I really have much concerns about my learning experience anymore since most classes are back to in person. During the online period, I really lost the interest I use to have for engineering, but that has returned since coming back to school in person. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3032,"For the most part I enjoyed online classes ,  I just found it a little harder to concentrate during online classes since at home I'm surrounded by a lot of distractions , other than that I found online classes to be best, I’m still able to participate share my screen show others how I do my work , go into break out rooms and Etc . It was also super beneficial since due to Covid I had to move to sacramento. Now I commute 3 1/2 hrs to go to class which can be very tiring since I also work 5 days a week . The way I been self caring is by just taking one day at a time and definitely have my work / school schedule set. I try to have the days that I commute be the days I finish my school work . My concerns for my learning is that our professors aren’t getting paid enough and are being  discouraged to teach , it’s important to pay off professors who work hard on teaching a subject and  offering extra help . "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3038,"Online learning has actually been an absolute godsend for me. I began my college career at Montana State University straight out of high school, moving from the bay area to Bozeman, Montana. I was there for three years before I eventually had to return home to tend to my fathers diminishing mental health and maintain his businesses while he went through his  own personal battles. After helping him with his businesses for three years I decided last year I was going to leave my job and return to school to finish out my degree and continue on towards a career in engineering. This was in inspiration due to the birth of my daughter and my belief in a better life for my family and I. Online learning presented me with the ability to still help with the raising of my daughter, working part time, all while attending school. Of course, once I met all of my CSU transfer requirements we returned to in person learning. While it makes things considerably more difficult scheduling and budgeting wise, I do find it to be a more effective form of education. Having had experienced a large amount of both in person learning (from Montana) and online learning (SFSU), I do find in person learning to be overall more valuable, dependent on the curriculum. One thing about engineering is it is highly hands-on, while for other majors this may not be quite as necessary. For example- I am concurrently doing a data analytics certification and learning a variety of programming types and languages. For these types of education, online learning works fantastically because I am already on my computer!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,282,"I am currently in an online asynchronous class, where the professor has extended the due date of almost every assignment to early May. This is a nice gesture by the professor, but I am so terrible at keeping up that I have fallen behind a bit. I know I can make up the work by the due date, but for people who are terrible at time management like me, this is a death sentence. I know its not on the professor to deal with this, but its something that happened to me, and I'm sure happened to others.Otherwise in the past, online classes are usually not helpful to my learning. I felt like I really didn't grasp a lot of the topics in normal in person classes, so when I can't ask questions as easily, I just fall behind."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1865,"Online classes are definitely a platform to get used to. At first, I found online learning to be very different from traditional in-person learning. It took me some time to get used to the video conferencing app Zoom and submitting all assignments completely online. I would say that online classes had a little negative impact on my learning since I was able to adapt to my changing environment relatively quick. I had to learn to do things by myself and adapt. For self-care, I have been spending time with my beloved 5 pet finches and weiner dog. I hope to retain all the material I'm learning via zoom as well as my asynchronous classes. I would say my well-being is stable and healthy since honestly, the pandemic did not fundamentally change my life. Personally, I have been using zoom for school for over a year now and I'm honestly tired of it, I just want to go back in person. It is so easy to get distracted in zoom and sometimes I don't have my full focus in class.I am now happy to say that we are officially back to normal in-person classes. I could not be happier. It is much better to learn and you don't get distracted as much. Lab classes a fun and in-person is how it was intended to everything is good to go. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3033,"Overall, classes have impacted my learning by problem solving all problems. School has taught me how to solve problems and I have applied that to my life. Life is all about solving problems, and how well one manages to solve the issue.  I am focused on my priorities, school, soccer, and work. Self-care needs improvement on my end, I need to take a vacation and relax as I been feeling overwhelmed with school, soccer, and work the last 3 years. Overall, life is great, and I am managing well. I am excited and blessed for what the engineering department has taught me. I don’t have too many concerns for my learning, and I feel I need to focus more on my well-being. I will take adventure on my free time and set time apart to relax my mind. The SFSU department has positively influenced self-care practices and I will further identify what works."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1854,"Online classes have brought about some flexibility in learning. I am able to self-pace my learning where possible and complete the exercises at the appropriate time. Learning can be done at a time when I feel it's comfortable to do so. I can now spend enough time with my family and close friends and the fatigue that results from long commutes is now gone.For self-care, I regularly run around the neighbourhood and also go to the gym. Additionally, I have adopted a healthy diet, watching over what I eat by taking less junk food and incorporating a lot of healthy meals especially organic foods.The workload should be just enough such that it does not overwhelm the students. This will allow students to have a balanced and healthy lifestyle that allows them to engage in other extra curricular activities such as sports and social events.Overall, the online learning experience has been great and I hope it improves and continuous to be the norm in one way or another into the future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3035,"Online classes have made it a bit easier on me, being that I work on the days that I am not in school. I am able to just get up from bed and jump online to the zoom class, instead of waking up two hours before my class then commuting about an hour and a half (depending on traffic) to the school, then finding parking, then walking to my class. When things get hard for me I try to take time off from work or school at least for the day so that I can physically and mentally recover. I believe that our mental health is just as important as our physical health, so I do my best to not push myself too hard. I am a perfectionist and when things do not turn out the way I would like, I get really upset with myself, but I remind myself that nothing is perfect. If I am feeling really down I will buy myself something to make myself feel better. I am a bit concerned about other classes that I am having trouble with, but it is due to personal things going on in my life that have caused me to miss class. I am just hoping that I will pass so I can hit my goal of graduating by summer 2023"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,186,"Online classes for a long time felt very optional, and almost like a time commitment more so than a commitment to learn something to build a career on. It was not until coming back to campus that I realized how much easier it is to absorb information by simply being present, and although not everything is offline just yet, this reset of coming back to school has given me the motivation to really utilize the advantages of online classes. I am thankful to have professors who have uploaded recordings of old lectures from either past semesters or current online classes, as a rewatch certainly helps to prepare for exams. For self-care I am definitely trying to become more organized. I feel as if my stress stems from deadlines and school and money related problems, both I can try to manage somewhat by organizing my time. Lately I have spent my free time making an elaborate google calendar and I also use that time to either watch some sports or listen to some music, so it is time well spent (which also stresses me out a lot less)/ "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1942,"Online classes have affected my learning so much, When covid hit I had to move back to my parents place to be near my family, My family are not very advanced with technology, they did not have a wifi router at home and the network where we lived was beyond horrible, the nearest wifi place was not so close and their wifi would sometimes shutdown and restart so I would get kicked out of the wifi and have to connect back again which happened to me through several classes and my professors would get mad and frustrated as I would have to log in and out into a zoom meeting while a lecture is being taught. So I wasn't able to attend many classes when all my lectures were online, not only that but also, during midterms, labs, or even quizzes (which are the most important requirements) I was not able to attend which affected my grade a lot. This resulted to having to repeat classes twice and still failing them, so I had to move back to the city where there is WIFI. So I am able to pass the same classes for the third time."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1836,"Online classes have given me more time to work on my self, most importantly my mental health. When we would go on campus I did not have as much time to do that for myself. Since online was at home I had time to go to the gym before I had to go to work and I also had more time to study and eat healthier. I have also taken care of my body physically such as go to the gym and take my dog out on more walks. The only concern I still have is I still do learn better in person because I can ask the professors questions face to face and I can also communicate with my class mates, I could also get in person tutoring that has helped me a lot over the last couple of months that we have been in person. I am thankful to be back in person."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3037,"I don't like the concept of online learning at all. the whole concept of sitting behind a desk and watching the lecture is something that I don't like at all. it lacks something that keeps me focused on the class at hand. it's a different atmosphere than a normal classroom, in class i can learn better because everything is physically in front of me which makes me more intrigued towards the class and helps me focus on it. I'm an extremely visual learner and sitting behind a screen where most teachers use a digital screen to teach is not the best way for me to learn especially not with the distractions around me, it's easy for me to zone out and get distracted but when I'm physically in class it becomes easier to focus. my performance in classes definitely dropped when we switched to fully online classes so I'm glad we are getting back to in person classes. the thing that I do for self-care is mainly just going to the gym, it helps me release any extra tension that I've accumulated throughout the day and helps me stay in better shape, when everything closed down due to covid it was really hard to work out and stay in shape so being able to work out again has definitely helped me not only with staying in shape, but it was also very beneficial to my mental health.    "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,597,"Online classes have affected me in different ways for example, it has taught me to learn and study differently and that I have to be more diligent when studying by myself. But now my schedule for this semester half of my classes were online and the other half were in person, so this semester was a learning curve of going back to in person learning and online learning. Some ways I take care of myself is by taking breaks from studying, or going on walks, or cooking a meal for myself or reading some comics in my down time. I just concerned that I’ll burn myself out, I’m already starting to feel that even though I have 2 more years til I finish my degree, and that I’ll start to spiral but I know I’ll be fine at the end. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3039,Online classes have been a mixed bag for me when it comes to my well being. They can impart a feeling of distance and apathy in me. I feel far less engaged in most online lectures than a comparable in person one. My attention span at home is poor compared to in the classroom. That is not to say that online classes are all bad. Online classes are an excellent way to help relieve commuting stress. Trying to take all my classes in person means building a brutal schedule that can be harmful to my mental health. I will reduce my maximum course load to 3 classes (9 units) for the rest of my time in the University because I can manage commuting easier if there are only a few classes to worry about.I find that the best way to ensure I do well in online classes is to get plenty of sleep. I can dose off during class because I don't have the adrenaline boost I normally get when around other people in a classroom setting.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1841,I actually like having classes online since I don't have to commute to my class. It also makes it easier since the lecture is recorded on zoom allowing students to go back on ilearn and learn in a more efficient way. I don't like classes in-person since some professors go very fast in their lectures and not giving students enough time to process the information and take notes. I like going outside and spending time with my friends this helps me with my mental health and gets me interacting more with people. Since this semester is mostly in-person it is kind of difficult to transition from almost 2 years of online class to having all in-person classes. I would like SFSU to give the students the option of either online or in-person classes.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2064,"From these online classes, the way they have impacted my learning is by not being able to do any hands-on work and to just watch things happen from videos or simulations. It doesn’t really make me understand or even learn that much about what kind of physics is really going on specifically in that situation. What I’m doing for self-care is that I would sometimes take a break in doing work and I would out on walks and take a small break so that I don’t overwork myself and burn out. Another thing that I do is talk with my family and basically just have a conversation with them and relax my mind a little bit. I also play video games and watch anime whenever I have the time as well. A big concern that I have for my learning and well being is that I wonder if these online classes will really stick with me as I go through college, because once I get into my graduate classes, I will need that information to go through those classes and I don’t think that I do so if these online classes aren’t very impactful for me or if they feel boring and then I can’t retain that information later on. "
