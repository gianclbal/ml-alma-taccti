2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2064,"For me, my goals are to get a bachelor's degree in engineering (right now I am specifically striving towards my electrical engineering degree), get a good job that is related to my field of work/degree, get a good house in a good neighborhood, and have my own family in the future. This class can help me achieve these goals because this class is the starting point to how my other goals can be completed. Without doing this class I won't be able to do the other things that I want to do because this class is required to be completed in order to get my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. After doing this class I am much closer to getting all of my goals completed. Since some of my goals are more long-term, completing this class is more of a short-term goal because it will be completed in May this year, while creating a family of my own is more of a decade-long goal, but doing this short-term goal is a ""prerequisite"" for the other goals."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,603,My goals are to become a successful civil engineer and to learn why is physics so important for my major. This class is helping me learn more about physics with calculus 3 helps me find the reason why this class is so important for my major. I am learning many things in this class like buoyancy and cooling and heating of a liquid how it is important to take measurements and how to plug it in a graph to find the function. Every week I learn something new in Lab and it helps me practice because our lab has the same basis as a Memo with the procedure and data analysis is like writing a memo for engineering. Doing work in this class helps me understand what a group is because it has been a while since we did in-person classes and I can remember how important it is to be in a group because everyone helps each other which helps me with my goal of becoming a successful civil engineer since I have to also be in a group in the future.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2020,"My goal is to end up working on special projects for amusement parks. They always need a new invention or trick device to either hide something from the audience or make them focus on it. I believe this class and the expiramintations will help me learn the materials and information I need to complete these special projects in the future. That’s really all there is to it. Disney has lots of special projects like the invisible green door, which is only a door with a specific green color that appears not interesting making it invisible to the human brain. This may be a simple idea but learning how to make these simple ideas happen stem from classes such as this one. Where I learn and truly experience how physics works."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2480,A short term goal that i have that i can hopefully achieve within the next few years is to start my own research in physics and get my name on a research paper. This class will help me with working in a group and how to work in a lab. I can see where i make mistakes and where I do well in. Theres a lot of measurement mistakes i take and thats something that needs to fixed. I also like working with a team and bouncing ideas off of each other. It creates a great why to work and get new ideas or methods that i have missed or forgotten. they are many things I can take away from a lab that also matches my goal that i can hopefully achieve. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3033,"My main goal has always been to utilize a degree within my community. I want to have my own General Contracting business who self performs rebar, concrete, and structural steel. Another one of my goals is to have a Bay Area Design Build Structural Engineering Firm: where I can design structural components of bridges, towers, and buildings that are pleasing to the eye in low income communities. Low-income communities don’t have to look like the stereotypical low-income community. The ways we analyze experiments through different labs in our class, will help me analyze different situations within my future scope of work. Furthermore, this class utilizes and teaches ways to problem solve different problems, and that skill will benefit my future scope of work within the construction industry. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3034,"My goals in this class are to apply the concepts I learned in the lecture and see it happen in real life. This week we are experimenting on the newtons law of cooling which I hope will teach and help me understand  more about specific heats and how they play a role in thermal equilibrium. Maybe seeing different materials and how much heat energy they are able to absorb will help me better understand different materials and their specific properties. I think this will greatly help in my engineering career if I ever decide to go into  materials engineering as this is a small insight into what I think materials engineering will be about. Not only that I can also see how the physics portion of this works in real life also. The goal of this lab was figuring out how much water cooled which meant how much energy is transfered out of the system into the environment. Different materials such as mercury have different cooling rates which explain why mercury is used in thermometers instead of water. They can either have the ability to expand greatly when absorbing heat which makes it good in a thermometer since you can physically see the bar rising. Overall, I enjoyed this weeks lab and hope to learn more about it and see how it applies in future concepts that I will learn. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,186,"What has helped in both the lab portion and the lecture portion of this course has been doing the homework in a timely manner using the power point and textbook to reference the formulas and terminology at a moments notice. My biggest goal is to understand the relationships between the different variables in all my equations so I can manipulate the given equations and plug in values correctly. At this point in my education, nearly every class has that minimum requirement this year and will so into my career so this skill is really being sharpened this year. I tried to understand what I have been doing in lab by visualizing how I can apply that same concept in real life applications beyond this class. Doing this reflection also served as a good reminder to always keep the end goal in mind as sometimes in the busyness of class and the semester, you get lost in the process and not the end goal which for me is being a great mechanical engineer."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3032,"My goals for this semester is to not only to pass my classes but to also understand the materials and learn how to use them in an everyday life situation.I think this class is great because its an extra class that adds on to my physics course. I find the lab to be very helpful since we get to experiment what we learn in our physics class. Being able to participate physically  helps me achieve my goal of actually understanding how to connect the learning material to real life. I also hope the material I learn will be helpful in the future within my career . I think a way for me to accomplish my goals is to study harder  and take advantage of the extra help im given , like office hours or tutoring . So this year I would like to use my resources and ask questions when needed , I also think managing my time would help . "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1942,"My goal is to be a civil engineer, grow big in the field I am studying and be successful in it. I want to be so successful that I could open and manage my own developing company. My company will be building new complex, houses and towers, etc.. I want to be a developer, building lavish compounds and towers all around the world. To be able to reach that goal and to be able to be a civil engineer, I need this class. This class is going to help me understand more about physics since physics is the core of engineering. Physics has a huge role in engineering since there are many physics factors that need to be addressed before building anything. This class opens my mind and helps me see a lot of things that happen around us in our day to day life differently, and understand how they all happen. Lastly, This class is also going to help me graduate and having the bachelor degree of Civil engineering since it is a requirement."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,597,My goal is that I want to inspire my niece and encourage her to be in the STEM field as well and be someone who she can look up too. I want to guide and assist when it’s her time to go to college since I know it was hard to get where I’m at. And I think this class will help me achieve that I’ll be needing this knowledge once I’m in the field and I could help my niece once shes in my position if she needs it.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3037,"my major goal so far is to be a mechanical engineer, that's my main focus right now and a physics is definitely one of the requirements to be able to graduate but the knowledge that i will gain from this class will be of great help towards my future classes. physics pretty much covers the basics for all my future classes so without this foundation i will probably struggle in future classes. and so far, I've learned quite a lot in this class, and it definitely made my other classes a bit easier because you end up finding grounds in which this class and other classes overlap."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1854,"My goal in life is to be an engineer and, in the process try to understand how various components especially those used in electrical devices work. I have always had the desire to know how the inner working of these devices. One of the goals I hope to achieve by the end of this class is that this class will equip me with the necessary skills to repair devices, tinker with the components, design and build. This class involves the study of electric potential which is a concept that is widely applicable in various components that are used in electrical devices. Through the lessons from this class, I am able to understand what is a charge, its composition, types of charges, it's effect on other charges, how it moves and also its application in our daily life. I am also able to learn about electric potential energy, potential difference, electric fields and how all these are applied in our daily life outside the physics lab."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3039,"My goal at this university is to get a degree in civil engineering. I want a job in this field, and I will be taking every class required to meet this goal. This class is not only a required course. It also will help me be a better engineer by giving me a foundation in physics, which is heavily applied in civil engineering. I may not remember the formulas, but the concepts of this class will last a lifetime. I plan on using physics to help me design structures, and I will take physics into account when ensuring the validity of engineering plans. I want to be the best engineer I can be."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3038,"My goals are to finally graduate with a degree in mechanical engineering and go get a good job in my field to support my wife and daughter. This class can help me attain that by giving me valuable hands-on experiences to assist in my understanding of physics which we all know is the backbone to mechanical engineering. Being a hands-on learner, the lab aspect of the class generally teaches me more than the lecture side does. So lab will give me the opportunity to refine my understanding of the subject, and inadvertently improve my performance as an engineer in industry down the road."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1841,"My goals for this class are to pass and continue on my academic goals of being a civil engineer. This class is helping me further strengthen my math and understanding of different problems that I will face as I become a civil engineer. This class is very enjoyable to attend this semester, compared to previous semesters where the class was online it was a bit hard to fully understand some of the material. As I keep going further in my physics class, I understand that everything is intertwined and builds upon everything since physics 1. This class is also helping me by understanding concepts in a deeper meaning by actually doing the experiments and being hands on. As I progressed in my education, I found it easier to remember and get a better understanding of material by doing the experiments myself."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1886,My goals in this class is to be able to fully understand the concepts we are learning in the lecture portion of the class. And then be able to translate this by attempting labs. This class will help me understand the physics subjects in a better way. My goal to to become a mechanical engineer and this class will hopefully help me in gaining new skills such as how to solve problems and how to conduct my own lab projects and how to write it down on papers. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,282,"This is a question I’ve been asking myself a lot lately. I’m a ME major, but I really don’t know if it’s for me (3 years in). My goals for myself are to get employed at a place I believe in, and also enjoy the challenges it might bring. And to also make a living hopefully. That said, I believe that this class will absolutely help me achieve my goals, as it brings me closer to understanding a lot of these concepts that are still out of my grasp after lecture. Lab is a great way to learn to work with others (which has been very fun!), but also greatly helps in ironing out these physics concepts because it’s all hands on."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3035,"I have so many goals, whether it is a super small goal or a very big goal. One of my major goals is to pass all my classes this semester with at least a C or better. I don't specifically think that this class will help me achieve this goal, but if I pass this class I will pass the lecture portion of this class too. If I just keep focused, pay attention, and study hard, I know I can achieve my goals and move forward to the more major goals. One of my smaller goals for this class is to get a better understanding of how to solve the equations given and understanding the formulas and how to change the formula to match the equation."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1865,"My goals are to obtain a degree in electrical engineering, develop a deep understanding of engineering and land an engineering job after college. This class can help me achieve these goals since physics is one of the core subjects in the field of engineering. Since I am majoring in electrical engineering, in this class we will learn electricity and magnetism. This class will help me grasp the fundamentals of electricity since it is a major part of my major. Understanding physics is key for understanding engineering and being successful on the job. This laboratory class of physics will help me further grasp the concepts and ideas of physics through the in person, hands on lab work"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1836,"My goals are to one day become a civil engineer and use physics to solve everyday problems. Civil engineering has a lot of physics that go in to it such as stabilizing beams, bridges and buildings. Even though I am not the best at physics this class can help me to work better as a team with others. Working together as a team is the most important thing in the field since you will be working with many people and all with different idea's. Another goal I have is to understand how Civil engineering problems can be solved with physics and how physics can make my job a lot easier."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3036,"My goal is that I want to be a pharmacist, so in order to achieve my goal I need lots of physics class because all the physics and chemistry are related to each other. Like all the science subjects are related to each other. Pharmacist is about dealing with making new drugs, so it is not enough only to know chemistry. Physics plays important role in explaining chemical reactions and the behaviors of compounds and elements. Physics is a prerequisite for all other science majors and also for the pharmacy school. There is physical chemistry in biochemistry major which is learning about physicochemical properties of several substances to make drugs, so I need to have the basic understanding about physics. Physics is very important for the advanced class which is physical chemistry. Physics is very important when making new drugs which need to be monitored in many aspects that need physics."
