2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1865,"My greatest takeaway from this lab would be gaining hands-on work experience when a diverse set of laboratory equipment. I was able to use several lab equipment such as a voltmeter, measuring tools, and many more I can't remember the names of. Getting this hands-on experience when different types of laboratory equipment allowed me to better understand and use any equipment for future classes and in the real world since I am able to properly use it and manipulate variables. I was also able to measure certain quantities such as centimeters, meters, millimeters, and other units to measure the distance between endpoints. measuring is a great skill to have and I have practiced and further improved my skill of measuring in this class. This will help me in the real world and as well as in future engineering classes. I was also able to work with a team live in person. This allowed me to gain teamwork experience which would serve me well in the real world when having an engineering job. My skills and knowledge have been amplified and enhanced now that the lab is in-person and not online. The in-person lab was very helpful to my understanding of physics. I can say that this class was the first in-person ""Real"" lab at university. I am glad I was able to gain and enhance my skills as a scholar at San Francisco State University "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1836,Greatest take away from this class was learning with a group. Actually being able to see other people's faces live than through a screen. Class was a lot more fun this way and I would say a lot more productive. Another great take away was being able to be hands on and to actually be able to do things step by step. Another take away was also being able to Be in a Physics class. For my past 4 years at Sf state this has been my first physics lab due to covid. Another take away was learning a bunch of new topics that hopefully I will use in real life and I hope to use what I learned in this class in my future career since I now have experience. What also helped me a lot in this class was asking questions in person and having them answered quickly and not have to wait for an email.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1091,"My greatest take away from this class is that hands on learning for labs is a lot harder than virtual (given that both have the necessary procedural tools). Doing online labs in the beginning helped me learn about that topic easier, but the in person labs assisted in learning how to deal with the lab equipment. Off topic, but this lab along with having Kathryn as a professor made me realize that younger professors are a lot more empathetic towards their students. Knowing that student fatigue is really taxing and giving out extensions when needed really lifts weight off our shoulders. I appreciate you as a professor."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3033,The greatest take away from this class is being able to solve problems in lab format utilizing different physic equipment. I also learned how to analyze graphs with different concept learned. The labs were very informative and has taught me a life lesson on how to problem solve. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,603,My greatest takeaway from this class is the labs we did for example where we had to see the refraction and the reflection using light and how we can see the rainbow color seeing stuff like that in a lab helps me understand more of the why do we learn this in physics. This class helped me understand how to do good lab analysis with graphs using excelsior it helped me understand in the future how a group act when doing an assignment like doing the frequencies lab how we found the highest wavelengths with frequency and have another one of our groupmates do the excelsior graph and another calculate the wavelength or other calculations. The biggest takeaway from this class is lab is very important for the physics lecture because it helps me understand more of the topic we are learning.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,186,"Seeing that the relationships discussed in this class were primarily linear helped me build connections between different physics laws discussed in the lecture portion of the class. The occasional online lab coupled with being in class again after a long time of quarantine was nice change of pace that I did not realize I needed until I came back. This class has been more beneficial to me than I may realize and I noticed it while doing the homework that some of the work involved while writing a lab report was easier than doing the class homework, making it much easier to complete homework assignments. I was not feeling well (not COVID-related) the last few weeks before the last week of school and the labs being online was a blessing in disguise for me at the time. I am thankful that this semester is coming to a close and I got a good grade in this class but not just that, as the repetition of assignments and labs have increased my understanding of physics and problem solving tremendously. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,282,"Light is extremely useful, and optics are becoming more and more interesting to me. I think that before, I didn't see a lot of the possibilities we could use light, but the more and more I learn about it, the more interested I become. I feel like a lot of these physics concepts apply a lot further than I realize, and its really interesting to see ways we can solve certain problems using solutions to seemingly different problems. Light is very confusing though, and I still have a lot of trouble with conceptualizing these concepts. I have also realized that some physics concepts are not intuitive from the start, and that I need to throw out assumptions I make about situations.The final big take away is how important perspective, in every situation, but especially in physics, where you're answer is entirely dependant on how you use tools and view the experiment."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3034,"My greatest take away with this class was using special equipment to really explore the many different topics and concepts we learned throughout the lecture portion of this course. Without using hands on equipment to say for example help us diffract light, we would never be able to actually explore and see how it works in real life. I also learned a lot and reinforced my report writing skills and excel skills. Since this course relied of a lot of recording data and making graphs and tables, it really improved my excel skills to where I can comfortably do what I need to do. This class was also very enjoyable as many of the topics in physics 3 was relatable and fun to break down. Although I did not enjoy the program or whatever cutting your pay or limiting your hours because I feel that it really affected our experience as students because feedback and grading took much longer than I was expecting. Overall, this course was extremely enjoyable, along with all the hands on experimentation and data recording was extremely new to me and refreshing from the usual solving problems on papers. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2020,My biggest take away from this class was learning how to use all the lab equipment we went over. Like lots of other studetns this was my first in person lab and it was amazing. We used lots of different instruments in order to perform these labs and understand many different concepts. Being able to visualy see the concepts in person definitly helped me learn a lot more. Also another big thing I took away from this class was actually learning how to use excel. I learned so many tricks by watching videos that I am confident enough to put excel on my resume.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3035,"My greatest take away from this class is being able to fully understand the concepts that were taught to us in the lecture. I am the type of person that has to physically see something to understand it. Lecture was quite hard for me because I could not physically see what exactly we were talking about, once I went into your class and we did the labs I got a much better understanding of how the whole thing works. Physics has been the hardest subject for me so far and your way of teaching really helped! THANK YOU!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3037,"one take away that i learned from this class as a whole would probably be that things however complicated they seem at first can be broken down into simpler structures that help you understand it better. when you look at all the labs, we covered big topics but focused on very specific aspects of them taht simplified them in a way that we were able to grasp the concept behind it. understanding these concepts is in baby steps helps us understand the bigger picture. and as a visual learner to be able to learn these big concepts in such a manner has helped me quite a bit. i would start being very confused but the longer i would spend on the lab while following the procedure the more i get a better grasp of the concept behind it "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1841,"What was my greatest take away from this class? I feel like the greatest take away from this class is being able to collaborate with other classmates. In past lab classes we had them in zoom and felt like I was not really learning anything. We would be put in groups of 5 and be given a document to fill out. This would make us split the work and we would all work on one question to try and finish on time. However, I think it was also a decent way to visualize some of the topics we were learning since we would be working with simulators. However, coming back to an in-person lab made me realize that it's always better to collaborate face to face. This way we can actually help each other and ask our lab instructor questions. I also feel like the labs in-person are more in-depth and have more to teach us."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3038,"My greatest takeaway from this class would be the method of solving problems. Although it is quite a ways into my academic career for me to finally be figuring this out, I’m glad that I finally did because it makes life exponentially easier for solving problems. The process of defining the problem, the knowns, constraints, and units, followed by the governing concepts really makes it a lot simpler to make sense of any physics based problems. Being a mechanical engineering student and heavily reliant on physics based calculations, this is such a helpful thing to have learned."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1942,"The greatest take away I took from this class is Ive learned a lot on how to be able to look at a physics problem, in other words when I look at a physics problem I always used to start it up by solving for numbers and trying to get the correct answer however, after this class Ive learned how to understand the problem, what is going on in the problem, find an actual real life example to such problem to be able to imagine it, and from there I am able to know whether my answer makes sense or not. Another thing I took from this was how to work as a group, be a group member which encouraged me to be able to communicate and participate with other students and brainstorm our ideas to be able to reach a conclusion. To sum it all up, this class showed how to imagine a physics problem I am approaching and be able to brainstorm many ideas with a group of other students and to be able to reach a conclusion to our answer for the problem and describe our answer."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,3039,This class was a good experience in conceptual physics. It helped me with physics class when it was similar to the material in lecture. I also was able to experience social interactions with other students for the first time in two years. This helped make the class more bearable. It also made the equations more approachable and easy to understand. I feel this lab may allow me to remember the physics longer into my life than if I had taken lecture only. This is because the lab provided me with memorable lived experience.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,597,"My biggest take away from the class was that it was cool finally conducting the experiments after 2 years of not being in person, and ti was a lot easier to understand the material when being hands on, which shows me that for me to fully understand a topic I have to be hands on about it, and ti was also cool to work in a team in person and I was able to connect to my teammates when performing the experiments, definitely my favorite classes this semester."
