2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2012,"One of the concepts I will be focusing on that was covered in class from the past few weeks is during the first week of classes which was learning about charges, as well as using a simulation and using tape to learn about how charges work. My question for this topic would be how can we prevent shocks? Have you ever felt a shock on your hand or fingers before? I have the answer which may or may not work for everyone, but I really believe this is a question everyone has thought of at least once and has thought of if there is a solution to this predicament.This information can be generally applicable to people’s lives and can benefit society because there is one thing that we all have experienced at least once: shocks. There can be minor or major ones, but sometimes we can get shocked by touching doorknobs, children sliding down slides, sometimes even touching things such as plastic but this all happens because of friction between two items. For example, if you were to rub your socks together, there will be a charge that is now placed on your socks and when you touch the doorknob, one would get shocked. It doesn't cause any real harm to our bodies, but having random shocks throughout the day is absolutely no fun. During our class, we used a simulation involving a balloon, a sweater, and a wall which required us to rub a balloon on the sweater and witness the attraction it had to the sweater, repelling a negatively charged wall. This can happen with slides: sliding down plastic or metal slides causes the fabric of our clothes to rub one another, and our body has this positive charge which causes one to experience the unfortunate shock. Now, I have heard and tested one thing that can help remove this charge: hand sanitizer! I have tried it before and surprisingly it works but perhaps if you are experiencing this shock, try some hand sanitizer and it’ll do the trick!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2913,"How ohms law can help and benefit society.   Electrical circuits are present in our everyday lives. From technology we use every day such as to light builds places throughout our homes, ohms law and electric circuits are present everywhere. Ohm’s law is an important equation that helps us understand electric circuits Ohm’s law is the equation that describes the relationship between voltage​, ​current​ and ​resistance​. the amount of electricity in terms of current that flows along a wire in an electrical device was accurately proportional to its cross-sectional area this causes ohms to define resistance and show that there is a simple relationship relative to the voltage, resistance and current. Ohm’s law helps us to analyze circuit diagrams. A few examples of the use in ohms law in everyday technology is ceiling fans, electric heaters, cellphones, and our chargers. Getting a better and more precise answer can help us further society. We can use this to distribute electric currents at a higher voltage and quicker than normal.       "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2903,"I think that the learning of basic circuits and how batteries/voltage/current works is very important for the average person. I can think of many situations where I have been stumped/have seen others be stumped when doing things like connecting batteries or jump starting a car. Jump starting a car might seem intuitive, but it most certainly isn't the easiest thing, mainly because both the ground and positive wires on each side of the jump cables shouldn't each be connected to the battery of both cars, but rather, the negative wire of the receiving car must be connected to an exposed metal. I have definitely messed this process up multiple times (my old car needed a new battery and I didn't get one for a long time), especially regarding the safest order of attaching the wires. I thought about this example since we touched upon jump starting a car in the lecture class today (I think the question was about whether you want current or voltage when jump starting a car). Knowledge of how these mechanisms/concepts work would definitely benefit the average person I feel, since it is something learned in physics class that has very relevant real world applications for nearly everybody. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,166,"Recently, we've been talking a lot about resistors. Resistors are very important in circuits as they prevent the circuit from being overloaded with electric current. When building circuits, one may think that it should always be the goal the maximize conductivity. Therefore, everything should be wired using silver and gold. However, this is not the case. Why is that? Beyond the high price of silver and gold, silver and gold wires would need stronger resistors that can dissipate more power to keep the current flowing through them in check. If you were to create a complex circuit with no resistors, such as the electrical system in a house, it would likely become dangerous. Using the example of the wiring in a house, if the the wires in a house were not properly insulated/wired to resistors, it could cause the wiring system of the house to become overheated and catch fire. In fact, electrical fires are frequently cited as one of the most common causes for house fires in the US. While gold and silver wires work great for small scale projects such as computers, for larger scale circuits the practicality of copper cannot be beaten."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2911,"What exactly is an electric current? An electric current is a flow of charged particles like protons or electrons. When we think of electricity in our everyday life, we are actually utilizing and manipulating a flow of charged particles in order to power things. This is relevant to almost all of modern society because it's a concept relevant to all of our powered technology. I think this was an interesting idea to learn and something that most people aren't aware of. I feel like when you hear the word electric or electricity, your mind immediately thinks of something like lightning. However, the distinction between that and the electricity running through our power lines isn't always clear and I think this simple definition gives some understanding."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2910,"The first thing that pops into my mind when thinking about this question is the classic experiment done in high school when we connect a lightbulb to both ends of a battery, actually very similar to what we’re did in this weeks laboratory. The battery emits a certain voltage or electromotive force that circulates through the newly created circuit and turns on the lightbulb. The new insight provided by my class is the fact that a battery has innately some internal resistance, which inevitably decreases the voltage by some small amount, and means we need to account for that when we think about the emf of batteries. Some examples like these show that A) Physics can be found in everything, but also B) that these artifacts have been so well invented that people know how to use them in abstraction without having to know the implementation/ins and outs of how the science works out"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2906,"It seems to me that the Electric field was the most interesting topic and lab to work on. How electric fields work and the charges and what kind of interactions between charges. When the charge is present in any form, an electric field is linked with each point in space. The value of E, also known as electric field strength, electric field intensity, or simply the electric field, expresses the size and direction of the electric field. While doing the electric field lab, we had to use F=q1,q2/r^2 and k is a constant of proportionality = 9*10^9 nm^2/c^2. The electric field radiates outward in all directions from the point charge. Spherical equipotential surfaces are represented by circles. A vector sum of the individual fields may be used to calculate the electric field from any number of point charges. Why do we need an electric field and what does it provide us with. The pushing power required to initiate current flow is provided by electric fields. An electric field in a circuit functions similarly to an electron pump: it is a big source of negative charges that may accelerate electrons along the circuit towards a positive charge lump. Electric Field vectors were really interesting to talk about. The way how we show or visualize the electric field with vectors. This Takes us to superposition where more than two charges are in place which makes the force on any charge is vector sum forces by all individual charges.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2908,"My question is this: What are actual useful implementations of resistors in our daily lives? I understand they reside in a all of the motherboards and electronics in our world, but I don’t truly understand their presence in todays electronics.The uses of capacitors is in every single electronic. First of all, resistors have a direct representation within Ohms law. In Ohms law, Voltage is equaled to current times resistance. Resistors are used for changing the voltage output of currents, divide voltages, and other things. That’s the extent of my notes. It’s very interesting how small capacitors can be, especially considering how important and necessary they are in all electronics. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2909,"I think that circuits are super important in people's lives. In our life, we have so much technology that we use every day that require circuits. Understanding how these circuits work may be important to society as it will allow more people to try and innovate for more creations. Not only this, but the fact that it can be used so that people can understand how many issues that may occur with their technology would be very beneficial. I believe that this is one of the most important things to understand in this class as it controls our lives so much, and yet we do not know much about it. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2914,"For my concept, I choose electric fields, since that topic makes the most sense to me and I think it's a pretty universally experienced phenomena. A question I'd pose about electric fields would be why it points outwards from a positive charge and towards a negative charge. From the textbook and my notes, I can't really find a straightforward answer to this, but did get some clarification that this is in reference to electric field lines, which aren't real. I think this concept could be applicable to everyday life with electronics used, and the magnets that are in most of them. Sometimes when I'm doing homework, I'll have a bobby pin by my laptop and notice that it's drawn to it, which I think would be represented by the bobby pins field pointing towards the magnet in my laptop."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2912,"How does working with circuits (i.e learning about resistance, current, and voltage) help me in my future? I plan on continuing my computer engineering major and so this information is extremely important/relevant to my future. Additionally, leaning about this kind of stuff can help people if they are having trouble with lights in their homes and need to solve some simple electric problems, but it also teaches new engineers the basic information they need to begin a profession in electrical engineering where they will be working on projects that improve society as a whole. "
