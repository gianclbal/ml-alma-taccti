2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,166,"Admittedly, I don't have a grand takeaway from this class nor a takeaway at all from this class. Nothing about the nature of Physics nor the nature of science or anything like that. I suppose a few of the labs did help me understand/visualize some of the concepts discussed in class a bit better, though that's about it. The labs weren't overly engaging, and some of the later ones were more confusing than they were enlightening. In quite a few of the later ones, I didn't understand why we were getting the results we did. I just knew that we were getting results. I know this isn't the answer I'm supposed to give nor the answer the department would like to hear, though at the very least I am being honest. For me, it was just another class. Another box to check off on the road to graduation. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2904,"My greatest take away from this class was that Physics can be challenging but also that if you come to class prepared to listen and participate that you can walk away from the course having learned a thing or two about the world. All in all I see Physics in nearly everything I do on a regular basis from my the time I wake up and turn on my light to see to the electricity going through the power outlet powering my television at night. Although I am not a Physics major, this class turned out to be really exciting in so many different ways. The classes were definitely a little long but regardless elf that I feel motivated and informed by way of our instructor and in the way that she explained the concepts that we learned."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2915,"In our labs, I believe the hands-on experience I have developed with various types of equipment is my greatest takeaway. It has helped retain the material very well with electromagnetism and circuits. Being able to see the calculations in another setting where we can utilize them helps visualize how the problems are solved ostensibly manner. Whether it's an experiment that is only graphing to see the change in a single variable through the numbers we received then visualize them more explicitly by forming a graph. Although it’s an important base of understanding to grasp how certain variables affect others in concepts we are learning I've seen that a lot of exams and quizzes usually ask a question regarding the flux of variables. Most used would be a simple magnitude problem. Then regarding the equipment, I enjoyed the items available during the lab a lot they were taken care of and simple to use. I was also concerned about how to use them properly because I have already begun to see the same equipment in other classrooms. Being able to understand how to use science and engineering equipment machinery is exciting to me and seeing how different technology is useful to our education."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2012,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that this laboratory has helped me understand some of the concepts or topics covered in the lecture which I am very thankful for because I have always struggled with Physics, especially understanding difficult concepts and the math behind them. Back then when I was in high school, I never really enjoyed or understood Physics because Mathematics was always my weak point, even now I struggle to comprehend equations while being thrown values for different variables in any of my previous or current classes. Not only have I been able to understand specific concepts better now, but I also am starting to understand that everything in life is connected to Physics: every day we use gravity which is a force, but everything we think about has some type of Physics involved even to the simplest of tasks like pushing a box. It's interesting to think about what kind of things have Physics involved, but I guess this class has just made me have a better experience than high school which I actually appreciate very much. Sometimes, we need that small push to understand things we may not know of and in this case, your teaching in this laboratory has been pretty amazing because if I am confused about lectures, some of the things we cover help me understand what I'm doing. I always believe that everyone has different ways to learn, but in this case, I think hands-on learning in the lab has actually been very helpful than sitting in a class for a few minutes to listen to concepts you know?"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2906,"The greatest takeaway from this class is that I learned a lot about physics and how the circuits and different types of circuits. This class was special because it was my first lab after three years since covid started and it felt great to be back on campus with people that are in front of me. we learned to practice the tasks of scientists in the laboratory, such as asking questions, executing procedures, collecting data, evaluating data, answering questions, and generating new topics to investigate. The labs were interesting to do and talk about. Some labs were confusing but when we talked about them in class, it was easier to figure things out with my classmates and my professor. I would like to take labs In-person because it helps students to focus on what they are doing and not be drifting off the topic or be busy doing something else, it also brings people together to experience the labs. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2910,"I would say my overall takeaway from the course is being able to appreciate the enormous value that groupwork has, specially with face-to-face interaction. Physics in general is difficult to digest (and 230 even more). This lab course serves as a support that reinforces the topics taught in the main course, both from the help of my teammates and out instructor. Sharing questions and thoughts around with other people really helps give a fuller understanding of topics and subjects covered.    In terms of Physics, this course has shown me that Physics can be understood more easily when presented in a concrete manner. A lot of times Physics (at least inside classrooms) is taught using concepts, diagrams, formulas, equations that seemingly have no practical application. However, opportunities like laboratories let us experiment bit by bit with what is behind (or perhaps is even the cause of) what we learn in lectures."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2913,the greatest take away from this class is the application of the laws we learned. the application of physicals in real examples come together and help me get a better understanding of the concept and where it originates from. another great take away would be group work. working as a team to achieve a common goal is something I’m not able to experience in other classes including lab. group work with applications of physics both helped me understand the concept and helped me strive in the course. The magnetic field lab was a great example of how the application of a concept/law helps with the understanding of the concept. From the drawings to the math it all came together and matched perfectly to what I’ve been learning in regular lecture
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2912,"My greatest take away from this class is just learning how to use the equipment we use in lab. It's fun to work with big machines and how they work together. I want to work in computer engineering so learning these electrical machines is definitely going to be useful. Additionally, it this lab specifically is useful for just understanding physics. The lecture portion of this class is confusion and hard, so I have a hard time following the topics being discussed and how they actually relate to real situations or scenarios. But this lab is helpful bc you explain the topics for lab in a much more simplified way that I can actually understand. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2914,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that collaborative work and getting help from my instructor is nice! I used to always dislike group work in college, specifically because breakout rooms were my only experience with them. Having an in-person group is a lot more comfortable for me personally, and it encourages me to keep coming to class because I feel like I'm forming more of a bond with my partners than just seeing their names on my screen. Zoom groups might be physically easier, but in person group are emotionally easier for me! I'm also less adverse to getting help from my lab instructor. In Zoom, it felt awkward to call them in and it was hard to communicate, I always felt like I was talking over people or like my point wasn't fully getting across because they couldn't see my body language. In person, questions I have can be answered quickly and clearly."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2911,"My greatest take away from this class just has to be the little things of seeing how the world works. This class hasn't exactly changed my life or my outlook on life but what it has done for me is demonstrated how certain parts of our world works. We've experimented with concepts that I would never think about in my day-to-day life and yet they are also very relevant to things we see in our everyday lives. Therefore, I think this class has made me a little more aware of the underlying processes in everyday phenomenon."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2909,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that I should be able to adapt to how my groupmates work in order to be most efficient. I tend to like doing my work solo and as a result, I struggle with working with groupmates. Projects, where we have to collaborate, make me struggle as sometimes there may be disagreements which I want to avoid as much as possible. However, I realise that just adapting to my groupmates and trying to be as patient as possible, it would make a lot of things a lot easier. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2903,"I think my biggest take away from this class were the topics of circuits and magnetism, not only because I need to take a circuits class in the fall, but mainly because those were the topics that did not stay with me from high school physics, and I have developed an interest in those fields since then. I really enjoyed this lab class because it was extremely hands on, and would always erase any doubts I had about a given topic by the end of the session. It was also a nice experience to work that closely with my colleagues, since our individual doubts or questions regarding a subject would all add to our collective understanding of the subject. Its also crazy to think of how fast this class has gone by, and how much we have learned. "
