2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2908,"I have many goals! I have goals to perform well on my courses here at SFSU. I have goals to find employment and meaningful work situations for my future. I am interested in making something of myself, to show that I am capable of high-performance work, and that I am capable of tackling different difficult tasks. I think this class is a perfect way to work on myself towards those aspects since I feel like I am very confused as to what's going on in this course. This is a good thing to me because that just means there is so much more about the field of STEM that I have yet to access and recognize. I think this course is a perfect test of will and hard work. Much like the other classes I've taken, this is no different in that I have no clue what is going on. However, this time, I think my performance will prove to be much different than my previous performances. I want to learn more about the truth in ""showing up"". I believe that in just ""showing up"" to whatever I need to do, that I will be doing more work than the next student. I think I am also trying to learn more about the bigger picture of STEM, and I think this course is helping me envision the whole overarching picture of applied mathematics and computing. Thats what I think!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2904,"My goals are to finally graduate college and begin my career in tech investing money in order to have my money work for me. This class will help me reach these goals because I absolutely must pass this class in order to graduate and free up my time that currently college has taken so much of. Furthermore, I want to channel my ability to do things that I really do not like to do. I cannot say that Physics is something that I am all that interested but I feel as though this class will help me sharpen this ability."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2905,Some goals that I have for myself is to get an internship eventually. It’s been my biggest goal going into my third year and something I really want to do over the summer. I have classes going into the summer so it will be hard to keep everything manageable. I worked on getting connections so that I can have multiple options going into the summer season that can help me on my resume going back to San Francisco. When I think about my goals I think that it is highly possible to accomplish these goals. I have my family and friend connections in the engineering world so I think constantly checking up on all of them I can see which ones will fall into my schedule.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2911,"My goals are to become a software engineer or something of that sort. My major is computer science and this class is one of my major requirements. This class will help me achieve these goals by letting me complete my major. It will also help me in my Physics 230 class which is also a requirement for my major. Overall, this class isn't that relevant to my goals but it might be relevant to a computing class in the future. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2912,"My goal is really just to understand electricity/voltage/etc. better. I need to understand it so that I can be successful in my next classes dealing with circuits I really dont want to have to take this class again. Ive never been very good at physics and I'm not going to lie, I don't really care that I am not good at physics. I am just trying to pass with an A and learn some knowledge along the way, but I can't say I am super emotionally invested. Anyway, my point is, im hoping by just paying attention, taking careful notes, and attending all my labs, I wlll be prepared for my future classes. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2910,"My current goals as mundane as they might sound are plainly to connect with more people. These past lockdown semesters have taken a toll on most people, and for me personally, the thing I struggled with the most was that lack of communication with tangible real human beings. On the flip side, I am taking this class “out of order” (per the suggestions of my major’s roadmap), which means I know absolutely no one in the class. This is slightly intimidating but very beneficial in a sense since I am forced to interact and work with new people.If we’re talking more about what this Physics course in particular can offer me, I would probably say that it fulfills one of my prerequisites. Again, very boring and maybe even unjust, but right now I’m simply not that interested in Physics. It’s not like I’m saying Physics was my jam and now it isn’t, rather, I used to like it but now not so much."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2914,"My most current goals are to keep striving towards my degree and to not overwhelm myself. This class helps me in the first goal mentioned since it’s one required for my graduation roadmap and gives me knowledge I can build on in classes I have to take later in my academic career. Since this class is pretty laid back as well, it helps support my second goal. The workload doesn’t stress me out and instructors are approachable. More long term goals I have are to enter the STEM field for my career, in a wet lab or otherwise hands on branch. This class helps me towards that goal as it gives me more in-person experience with the foundational concepts I’m learning in the lecture portion of the course. I’m not going to be a physicist, but more exposure to lab work and procedure is something I’m happy to practice with!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2903,"My goal in this class is to be able to retain my knowledge of the formulas and concepts after the class. Taking physics online last year was definitely tough because I feel like the class setting took out a lot of the enjoyment of the class and made feel like trying to get a good grade was more important than actually learning the material fully. I found myself doing the bare minimum to get through that class, so this semester I decided to make it my goal to really get a grasp of the material that I can keep with me for a long time. I found that I only had this issue in physics, as opposed to calculus, because calculus is more of a class where you work on perfecting certain equations and concepts, while physics is more about the quantity and simple being able to recognize when to use a variety of equations."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2909,"My goals for this class are to understand the topics that we learn on PHYS230 more so that I am able to use this knowledge in my future classes and applications. This class can really help me out with this goal as I am slightly confused with some of the topics that we learn in the lecture class. With the fact that this lab is a class that shows the real-life applications of the topics that we learn, it helps me to understand how the topics that we learn work. I think that this class will be one of the best ways to study for things that we learn in the lectures. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2906,"When I entered this class my goal is to know more about physics and the theories around physics. It clarifies the fundamental understanding of the topic in the minds of the pupils. Students are aware of the distinction between theory and practice. A physics laboratory can assist a student in improving their understanding of the topic. in the previous years, I had a lot of labs and it helped me develop more with numbers and entering data on my documents and what the experience comes out to be. In my opinion, after experiencing a lot of lab classes through high school and college. it helps you understand more about the actual rules and physics because it helps you figure out what you need in order to solve this equation or question. One of the years, I had a tough understanding the lecture about physics but when we had the lab, It helped me understand more about the physics lecture. Also one of my main goals in this class is to reach the logics that faces us every day in our lives, this pushes me to do all the homework so I can learn more about the lab that we are taking every week and search more because the more you know the easy for you to understand. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2012,"My goal for this semester is to learn to be more flexible by balancing the assignments that are given during different classes since most of the classes I am taking this semester as of now are needed for me to move into my upper divisions. To be honest, I took some of these classes, which I will not specify because I feel pretty guilty for failing these classes before but being online made me lazy and actually made me lose motivation to keep going academically hence why I started doing my work quite late once the semester was over; I am hoping to change things this semester and hopefully be able to pass my classes this semester since I am in a learning environment. I will achieve my goal by being able to attend every class I can, especially since I am finally now being placed back in a learning environment that I truly believe I desperately needed it. I am hoping that with this semester being in person, I will be able to focus on each of my classes and actually rekindle that hope to graduate from college, and I am hoping to learn anything I can along the way about myself both mentally and academically."
