2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2904,"Transitioning to in person classes has helped me get more or less back into the flow of school. When we were not in person there would be questions that I would have, not necessarily for this course but in general, that I could not explain all to well over email. For these reasons, in person classes have helped me dramatically. The commute to class sometimes can be very difficult but overall it is well worth it. In terms of self-care, I try to spend as much time as possible working out exercising and meditating. I have found that doing both has really helped my stress levels. Moreover, they enable me to have a clear mind for my classes."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,166,"Transitioning to more in-person classes hasn't done too too much for my learning. Instead, evolving teaching practices and classroom practices is what has had the most positive impact on my learning. For example, I've noticed more and more professors transitioning away from closed note/closed book tests in favor of open note tests. I feel like this is a good practice as in a practical, non-academic setting no one would actually forbid you from looking at a reference or looking up something up online. Instead, exams and quizzes should be structured in a way where you can use your notes and other resources, but benefits those the most who know exactly what to look for or already the material. I also appreciate how more professors seem to be skewing away from stressful final exams in exchange for projects that better allow students to demonstrate what they've learned on the exam. Though, because I have to commute to campus, having to go on to campus can sometimes feel more inconvenient then just grabbing my computer and logging on. There are also some practices from online learning that I feel like should continue, such as recording lectures and uploading PowerPoints to iLearn. Honestly, I'm a really busy student and I work a part-time job too for 24-32 hours a week. The most I do for self care is try to cook for myself and pick a certain time each day where I just completely stop working on school and having a couple hours in the day to do what I want to before going to bed. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2914,"Transitioning to mostly in-person classes has had its pros and cons. It's benefitted me in that I pay more attention and can make connections with my classmates more easily. But it's also difficult to keep up the motivation to make a 2 hour commute and find somehow to take my online classes, and work too. It feels like I'm in two different modes of learning, online and face-to-face, so it's hard for me to give enough attention to both-- I'm either completely invested in my online classes or only caring about getting to my in-person ones. For self-care this semester, I'm taking off a lot more days to rest, which isn't the best for my grades but is better than me completely burning out. I'm concerned with whether or not I'll find a sustainable way to balance everything in my life before the semester ends, but I think I can do it!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2909,"I think that going back to in-person classes has allowed me to do a lot better for my learning. During online classes, I struggled with focusing on my classes and finding the motivation to do my schoolwork properly and on time. However, being back to in-person classes has allowed me to find a sense of urgency in finishing homework and studying lessons. I think that for my self-care, though, being back to in-person classes has caused me to be more stressed with keeping up with my classes and the workload that comes with it. I am concerned about becoming too stressed and losing the motivation to continue doing well in my classes."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2913,transitioning to in-person class has really helped me to stay focus in class and get a good understanding of the concept. with online classes i would easily get distracted and side tracked. the pandemic has been draining mentally and physically. something that ive been doing to help me with this transition is slowly exploring the city. if i have time after class i just go on the muni or bus and stop at a random location and just explore and my surroundings. Ive also been working out to relieve any stress i have from school. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2012,"Ever since we have transitioned to in-person classes this semester, I believe it has been giving me a positive reaction because now I feel like I am physically and mentally in an academic environment rather than being stuck at home where I could find myself often distracted. Sure there are some positives and negatives about being online, but I missed the commute, being able to walk to my classes. I also believe I am doing much better now that we are back on campus. Ever since classes are back in person though, I have been doing a few things for self-care, sometimes I might treat myself to something I like eating, but what I have been doing is popping in a call with my friends even if for a few minutes to help me unwind. I haven’t had time to do many things for myself but there are times I will decide to play some video games or even sit down and spend a few minutes drawing just because if I stick my head to school for so long, it’ll make me feel slow mentally. I never really do things for self-care unless it just means stopping academic work for a few moments.Some concerns I have for my learning are mostly me wondering if next semester will remain in person, but it also makes me wonder if my classes will be difficult, making me ponder on if it would be easier online. Some concerns about my well-being are whether or not what I am doing for myself is actually helping because sure it’s great to be back on campus but I tend to overthink what I am doing and how it makes me feel which isn’t very pleasant when I think negatively. Despite the road being bumpy, I’d like to believe that everyone, including teachers, loves to take a break from their academic life by doing things they enjoy, breaking away from the academic slice of life we are in."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2908,"Transitioning into in person classes has been one of the most beneficial things for me coming out of the Pandemic. I was starting to understand the appeal and desire for working from home, however, me being a social animal, I really enjoy consistently leaving my home to do my studies. Having to make a trip to class is always a new experience, especially being a skateboarder in these San Francisco hills. Having to go to class gives me some sense of structure, a reason to be in the city, and its great exercise. I generally take muni, so I am forced to immerse myself. I also enjoy being on campus! I enjoy skating on my breaks at West Campus Green, and I have found some form of work on campus!If anything, having to go to campus for schooling has been amazing for my overall self-care.So overall, I really like being on campus and returning to in person classes. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2906,"This year when we had the class in person it was such a big impact on me and my classmates because we were able to connect with each other in class and that was something we were missing. In my opinion coming into class Megs things a lot easier for you for example we had a really tough lab last week but with our teacher help and my classmates work together, we were able to finish the lab with each other on the other hand if we were doing this online we would’ve struggled a lot because the teacher wasn’t able to show us face to face and explain more efficiently for the students because they are sitting in front of her so whoever is confused about the lab can ask and it will take less time to figure things out in the life. Coming in in person was such a relief thing for my lab partners that wanted to meet new people and we all became friends and we were able to help each other in other classes, if that was the case and online probably a high chance we would’ve not been friends and make new connections in your life and learn more about your college and your classes. Doing the lab by your hands and writing down the data by handwriting is so much easier for students to do but on the other side the cons and the pros of everything in life. The bad things about the lab that some labs takes less time that we think and it makes people come all the way from far places for 30 minutes Lab while they can just finish it online at their home and save time for other classes to work on it, these are some things that may be improved or fixed by the time we have more time and flexible hours to come on campus and arrange it with the professors of the lab is sure that we can finish it online . This would help students to focus more on their classes and save time to work or to take care of their selves because going to college every day is hard for some people to make it on time and have that much energy to commit every day. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2903,"I like in person classes a lot more because participation is a lot more genuine and less forced. In online class, I felt like any sort of participation that the professors would want from the students would only hinder the class and slow it down, and online class also made it a lot less human-to-human which definitely affects your well being, since you can have class for hours upon hours a day. Being in class and talking with others definitely makes you feel better and more comfortable in the class, especially since you're surrounded by people that have common interests with you. I also find that I do better on in person tests since I can focus a lot better. In person school overall makes you feel better, since that's how school is supposed to be and how we've all done school growing up. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2912,"Transitioning to in-person classes has been kinda rough for me. I have really preferred online classes these last few years and going back in person has made everything more stressful. I have to manage more of my time very precisely and I have to actually get dressed and present myself in front of a lot of people. Being online too made it a lot easier for me to interact with class because I am quite shy and often prefer to sit in the back and never talk. I recently have adopted a dog though to help with my anxiety and give me something to look forward to when I come home. This also means that I go for many walks a day and actually get some exercise. My dog is a bit of a mess and sometimes gives me more anxiety than I already had, but I love him still and I don't mind. Other than that, I don't do a lot for self care because I simply don't have time to. I do try to get at least 6 hours of sleep though and that helps, but I find I am tired throughout the day regardless. Despite this, the semester should be over soon and I'll be able to relax once it is. I am taking way too many classes this semester (because I had to) and the next semesters will not be as painful. Also hopefully I will be given more opportunities to take my classes online. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2911,"I haven't transitioned much into in-person classes because I only have 1. I think online classes have actually been better for me because I've always thrived in independent study situations and it's hard for me to follow an entire class's pace rather than my own. I'm not doing much for self care right now because I am so busy with work and school. I'm concerned that I will burn out before I graduate because I feel like the rest of my time at SFSU will be like this. However, I'm doing my best to work on my time management and be efficient as possible with my schedule."
