Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2903,"I want to go into the STEM field many because of innovation and engineering. I feel like the STEM field is just one of those fields that has no ceiling. I definitely want to be a part of that. STEM is the type of field that dominates our everyday lives; its what we see around us the most and its what we pay attention to. Our society is very much driven by technology, such as having the newest iPhone, and its that kind of drive that I want to be a part of. Choosing my major in Mechanical Engineering didn't come easy. At first, engineering was a passion that I knew I had, but for some reason, didn't see myself pursing. It was only after dipping into other, non-STEM majors, that I found my love for mathematics and physics that I could have never expected myself having. For the future, I want to be a part of a team that either optimizes existing solutions, or researches something new. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2904,"I want to get into the STEM field in order to learn everything I can learn in order to understand things about the world in a more informed way. Furthermore, I want to be able to teach my son everything I know early in his life so that by the time he reaches my age he's just as smart as anybody at this stuff. Lastly, I want to enter the STEM field in order to earn income that is passive. I can do things like write books and post videos on YouTube that will make me money even when I am asleep, granted that I can present the information in a more informed way."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2905,I want to be in the stem field for plenty of reasons. I always saw stem as the future and knew that being in the field I'll be apart as moving the world into the future. When growing up I wanted to become a math teacher after all my teachers would make me be very interested in math but strayed away from that Idea as I grew up because I wouldn't be doing any self growth in bringing the future to a brighter area. I am now an electrical engineering major and happy with my decision. This major is really beneficial to the world and something I saw that was in high demand so it drew me towards it more because it's something not many people do. I am super excited and there is always new to create and I love to know that there's always more to learn. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2906,"I want to become a STEM student because People like me need help at the beginning of their careers because they don't have the experience and the participation. Employers in the STEM fields are in desperate need of skilled and competent personnel. Pursuing a STEM profession can give you employment stability and a great sense of being an important part of our economy. This helps our future generation to grow up in their lives and be able to help the next generation as they were being taught by the previous people. Also, STEM has a variety of work and people helping in all careers filed to be able to find you next destination of your life. In my opinion, the stem also has some cons that the lack of money or the lack of teachers would not help you on your next move. So you have to pick correctly and know what are you want to do in your major and what you going to specify. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2907,"I would like to be in a position where I can help enable the world for people, to make it an easier place to live in. I was always interested in fields of STEM, and am currently looking to major in Computer Science. My goal is to be able to go into the research and development of artificial intelligence, more specifically in the field of machine learning to help make the world an easier place for people to live. Using machine learning in our world would help make mundane tasks automated, therefore giving people the opportunity to showcase their creative side as well as learn more and get more out of their job. This will have a huge impact in the industries we have today as it will help speed growth and innovation. Artificial Intelligence overall will also help develop more efficient and accurate methods in important fields such as health and medicine."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2908,"The field of STEM has always interested my. I've always been someone who is interested with computers and learning more about it is really enjoyable and invigorating for me. A lot of my semester has to do with coding, which is a niche topic that allows for a lot of room for me to naturally grow. I think my mind is very able when it comes to learning new concepts and skills regarding computing, programming, and mathematics. I also think it would be a great field to get into for my future. I am super excited to study STEM for these reasons. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2909,"I wanted to go into the STEM field because as a kid, I have always liked math and science. And after high school, I realised that I would enjoy being in some sort of technology major. And because I was interested in so much in the STEM field, I decided to go into it. I also loved computers, which made me choose my major: Computer Engineering. I love the classes that I'm taking, such as math, physics, chemistry, programming. So, I think that I already knew that I was going to be in the STEM field pretty early in my life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2012,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field? I never really sat down and thought much about this question but to be completely honest I never thought I would go into a major that is a part of STEM when entering college. Looking back at the past, I came in as a Psychology major and switched into the major I have now been working hard for which is Biology with a concentration in Physiology. My father has always loved Biology, and I think because of him I decided to switch into something that he loved and hopefully be able to complete what he never was able to accomplish himself in his life but I believe that with a career in Biology I will be able to have a successful future like being able to work with forensics which is something I believe would be good for me or perhaps working in a laboratory using a microscope- it’s always been amazing to look at something that isn’t visible without the help of tools. I have a sort of love-hate relationship with the courses I had taken; keep in mind there are a lot of requirements for this major of course but throughout the years, I have started to like certain things about the classes I have taken. This has been so difficult to follow through and yes, there are times I feel like giving up and going into an easier career or something that I have been good at but I need to keep in mind that this will come with amazing awards so it’ll be worth the hurdles. I still have more to go, but I know I will learn more about myself and maybe my love for this major will grow: it is a lot of hard work to put into this major which isn’t easy and it means I haven’t been able to go out as much but I believe I will graduate despite the bumpy road ahead, besides, I have a brother who is also the same major as I am so I want to show him that he can do it too because we go to the same campus as well. I want to be there for him and hopefully, he loves what he does in the future; we will both push each other and hopefully be able to graduate!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2910,"My choice of career wasn't really fueled by some great deal of inspiration, more than the fact that I perform better in it than in Humanities. I'm generally not the best with reading and writing, so science classes where I can reason my way out of things seemed like a good choice. But that didn't really give me a specific major I wanted to study. I'm currently studying Computer Science on a whim really; I don't dislike it or anything, but I don't feel that ""drive"", if you will. To that extent, last semester I started questioning if I wanted to stick to it or not and fancied the idea of Math for Teaching. It's still STEM, so the prompt still applies. The first reason that comes to mind once again is the fact that I'd be god at it, but something reassuring to me is that this major has the extra appeal of Teaching, which I have always liked since high school. Helping people understand and learn how to think is really gratifying to me ans something I believe I can do relatively well. I'm even teaching an SCI course this semester for the first time, so that's exciting!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2911,"I want to go into the STEM field because I like coding and I want a job in the computer science field. I've always been good at math and so coding and similar subjects have never been too difficult for me. I'm not particularly passionate about programming itself but I do have some interest in it and being able to create my own software. I have to admit that part of my interest in a career in STEM is due to the pay and stability of the career. While I wouldn't want that to affect how I choose a career, in actuality it does matter. I don't have any other fields that I would prefer over STEM so I'm planning to stick with this unless something really catches my eye."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2912,"I chose STEM for a few reasons. My father and brother are both STEM majors and I have always looked up to their intelligence. Growing up I wanted to follow the path they took too, so I did. As I got to learning things from my major I began to see just how much I enjoyed it too! I knew that pursuing an education and a career in STEM would make me very happy. All in all, I am a STEM major because I enjoy it, simple as that. As I begin to finish my GE's and get into the classes that really pertain to my major, I am getting more and more excited to keep going and keep learning. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2913,"Why do I want to go in the stem field?  The field of stem is full of opportunities and exciting new discoveries. I’m someone who is always curious about the latest technology, how things are built, and how things function. I had a late start when it came to my education. I jumped from major to major trying to figure out what would be best suited for me and what I enjoyed the most. Eventually I landed on mechanical engineering and worked from there. The science aspect of mechanical engineering reeled me in. I’m more of a hands-on person which is why I chose mechanical engineering.  Majoring in the stem field challenges students like myself to think outside the box and really sit down and figure out solutions to certain problems. What a lot of people don’t realize majoring in stem doesn’t mean you’ll be working by yourself. A lot of stem projects are most efficient in a group, this is another reason why I love majoring in stem. Interacting with different people seeing the way they solve and face problems and learning how they unravel a problem.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2914,"I want to go into the STEM field since it’s an interest that’s easiest for me to approach in a career and “working” mindset without ruining it, and it continues to hold my interest and evolve in real time! As I go through the classes for my major, I find that I’m still really interested in building on my knowledge and enjoying each step of my education as it comes, which is nice! I don’t feel a need to rush to the next goal, as excited as I may be for it, since my current position is just as fulfilling. I decided against pursuing my other interests, like interior design or fashion, as careers since those are more leisurely hobbies in my mind; I wouldn’t be able to dedicate myself to them the same way I can to the sciences. "
