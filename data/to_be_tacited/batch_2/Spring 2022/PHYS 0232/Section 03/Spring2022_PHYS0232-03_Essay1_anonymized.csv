Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2852,"After starting community college in 2013 and stopping in order to pursue a biotech career,I found that I need to go into the STEM field to further climb the chain of command in the tech world. Although i am studying civil engineering, my background of roughly 5 years in downstream/upstream biological processes will likely require a chemistry minor of some sort. In additional to the general need for a stem degree, I find the idea of being an engineer and solving problems relates to how i want to live my life. + biotech jobs can be mind-blowing. In the future I hope to touch on most of the stem field to be well versed on how most everything works. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2853,"I'm only interested in computer programming which is only one aspect of the STEM field, but I also know that STEM is a major field in advancing our society. Others can choose to focus on sciences or engineering but I find those to be too hard for me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2854,"I want to go into the STEM field because I want to use my knowledge to build something that makes people's life easier. I also like to work on something with my hands. Such as building a PC. I need to search the steps and solve problems during the process of building a PC. Solving a problem is like a puzzle, I use my knowledge and intuition to solve the puzzle. Getting into the STEM field helps me to have a better understanding of our nature. Such as why San Francisco doesn't rain in summer. I like the STEM field more than the liberal arts major because STEM is all about understanding rather than memorizing. My brain easily to lost information if I don't understand something or they are boring content.  I feel accomplishment when I build something useful or successfully prove my prediction by experiment. Working in a STEM field is my interest and it can help people. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2855,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field? Well when I was younger I always wanted to become a scientist and when I hit high school I really didn't know what I wanted to do. It wasn't until my friend in high school told me about coding and that was when I really got into the STEM field. I thought the idea behind coding was really cool and while it is a challenging major I feel that it is very rewarding. I guess that is why I chose to be into STEM. Science was also one of my favorite subjects growing up and I was always fascinated with the subject. I mean the money is a reason but I am genuinely interested in computer science and coding in general. Learning new languages excites me and when I have genuine progress it feels very rewarding. And although I am taking this class for a credit towards my major I was always fascinated with physics, and while I was intimidated on the math heavy sections of it I always thought that physics was cool, as it is the subject to learn more about how our universe works. Physics may be an intimidating subject but the physics classes that I have taken and am taking now have really opened up my mind and how our universe functions as a whole."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2856,"I joined the STEM classes because I'm interested in making things. I wanted to become a civil engineer as a career. I wanted to know on how things work all around our world. When I travel around, I'm very curious on how old and new structures work. I also want to know how creations end up either it's stable or unstable. Maybe, I want to make structures that can move. Making improvements all around me is also a thing that I like doing. I like to do out with the old and in with the new. My goal is to make something brand new by editing the old things by putting in something presentable for people to like and see. That way, we can evole on how we work and live in the future of our world. If we can change at all, we will be stuck in a loop forever."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2857,"I decided to pursue a career in stem because I always succeeded at mathematics as opposed to humanities. Specifically, I chose to work with computers because they significantly expanded the maths I had been studying into an entirely new discipline. I think having an understanding of all stem fields (physics, chem, bio, engineering, computer science, etc.) expands one’s brain to become a truest critical thinker. With a deep understanding of each of these disciplines I can analyze the complex structures which surround me in an urban environment. Also, I enjoy working in person on labs. I find labs to be very fun. A career in engineering opens many work opportunities for me all over the world. I hope to continue learning about the complex structures of the world while exploring it. Also, working in engineering and stem offer a unique opportunity to develop a new product to provide value to the rest of society. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,1835,"The reason I want to go into the stem field is that I like to work with my hands. It was in high school that I took an elective on automotive for beginners. While it was not the most up-to-date shop, the experience of working on a variety of cars was something I enjoyed. While I don't have a clear idea of what specific job/title I want, I know this is a field that interests me and hopefully one day can be part of the workforce. So far my only experience related to STEM was an internship in the engineering field. An internship took place in the city and county of San Francisco as a stationary Engineering. I learned a lot from this experience and become aware that there was more than math equations and coding. All in all, it's what pushed me to pursue a degree in the STEM field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2858,"The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is because math has always been my strongest point. Out of all the subjects I have taken in the past, I enjoy math and it has been something I can focus really well on. For the science part, I enjoyed physics in the past. I love exploring physics because there are a lot of aspects where they can be applied to many things. For the engineering and technology part, I really like how we keep evolving these things further and further each year. As for myself, I want to contribute to these things in the future and probably do something that hasn’t been heard of. So in short, the reason why I want to go into the STEM field is that math and science are my favorite and strong points. Engineering and technology are my desires for what I want to do in the future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2859,"I want to go into the STEM field mostly because it's a field where I feel like I'll be the most comfortable.  Most of the humanities subjects i never really excelled at and I like to work with numbers so STEM seemed like the best choice.  I have no idea what I want to specialize in now but I'm hoping to understand in the next 2 years I have at SFSU.  It also helps that that is where the money is at, and hopefully I could do something along the lines of sales one day."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2860,"I guess I want to go into the STEM field mostly to find a job and be able to sustain myself. Over the past decade I eventually came to the decision that I'm fine with just being content with life. I don't really have any aspirations to chase something extravagant, instead I just want live a nice and simple/mediocre life. As for why I chose to go into the STEM field specifically, it's because areas relating to programming/computers/technology are mostly concentrated in the STEM field. Since I've been using computers my entire life I took an interest in the subjects concerning them and decided that my familiarity with them would make Computer Science a more enjoyable pursuit than other options. My end goal with going into the STEM field would be to get a job able to sustain myself then pursue hobbies in my off time. Things like video games, learning the piano, and other things that might take my interest like Mahjong which I started playing 2 years ago and still play today."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2861,"I want to go into the stem field for many different reasons. The first reason is so that I could understand the current STEM related problems that other scientists are encountering. It's very interesting to me to see what types of high-level problems, the greatest minds in the world are having issues solving. So not only do I want to understand them, I want to be able to be knowledgeable enough to try and solve those problems on my own. I intend to innovate new technology and solutions during my life to better the lives of generations to come in the future. I strive to work towards solving humanities greatest challenges and make the world a better place for myself and others to come."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,232,"i was in the military doing tactical communications for 6 years. working with satcom and radios, doing IT work, and networking. i loved my job and wanted to stay somewhat in the field, so im majoring in computer science."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2862,"I want to go into the STEM field because I want to become a structural engineer. To start off, I like physics and math because those are the subjects that I understand the most and learn the fastest. I always thought it would be cool to design and make buildings or at least focus on the STEM part of it. It would be cool to look at a building and say “I helped build that” and then have many people use it for whatever purpose. I also like the fact that as a structural engineer I can help innovate a city by making it look better and be more efficient. I also really like the feeling of when I solve a problem, it makes me feel like I am unstoppable and relieved. Overall I feel like it is something that I can do pretty well to help better society and I also think it is interesting."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2863,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field? Mostly because I can’t do anything else. Nothing else calls to me the way Civil Engineering does. Growing up I always knew I was going to be some kind of an engineer. I loved building with Legos and pulling things apart just to see if I could put them back together. On paper and in my experience there are many downsides to being a woman in Civil Engineering, even sitting here writing this I note only two other women in a class of 25, but I cannot imagine doing anything else. I’ve always loved the thrill of figuring out equations, seeing what my hands can build, and thinking of new solutions. None of the other subjects felt like they were worth it to me, it was always going to be this. I’m hoping to go into sustainable engineering once I graduate and help be a part of building a better future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2864,"I want to go into the STEM field because I find STEM subjects more interesting and because I feel like I know better what I am doing in my STEM classes. The type of logical, problem-solving, step-by-step thinking that is used so heavily in STEM is my strong suit. While I do perform well in my other classes, I lack the confidence that I have in STEM. In humanities classes, I always felt like I was doing all my assignments blindly and just doing well based on luck. I never understood what I was doing, nor did I care as much. But, in STEM classes, I feel like it’s more clear whether or not you are on the right track. This makes me feel so much more confident when I do well in STEM. The answers are usually clearly right or wrong and not based on more objective opinions like in the humanities or arts."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2865,"My path is CS has been propelled until now by the following three principles: Plato when he says [that] ""the price of apathy is to be ruled by evil men.""Wael Ghonim when he says, ""[that] technology is here to serve people, not to manipulate them nor monetize their attention. [..] [and that] access to secure and productive technological advancements is a universal human right. And In the advice of Cesar Chavez, ""We cannot seek achievement for ourselves and forget about progress and prosperity for our community... Our ambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and needs of others, for their sakes and for our own."" There are principles I find a lot of harmony in and I consider to be at the forefront of what I do. I have always felt a slight bit indifferent to the field of study I'd go into so long as that I can apply myself through it and be of service. Currently, I'm finding a lot of ways in which engineering solutions can be beneficial to others so that's the path I hope to continue on. Just how Malcolm X and MLK changed the course of history through words, in a digital age the same can be done via technology. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2866,"I want to go into the STEM field because I always find something interesting about science. STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Among them, my favorite subject is science, especially chemistry. I have found lots of interesting things since I started learning Chemistry in 9th grade when I was in my home country. After one years of learning, I noticed that I'm interested in science and want to work in science as my career in the future. I believe that “Be interested in something would be the best teacher of learning something”. In addition, our convenient life is made up of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics nowadays. Human beings and even any creature on the Earth may not be able to live without science. Everyday’s life is filled with Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. It can be a small part as we need math to calculate when we check out the total price of the food we buy. It can be a big part as driving the vehicles when we need them to get to some places far away from home. And even larger part like fighting different viruses and their variations that are invisible to our naked eyes. We need the STEM field to make our life better and better. I only want to be a very small part of using what I learned about science to make people’s life become easier, safer, and better."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2033,"At first, I did not know what steam even meant but after some time now I know what it means. I liked math and physics a lot during my high school years back in my home country, but it changed while I was in high school. I still like it not that I don't but that the spark like before exists in me. Even while choosing my major, I just chose it because my family said it has a good future and would bring you success. I accepted even if I may not be good at it, I am trying as I follow my path here in SFSU. The steam field may not be my strong field, but I have always tried to be succus in this path. Hopefully, I can continue now as well. I am majoring in computer science which is really important for me to succeed. I do not want to disappoint my family, that's why I chose this field as they suggested indirectly. I will try to understand and ask questions as much as I can to adjust to everything. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2867,personally I want to go into the STEM field because of how cool everything is in the field and how well they can explain our world because it is very confusing. Also to be able to go on to greater things and create even more from what we have already known the progression we get from science and knowledge as well. The possibilities of creation and discoveries are endless in the STEM field that could help advance society advance our way of thinking. That is why I do love and plan to stay in the stem field forever because is it constant progression of and remastering of what we already understand and I just like to say that I helped advance society in some sort of way even thought it might be meaningless in the long wrong at the time it does not. Also STEM make me feel really powerful because I can explain and predict things that might happen in the real world because the knowledge that has been acclimated throughout history. Evan when something is wrong it is still right because now you have Ideas of what not to do and these ideas are based in truth and what we have seen. so all in all I want to go into STEM because I want to advance society and gain more knowledge because in the end knowledge is power. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2868,"I want to go into the STEM field because I'm more interested in this field than any other field they taught at school. I was never drawn in by history, English, or art; I always thought that math and engineering was something I wanted to do in my life. I wanted engineering to be my main focus of studying. I think the STEM field is the most interesting academic group for learning. I first heard about the STEM field in middle school. I attended a class that was STEM related, and enjoyed every part of it. We only worked on project related assignments like designing roller coasters in a simulator, building a bridge that could carry a brick using only toothpicks, and physics related projects. I had the most fun in that class than any other subject I was learning. And I thought that this style of learning is what I also want to do in the future."
