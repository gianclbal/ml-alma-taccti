2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2864,"My goal is to graduate with a B.S. in computer science. The most obvious way that this class will help me with this goal is by satisfying part of the physics requirements for this major. Both PHYS 220 and PHYS 230 as well as their corresponding labs are required to graduate with a B.S. in computer science. Honestly, I don’t see how physics is supposed to help me with computer science because it’s mostly software. It probably would have helped more if I was doing computer engineering which is more hardware-focused. I would probably be able to apply the concepts within electricity and magnetism to how the hardware works. This is how I felt about the physics requirement before taking these classes though. I would say that they did improve my problem-solving skills, which are important for computer science, with all the difficult problems I did so far in both this class and PHYS 230. It also doesn’t hurt to have this knowledge in case I do want to learn more about computer hardware."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2867,my goals as of right now are trying to just finish off the last 2 years of my college career then from there if I still have the drive and want to pressure my education further into my senior year I will etheir apply for a master program in the east coast to maybe a phd program for chemistry to be a pharmaceutical scientist. in the sort term this class will help me because I need it for my degree and then from there I can move on to my major core classes which I am really excited about. other then that I think physics is just one of those hard classes for me that I know if I can get through it I know I can do anything. somewhat like organic chem I feel like if I can get through it then I am okay and will succeed in achieving the hardest things in my educational career. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2860,"My goals are to be able to sustain myself in life, with a decent amount of free time that I can use to pursue hobbies/interests. As for how this class can help me achieve these goals, there are two ways that come to mind. Firstly as well as quite bluntly, this class is a necessary requirement for my major, where I hope the process of getting my Bachelor's degree provides me with somewhat of a start in a career path. Secondly, I've always been fascinated with the inner workings things around us. And this class delves into understanding how electricity works on a fundamental level which is something I've been somewhat interested in. Gaining more knowledge about how the things around us work helps sate one of my interests."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2855,Right now my goal is to progress further in my degree and by taking this class is a part of that goal right now. I need to pass this class in order to fulfill my requirements. I also have other goals in mind that don't relate to this class but this class and classes in general help me achieve my goals by being able to stick with something for a long period of time and seeing it out. I sometimes blank out on classes or get bored and being on my own and being accountable for my classes has really helped me break this bad habit and I really want to be a more responsible and hardworking person. So taking this class also has been very interesting. Learning more about physics has been pretty cool and I honestly thought I wasn’t gonna enjoy this class as much as I have.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2859,"My goals of physics have been ultimately to pass the class and just forget about it altogether.  However, something that I've learned about studying for physics that I would want to apply to my other classes is starting to derive not only equations but fundamentals.  Something that I've learned to be very useful this semester is a 100% understanding of the basis which takes my mind off of the harder problems and how to approach them.  Physics has been helping me because I've been understanding more material by only memorizing the base equations which can be interwined with multiple other equations."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2852,"My goals for the most part stem down to gaining engineering knowledge from a number of concepts/fields to make myself fairly compatible with whatever roles I take on in the future. These roles range from biotech tech to environmental engineering to health so most everything I learn for every class can apply to what I could be doing in the future. The current Electrostatic labs will definitely help with real world applications. Now given I am pursuing a bachelor's degree, it is understandable to say that most classes aside from core Civil Engr. classes will lack sufficient concentrations on topics that may help me once I climb the chain of command. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,1970,"My goals for this next semester is being able to become better on complete my homeworks more, to procrastinate less, have better time management, and become more comfortable to ask for help. I feel like the last couple of semesters have been really tough and I have done a horrible job on trying to communicate with those around me and my professors about the struggles I might be going through. I have a really hard time recognizing that I need help in certain aspects in my life and not reaching out for help makes the situation much worse. When it comes to procrastination and time management, I tend to lose track of time when doing something, or I get distracted easily when trying to complete work. This can help with all of these when we are able to work during groups which help me stay on task. Another thing this class can help me on is being able to get comfortable asking the professor for help when I need it. I just need to push myself more often to be able to complete my work and become more comfortable to  be more communicative"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2862,"I have many life goals like visiting different countries and buying a car and stuff like that but if we are talking about my education and career, I just want to succeed. What I mean by succeeding is that I want to become a structural engineer and help build and improve cities. There are many stepping stones I have to pass in order to become a successful structural engineer and this class is one of them. It will help me understand the concepts of electricity and magnetism which I will need in the future, whether it is for my career or for another class. Another goal is to improve my time management since I am constantly procrastinating and not getting enough sleep. This class is helping just by not overloading me with work but still having something to do. Overall, I just want to have a good and happy life with a job I enjoy. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2866,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?My goals are to get a bachelor's degree of science in chemistry, and if I am able to be further, I want to get a master's degree in chemistry too. So that, when I will be more confident to get into my career and look for jobs after getting my academic degrees. This class will help me to achieve my goals because of what I learned and what I will learn about Physics. Physics can be embodied in many different scientific fields. I have heard that the basis of biology is chemistry, the basis of chemistry is physics, and the basis of physics is mathematics. In the STEM field, they are connected with each other all the time. So, this lab class will also be helpful for achieving my goals."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2861,"One of my goals is to gain a solid understanding of physics so I can create my own workshop for innovative technologies. I am working towards creating a good time management schedule so that I could be accountable and knowledgable for these topics. I intend to create a company where innovation is emphasized and encouraged to lay out a better future for us. By focusing and learning from this class, I can apply this knowledge to real life scenarios. Time management is an extremely hard thing to work with but I am trying my very best to be accountable and take time out of my day to grow. I am really excited to be continuing this class for this reason and can't wait to see what else we learn in the upcoming weeks."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2858,"For goals I'll split them into short term goals and long term goals. For short term goals, I still need to get back into shape of going back to in person class. For me to achieve this, I need to have a better sleeping schedule and plan my schedule a lot better. Since it takes around two hours to get to school and back home, I basically lose 2 hours in the day that I usually have to myself. Another short term goal is that I need to pass my current classes to open up more options for the future. By passing these classes, I don’t have to worry about wasting time being in school for not being responsible in the past. For long term goals, I would like to see myself working a job that I enjoy. I think by finding something I really enjoy will drive me to the right path."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2863,My goals for school are to graduate with my civil engineering degree and go into sustainable engineering. I want to travel the world for some time if possible and own my own house one day. I hope to be able to graduate in 2024 or 2025. After I graduate I want to get my professional engineering license and maybe a master’s degree. I want to build places that give people joy and are helpful to those around them. I want to improve cities and bring them up to the standard I know they can be. This class helps me get to these goals because physics is necessary for getting my degree. It is also a prerequisite for the next physics class I need to take. Physics is pretty important for civil engineers for the obvious reasons of knowing how to design structures without them falling apart. I am excited to be able to apply the things I learn in this class to my future studies.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2856,"I've been working so hard until I fell asleep. I learned on how to use and handle electrical devices and know how to use the equations for the application. It's better that I work as a team because one mind isn't really enough for me. That way, I can brainstorm and make connections to my thinking rather to myself. My goals are to have more and more understanding in the concept rather than make simple mistakes. What I can do is the read more of the concepts and see tutors more often. It may be tiring but to me, it will all be worth it by looking through it. Maybe I can look at more of the textbook too. Seeing more examples would be very good because that way, I can memorize all the many concepts for the next time I go through with something. Next time, I'll do better."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2854,"The goal for me in this class is to learn more physics knowledge while getting an A. I think basic physics knowledge is significant in the modern world. For example, we can generate electricity from a magnetic field. People who don't know physics may be surprised and think you must have some kind of magic. However, people who do know physics know that just a little tricks. Basic physics can help me to understand the pattern of the world such as water having a lower volume than ice, the moon itself doesn’t light up, the moon reflects the sunlight. This class helps me to verify physical theories instead of memorizing them. This class also help me to learn how to do rigorous experimentation. Before I attempt this class, I think getting the result that matches the theory is enough but a rigorous experimental process is more important."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2033,"Hi,My goals for this semester or this class are to learn as much as I can and practice daily to remember. It seems like I study but I can't focus or I am here physically but not mentally so thats' why I can't remember most of the things I spend the most hours on them to study. I am trying to make a schedule to manage everything and be organized. I also want to manage time by having a planner and setting my times to sleep early which is impossible as a CS major, but I will try my best."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2865,"As a teacher, I often tell my students that success is nothing but iterated failure. Like many of us, sometimes I give advice I forget to take myself.  I've been putting off this physics class for quite a while and although I really enjoyed the subject in high school, I couldn't get myself to sign up to take the class. I'm not quite sure what was holding me back, I'm really enjoying the process and conversations we're having in class thus far. More specifically, my goal is just to have fun and learn to learn. Currently, I'm studying software engineering which is a very technical field. We learn how to do things and how to do them well, how to optimize and problem solve and all that jazz. What's different for me in this class is that the concepts can be observed in the world around us and you can sort of marvel and wonder about the nature of the universe if you let yourself sit still enough. So, in short I'm just here to enjoy the ride, try my best not to over-conceptualize each idea, recognize i don't have as much control in the design of the problems solution, and just let myself learn things without too much pressure to get it right the first time, and of course observe how each of the concepts apply to the real world. The nature of the labs have been super helpful in allowing for that. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,1835,"My goal for this semester is to have better communication with my professors but more importantly with my peers. I have seen that when we split into groups, it is difficult to get students to talk to each other. It is difficult to speak when you are in a group that is silent for the most part. I believe this has to do with the fact that at times you can't put a face to a peer that you never have met. In my experience, I find it helpful when I reach first to my fellow peers when doing group work. This doesn't always work though. Sadly the conversation can quickly become one-sided. this class has helped as the group that I am in has students that want to communicate and delegate work evenly. Having the Professor come by each group also helps push students to talk to each other. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2857,"Felix Coffelt2/21/2022PHYS 232-03Reflection 2What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals? 	While my major is not specifically physics, I still believe having a well rounded and complex understanding of mechanics and basic physics is a valuable asset in the modern day. My goal in this class is to strengthen my understanding of these topics and obtain a literal comprehension by witnessing in class labs first hand. Currently physics is not my strongest subject. By pushing through, working ahead and researching more my comprehension of the class material will develop exponentially in the coming weeks. Achieving this will not only provide me with a dynamic appreciation of physical laws and techniques, but also develop my work ethic and gumption under times of stress. Furthermore, the lab work aspect of this class is incredibly valuable. I want to develop my teamwork and communication skills through practice during lab experiments. I hope these goals are realized in the coming semester. I look forward to developing into a better student, teammate and human. Thank you."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2853,"My goal in this class is to pass it, but in order to do that, I must achieve success. And in order to get that I need to find understanding. So my true goal is to learn and understand the concepts in the class. and thereby finding success in knowing and therefore passing the class. Of course, there are many ways of going for it but the main idea is to be persistent. not giving on when something seems to be hard because somethings one viewpoint of the concept is not enough, and like scientists before it may take many tries to find the result one is looking for."
