2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2857,"My greatest takeaway from this class is the knowledge of how to work efficiently during class time and produce a professional report in a couple of hours. Over the weeks of this semester we had a lot of time to practice teamwork with peers and through the process of completing labs my skills of efficient class time work and production of professional reports were developed. I really enjoyed doing labs in person this semester. Because of the pandemic I have not been able to take a physics lab class in person until now. I absolutely feel that my brain retains information better when I work with my hands on a project as opposed to completing online labs with simulations. Furthermore, the peer collaborative work online is very subpar in comparison to working together in class. It is far too easy to get distracted online and simply is not as fun or engaging. I enjoyed taking this lab class in person this semester.    "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2864,"My greatest takeaway from this class is my new lab skills. That is kind of vague, but what I mean is that I learned a lot about how to do labs and do them properly. PHYS 232 is my first in-person lab in college. I have done labs in person in high school but not within a college class. Labs in high school are simpler to follow and there isn’t as much thought into doing the lab procedure. In PHYS 232, I learned how to familiarize myself with the different equipment we used and interpret diagrams of the lab setup. Until now, I have only had online labs in college where we used simulations. The nice thing about simulations is that everything is already set up for you and you just had to click a few buttons and you get your data (which ends up being exactly what you expect). Doing labs in person requires a lot more thought to properly set up. Moreover, your results are not always reliable because of your own human error. You need to be able to recognize whether your data is accurate and where any possible errors came from."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2853,"The biggest thing Ive seen is how complex and involved electricity is involved in our daily lives, and how it's even more so in the field of computers. And honestly it is just a lot of equations that explains how everything works together."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,1970,"My greatest take away from this class was being able to experience in person labs, which is very different from doing it all online. I had a great time in doing this and I really enjoyed being in s group being able to complete labs that are more hands on about the things we are learning about in Physics. I really liked how we are given time to figure out the experiments and time to reflect with our group-mates about what the lab was used for. I really the lab group i ended up with, and working with them made the class much more enjoyable and interesting. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2856,"There were many great things from getting out of this class. The greatest take away for doing things in this class is working with real life tools. Using all kinds of machinery can help us learn how real-life work that relates to science. Trying out the technology gives us hands on experience when it comes to engineering and physics. Electronics were fun to tamper with because I get to see how the experiments work and compare the real-life applications to people's many STEM careers like electrical engineering, civil engineering, and structural engineering. But I know that there's a lot more to learn than in the in-person classes. We can work together as a team. Working as a group helps us know on how a real job feels like. People who have jobs work together in order to get the job done in no time. It's quite fun to work as a team rather than myself."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2859,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that if I understand the fundamentals enough, learning newer concepts would not be as hard.  This was something that I struggled with throughout my early years of highschool/college and it's nice to gain some confidence in my studying habits as well as understanding content.  As much as I didn't want to take another physics class, I learned a lot."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2852,"My greatest takeaway from this class was definitely the circuits, resistance, current, capacitator etc. topics with regards real world applications. I did not really understand how electricity and circuits worked to be honest, but after the few labs and lectures I gained a decent grasp on how standard circuits work and how to appropriately change them and pick correct resistors and their positioning. My initial expectations from this class were fairly low since physics 1 did not really do it for me, but most everything from this class went beyond my expectations. I do feel that labs provide a crucial part to learning when compared to lectures, the hands on experience and direct application of topic summaries provides quick and precise knowledge gains. I hope that future physics labs provide the same experience for me. There could be differences in approach from teacher to teacher, but your methodology made things fairly clear. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2868,"My greatest take away from this class was that doing labs at home isn't enjoyable, apposed to doing it in person. While I was at home doing the assigned labs, it was hard to stay concentrated because I have a lot of distractions at home going on all the time. It's also sometimes difficult to do the lab itself, and there isn't anyone you can ask right away for help. Although for some labs, I had my little brother participate in the labs with me and we had a fun time. If I was able to go to in-person classes, I think I would've enjoyed this class more. I feel like I would have also learned the material way better than I did, doing the lab at home. The lab I understood the most was probably the Ohm's law batteries. The simulation was very helpful in understanding the subject for that week's lab. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2866,"I think the greatest thing I took away from this class is that I got the chance to have a great experience in this lab since the beginning of Covid-19 breakout. All of the laboratories moved to a virtual model with simulators when the breakout of Covid-19 started. That means, no more hands on laboratories for us. In this class, we are back in classrooms, we can work with classmates and groupmates in real life. These teamwork help us build our team spirit up, so that we can be better adapted to the works of group cooperation. In our group, we separate into two parts when working on the lab. Some work on the lab experiments and data collecting, the other one work on the text editor, like procedure, introduction. Then, we analyze and come to a conclusion together based on the data we got. This can make our group complete the task more efficiently."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2854,"I learn many cool experiments in this class, I can measure the voltage and the current in the circuit, and I can measure the magnetic field and compare it to the theoretical value. I never get a chance to do an experiment by hand because of COVID. I learn the usage of each different physics equipment such as universal meters. All the experiments I did in the simulator are in the line with my expectations. This class taught me how to fail and experiment. I learn many details from those mistakes. I also meet many lovely classmates, we worked together on the experiment report. We always finish it in class time."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2867,I think my greatest takeaway from this class would most likely be team work and a better understanding of what voltage is and how it relates to current and resistance. from teamwork I think I have developed because sometimes we don't want to work and just having a team around you that has the same goals and mindset helps a lot because breaking down the task into little things that the group can kill I nice. Also it helps me even more sometimes because when I am not in the mood I still have to work on the assignment with my group and it gives me more skills to check myself because of the environment I am in. From the standpoint in physics having a better understanding or resistance effects voltage with circuits in series and parallel and from there how much current is running through a circuit as well as understanding how they all somewhat relate to each other in the real world. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2863,"One of my greatest takeaways from this class was a deeper understanding of how gravity works, which I realize wasn't the main focus of this course but still something I greatly appreciated. As a civil engineering major understanding gravity and its effects not only on solid buildings but on the particle level as well helps to understand the overall concept as well as the more in-depth meaning behind the dynamic calculations we are making. I like learning about how earth’s gravity and magnetic field work differently from other planets due to the earth’s age and makeup. I also appreciated learning about circuits and how energy flows throughout those systems."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2033,"The most important thing I learned this year was how to read a problem for what I know and apply what I have learned, even if I don’t understand necessarily how to go about a problem. I probably have the tools to do it, I just need to work through it. I’ve learned this year is how to use different concepts and graphs to figure out each physics question. I have learned how to illustrate goal-less problems with diagrams and then use these diagrams to answer specific questions. Also, I learned about how I learn is that it’s critical to keep trying and practicing difficult problems and making mistakes in order to ultimately learn something important."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2855,"My greatest takeaway from this class was to persevere. And also to take my time with the lab and not to rush them. Patience is another way to phrase it. I need to be able to take in information and understand it’s complexity. It’s alright if I don’t understand it the very first time, but to be able to be patient, persevere, and go back to the information and reapply it has really helped me this semester. I really learned about patience from this class and even after I would complete a lab, if I didn’t fully understand it then I would go back to the subject and go over the material once again. Overall I am very grateful from the skills and topics that I have learned so far from this class and I do hope that what I have taken away from this class can be applied to other things in my life. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2860,"My greatest take away from this class would be a greater understanding of how circuits work. Prior to this class I had no knowledge about how circuits worked and what they even were exactly. However due to the couple of labs that allowed for hands-on experience, I now understand more on how electricity flows through a circuit. The labs where we interacted light bulbs were the most helpful in getting me to understand how circuits worked. Being able to directly see the effects of circuit changes via the light bulb's glow was very helpful. It's nice knowing about the concrete mechanics of how things work, especially as something ubiquitous like electricity. While electricity is something we interact with on a daily basis, its mostly through a black box interface where we don't have to worry about the details of how the components inside work. Knowing a bit more on how electricity flows is definitely the greatest take away from this class that I'll think about a lot."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2862,"My greatest takeaway from this class would be that actually performing an experiment based on a concept can really help me understand the concept even better. When just reading or writing a concept can be hard to grasp but being able to see it in action can help clarify some questions that I may have. It also does help to do practice problems as I am applying the concept to equations and knowing when to use those equations. For me, it is similar to when I tried to learn how to ollie on my skateboard. I would read and watch videos on how to do one but it is easier when actually trying it myself. I could better understand the timing and how to place my feet. Trying to do things in my head gets way more complicated than when actually doing them. So basically, practice and experimenting are crucial parts of learning and understanding a concept. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2865,"What was my greatest take away from this class? I think my greatest take away from this class has just been: ask a lot of questions irrespective of how well you think you  understand. I guess it almost feels very obvious, asking questions will  help you understand better but for a long time I think considered it  something you do once you understand. While checking for understanding  is one part ""Am i thinking about this is the right way"" but it shouldn't  be the only question asked. I think I've set the bar too high for  myself that I don't allow myself to ask simple questions. I'm learning  that I don't have to have a semi-solid understanding of a subject in  order to ask questions. Just ask, then understanding will come along the  way. Its also helpful to other students who are unsure aswell and feeds into a great classroom environment. I think with online classes I've become more comfortable asking questions and can only hope that doesn't change once we're back in person."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2861,"My greatest takeaway from this class is being able to understand the basics of circuits and electricity. I love the idea of being able to build my own electronics for my needs and understanding this content can take me a long way in the realm of engineering. As intense as some of the work is, I find that everything we learn is necessary in the understanding of electronic components and power distribution. I especially find it fun to be able to work with REAL equipment so that I could apply some of the things learned in class in the real world. "
