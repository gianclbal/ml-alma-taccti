2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2853,"The reality is that I have been more focused being in class than being online, and that along with social interaction in person has really helped with my well being. My only concern is my fitness as being stuck at home has weakened my muscles and walking problems has appeared, but I believe for the short term. Otherwise I believe I am fine. Another problem may be my sleeping schedule as it was much more lax during stay at home periods, and returning to classrooms may cause tireness for my later class periods due to my varied schedule. I been personally dealing with this by sleeping early and preparing later classes with an energy drink."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2860,"Transitioning to in person classes have been nice as I found online classes to hamper my learning by quite a bit. In online classes, I found myself to be constantly distracted and pay much less attention, due to the access to my computer and being in my home environment. In in person classes however, since there's no distractions around I tend to be fully engaged in the material and retain much more information in that environment. A concern I do have about my learning is my social anxiety, as I really have to push myself to make it to in person classes. As for self care, I've always been wary of Covid and always wear a mask when going out as a result. Besides cautions regarding Covid I don't really have any concerns regarding my self-care. I've always liked solitude so my mental health throughout the pandemic has been doing okay as a result."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2863,"Transitioning to in-person classes has been a somewhat chaotic affair for me. I graduated high school when the pandemic first began and spent the entire first year of college online. Being online made it extremely difficult to meet people and kept me pretty isolated, which I think most people felt. I could tell we weren't learning as much either. I'm a civil engineering major and I had about 6 labs before I went back to in-person learning, all of those labs felt pretty useless and I don't feel like I really learned anything from them. In the first semester of my second year of college, I lived off-campus and all of my classes were in person, I went to Chico State at the time, and it was much easier to make friends. I ended up transferring to SFSU for various reasons and now you are all in person for the first time whereas I went back to a mixed schedule. I also commute from the east bay and find myself going days before talking to someone my age. It has definitely been a very weird time to experience and I think that while I am learning and enjoying what I learn, I am not going to look back on these years too fondly."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2856,"In person classes to me were quite interesting. It made me gain the experience on what's it like to be on campus like any normal day before COVID-19 broke out. Instead of me being inside in my house all day every day, I finally get to have the opportunity to make friends and get to know my teachers. Learning in ZOOM is pretty difficult because we don't get to ask frequent questions while on the zoom the professor leaves immediately. It's easier to be in class instead of being by myself. I get to work and brainstorm with others in order to get things done and accurately. Working by myself is kind of boring and hard to do if you don't have any ideas.  With self-care, I have my alone times in order to rest my brain because of all the crazy work I had to do. That's all I have."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2857,"The transition into in-person classes presented a few organizational problems. However, I find taking classes in person to be an overwhelmingly better experience. Working in teams is far easier when you are face to face with classmates. This is especially true for the circuit labs we have been doing in class. It is far easier to ask questions of the professor in person. Generally the process is far more efficient and at the end of a class I have learned more every time. This is because the temptation to lose focus in an online class is much greater. In regards to any self help I have been doing recently, exercise has been the most effective method. It is a quick and easy way for me to take care of both my physical and mental health. I like to do a bit of exercise everyday. Overall I am doing very well right now and I appreciate the opportunity to study in person."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2868,"Actually, transitioning to in-person classes has been a very difficult for me. I've gotten very used to doing the school work at home, the labs, and tests/exams. Especially tests/exams, I feel more anxiety because there's more pressure being in-person. Also, waking up on time for class and sometimes finding the motivation to go to class, instead of opening up your laptop and attending the zoom. For self-care, I've just been motivating myself to go until I get used to going in-person again. A concern everyone has on there mind when attending class in-person nowadays, is obviously catching COVID-19 and I'm also the same. It's very difficult to keep a peace of mind when showing up to class because you never know who went where and who came into contact with someone that has COVID-19. This is even more stressful for me because I have to grandparents living at home and they are very susceptible to the deadly virus. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2866,"Transitioning to in person classes have impacted my learning by deciding if coming to in person class or staying at home on zoom class. It is because there is a risk of infection of any Covid-19 variety even though everyone is required to put on a face mask for protection. The positive impact of self-care practices is that the professor requires all of the students who decide to come to the classroom for real in person classes must put on a face mask so that the face mask can be an important part of protection, for Covid-19 and common cold also. The instructor gives the lab both in-person and online versions so students can choose which one is more suitable based on our actual situation and needs. I believe these are the best supports for every student during this special period. I think those are enough for us to go through the transition from the long time breakout of Covid-19."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2854,"In-person classes make me feel like I am an actual college student instead of an unemployed person doing online classes. I am not able to focus study when we are on zoom, I always want to check my message or even not go to class because there is a recording. I can work with other classmates in the group when we are doing the in-person class. I don’t like the zoom breakout room because there is no one talking. In-person classes improve my study efficiency and I can meet more new friends. The concern for the in-person class is COVID, the vaccine is not 100% protect us away COVID. In addition, there is more and more various mutation in COVID, the old vaccine may not work."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2855,"I feel like transitioning to in person classes have impacted my learning in both good and bad ways. I do honestly enjoy online classes as it saves a lot of time for traveling for me but there are also some negatives as well such as more distractions. Overall I do think that it has impacted my learning in a better way because I feel more challenged in person. I feel like I do understand the material a bit more as well, but I won’t lie when I say I miss online classes sometimes. I feel that learning online also has its advantages as well such as saving time, and having zoom office hours help alleviate the disadvantages of online learning. One benefit from switching back onto in person classes is also feeling more on a schedule and helps me get into the mode of learning more as well. I do feel like it is a bit more draining though, having in person classes and sometimes can feel more fatigue as well, but overall I feel that there are both advantages and disadvantages to both in person classes and online classes."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2864,"Transitioning to in-person classes hasn’t really affected my learning much. I actually feel that I am learning better in person compared to online. It feels easier to focus in a classroom environment compared to being on zoom at home. When I am at home I feel much more easily distracted and constantly check my phone and think about other things. But, when I’m in a classroom I feel much more on-task because I associate the environment with learning. I do not have any concerns about learning or well-being when it comes to transitioning to in-person classes. As for what I have been doing for self-care, I make sure that I am getting enough sleep and eating consistently, so I can give my best in my classes. To manage stress, I also started going to the gym. I feel like I have a lot on my plate, so I make sure to be organized and plan out what I’m going to do each day."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2862,"Transitioning into in-person classes has been pretty easy but it does feel different. I prefer in-person classes over online because I feel like I actually learn more since there are fewer distractions. It also feels good to get some interaction with other people instead of through a screen. Transitioning into in-person is a pretty big change for me since I have not had any in-person classes for a bit over a year. For self-care, I hang out with my friends, go skate, or play video games. Some days I take completely off of school and focus on myself and do what I want to do for that day. Some concerns for me would be exposure to COVID-19 as I am seeing people face-to-face. I do not really see any negative consequences for my learning when it is in person. Overall, I feel like this change will benefit my learning and mental health more than online."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2865,"I have not yet actually transitioned back into in person classes since my work and school are too far apart. I'm actually hoping that I can get to graduation without having to go through the hour long commute to campus. I know that online hasn't worked for a lot of people but personally I think it's removed a lot of stress from my life that I previously did not recognize. My first two years of college I was working full time and attending school and looking back I really don't miss the time I spent in transit. Before I drove a car, I would leave my home at 5am to hop on a train which would take me to a transit stop to hop on a bus then commute another 30 minutes to campus. Then I'd be in class from 7am back to back until noon. At noon, I'd run across campus to catch another bus to get to do downtown, then I'd hop in an Uber to get to work. I'd be at work from 1pm to 10pm and sometimes till 1am. Then I'd Uber home and do the exact same thing the next day. Being online means I actually get to eat lunch. I actually get to make coffee for someone I love in the morning and I don't have to worry about missing a bus.  My Tuesday schedule is still that I have class from 9am to 10pm but being online does mean that I get to live life a little more and I am grateful for that."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2033,"For me it has always been different for some classes I would like to be in person but for some, I would like to be online because that way I would have a better way of communicating in private.  There are two sides to it: ConsLack of face-to-face interaction during the process of learning. Subjects that require guidance from a mentor could not be learned through online classes. Online classes require increased personal motivation and efforts for learning. Requires a high level of self-discipline and dedication. A network problem is a major hurdle for such classes.2. The advantages of online classes are:They provide the learners with a variety of options that a learner could choose according to their convenience. Online classes are cheaper than traditional courses and can be done in any part of the world. It promotes self-motivation, dedication, and discipline in the learner to achieve the targets of learning. Online classes provide convenience and flexibility to the learners, as learners of all ages, professions, etc can choose their subjects for learning according to their convenience and time.• Online classes are helpful in career advancement. Online classes also provide better job opportunities to their learners. I wouldn't recommend online classes to students because all the students don't have proper access to stable connectivity. We often come across problems like network issues and all. And our teachers are not trained to do this. Training is important for the teacher to keep engaging all the students in the lesson. Online classes demand more work from the Part of the teacher. It needs lots of planning and types of equipment. The teacher needs to excel in technology. For the exhibition, various technical knowledge is required on the part of the teacher."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2867,Transitioning in the in person classes has impacted me a lot because now I have to take the time out of my day to actually be somewhere and do something. sometime with online classes it's a real hit or miss type of situation if I am really felling up to doing class with in person it feels like less of a choice and more of I have to not even a chore which online classes make me feel like. in the end it make me think about what I have to do in the meantime to be prepared for my class mates and also just looking someone what presentable in class instead of just rolling out of the bed and going to class in a haze and just hoping for the best that happens. now although I have been procrastinating and not been taking care of what I need to take care of I know I dont like it and I should make it more of a habit to get my shit togther. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2852,"Transitioning to in person has not really impacted my learning due to my mixed online / in person class schedule. I feel as this allows for a smoother transition to fully in person courses. The In person learning likely pushed me to study or learn more, but the transition from fully online to partial in person over all was fairly neutral. As I didn't follow CDC, state recommenced guidelines much during the COVID crisis, my self care remained the same. I have no concerns that are out of my control towards my well being or my learning. The one odd note about physically going back to school is that it seems as classes are easier, whether it be my personal development or the teachers are simply allowing for a smooth conversion. Transferring for De Anza college could also be a reason. Nevertheless, the transition is appropriate in timing and I applaud the teachers for supporting students throughout. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,1970,"Transitioning into in person for me has been a struggle. At the same time of that transitioning I was dealing with a lot of medical issues, which still impact my day to day life now. I have been trying to do my best with the situation that I'm dealing with, but some days there are things come in the way that make completing work hard for me. What make school right now a struggle is how long its taking my body to recover from an allergic reaction and hnow it hasn't been luch a a linear recovery.This semester I have been focused on trying to create a more balanced lifestyle. The most important thing I try to do is incorporate things I enjoy ddoing my everyday lifestyle. For example I try a take a walk outside and listened to a podcast at the same time. Sometimes I incorporate some time to play my favorite video games(on my nintendo switch), so I'm doing something that can give me joy. i'm just trying my best not to stress myself as much, because when I do that becomes my downfall and leads to me not being able to succeed as a student. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2859,"Transitioning to in person classes has forced me to pay more attention during class with the logic of, ""my parents paid for this might as well pay attention"".  Self-care wise i've been very physically active with sports which helps me take my mind off of things as well as trying new sports out from time to time.  Some concerns that i have for my learning and my well-being are that transitioning from a mainly business coursework to STEM heavy coursework is a lot of time taken up, so i just hope that I'll be able to maintain social/school well."
