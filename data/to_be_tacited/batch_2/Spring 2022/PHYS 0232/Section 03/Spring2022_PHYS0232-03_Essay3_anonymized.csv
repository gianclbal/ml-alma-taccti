2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2861,In class we had learned about Ohms law which is V = I x RV = VoltageI = Current flowing through the conductorR = ResistanceA perfect example where ohms law is used is for electrical heaters where it contains a high-resistance metal coil allows a certain amount of current to pass through. This creates heat. Another example of Ohms law in action is electric kettles and irons which also have lots of resistors for generating heat. I think its very useful to use Ohm's law for a plethora of electrical items that need to generate heat. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2863,What do resistors provide for a system?Resistors are used to limit the current circulating a system. They can be used in a variety of ways through the main use is to create the correct amount of voltage to a circuit so the system isn't overpowered by the energy provider. This can also be helpful in power surges to protect equipment as well as discharging capacitors after the main power source has been removed from the system. We used resistors in lab to show the resistance a resistor can provide in series vs parallels. This is useful to know because in series the resistors amount to a higher resistance than in parallel. By knowing this we can apply this information to future endeavors where we need a higher resistance.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2033,"Voltage:This is what i have leanred so far:Most of us wouldn't think about voltage until we need to power an appliance, a remote, or a child's toy with the correct voltage batteries. The correct voltage, on the other hand, is vital to the entire power system securely delivering the electricity we require. Voltage is a crucial element to understand while managing a power system and discussing how it works. Here are some basic elements to understand how voltage affects power system operation: Electrons carry electrical energy through conducting materials. The voltage of a transmission line measures the amount of potential energy carried by each electron as it travels over the power line. Voltage, to put it another way, is the force that propels current through the electrical supply chain. Electrical current measures how many electrons flow through a particular part of the supply chain in a given amount of time. Voltage combines with current to define how much power flows through the network. We use different voltage levels for different purposes. Generally, it is very high on the biggest power lines coming from large-scale generators or carrying electricity between states, and lower on the lines closer to our homes and businesses. Voltage, like frequency, must be kept within a certain range for the power system to function correctly and safely. Equipment can be destroyed or ""fried"" if the voltage is too high, while equipment can perform badly or stall if the voltage is too low. The voltage is defined as the difference in voltage between two places. It's the force that enables electrons to migrate from one location to another. If there is no voltage, electrons cannot flow between locations in a circuit, implying that there is no current."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2855,"I wanted to cover superconductors, which is a material that achieves superconductivity. In this certain state, there is no electrical resistance and also does not allow the magnetic fields to penetrate it. Superconductors have been talked about a couple of times in the book and we have discussed them multiple times. So an electric current in a superconductor can persist indefinitely. Usually, superconductivity can usually only be achieved in colder temperatures. Some examples of superconductors are aluminum, magnesium, diboride, and niobium. Superconductors are very interesting to me, and a concept that just intrigued me while continuing in the class. Some examples of superconductors in the real world would be the bullet trains in Japan, generators and transformers as well.Superconductors are very vital and it’s use and application in the real world are important as well. The versatility is widespread and the application is needed. One benefit of using a superconductor is it’s low energy losses. It’s an extremely efficient concept because of the lack of electric fields affecting it. Even MRI’s are used by superconductors. You can see that the versatility is endless and it used in many of our important needs even if you do not realize it. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2852,"Going based off of the topics based on weeks 7 & 8 ( Ohms law, batteries, circuits, voltmeters, & resistors in parallel/series), I felt that these topics are can be applied to a wide range of peoples lives in an ordinary fashion. Whether it be working on electric projects ( bathroom lights, heaters ) or even making your own portable charges. Knowing that parallel circuits can have higher power throughput over series circuits, choosing an appropriate circuit will be simpler. Although the general topic may not benefit society greatly, it can increase self reliance in society. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2862,"Capacitance is the amount of energy that can be stored by a capacitor. So, capacitors store this energy from an electric field in a circuit in order to regulate the voltage to the desired state. A good analogy is that capacitors work similar to traffic lights, the capacitor tells the electric energy when it can and cannot go through. A capacitor can be found in many pieces of technology we have today. Along with other components, capacitors help our devices basically exist and do their job. Technology is something that has changed our world and every piece of technology has a capacitor. A good example of this is a camera flash, the charge is stored in the capacitor in the camera circuit and then released very fast which causes a flash. Capacitors and many other components are what make technology possible. The majority of the population uses a cell phone which contains multiple antenna systems. A capacitor helps with frequency tuning and filtering in those antenna systems whether it is for cellular data, Bluetooth, GPS, or WiFi. Obviously, depending on the size of the object, a bigger or smaller capacitor is needed. Also, knowing how strong the electric field and voltage are, affects how the dimensions and material of the capacitor."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2860,"How much power is the light in my room currently drawing and how much does it cost per hour leaving it on? Power was a recently discussed concept last week and very applicable to people's lives due to our reliance on electronics and appliances. From the lectures, we found that the formula for power is P = IV, which can be substituted into various forms such as P = (I^2)(R). Thus, given the current and either the resistance or voltage of something, we can find out how much power it needs. However, most appliances nowadays directly state their wattage, with my light bulb consuming 60W. Given the wattage of 60W, 60W * 1hr = 60 W*hr or 0.06 kW * hr. With my electricity rate of 25 cents per kW * hr, it costs: (0.06 * 0.25) = 0.015, 1.5 cents per hour for leaving my light bulb on.Information regarding power can be used to benefit society, as understanding how power works can lead to energy efficient advancements. In the text, the inner makings of an incandescent lamp is discussed. Constructed of a tungsten filament, with a glass envelope, the lamp is lit via heating the filament. However, only a minor amount of this energy produces visible light, with the rest of the energy being lost as heat. Eventually much more efficient light bulbs would start to be widely used, such as LED light bulbs. With the unit, lumens per watt (Lm/W) measuring the energy efficiency of a light, LED bulbs generally have 200 Lm/W compared with an incandescent lamp's 16/W. A LED light bulb produces almost 90% more light per watt compared with an incandescent lamp which is an incredible advancement."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2864,"What are resistors used for?   A resistor is an object that lowers voltage within a circuit. The relationship between voltage and resistance is linear and inversely proportional. In other words, as resistance increases voltage lowers and vice versa. Every object has some level of resistance in a circuit, but some materials do this job effectively and are referred to as “resistors”. Resistors play an integral role in regulating the voltage of a circuit and are key to protecting electronics. There are occasionally voltage spikes in the electric grid that supplies electricity to your homes and other such buildings. Everything plugged into an outlet will have to have some method of dealing with these spikes. Electronics are designed to function at specific voltage levels and anything higher will damage them. This is why they have resistors to drop the voltage during voltage spikes in the grid. However, resistance is also affected by heat.  Electronics need to be kept at room temperature for them to be effective because high temperatures will lower resistance."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2868,"Electric current is all around us. All of the technology we use involves electric current: the flow of charged particles moving in a circuit. Learning about electric current and the behavior of charged particles is very important because mostly everyone in the world has access to electronics and this principle of Electric current applies to everything. People who have jobs that are required to know about electronics, they would have to study how the piece of technology functions and why it functions. Knowing electric current and circuits would be of great help to understanding the piece of equipment. For example, people who work as a hardware computer engineer. Those people have to research, design, develop, and test computer systems and components on circuit boards. Studying electric current, electric charges, electric potential, etc..., can help with designing of computer systems and the components of a computer. Knowing more about electric current and other things related to it, can benefit our society's type of technology. It can propel us into a new era of technology if we better understand how to use it. It can also advance our medical field technology."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2856,"We have covered a lot about circuits and electricity. This would be very useful for future careers like electrical engineering or computer sciences. I think using real tools for this lab is the best thing that we can do as students. It's really good when we get the experience with real life applications. My question is that can this be useful for non-engineering majors? It can be. We can apply it if we need to fix our own personal devices whenever they're broken. If not, electrical engineers can help out. They can benefit to cities by using ohm's law and create power across many places. Without electrical engineers, we won't have any power in any of our houses. It takes a lot of mathematics and detail to make something big. We all need to know the basic things about electricity, otherwise it's useless. to us. It would be best to know many things and be prepared for anything. That's the purpose of school across the state. Knowing science is the most important thing to learn because it tells us how thing work in this world. We won't be able to evolve technology in the future and everything would be obsolete."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2859,"The question that I formulated in class was ""is it possible for there to be an object inside a circuit that acts as both a resistor and a capacitor"".  Looking through my notes, there wasn't anything that particularly hinted towards that answer, but my professor answered during lecture that wires are seen as a capacitor and resistor since wires themselves have a natural form of resistance based on what material they are made of.  I found this applicable to people's lives because this is the reasoning behind why most wires are made of copper.  Silver was also an option, but the cost benefit of conductivity/resistivity compared to copper was way too high for applicable use."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2865,"In line with the discussion we were having in class this morning, I would always used to wonder ""why does the electricity in my kitchen go out when I run the microwave, dishwasher and coffee machine at the same time?"" A lot of the electricity in my home is DIY and I would actually  assume that going to reset the main circuit breaker box was just something my family did often because of how our electricity wiring was done. After our discussion this morning, I think I'm starting to understand why it happens in more detail and might actually be able to fox the issue. The issue is this: If I turn on the  coffee machine while the dishwasher or microwave are running everything connected to an outlet in the kitchen suddenly looses power. As a precaution, what we do is actually plug out the coffee machine and microwave whenever the dishwasher is on to avoid someone accidentally stepping into the turning the microwave on resulting in a short circuit. To fix this, I think our best bet would be to have the microwave run on a separate circuit than the other kitchen appliances such that turning it on would not overburden the breaker with too many amps."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2853,"When designing circuits, there are many factors to consider, being efficiency and utilization. Compared to the earliest computers, the circuits found in our tv, our phones, and our gaming consoles circuits have become much more complicated, and in order to advance our technology, we must also learn to improve our circuits to perform more while also becoming more efficient. with possible applications in nanotechnology and vitural reality."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2854,"We learned about current and resistance last week. I learned that resistance can block the current and can generate heat. Resistance is a double-sided sword in our life because sometimes we want to lower the resistance so the circuit produces higher power. On the other hand, sometimes we want to generate heat, but fire is too dangerous. We can raise the resistance in a circuit to generate heat. Unlike fire, we can control how much heat has been released from the resistances based on its resistivity. An example that lowers the resistance that can help society is SCMaglev. Material can be 0 resistances in certain temperatures. The circuit can have a high amount of current to produce a strong magnetic field. An example that people need to raise the resistance is an electric heater. I also learned about the current will increase if the number of resistance increases in a parallel circuit. That explains when too many electric devices are on, the electrical system will blow fuse. Before that class, I think I hook up too many devices, so there isn’t enough power for that. The fact is the opposite, there is too much “power”."
