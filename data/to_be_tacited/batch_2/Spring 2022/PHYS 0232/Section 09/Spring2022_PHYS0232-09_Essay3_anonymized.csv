2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2955,"The most memorable topic for me was electromagnetic force. The electro magnetic field and it's interaction with another electromagnetic field. For example, what if there was a ball hanging by a string with neutral charge, and a negatively charged rod was moved near to it, what would happen? Firstly, it is important to start by noting that a neutrally charged object has an even distribution of negative and positive charges. What happens now is that the negative charges in the ball move away from the rod, but the positive charges move towards the rod. Because the negative and positive charges are closest together the ball will move towards the rod. The ball and the rod will touch, which then causes some negative charges from the rod to flow into the ball causing the ball to now be negatively charged. Since the ball is negatively charge, it is repulsed from the rod."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2941,"My question is how can we use the knowledge of a circuit in our lives? My answer to this question is that knowledge of circuits not only helps with understanding everyday electrical items that we use, but can also help when diagnosing and repairing circuits throughout a house, car, and even personal items. An example would be when fixing lights on a car. Having the understanding of a circuit can lead us to discovering if there is a short circuit, if there isn’t a complete circuit, and even if there is no current flowing throughout a circuit. On my personal car, I have used this method to diagnose a short circuit in my tail light. I was able to ground the light which caused the light to start working. Having an understanding of circuitry is a key skill to have when understanding how electronics work."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2930,"One concept I really enjoyed learning about in this class is circuits. I have always wanted to learn more about electric circuits and how physics plays a role in the process. When I was little, I used to go with my dad to his watch repair shop and throughout my time there, I learned how to change the battery of a mechanical watch. I must say, it's a very intricate and complex process at times since you are dealing with very minuscule parts. At the time, I didn't much pay attention to the physics behind the circuit that connects the battery to the watch and gives it power. However, after learning more about circuits, I began to connect the dots and see how the physical process connects to physics. I believe the concept of electrical circuits has revolutionized our species and created very useful and arguably the most important technology for human evolution. From computers to all other electrical innovations that require circuits to operate, learning about circuits is essential to understanding most of modern technology."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2934,"One concept I'd like to talk about is simple circuits and short circuits. This was one of the labs I had the best understanding of and I think I could explain circuits the best out of everything we've learned so far. One question I have is how can we relate circuits to our daily lives? Circuits are used in our every day life as we use and interact with technology. Our homes rely on circuits for electricity and lights, and even our computers are phones involve circuits. The majority of people use smartphones which have touchscreens that use circuits to function. We encounter circuits in our lives when we don't really think about where circuits are being used. Homes and buildings use electricity everyday and lights use circuits in order to function. Without circuits, light bulbs without be able to turn on and provide us with light. Circuits are not something that everyone thinks about as they go about their day, but it is important as circuits are used in the technology we use. I think it would be nice to have a better understanding on how circuits work and how they help technology function."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2937,"In our daily life, should we use a series circuit or parallel circuit to connect the electric devices?The current will be the same in a series circuit. In the parallel circuit, the voltage will be the same. The series circuit might not have enough current if we connect too many devices. If we use the parallel circuit to connect the devices, we don't need to worry about the current. I think the parallel circuit will be better in daily life. If we connect too many devices and the main current becomes too large to burn the power, we can add a fuse to protect the circuit. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2936,It was helpful for me to see the short circuit exercise since in real life i am exposed to electronics constantly. It is helpful to know what could happen if a circuit is shorted
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2951,"One concept that I enjoyed learning about within these past weeks was charge. It was fairly interesting to learn about and not hard to understand which is why I enjoyed it. One question I would have about charge is that who came up with the concept of charge? who knew that opposite charges attracted one another and likes repel. Is this concept applied to many things in life? I honestly don't know who came up with the concept of charge and how opposites attract. But I do hear a lot that in life opposite people attract one another when it comes to love interest. Iven actually been in a relationship with someone who is the complete opposite of me and honestly I don't know if I liked it as much as I should have. I found it more frustrating than enjoying it but I am still fairly close to this person so I guess it stays true. Anyways, the idea of charge can be applied to many different things within peoples lives. There's a lot of jobs within society that use this concept to help further benefit mankind. From how our cars operate, to making our computers run, to how our everyday technology works, charge is extremely important and without it we would still be in the stone ages."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2946,"What is flux?I am still having questions about flux right now and thinking how it will help me in the future and be a benefit to the society. In one word, flux is passage. It is a passage of an element, electron or whatever, through a surface and that is flux. This will greatly help me when I am working as a computer engineer in the future. I will have to carefully choose materials for circuits or will have to create one. Then, I will have to calculate the flux for each and every part of the element I will be using. During lab section working with different types of materials, flux would always be useful for me. However, I still am not one hundred percent sure about how the flux is working .So I would have to study harder to become a researcher. Someday, I hope to work at a research lab creating something that will be a great help to mankind."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2932,"In a world  were technology is ever expanding and growing we has a human race are becoming more dependent on technology. It has made life more convenient and because of that we have become more reliant to it in our daily life. Many of us we technology not even knowing how it works, just as long as it does work. So I always wondered how does logic board, circuit board, even how does a light bulb turn on? How does this all work? I knew it had to do with electricity but that was as far as my knowledge use to go. After taking this lab and taking my physics class I have learned that electrons and protons have to do with how technology power and stay on. The electrons travels through the whole circuit board turning a logic board, circuit board, and even a light bulb on. Electrons goes through the whole entire circuit board were creates a current which is when the device turns on. This happens because the electron wants to find balance, by that I mean wants to find a proton to find its balance. So when electron is finding the shortest path to find a proton the electron is turning on the device we use in a daily basis."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2952,"The concept of batteries is an important topic we just learned recently. Batteries are used to charge many things like a calculator, remote, etc. There are currents that flow through the battery to make it work. We also learned that batteries can be recharged. This is possible by drawing a current through that is in the opposite direction of the original current in the battery. Since the current supplied will be in the opposite direction of the current we are putting in, the battery can be recharged. The voltages we put in must be greater than the current inside of the battery already, so that it can reverse the current. This makes sense if we were to look at the given equation, (terminal voltage) equals emf (the electromotive force) - Ir (electric current times the internal resistance). I, the electric current would've been negative then we need voltage to be greater than that. This is good to learn in class because recharging batteries is used in our everyday lives. For example, we recharge batteries when we need to jump start our cars whenever the battery dies. Another example could be when people recharge batteries that we put inside of our calculators or remotes. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2944,A concept that we covered in the last few weeks would be the capacitors. I like that we use these capacitors in our devices and we leaned about them in our labs so we know how to use them if we ever wanted to make our own for example a circuit board. This information benefits society because we are in a world of technology and in our world we need the electricity to run through our devices and we expect them not to short circuit and break everything. so I believe that if we teach everyone this basic information repairing our own devices or making our own devices could be a more common thing and we could connect society through technology more then it is currently because that is how connections should be formed making it easier. Thank you for reading this.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2929,"How do circuits in series work? Well this is a question I had while we were in class and we talked about circuits. After the lecture, the lab, and many homework problems I realized that circuits in series can be defined as having only one path through which current can flow. We made an experiment during our lab class that proved the big differences between a parallel circuit and a circuit in series. We were able to notice that with a circuit in series we were able to get the most amount of voltage out of the battery while with a parallel circuit you can get more current. This can definitely apply to people's lives in an everyday scenario, all the way  from how your car lights work and house lights work. This was a very interesting topic for me because I was fascinated of how these two differ and how they are very different from each other. I have been able to get better at finding the differences and also at explaining the differences. I have sen multiple real life examples with my cousin since he is an electrician. I have seen how these two differ and how they work."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2947,"Concept: Simple Circuits.Question: Will I be using this on a day to day basis?The answer is going to be yes, for myself, but not so much for everyone else, but I think it should be something that most people are taught and I will explain why.The world shifted recently (the last 100 years) to one of electronics and more so today, it is almost essential to have a knowledge of the basics in order to get by in todays world and I think it is something that  should be taught as a basic skill just like economics or history.  It isn't just a trade anymore but a major part of our lives, so much so that it is necessary to know about it or have the money to pay for it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2935,"Electricity has had a tremendous impact on human social life. With electricity came the Internet and computers, and the speed at which information could travel was greatly reduced. We have more channels to learn about our society, and a piece of news can easily spread around the world in a short time. Like the Tonga eruption. Secondly, electrical appliances improve the quality of our life. They are used in medicine, education, aerospace, resource extraction, and almost every aspect related to modern life. In the old days when there was no electricity, large numbers of people had to work in agriculture and livestock to feed themselves. 20% of newborns do not survive, and the average life expectancy is fewer than 40 years because of the lack of modern medical care. Most of them have a geographical range of fewer than 200 km and are almost confined to their own country. When we have electricity, we have dishwashers after eating, washers and dryers for washing clothes, and robots for cleaning. Everywhere in our life, we can see the improvement of the quality of life of electric appliances. When we get used to living like this, life without electricity becomes especially difficult. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2943,"Among the topics we have covered in class, the topic about charge was the most interesting one for me. While exploring that topic in class the main question that popped up in my mind was: Why do most objects have nearly equal numbers of positive and negative charges? Most objects have nearly equal numbers of positive and negative charges because the phenomenon of static electricity necessitates the separation of positive and negative charges When two materials come into contact, electrons can move from one to the other, leaving an excess of positive charge on one and an equal negative charge on the other. The imbalance of negative and positive charges in an object causes static electricity. These charges can accumulate on an object's surface until they are released or discharged."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2949,"The first lab we did was about charges, in it I learned more about Protons, Electrons, and Neutrons. Protons are positively, electrons are negatively charged, and neutrons have no charge. Opposites attract and like charges repel, the one thing I really didn't know is that neutrons while they have no charge can actually attract, from what I remember only when the positive/negative charge is really close by. Such as the example where we charged a piece of tape and the pen, they stuck together only when close to each other."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2940,"A concept that I want to select from class that was covered in the last few weeks is the electric field. What I want to know is what is an easy way to explain what the electric field is or represents to anyone, whether they are in the world of physics or not. An electric field is a space around a charged particle where the particle exerts electric force on other charged particles. Because of their force fields, charged particles can exert force on each other without actually touching. Electric fields are generally represented by arrows. The arrows show the direction of electric force around a positive particle and a negative particle. The information regarding electric field lines is important because it relates to lots of also very important things in the real world like wound healing, corneal repair and even brain and spinal stimulation which is due to the flow from positive to negative charges. This topic has really helped me have an understanding not just in class but translate it into something relevant I can lean on in regards to society, my community and my everyday life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2956,"The understanding of charge can be a benefit for people's lives and for society. Based on the lab we understand because of the demo of he negative and positive charges can be transferred or affect the charges of another object. Examples that can be beneficial in our everyday life with the knowledge of charges is knowing that certain materials will affect another's charges. For medical purposes, electrical cardioversion need to have enough charge pumped in order to transfer that charge. Another example is when you are crating friction with your hands, it will become warm and when you touch something after then the charge will then transfer that heat over. These are just basic understandings of how charges work, I am sure there are more uses for it. Doing the lab just created a general knowledge for myself of how charges are created and they are transferred over from object to object and how the transfer can affect the amount of charges."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2928,"One topic that we have previously learned about is charges. We learned how charges can attract one another. In the simulations we used we can see that when the balloon is rubbed on the sweater, it gets some of the negative charges from the sweater which makes it attract more to the sweater when it's placed at a distance due to the sweater having a lot of positive charges and the balloon which has the negative charges. This is applicable to our daily lives since we do see it happen a lot such as how when we are in the kitchen and maybe use some plastic such as the plastic wrap or ziploc. When we get the wrap out it starts to somewhat cling to our arms due to the charges."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2953,"How do circuits allow electricity to power on devices.As I understand electrical current is a flow of electrons. This flow needs to be directed towards what you want, this is where circuits come in. A circuit is made by electrical conductors that create an easy path for the electrical current to travel.  Most of the time the circuit conductor is made of gold. Any devices on the circuit will be reacting with the current. Circuits are part of every day life. The computer that I'm am using to write this reflection is just a metal box full of circuits allowing electricity to create everything I am seeing and typing. All the recent advancements have been thanks to circuits and electricity. We would still be in a metal age if we never discovered electricity. citizens would not be able to learn remotely you probably wouldn't be able to call anyone or see anyone on the phone. humans take circuits and electricity for granted. life would be a lot different without it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2933,"The simple circuit lab and topic was probably the most interesting for me because it showed me a lot of topics that can be used when it comes to relation to real life scenarios like car batteries and things like that. So how can this topic be used in real life situations?What really peaked my interest was the fact that if you have a circuit that does not have resistance then there is a huge possibility that your battery will catch on fire which I found explains a lot of the mishaps and errors we see in everyday life. For instance I once plugged in a VCR as a kid into the power plug and the VCR got fried. I later realized that it happened because I didn't use an adapter that provides enough resistance so that the power doesn't overload the circuit and fry the VCR's power source, so that traumatic event that scarred me as a kid believe it or not got explained 12 years later in this course. That is one of many possible ways that it can explain real life events, I also found it intriguing that if there is a way for the electricity to travel and complete its path through the circuit faster and avoid the resistance then it will naturally always take that path and that was very eye opening for me, so if you install a wire to your circuit that allows the electricity flow to flow from one end of the battery to the other whilst avoiding resistance then it will always take that path."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2939,"In class and in the past few weeks, we have learned a lot more about circuits and different types of circuits. We have also learned about current and how to calculate the current in different types of circuits. The different types of circuits are parallel and series circuits. Based on this, how would you be able to tell the difference between a series circuit and a parallel circuit? A series circuit is a circuit where all components are connected across each other and they will form a single path for the electrons to flow in a straight path. On the other hand, in a parallel circuit, all components will be connected across from each other and they will form separate connected points. In a parallel circuit, in order to calculate the current, you will have to take the sum of the individual points that are forming the electrical paths. On the other hand, in a series circuit, in order to calculate the current, you will have to use Ohms law which is the voltage is equal to the current divided by the total resistance in the circuit. You can easily solve for the current using this formula. This information is used in everyday life since we are surrounded by many machines in today's world and almost all machines will use circuits."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2954,"One of the main concepts I've learned so far is electric currents, electric forces, and electric fields. These are all really cool and interesting things I've enjoyed learning so far and it's amazing to know how much we've grown as a society. Since we rely on electricity, light, and currents everyday to make sure our appliances are working, this concept is important for our day-to-day lives. I cannot imagine a life without electric currents since I utilize them every second of the day. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2938,"Over the past several labs as well as in the lectures for this course, we have discussed a variety of topics pertaining to electricity and the physics of how it works. I think the information that has been presented to us is very relevant to the every day lives of most individuals, but they may not be totally aware of this being  the case. People need to use electronics nearly every day, especially during this time. Now that everything has transitioned to being online for many of us, we rely on our electronics to help us with every day tasks.I think that knowing how electricity works in our electronics and how they're powered by it can impact how we value technology as a whole. Of all the things that we covered, I think that current is one of the more useful topics for people to know about. I also think charge is useful for people to know about. The reason I consider these useful is that they serve a practical purpose rather than just theoretical knowledge. Anything hands-on that requires us to use electronics in some meaningful way (smartphones, to power our devices, in our homes for electricity, etc.) is definitely something most people should at least be aware of.For example: it might be useful for someone to know that when shoes are rubbed on a carpet, the body collects the extra electrons. These electrons cling to the body, and are released once they touch something. If people don't understand this, they won't know what exactly they're doing, how its being done, or why they get a literal shock from static discharge."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2931,"How does charge apply to our everyday lives as students and people living in the 21st century? Well, a ton! As students and humans living in the 21st century, the charge is applied to almost all types of technology. We can think about our laptops, iPads, and iPhones as examples. Due to the pandemic brought upon us by Coivid-19, we were forced to move to a virtual way of learning, which included us having to use these devices to be able to tune in. These devices need to be applied a charge and can even hold a charge due to their battery packs. It was and still is crucial to make sure our devices are charged so that they are ready for the following day or use. When we charge the device, we are adding electrons to the battery to be stored. Alternately, when we use the device, we are using the stored electrons that are keeping the device alive. Some devices such as TVs don't have a battery pack and therefore can not hold a charge. They must be plugged into a source or charge such as an outlet. As a result, when the TV is turned on, it is connected to a constant flow of electrons that keep it powered on. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2942,"We have learned so far a lot of topics throughout the semester even though it is on week 7. I want to say I want to focus more on topics that we have learned recently, that is circuits and electric current. When I was young, I played around with a simple circuit in science class, and at that time, it was very interesting when I connected the circuit and the light bulb was on. I think I was just focusing on the fact that the light bulb was on, and it was actually so bright!. However, when I took classes in the last two weeks, I have learned the concepts about how the circuit works, and how the current depends on what is attached to the battery. What I thought as soon as I took the classes was something that the examples in my everyday life that is related to these topics are almost everything and everywhere. In other words, people can easily find examples of the topics. This is because we use electric devices every time at home, and all home appliances need electricity. I also have some experiences related to the topics. When I use a hair dryer, sometimes my cousin or my uncle uses another hairdryer at the same time, and when that happens, most of the time the power goes out. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,191,"Ryan RiveraOne topic I want to cover really quickly is the resistance in wires. My question is, how does the resistance of a current affect the current strength, and how does this affect your circuit?Basically, resistance depends on the piece of metal that the electricity is traveling to. In our experiment, we used aluminum foil slivers. We discovered that when the slivers of foil are very thin, the resistance is lower which actually makes the current stronger. If the foil is thin enough, it can combust due to the low resistance and high power. When we use a bigger sliver of foil, the resistance is stronger which means the foil will not react as heavily to the current. Instead of combusting and ruining the current, we can actually stabilize and create a current of electricity that goes all the way around and creates a circuit. So resistance matters when you have an objective in mind: Do you want to create a stable current or create a current that produces as much electricity in one spot as possible? Well, if you have to pay attention to the resistance and how it affects your current."
