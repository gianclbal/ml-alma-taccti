2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2935,"As an international student, I spent most of my college years in online courses. My high school imagination about college clubs and parties went up in smoke. Especially when I was in my country, I had to stay up late for classes almost every day. I often feel so sleepy and tired that I can't keep my eyes open, which greatly reduces my enthusiasm for studying. Because of this, IT was difficult for me to participate in group discussions. Because most of them have a 16-hour time difference from me, group work is very difficult for me. And since everyone just went to zoom for classes, it became difficult to make new friends. I feel that the only advantage of online courses is that there is no need to shuttle between buildings, and I can even get up 5 minutes before class. In addition, excessive screen time has an impact on my cervical spine and eyesight."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2947,"Online learning was not something that I thought would be of a big helps to me until I got out of the military.  I thought that I was going to really enjoy working in person for a lot of the subjects, but what I found out was that I much prefer learning online.  The structure and the pace is much more doable with my ability to process information and I think that the ability to have it all done in the comfort of my home lends a helping hand to the learning by allowing me to be less stressed.If I had to choose, I would have to say that online as an option would be the best for me, maybe with one or two classes in person. It would break up the monotony but I would also be able to get the work done more efficiently. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2949,"I think taking online classes have changed the way I feel about classes. On a positive note I can choose to take some classes either asynchronous which allows for me to do the assignments and lessons on my own time which is nice or synchronous which gives me the whole lesson in the comfort of my home but I have the chance to still interact with the professor and other students. It has negatively affected me though, I have a computer in front of me so I do have to restrain myself from slacking off when working online, I might be watching the video for the lesson and then get the urge to go to the kitchen and eat a cookie or something. Being over 30 minutes away from campus and with gas prices still rising I still do think that online classes are beneficial to my time and wallet."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2931,"If anything, I would say that online classes have impacted my learning for the best. The reason is that the time that it takes to travel to school and back has been significantly reduced. I am allowed to sign onto class from the comfort of my apartment and do what I have to do without distracting other students. I have bad back issues so when I am in in-person classes, I need to stand up and stretch out, and being at home allows me to do this without being a distraction to my classmates. On top of that, the chairs in classes are not comfortable at all, especially for someone with back issues like myself, so being able to sit in my comfy ergonomic chair is a really nice perk of online classes. I still enjoy going to a class or two throughout the week because that allows me to get outside and gets me walking around. In the future, I will be trying to take as many classes online as I can while still having 1 or 2 classes on campus for 1 or 2 days a week or just as balanced as possible."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2954,"Online classes have impacted my learning greatly. Although I enjoy the convenience of learning from home, I feel like I’ve been focussing ‘less’ this entire year, and admitting makes me very hard on my studies. I feel as though physical classes are more ‘intimate’, in a sense where my phone isn’t on my desk, my attention is on the professor, and I have to put my entire effort into listening and learning. But for online classes, everything is a disruption. I can fidget on my phone with my camera off, I can open Zoom but have a different tab up, I can get up and make lunch rather than listen to the lecture, and that limits my learning experience a lot. Although, the plus is that because every Zoom lecture is recorded, I can also review the material, versus in person classes where if you don’t show up, there’s no way to review the material. As for my well-being, I do admit that online courses have helped me greatly. I don’t need to wake up earlier to get ready or commute to school. I do not need to worry about being ‘late’, because I can wake up 5 minutes before class and simply turn on my laptop. That sense of convenience is one of the most positive things that online learning has provided. It is virtually impossible (pun intended) for any student to miss class."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,191,"At first, I thought online classes were a complete detriment to my learning, and they definitely were. But, I wasn't really used to them yet back when covid first started. Now, however, I am well adjusted to self-learning and really prefer online classes due to the convenience. I also find that it doesn't inhibit my learning as much as I thought, I just have to dive in to the subject myself a little bit and do some preparation before classes. Now, however, I am dealing with one in person class and that is now my weakness. So for this class, I am enjoying it all so far and feel like it is one of my strongest classes. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2945,"taking classes has been more difficult with everything being online. it is harder to understand the information without seeing it happen in person from someone else. for a while up until this semester a lot of the facilities and places to get help have been closed for a long time. I am worried that I have missed something important and will have to learn something over aging. I'm also worried that I might not correctly understand the material that I am reading because I don't have anyone to show me. I am very much a physical learner where I have to write things down. with everything being typed it is a little more difficult to retain the information being presented to me. I have been still practicing social distancing and isolation of self. to take care of my mental health I make sure to go outside multiple times to get some fresh air and sunlight. I also write down how I feel for the day in a journal if I am feeling bad, for any reasons "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2939,"Distance learning has definitely significantly impacted my learning throughout all of COVID. This is because it is significantly easier to focus when I'm in an actual classroom and I see other people studying. It motivates me to work and study as well and become more productive in general. When I'm at home studying alone, there are a lot more distractions especially if I'm on the computer everyday. I have a hard time focusing when random social media articles pop up or there's some new news. Additionally, I feel like I learn a lot more in a classroom because I can discuss my ideas with other students. In a online learning, I notice a lot of people tend to become really quiet and do not bother discussing or even sharing their ideas. They simple want to finish their school work so they can do whatever they want. In order to cope with this, I try to find friends who are my age and are in similar majors. I end up doing practice problems with them and have discussions with them instead."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2934,"Since the pandemic hit and classes turned online, I definitely found pros and cons to learning online. It was definitely very convenient to have all my classes online and I did not have to commute. I would be able to switch from class to class all from my home. However, I found myself struggling to focus more online. I would get too easily distracted since I wasn't in a school or classroom environment. This semester is where I'm struggling the most. I've been holding up pretty well for the past couple semesters that have been online, but I've definitely lost some motivation as the pandemic continued. It's hard to focus and I am not always guaranteed a quiet place to study at home. My time management has not been the best and it's hard trying to stay on top of my due dates. Since this semester is more of a hybrid schedule with classes, I have to go on campus on some days. I don't really have an issue with that, but I want to stay as safe as possible while the pandemic is still going on. Someone in my class recently tested positive for covid and I'm a bit worried going back to class. Commuting to school and back home is also a bit difficult and I would rather my classes all be online to make sure everyone stays safe. In terms of self-care, I have tried to dedicate time for myself. I try my best to get as much rest as I can and, if possible, spend some time on my hobbies. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2944,"Online classes honestly made it a little more difficult to learn in the beginning of the pandemic due to several reasons. One of those reasons would be how transition from learning in person for my entire life to suddenly switching to an online format made it difficult to readjust myself. Especially in ways of lecture because when I am at home there are so many distractions that allow me to look away and not focus on the lecture while in person, I must pay attention to my professor. Another reason would be not knowing what to do with myself after classes because in person I would be able to chat with my fellow students but when its online we all leave the Zoom call and we would not speak again unless it was a group project. I'm concerned for online learning because we have fewer social interactions and less of a community feeling and does not have a classroom like learning environment."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2940,"Personally, I have really grown to love online classes. Although, I will admit that in the beginning, the switch was extremely painful for me. Now that I have gotten a groove with it I have really discovered all the perks that come with it. For example, I spend significantly less time wasted just sitting in traffic. I literally have more hours in the day to do things like self care. I am able to have a better balance of working out physically and doing homework. One aspect of it that is hard is that I do not have a private dedicated workspace at home. So if I need silence to really listen to a lecture or do a quiz, I don't always get it which can make learning hard. On the other hand I have invested in some really good headphones and found lots of places close to where I live, like the library or a coffee shop where I can go to study in peace. That has helped me branch out and explore the resources of where I live more. I personally will continue to enjoy online learning for the rest of my degree and I hope others are able to do the same."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2955,"Online classes have made school much easier for me because I have a life outside of school and it really gets in the way of my life having to commute to San Francisco 3 times a week. I am liking in person classes though because it is much easier to pay attention and its cool to meet my classmates. I heard there is a new variant of covid that could cause another lockdown, so I am not very excited for that to be honest. I am pretty tired of wearing a mask everywhere I go."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2951,"If I were to be completely honest I feel like online learning has impacted me both negatively and positively. Negatively in a sense that I don't really have the super gritty work ethic that I had years ago in community college. I used to spend hours upon hours studying. Going to cafes or coffee shops and drill these concepts into my brain until I understood it fully. Now, it seems like I do half of that because everything I need is fairly easy to access. Another negative is that I feel like I got so used to online classes that in person classes feel weird now and its a lot harder to pay attention to. Things don't make sense as much and I don't know if its the topic at hand or the professor but its extremely difficult and trying to solve these problems seem impossible. On a positive note I feel like there were some classes where I probably couldn't pass if it was in person. Having the internet on stand by is extremely helpful to help me understand. Resources like Youtube give you a better perspective from the professors and it could be way easier to understand"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2936,"I believe that online classes level the playing field for me. Without worrying about the cost of commuting from Sacramento, gas prices, time in traffic and other logistics i feel that i am able to focus on solely my work in school. I do, however, acknowledge this comes from a privelaged perspective as other students might not have the same access to a stable internet connection or quiet home environment"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2932,"I think that online classes has benefited me in a positive way. The commute would normally take one hour to one hour and a half if I had to drive to San Francisco State University, which would be very exhausting. That one hour that I would be stuck in traffic trying to get to school, and coming back from school would be a total of two hours to three hours of my day. Those two to three hours I could use to study for my classes instead of being stuck in traffic. So online not only allowed me to have more time to study, but I don’t have to stay in traffic so that is definitely an improvement in quality to life. I really think being able to stay at home for class has made it more flexible for me to study longer, and as well stay more focused in class because I am not so exhausted from being stuck in traffic."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2953,I work online for most of my day. During work i have time set aside to participate in my online classes. Online classes have been mostly a blessing. i am able to keep my current job and attend classes without having a impact to my schedule. Although i am grateful to my job for allowing me to focus on my classes. it also feels like i am on the computer most of the day. It can be very boring and bad for my health especially if i don't get up and walk to exercise. i would love to have a combination of online classes and physical classes. but i would still prefer online since it gives me more freedom. i do feel sometime as if i am learning less especially when the instructor has trouble teaching online. most of the time the classes seem messy and not arranged.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2943,"Online classes have definitely impacted both positively and negatively on my learning. I was able to have more time to focus on myself as commute was avoided. I was also able to manage my time well, in a sense I had more time to study and review lecture notes. Something I did not like about online learning was the teacher to student interaction. With classes being held via zoom, students became more lazy to participate in discussions and engaging in activities also reduced. I believe time-wise online learning has provided a lot of pros, however engagement-wise there are a lot of cons."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2933,"I guess my only concern when it  comes to taking online classes is the question of whether or not I'm  really learning anything. I feel as though I am, and especially  considering my major is in Computer Science so taking inline classes  doesn't really affect me, but for some reason I keep feeling like I'm  not getting what I need exactly from my class. It feels like it's just  hard to focus all the time. I  also have another concern which might sound a bit weird, but let's say  I'm a fresh out of college student looking for a job and an employer is  looking at my history in college and sees that I went to University  during the years of covid and I just feel like deep down these employer  will prefer college students who didn't go through online classes, but I  might be totally wrong here. Other  than that I have to admit that the freedom we get with these online  classes is unmatched at this point. I feel like it can be stress free  almost if you know how to manage your time"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2938,"I think that online learning has made it more difficult to focus, but makes it easier to refer back to things I may have missed. Since we have access to recordings most of the time, we're able to check if we missed any details during class. There are pros and cons to online learning, but I think it's been working for me for the most part.As for self-care, I have been practicing self-care more than any other point in my life. I've noticed that as I've gone through college, I've had to learn to better pace myself  in order to get all of my work done in a timely fashion--especially being in the software development field. Not everything gets done as soon as we hope, so its best to not rush oneself. You need to practice self-care first and foremost before you can get assignments, etc., done in the first place. If you're burning yourself out, it's not sustainable in the long-term."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2928,"Online classes have impacted my learning because I now have an easier schedule to deal with rather than commuting to school everyday I just have to commute every other day. Also online learning doesn't stop me from studying as much as I don't have trouble asking my questions and getting them answered. The work load still feels the same and the teachers are still helpful. The only thing that online learning is bad for me is how it puts strain on my eyes if I look at the screen for too long, so after a class I usually just try to close my eyes or take a 20 minute nap before getting back to work. My self care still is good even with online learning."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2946,"The online classes have impacted me, a lot, in being that I am able to study at home and not waste time on the road. However, I believe labs should still be held on-campus and everyone will return to campus one day. I am currently living with my 2 year old niece and I have time to actually play with her and interact with her since I am home. When my brother needs me to baby sit for a while, I am more than willingly to baby sit for him. I am tired, sometimes from all the school work I have to do. But whenever I have play time with her, I charge myself, though she is a handful, and can do more things in the long term due to stress relief. I also try to take naps, in between classes, to maintain the best condition to attend to online ""class (zoom) room."" Due to Covid-19, I was able to see my niece grow up every single day and I am very happy of it. Though, I am worried that once fully on campus starts, I might be jeopardizing her health. I hope that Covid really really truly goes away."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2942,"When the pandemic started in the US, I was really worried about school life in the US because all the courses were moved to online classes, and I had never done so many online classes before. Also, I was worried that if I have a question, how can I explain the problems to classmates and professors. Sometimes, since my English is not that good, I had to explain some problems by holding a textbook and pointing to the question with short English when I used to take in-person classes. However, as time goes, I think I am kind of used to these online classes, and now I am pretty much confident in online classes. If I have a question, I can just share my screens and have no problems. But this does not mean I do not like in-person classes. I am taking a Math class at school, I actually pretty much like it. Just something that I am worried about is that there is a possibility that I can get a COVID-19 at school even if the possibility is really low. Other than that, I am good with everything at the moment. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2952,Online classes impacted my learning negatively. I have a harder time retaining information and it's hard for me to focus because there is a lot of distractions at home. I'm concerned that I'm not actually absorbing the material and that I will struggle in my next classes. For example I am worried I'm not fully prepared for the next physics class after this. But I'd rather have online classes than in-person classes right now because of the pandemic. I try to take breaks every now and then so that I'm not staring at a computer all day. I also try to call friends or see a few friends on the weekends. But I usually can't go out due to covid and all the homework I need to do. I also try to remind myself to eat during my breaks because I usually forget to eat while I'm doing online classes. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2930,"Learning online has been an odd experience for me. I really like the convenience of learning online and being able to work on my own schedule. I won't lie, though, it's a double-edged sword. While it's convenient to study from home, my procrastination rate has increased drastically during this time. I've had the issue of procrastination since high school but I was held accountable because I had to turn in my assignments in an actual classroom by hand, rather than pressing a button before 11:59. I feel like I've been doing better, though. I'm set on a weekly routine to make sure I get everything done for every class which has been great mentally. However, I do miss going on campus, meeting new people, and interacting with the world. The past two years, I feel like I've been disconnected from the outside world and I hope to get back soon."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2929,"Online classes have been impacted my learning in a very positive way. To be honest I wish online classes remained, the reason is that with online classes I do not have to commute for so many hours. Another reason why I think online classes are helpful is because they give me more time to do other things like sports for example, I am also able to work more days that help me pay off some bills. Also, I really like online classes because I can do work from the comfort of my house. These are just a few reasons why I really like online classes; I know there are also big flaws to online learning like more distractions and such, but I think online classes should remain as an option for students. I would like my future classes to have alternatives, I want to take some in person and some online like I did this semester. Hopefully i do not have to come to school every day and commute so many hours to arrive at the university. So, I have nothing but good things to say about online classes, I feel like I am learning the same as I would if I had all of my classes in person."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2941,"Online classes have been beneficial for me. As a computer science major, I am very much used to independent research rather than relying fully on classroom resources, and instead relying on online classes for questions and progress checking. Being online has been harder for self care, as being pushed to attend in person classes ensures students are regularly going outside. Now as all my classes are online, and my job is soon to be online, it’ll require a lot more time management and schedule improvement to ensure that I take proper breaks and go outside. I think with this con of online learning in mind, I would still rather stick to fully online classes as I live far away from SFSU."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2937,I really love online classes because I don't have to waste any time on transportation. And almost all online classes will have the records; this really helps me catch any concept I don't understand at that moment. I will not miss anything from the lecture because I'm too busy to take notes. I really love studying at home because I will not worry about anything. I think we should have more online classes for everybody's convenience. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2948,"I think online classes impacted my learning in a lot of good ways and bad ways. One of the good ways is that I tend to pay more attention in online classes than in my in-person classes. I think I am paying more attention because I am in my own comfortable space and nothing else is distracting me. I know a lot of people might say otherwise but being at home has given me a comfortable space to really lock in and pay attention in class. A bad way online classes have impacted my learning is that I tend to want to procrastinate and do all my homework at the due date. This has become a very bad habit of mine and I am working on overcoming it. I feel like I am doing a lot more remedies for self-care while having online classes. I would always make a cup of tea before my classes and get comfortable in my chair before hopping into zoom, another self-care is that I am doing my skincare routine a lot more in the morning because I have time to do it before my morning class instead of having to rush to school. I have no concerns for my learning and well-being because I feel like I am a lot more productive throughout my day because I have online classes."
