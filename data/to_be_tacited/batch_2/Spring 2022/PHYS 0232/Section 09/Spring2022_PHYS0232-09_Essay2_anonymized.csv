2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2930,"I guess my academic goal is to graduate and get my bachelor's degree in computer science. I don't really have a long-term goal, I usually live life in the moment and figure things out as they come at me. As for this class, I think it can help me improve my problem-solving skills critical thinking in order to succeed in my academic career. I really just want to strive to be the best person I can be, live life, create memories, and see where my life takes me. At the end of the day, goals are meant to motivate you and have something to look forward to. I'm at the chapter of my life where there are forks at every road I take and I'm constantly trying to make the right decisions and travel through the correct path. All in all, my goal is to graduate and work in an industry I enjoy, build a family, and travel around the world."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2928,"My goals are still the same as last semester. I want to be able to graduate with remembering everything I've learned so I can put these skills to use. To add on to my original goal, I also want to find some hands on activities related to my major such as internships or maybe some small solo projects I can do on my free time that can help improve my skills. This class is a step to helping achieve these goals as it is a course I need to take in order to fulfill my majors requirements. Besides helping me fulfill the requirements of my major it also can bring some skills that may be used later on, who knows what I can use these skills for if I try to do something else."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2947,Currently my goals are set on a series of ideas.  I want to get my degree in EE strictly because I enjoy working with electronics and I would like to have more of an understanding on the subject.  End goal is to have the understanding required to design components that suit my own needs and have the knowledge to get those items manufactured.This class is yet another stepping stone that is directly related to my understanding of the field of EE and I am excited for that.  Getting a better understanding of electricity and magnetism is going to help me have a more firm grasp on the concepts that I am going to be learning in future classes.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2933,"When it comes to what my goals are throughout this class exactly, it would have to be to gain a better amount of knowledge on what I'm taking in my normal 230 class, because when it comes to physics in general, I've always had problems understanding the concepts that are in relation to electricity in general, so I think that the lab is really helping me gain a lot of extra knowledge that may be unattainable from my normal 230 class, and especially when it comes top all these simu7lations we are using which helps me picture all these concepts better. I also think that the textbook for this class is very hard to read and understand so the lab actually helps out a lot to better understand all these concepts rather than flooding you with information like the textbook. I also think the teamwork aspect in this class really helps us work together to find answers to some complicated question, and that sense of teamwork actually helps you grasp knowledge in a better way, because you're working on it step by step with your team."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2943,"My goal is to mainly learn and understand the concepts of physics thoroughly as growing up learning physics in middle and high school, I never found the interest to understand where and why physics was actually used. However, it is pretty clear that physics is involved in our daily lives and lifestyles. I believe taking this class, is gonnahelp me to clear my doubts and further explore the ideas and certain concepts."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2936,My goals are to create healthy food in a sustainable way available to those that need it. This glass will give me the critical thinking skills to obtain this.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,191,"Ryan RiveraMy goals revolve around spending as little money that isn’t mine as possible. Currently, my grandparents are helping me get through school and I want to graduate as soon as I can so I can support myself and not have to ask others for financial help. That is my ultimate goal. This class is helping me get closer to my goal because it is part of the requirements to obtain my degree. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2955,"My goal in terms of school is to graduate with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. This class for me is just a requirement that I have to take rather than something I will take with me into my career. Although I do find it really interesting especially in comparison to the Physics 230 class because that is really hard to follow along and seems more like theory within theory because none of it is connected to a physical thing unlike in this class. So it is really hard for me to follow along in that class because I'm not sure what the topics actually relate to. I have enjoyed this class so far though, and I am looking forward to the rest of the semester with you."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2938,"I think the most important thing for me in this course, as well as the lecture, is to understand how electricity works. I really care about how electricity works in electronics, so this is one of the things that has driven me to learn more about how it works. I want to learn how electricity works on a theoretical level and a physical level. I think it's fascinating how we can even get electricity flowing through our devices in the first place. The history of how technologies like this were created is a large interest of mine, so this class is really useful in understanding how it all works.As for how to help the learning for students in the course: I think this course is doing a decent job so far helping me understand exactly how electricity works with the experiments  that we've done. I also particularly enjoy using PHET to have a visual to aid. I think understanding how electricity works isn't easily done without the use of some kind of visual element, since its one of those things that needs to be demonstrated in order to be better understood."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2956,"My main goal is to still gradually progress towards my career in civil engineering. This class helps me get a better understanding of physics and how to eventually relate this back to engineering. Every class such as this one, similar courses in the same category can be calculus, I see it as stepping stones towards my total understanding of engineering and how to apply it in my main engineering courses. What I have noticed is that when I lack in physics and calculus, I seem to be also a bit behind in my main engineering courses. So besides the main goal, another goal of mine is to make these classes as prioritized as my main classes. It is very similar to how professional athletes still have to go to training and practices, to learn or master their own tools and skills. Such as them, if I lack in this class, it will be a pain going forward."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2939,"To be honest my interest is not really in physics and it is in computer science instead. I still feel like one goal this class can help me achieve is becoming a better problem solver. For example, in physics, we tend to solve a lot of problems which makes you think of different ways to solve problems. Similar to computer science, for coding problems, I also have to think of different strategies in order to solve problems. I really like how we are given challenge problems at the end of each lab that help you think more about the material and apply all the concepts you learned throughout the labs. While I still do not really enjoy doing the labs or learning about physics, these problem-solving skills that I develop through these problems really help me even in my other computer science classes and interviews. I think if we were given more challenging problems that would be the best thing to help me overall."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2942,"For the short-term goals, first I really want to pass the class. I was the one who was really afraid of taking math courses and physics courses because I am not really a math person and especially for physics, it requires a lot of reading for solving problems (I am an international student and I was not confident for that). However, I think the Physics course and the lab that I am taking this semester are very organized, making me confident. So, one of my goals is to pass the class, and hopefully, I can pass the harder courses in Fall 2022 as well. I am pretty sure this class will help me understand all the concepts that I will need to know for the next level classes such as math and science courses. So far, I'm in week 5, I feel like it is getting hard. However, I'm pretty sure if I put effort into the lectures and homework, it will be fine. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2934,"One of my goals that I can achieve in this class is to improve on my problem solving abilities. I've never been the best at problem solving or math in general, but I have definitely slowly improved the more classes I've taken. Problem solving doesn't come as natural or easy to me as it would for some people, but I still enjoy figuring things out and finding the solutions for them. I found that physics is one of those classes that is involved in problem solving and gives me more practice with problem solving. I had a similar experience last semester when I took physics and thought that it was a good opportunity to practice problem solving. I hope that by the end of this semester I will be even more comfortable in my skills and be able to apply them to future classes and opportunities."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2946,"My goal is to become a Computer Engineer by Fall of 2023 and passing this class will help me reach that, in both taking the pre-requisites for the major and learning the fundamental of Electrical Engineering. In order to reach my goal, I talked to some of my friend working in the field as hardware engineers; however, they have not actively searched for a job, entering as a junior, recently, so I have decided to consult to Kevin Manago, one of my instructor who is pursuing MS in Computer Engineering at our school. I thought about going to a counsellor, but I first needed to concrete my plans for the future, so I decided to ask Manago for a meeting and he willingly accepted. Also, Physics and math was my favorite subject until I met with charges in physics; but now, I am starting to understand more of the fundamentals on how the charges correlate with the surroundings with flux and field. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2932,"My goal is to graduate and to learn as much as possible so I can be good at my career. Foremost I know that to graduate I need to take physics so I can graduate so that is one thing that this class can help me with. Now the other is that I like to learn, and want to be good at what I do, and as a computer science major I like to work with computers. Now considering computers need electricity learning how electricity works will help me learn how the electric flow works within its components. By having more knowledge on how physics work the more I know how components of computer will work, which will help me be better at my career job. Taking this class so far I have learned a lot and I feel like I am on the right place and on my way to achieving my goals."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2929,"My goal for this semester is to learn everything I can from my physics class. I want to be better at electricity, I just like electricity a lot, but I feel like I need to learn more about electricity. I honestly have a lot of goals for this semester to be honest, I just want to make sure I learn as I go through the semesters. This class is already helping me understand the concepts related to electricity, I am able to say that I know a little bit about the basics of electricity. The lecture class is good, but I feel like lab helps me understand everything that was discussed in lecture more deeply. This lab class is very helpful for me, I wouldn't be able to do good in my lecture class if it wasn't for this lab class, doing simulations and going over electricity in more details allows me to better understand what is going on. There is a long road ahead and I have to say I feel good, I just feel a little tired already of all the math I have to do, in all of my classes I have to do math and it's just tiring. That is all I have to say really, I just want to highlight the fact that this class is helping me succeed in my main physics class lectures, which means if I keep on going, I can definitely achieve my goal of becoming more knowledgeable in electricity."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2949,"My goals are to just get an understanding of the material of the class. I've always been overwhelmed by the amount of things we need to learn in physics and trying to remember certain concepts become hard after a while. I've been getting better at this however, the little lessons help and the group allows me to ask questions from students like me. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2953,"My goal is to receive an undergraduate diploma in computer science and be one of the first in my family to graduate from college. This course has helped me better understand the world and how it works on a quantum level. The things we learn apply to our everyday life and it is interesting to know how it works. The material may come in handy when creating a piece of software or figuring out an physical property of an event. It is sometimes difficult to imagine what it will be used for since the concepts can become so abstract, but it is better to know it on a basic level then not to. I am sure as class goes on we will  touch on more topics that may have less or more relevance to our everyday life. This class could probably use computer simulation and show how data can be used to find results or show the data in a simulation."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2941,"My goal from taking this lab is to be able to learn efficient and effective team work. As a programmer, being able to work both independently and as a team is something that is needed throughout my career. Throughout this lab, I am able to work on these skills both in break out groups as well as a whole class. In breakout rooms, we are able to work on part of assignments that we know well independently asking each other questions on problems we get stuck on. After completing those problems, we are then able to work as a group and go over our answers and then work on difficult questions together. This is transferable when working on programming projects, as there are parts that require independent work as well as team work. This is why I want to learn efficient and effective team work throughout this lab. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2937,"My goal is to graduate from San Francisco State University. I hope I can get an internship opportunity in Computer Science this year. If I want to work on hardware in the future, this class can prevent burning my device. Even if I don't want to work on hardware, I still need to work hard in this class. A higher GPA can help me have more chances to get an internship. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2935,"My major is computer science. I hope to work in game development in the future. In many open-world games, there will be a need to use physics engines. And the better the physics engine is, the closer it is to our life. For example, water can conduct electricity, high temperatures can melt ice, etc. Players can use the real-life experience to reproduce in the game, which will give players a sense of enjoyment and satisfaction. And I hope to work on this aspect and participate in the development of a physics engine that makes the game experience even better. The joy of playing games is pure, and making games that make others happy is a great accomplishment. This course can help me in my future career planning. Because I can only apply it in the development process if I know enough about physics. That's what I think this course will mean for my future career."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2952,"I try not to think so hard about long-term goals because I like to focus on what I'm dong right now. But my main goal right now is to graduate with a computer science degree. This class can help me achieve these goals by helping me finish my prerequisites classes. After I finish this class, I am one class closer to my degree. Another goal of mine is find what exactly I want to do with my degree. Hopefully, by taking this class I can discover more things that I'm interested in. With the new knowledge I'm learning, maybe I'll figure out what I want to do with my degree. Another goal I have is that I want a software engineering internship and maybe with the labs we are doing now, it will give me some lab experience. I know that they are two completely different subjects, but having some lab experience at all is good experience. I may even get into research for computer science and lab experience will help with that.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2931,"My overall goals in terms of schooling are to come out knowing how to computer program sufficiently and to know all of the necessary things in order to be able to program something more difficult in the future. For instance, learning physics is very helpful for this reason because maybe in the future I will need to make a program that calculates flux or electric potential or looking further into the course, circuits. It's just helpful to know how things in physics work in order to be able to code them down the road. the thing that fascinates me the most about physics is that everything relates back to things in real life and how things in our everyday lives work. We can then program these real-life things to maybe make our own simulations or whatnot."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2951,"My overall goal is to be able to graduate with a degree and start getting into my career so I can support myself on my own and help my family with my finances. But my priority is supporting myself and being independent. I am going to be 24 in little less than a month, and I feel like I am no where near from where I want to be in my life. I've been in school for about 6 years and I am over it honestly. I just want to graduate and start enjoying life without school. Doing things I love, having a steady income and travel, Buy things that I am interested in. This class will help me achieve my goals as acting like a stepping stone in order to get my bachelors degree. For my major I don't really need physics, and even the computer science department stated that they are trying to have it not be a prerequisite to get a Degree with this major. So overall this class will help me with my prerequisite for my major and help me get closer to obtaining my bachelors degree"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2944,"My goals are to work in the technology industry and work as a software developer because I enjoy how technology interacts with one another. I wanted to work as a software developer because I liked how coding things can make your life easier and other peoples as well and I learned this from playing games because people would write code to help automate some functions that they need to get done and I was really envious of that. Taking this class Physics with Lab allows me to help progress towards my goal because I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science and this class is a perquisite of my major. Also, the equations in this class will potentially allow me to implement these equations to code something that may need those equations because not everything will be straight forward and I would in need to code in physics for a game or something.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2954,"My goal is to get my bachelors in Computer Science and I would love to be a UI/UX designer or a front-end developer. I have a love for interface design and also coding things that appeal to the user's eyes. I’m not too sure if my occupation interest has anything to do with physics in itself, but I do appreciate the math involved within the science of physics. I know coding does require some sense of math, as it’s needed to create patterns or certain arrays, or just counting logically, so I do appreciate the integration of math in computer science."
