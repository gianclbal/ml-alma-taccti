2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2928,"I want to go into the STEM field because I like to do math as well as hands on work. I always grew up with the computer since I was little until now and love how computers work, I also like how websites and games work since I use them on a daily basis. Technology is growing day by day during our time and it is very interesting to me how it works each new little thing that I see everyday fascinates me. An example of something recently that fascinated me was how you can make your own bots on discord and use them. A professor that I currently have showed the class his discord bot that helps him show the current students that are enrolled in his class their grades on each assignment as well as their overall grade. I thought this was cool and now I want to start a project on making a bot similar to this, it might or might not be a discord bot, but something similar to this would be an ideal project I want to start. Trying to figure how things work is also something I like to do. It might not have to do with computers for example I want to figure out how a bicycle works with the gears and such, so I start doing research on it, then next time I know which gears to use when biking. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2929,"The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is so that I can reach my dream of becoming a mechanic. I really want to be able to work on vehicles or heavy machinery, I want to be able to work at a job where I can demonstrate how good I am at working with my hands. For many years I have watched my dad fix tractors and vehicles and I want to do the same. For these reasons I feel like I want to go into the STEM field, I want to graduate with a Mechanical Engineering degree so that I can work either at a John Deere factory or an Automotive production line. I have a passion for fixing any type of vehicles, all the way from small cars to big machines like harvesting combines. This is something I love to do and I hope I get a job in some of these factories, I would be lying if I said I want to do something other than fixing vehicles. I will try my very best in order to achieve this, I was told that with a Mechanical Engineering degree I was going to have multiple doors open for my future and I am looking forward to this. I don't see myself working at an office or spending endless hours on a computer screen, I am more of a hands on person."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,191,"Ryan RiveraReflection #1 Why do I want to go into the stem field? I have thought about this for a while. I believe engineering is a field that, when learned, can unlock some powers in a way. What I mean by this is how learning engineering can help you build what you want, design what you think of, and actually put your thoughts onto paper (or program). I’ve always loved math and science, which is my initial reason I wanted to go into engineering, but now that I’ve seen what can be done by mastering the field, that is my new goal. I want to be able to think of something and if I want to show it to someone, I can. That’s my ultimate goal when becoming an engineer. I also went into the stem field for its stability. I have many people I consider mentors who are also engineers, which felt safer for me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2930,"I haven’t really thought deeply about why I wanted to join the STEM field. When I was in high school, I really liked to solve math problems and learn more advanced concepts the further I go into the field. While I get frustrated sometimes when I struggle with certain problems, finally being able to solve the hard problems is the best feeling you could get. I’m specifically going into the computer science field. I’ve always been intrigued with computers and technology; I love watching sci-fi and futuristic films to see what kind of advancement humans can achieve in the next years. The more I dive deeper into more complex courses within my major and learn more about the history of computers, the more I respect what humans have built over the decades. To be honest, I can’t really describe the reason why building computers and coding programs is something I’m passionate about, it just is."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2931,"I have always enjoyed and have been fascinated with how computers work and how I can get them to work in a way that others won't really understand. I have also always disliked English and history classes so I really didn't want much to do with those courses. That being said I have always been pretty gifted with being able to understand math concepts, which leads to me liking math and other STEM classes more than the courses outside of STEM. Physics has also been very interesting to me because it is how our actual everyday life works put into numbers which again is something that is more understandable to me. There are also so many different Physics topics that it is hard not to find one that appeals to an individual."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2932,"I am a very curious individual and I have always been fascinated with how things work. I like to figure out how a computer works, or even figure out how to fix my own car. All this things that I like to play around with have been built by scientist or engineers using math and/or science. So I figured that because I am interested in figuring out how things works I thought it would be natural for me to get into a form of STEM. Which then lead me to go into computer science, since looking back at my child hood I have always been interested in computers and building my own computer. So by going into computer science this will allow me to have a better understanding of not only how a computer works, but to see how a machine works together with a software. So, this is some of the reason why I wanted to get into STEM."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2933,"I feel like the STEM field not only opens up so many different paths for me to take in my career, but it also provides me with entertainment at times. I feel like if I can find the exact field I want to dump all my time into, it will be worth my time. I also think that the STEM field is where the future is headed, and most job listing nowadays are looking for computer Science majors, so that's very nice to have when you're in this field you feel like you're never going to go out of style and there will always be a place for you in the workforce somewhere around the world.I also found myself here, because I don't see myself studying anything other than Computer Science, because this field has the highest chance of providing me with a career I can actually enjoy and live comfortably off of."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2934,"I don't have an exact, pinpoint reason on why I want to go into the STEM field. I thought that it would be a good field to study in and I believe that, in the future, STEM will become even bigger in our world. I chose to go into Computer Science because technology is a large part of my life. I don't go a day without using any sort of technology and always either use my phone or computer. As a result, I wanted to learn more about the technology I use and how technology would advance or change in the future. I wanted to be able to understand the technology I was using, how my phone and its apps worked. STEM is definitely not an easy field to study in and sometimes I'm afraid that I won't be able to make it or burn out. I've previously switched majors before and I don't want to end up switch again. I do find Computer Science fun to learn even though it can difficult."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2935,"When I studied in junior high school, our school settled a class named robotic programming. It asks us to use programming skills and math knowledge to reach a series of objectives. For example, robot walking is not the same as human walking. It will only act in accordance with the program, generally speaking, it is straight, when it needs to turn, we need to calculate the Angle it needs to rotate in order to achieve the function of turning. The project that impressed me most in this course was simulated fire rescue. When there is an emergency fire, how to rescue the injured through the robot. It was in this class that I felt the joy of programming, which is like a conductor's baton. The code is your orchestra. I love creating tools to achieve my goals. So from then on, I decided that I wanted to study computer science in the future. In a way, this is a wish come true for me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2936,"At first, STEM meant to me a pursuit of something I have always felt strongly about: understanding why, building, and solving problems. As I have progressed in life certain expectations and hardships were placed on me. The thought of growing up an at-risk youth raised by a single mother and still succeeding in engineering as a female seemed like an act of rebellion and I was the Last Jedi. 	“A Scientific Jedi working for The Resistance” was a way to personify the struggle in a manner that kept me going. I have been in Community College a long time, 10 years. That’s the shortest time to work your way up to university while working and keeping your head down.  	For some, the transition over the Golden Gate Bridge is a golden ticket to success. Maybe it’s the city's long-time love affair with public parks, public companies, or the fact that there’s no-where to park so get good at taking public transportation. Silicon Valley, Twin Peaks, and Peking duck are all great reasons to come to The Bay, but they weren’t my reason. SFSU was the only university that accepted me, despite a transcript as colorful as the Castro. “Candace Castro, yes, that’s me”. One of thirty-three, the only female in a lab that doesn’t take me seriously. Material science was the class and atom structure was the lecture. Professor thought I would find this slide to be important. He looked me in the eyes to make sure “ladies” could differentiate between a real and fake diamond. Those words still ring in my ear. Talking about rings to make sure I would hear, and a Force Awakens. Maybe I had not yet awakened from my overnight shift. Maybe an older professor could not be forced to shift their views overnight to be woke.  	I remember how proud I felt to be one of the first drivers of a Model X down Mission Street. Until, that is, I hopped out of the car in my valet uniform, clocked out, and took the bus to take Muni to class at 8 AM. I guess you could say I started up cars of people who started up startups.  	If Darwin’s greatest discovery was natural selection, San Francisco’s greatest discovery was financial selection. Since only the richest could live in San Francisco, that meant my commute shifted each semester: from Daly City, Oakland, San Jose and even Merced. I’ve taken many Munis, darted after BARTs, and complained about late Caltrains. I was the princess of layovers since it was my only hope. 	Fast forward 4 years and 2 years off of school and now I have my own start-up. Now that my mission is almost done here at SFSU I can look towards a New Hope. I am finally in a position where I can dedicate myself to school. My intention is to make healthy food accessible to everyone that needs it and I am ready to change the world. I am my ancestors' wildest dreams, a Phantom Menace."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2937,"I have been told that girls weren't good at math when I was a child. I was so confused and frustrated because I'm good at math. I tried to do better in math to prove myself. However, even if I got the best in my class, nothing changed. ""She is the best because it's just the beginning level of math."" ""Boy will be better after they grow up."" If there are a lot of females in the STEM field, I will not doubt myself. I can't go back to the past, but I can be an example to the little girls. We don't have to be the best to go into the STEM field;  all we need is passion and love. In my opinion, the STEM field is the world's future, and nobody should be rejected because they are female. They can give up after they try, not being told. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2938,"I would like to be in STEM because I've always been very interested in technology. I remember being young and loving messing with computers, old phones, etc. I just loved messing around with anything that I could find related to electronics. I was planning to go into Japanese and Social Work at one point in time, but reconsidered and ended up going into Computer Science. Now that I am almost at senior level for CS, I don't regret my decision. I think it was the right choice and career path to go into since it continues to hold my attention well. I have enjoyed most classes I've taken, and am looking forward to future classes."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2939,"I want to go into the STEM field mainly because I have a passion for technology. I'm a computer science major and as a child, I have seen my parents constantly work in tech as well. I was surrounded by computers from a young age which led to me developing an interest in them. I mainly liked to play with them and learn how things work on a software level and even on a hardware level. I loved to take computers apart and rebuild them again with my father and I learned a lot through that process. Then, in high school, when I took my first programming class, I realized I really loved to program because you can be creative and create whatever you want. For example, I could create a game or a web application or even some kind of program that solves a real world problem like an app that keeps track of your finances."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2940,"I want to go into the STEM field because as a female I want to help change the world. I think that having more women in the STEM field is one of the best ways to make the world a better place. We need to have more diverse teams of people, whether that be through gender or ethnicity designing our future in a way that includes everyone. That will not happen without more women and people of color braving forward to be in a STEM field. STEM should be more inclusive. Also, on a real but more selfish note, I want to be able to afford living in the bay area and this will help me achieve my materialistic and housing goals. I also want to prove everyone wrong that put me down my whole life and show them and myself that I can be so much more than ever expected and have a wonderful life!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2941,"I want to go into STEM, because I love the evolution of technology. I think that taking part in a rapidly growing industry that is well diverse in many different sub industries is exciting and makes me thrive for becoming a better student. With how many new projects are being released that require many teams that are in STEM, there are many opportunities for great paying, and  interesting careers. I also want to be able to be well diversified in many different career paths, and being in technology helps with the job demand market. Although I am not great with the science and math part of STEM, I find that being able to understand these departments helps with critical thinking and problem solving skills. I do feel a little stressed with my current path in computer science, as many entry level programming jobs and internships are impacted heavily, but I think that in the end, STEM will be well worth pursuing."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2942,"When I was in Korea, I went to a university with a major in Business Management. Honestly, I chose the major because I really did not know what I want to do. About two years later, I was interested in Self-driving cars, and I searched on the internet for some information. Also, my aunt always told me to come to the US and to study here because she has been working in the STEM field in Silicon Valley for more than ten years. Therefore, I quit the university in Korea and decided to come to the US to study computer science stuff. I really got into computer programming as well because it was just something that I have never learned before in my life. I believe that all future technologies are related to my major and STEM field, and I think it might be easy to get a job that gives high salaries if I study computer science than other majors. Still, my interests are changing a little bit, but those are all related to the STEM field. I recently read an article that says in near future, robotic science will be a hot topic. I know I need to work on a lot of things but yeah this is why I chose STEM field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2943,"Growing up I was always amused by the way science works. Once I was in middle school I started to see the connection between math and science. It was amusing how two distinct subjects could be used to create some wonders. Not only that, it was also utilized in our daily lives. Ever since then I have been planning to be involved in STEM. The field has a vast variety of opportunities to learn and achieve. So far I have learned a fair share about the field of STEM, however I believe there's far more to learn and I look forward to that!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2944,I want to go into the STEM field because I love technology. It is as simple as that but in technology I love everything you can do with it from simple automation to creating large scale technology that allows us to travel the word and transform how humanity lives. Such as how with creation of the smartphone in the last decade we have gone from not being reliant on our mobile phones to bringing it everywhere around with us no matter where we go. We have our entire lives stored on our phone from our contacts to our photos and applications that allow us to share our lives with our friends as well as accessing the worlds information through browsers. I want to be part of helping make the next tremendous change that changes how society interacts with each other and or create something new that will allow society to progress into something different like creating application that lets us check for our health vitals from at home. There is so much that is possible to accomplish with technology and I just wish to be part of the changes when they do end up changing the world again. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2945,"I want to be in the STEM field because I have had an interest in learning from an early age. I want to practice programming and have a deep understanding of what it is and how it is used. are lives more and more are being intrenched in new technology everyday, and I believe by staying in STEM I would be able to understand all the new things being built today. I also want to help create new things in the cyber space world that is being created to day in web 3.0. I also think doing this will help secure my future safety as a person I cant reaaly see myself doing anything eles"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2946,"I am currently 31 and pursuing my first first Bachelor's degree. At 18, I was accepted to Binghamton University in NY and started my college life with hopes in pursuing BS in Economics thinking that it would mostly be playing with numbers, since I was fond with math; however, that didn't last for a while and I was academically expelled from the college after three years. If I were Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, I would have started a multi-trillion dollar company, but I was not so I just worked here and there, interning in Europe for a while, and travelling a lot. Then, I had a foot injury and went to alternate service, instead of the military service, in Korea, for two years. Then, I realized that I needed a well-paying job to support all my spendings and since I am a handy person and like math and physics, I am here today studying Computer Engineering, well-paying job that will support all my spendings and travel plans in the future. Also, I would want to live a happy life doing the things I like, such as spending time resolving technical problems. Therefore, I and pursuing my best to get a job and enjoy life! This is just a short version of my story, but I hope our class would have a time to share our life experiences."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2947,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field?  Alexander L Scott.  PHYS 232  2/3/22     Well I don’t really want to go into the STEM field, I want to have the knowledge and the knowhow that is associated with a degree in electrical engineering.     From an early age I have been taking apart and putting things back together and learning how the world around me works.  This degree is going to allow me to take it to another level. My passion is in photography and I did not choose that as my major because I did not want to make my passion into something that I was required to do.  I am able to learn all I want from youtube on the subject of photography so electrical engineering it is.     I would like to have the understanding of circuitry and electronics so that I can take concepts that I have in my head and make them into a reality.  There are many times that I have had to do a lot of research to piece things together in order to make them work, instead of doing that, I would like to have the know how of building what I need instead of making a Frankenstein device.  It works, but its not pretty."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2948,"The reason why I want to be in the STEM field is because ever since I was a child, I've always been interested in technology and computers. When I was growing up, My family was struggling to make ends meet and I wasn’t surrounded by much technology but I have always kept up with the latest and newest. Technology to me is so fascinating because of how it developed and improved over the years. Another reason that made me want to be in the STEM field is because of their high paying salary. I want to be able to afford the newest things coming out and be able to enjoy them without breaking my pockets."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2949,"I'm not very sure as to why I want to pursue a career in stem, but I am majoring in Computer Science because I find it fun to solve the task given to me and create something from some simple symbols. I started being interested in CS back in middle school as we had this day of code and were showed this website where students could learn to code, I think CodeHS, and during lunch my friend and I could enter the computer lab thanks to our teacher and keep on learning and enjoying solving the problems. Since then it has been my goal to enter college with a CS major and hopefully graduate with a major in something I enjoy."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2950,I want to get into Software Engineering. I am currently a Junior studying Computer Science.  My most memorable moment and why I wanted to get into STEM was in high school when I had to program a robot in class. The assignment was to program the robot to follow specific routes and not go off the line. There was a lot of trial and error involved but this assignment made me think that I wanted to program things for my career. I want to one day make some form of artificial intelligence. It would make the way we live easier and it would be affordable for everyone to have in their house.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2951,"I've always gravitated toward the STEM field honestly. From sciences like physiology or neurology, or tech such as programming or computer engineering, all of those things I absolutely love and would gladly find a career within the STEM field. The main reason I want to be in the STEM field is because I want to find a career that will satisfy my curiosity, and this field is right up my alley. I am a very curious person and I always think about either space or the brain. I was taking classes to get my degree in neurology in hopes to become a neurologist, but I had to let that dream go because of finances and not being able to afford future schooling after my bachelors. After building my first computer I decided to switch my major to computer science because I feel like it will be an ideal career to get into as technology starts to advance. Im praying I can land a job at a Space company or something like Neuralink. It would be interesting to work on robots that can captivate mars or software for neuralink for the processor that goes into your brain. On the contrary, I am also a very creative individual. I am part of the editing/creative directing team for my friends band and I have a passion for photography and shooting/directing music videos. If getting a degree in the STEM field does not work out, best believe my back up plan is directing music videos."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2952,"I want to go into the STEM field because I'm interested in computer science. I honestly didn't think about the benefits, money, or status that came with being in the computer science field. I wasn't interested in school before when I was younger. Then I took a introduction to computer science class in high school and I suddenly became interested in learning. So now I'm just trying to continue to do what I love by getting a computer science degree. I'm honestly unsure what I can do with a computer science degree because there so many different careers I can get into. But I hope that I can get into a career that helps other people. I'd love to give back to my community when I'm older and I have a career. I hope that I can help young minority women in computer science by starting scholarships, mentorship programs, etc. I'm not sure why else I want to go into the STEM field. I just like to code and I want to give back to my community."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2953,I have wanted to be in the STEM field ever since i was a child and played with my first computer. I found it fascinating how thing moved on the screen and you where able to get any info you wanted. As i have grown up the pay is a main motivator. My family has never had a lot of money and i hoped to turn a fascination into a career. Coding is challenging and allows me to think in abstract ways even though its very logical. It can be very frustrating to learn but the feeling of accomplishment seeing it all come together and work is very rewarding. Things don't turn out how you expect and suddenly you are not where you  thought you would be. thankfully I am back on track to going in the stem field and  enjoying it.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2954,"I want to go into the STEM field because I appreciate how innovative technology is. Although there are pros and cons when it comes to how advances technology is (and will get), I think the change allows for more good than bad. In today's world, having smart phones, self driving cars, apps, virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, things such as touch ID and face ID are all so innovative. We even have simple things such as touch pads, wireless ear phones/head phones, watches that can read our heart rate, spam filters, phone calls that filters spam, etc. that allows our days to be more convenient and at ease. I think these things affect us all positively, and I can't imagine a single person who doesn't rely on technology or AI. It is a goal of mine to be a part of a field like that. I want to make a change in the world and I want to do it through technology."
