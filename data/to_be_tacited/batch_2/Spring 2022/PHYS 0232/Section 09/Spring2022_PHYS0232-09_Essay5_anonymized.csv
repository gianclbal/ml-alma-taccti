2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2934,"My greatest take away from this class is that I can apply and relate a lot of what I learn in class to real life. Things like circuits, magnets, electric currents, and voltage are all things that I have seen or know of in my life. House appliances and objects that use electricity involved circuits, currents, and voltages. Physics is always applicable to not only my life, but everyone's life as well. We never think twice about how things work the way they do, and we become comfortable using them without really understanding it. I believe it is helpful in connecting the materials and topics I learn in class to my life. It helps me gain a better understanding and confirms that I understand what I was taught. Sometimes it is hard or difficult to understand topics and apply them to my life, but that is just the process of learning."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2933,"So far I'd say my greatest take away from this class is that physics actually has potential to be genuinely fun for me, and I don't think I've ever felt this way about physics before except in rare cases.I think the simulations especially give me a sense of exploration and that I'm actually figuring a bunch of stuff out as we go and I find that very fun, especially that simulation for the coding and actually creating code to make a graph for some reason I found those to be the most fun so far from this class. I also feel like I'm gaining a lot of knowledge on the world from this class in a way, like when I'm driving or something, I find my brain drifting off and thinking about the exact physics behind what's going on whilst I'm driving and for the first time I can actually answer the questions I think about which is great."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2946,"My greatest takeaway from the class would be PHYS 230. Since our professor was not the most helpful person in the world in teaching the subject, I have mostly learned from your class about the subjects of physics then his class. I hope that a day when you would teach regular classes would come to learn from you. Thank you for teaching my PHYS 232 and I hope to meet you in another class!!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2930,"I learned a lot of things in this class. While I knew some of the concepts that were introduced in this class briefly, there were many new details I found by doing the labs each week. I also really enjoyed watching the youtube demos provided in some of the labs, I thought they were incredibly entertaining and interesting. I was so intrigued by these physics-related experiments that I researched more on my own time. It's weird how we ""know"" what forces move different things around us but we don't really know why things are the way they are. I really enjoyed learning about circuits and energy manipulation. While some of the labs were lengthy and challenging, others were very laid back and fun. The unit I found most fascinating was the one that talked about magnets and what makes different things attract or repel. Overall, this was a very fun and informative course."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2948,"I think my greatest takeaway from this class was being able to learn how physics applied to so many things in our lives. Before taking any physics class in college, I had no idea that physics had this much impact on our daily lives. In high school, I knew that Biology and Chemistry were very important. I also thought that Biology and Chemistry is the more important topics in the world, But as I started taking more physics classes. I started to realize that physics is actually much more impactful for our daily lives than biology and chemistry. This class has gave me a much bigger appreciation on physics and those who tries to be a master in it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2943,"The greatest take away from this class was being able to work in groups and learning advanced topics in physics. There were a lot of topics that I found very interesting and the summary part of the labs helped me connect the topic to everyday use of that concept. The most significant thing I gained in this class was how to read a problem for what I already know and use what I've learned, even if I didn't understand how to solve it. I'm sure I have the tools to do it; all I have to do now is put them to use. I also learnt more about myself and how I learn, such as how crucial it is to constantly attempting and practicing difficult problems and making mistakes in order to learn anything valuable. Last but not least, I learned how to solve physics problems using various concepts and graphs. I've learnt how to use diagrams to depict goalless situations and then utilize those diagrams to answer particular questions."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2940,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that I am not too old to try something new. It was so nice on the first day of class to see how many othe seasoned adults were also going to be my peers in this class. I have also had the best experience in my entire educational career in regards to group work in this class. It has been so nice to be in a group of adults where everyone fairly participated and contributed. I do not know if these types of things just get better as you climb up the ladder to higher level classes but I am so appreciative of this experience and will do my best to carry these lessons with me so I can help facilitate the same kind of positive learning environment wherever I go next. Oh, I also really liked the presentation style of the professor and thought she did an exceptional job caring for and teaching the students. I hope I have her again for something else!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2938,"My greatest take away from this course is that I've learned a lot about physics and how it works with electricity; it is on a different level than the first physics course. Since most of this course has been theoretical, and some concepts haven't been easily demonstrable. In general, concepts are more difficult to comprehend if they cannot be demonstrated, from how I see it. I do think that the labs as well as PHET demos have helped a lot. I think I have an overall better understanding the physics of electricity from this course, and am happy that I was able to learn so much from the class.I think that some of the labs haven't been useful for me, or at least I don't think I learned a lot from several of them. Most of them I did at least gain a better understanding as to how to solve complex physics problems. I think if anything, PHET my favorite way of learning. I would absolutely use PHET in the future if need be."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2932,"The biggest take away from this class is how electricity or charged particles work it really has broaden my understanding of how electricity and particles work. We normally we think of electricity as a lightning striking hitting the ground, although this is a form of how electricity works, it can be also be as simple of charging scotch tape and then having the two scotch tape repel each other. Even simply how rubbing a balloon on a Christmas sweater and then how it stick because of how negative charge, and positive charge works. Its amazing to how electricity works in our daily lives and taking this class has helped me see how much electricity really plays in our daily lives. As well Learning how resistance and capacitors works was a great part. From learning about resistance and capacitors it has also helped me understand how circuit board or even how a mother boards work a bit more."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2942,"Before taking physic class and lab, I was really worried about passing the classes because I have failed a physic class before in my previous college. However, everything has changed. My greatest takeaway from this class was confidence in the physic subject by doing experiments with my group members. I mean at the beginning of the semester, it was a little hard to communicate with friends because we are using zoom, not in-person class, but as time goes it became much better and better. Since I got confidence after taking this class, I feel like I am ready for the next challenges with other physics classes or math classes that use the knowledge of physics. Even though I have a health problem right now, so  I'm not sure I can get an A or something, but I am sure that I will be fine because I had a lot of experience in this class as well with my group members. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2950,My greatest takeaway from the class is working in a team when doing labs. My groupmates are wonderful people and are very encouraging. The labs are very helpful with the visualizations and helped me learn the concept better.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2947,"The greatest take away from this course is that I think that I need to stop intimidating myself by thinking these courses are gong to be beyond my own understanding.  All of the math, physics, and engineering courses that I have taken aren't as intimidating as I make them out to be and this course is yet another example for me.  This course has been another step in allowing me to understand that I belong in this major.As far as specific experiences within the course, I think that having the course in person would be great, although I do feel like I am less stressed at home, I think that courses specifically like this one should be had in person.  There is a certain level of involvement that I feel is necessary for the absorption of the material and online just isn't quite there. Electricity and magnetism specifically need to have some hands on experimentation, not being able to put abstract concepts into practice makes the comprehension a little more difficult I feel.  For what it was, I think the professors did amazingly and I think that I learned what I needed to know."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2955,"My greatest takeaway from this class has been working with a group better. Sometimes people don't help, while other people really want to help and do the work. I feel that it works to help guide the first group by making it clear for them to understand what the group needs from them. I completely understand that it can be paralyzing when there is so much to do and everything looks like gibberish so you don't know where to start. I have felt this way, and I found that it helps to just focus on one small thing, or in this case just to focus on one question in order to help your group. We all focus on just one question together and try to make each others lives easier by putting in equal effort. This is something that I took away from this class."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2931,"One of my greatest takeaways from this class, is how nice people/ programmers have made it to be able to learn physics online. One is likely to assume that the best way to learn physics is in a classroom because one can be hands on with the material and see exactly whats going on in the lab. I found the physics simulations to be an extremely helpful tool throughout my experience learning both into to physics with calculus 1 and this follow up corse with calculus 2. Without the simulations, as one could easily imagine, a whole lot of students would get lost when taking this subject."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2928,"My greatest take away from this class is how we got to work with groups breaking down the assignment into parts so we all can help each other understand what we were trying to work on as well as getting our assignments in on time. There were a lot of different topics we went over and some were confusing while others were easier to understand. Working together whether it would be with the professor or with the other students, it both helped me get a better understanding than when I was trying to figure it out myself as getting help from others showed me different possibilities to the answer as well as answers that differed from what I originally got myself. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2935,"Most of the physics involved for PHYS232 is something I learned in senior high school. Instead of doing exploratory experiments, then counting, and then drawing conclusions, I knew the conclusions from the beginning. As for me, I was barely exposed to experiments in the past and just blindly learned the knowledge from the textbook. Knowing the conclusion but not knowing where it comes from. Perhaps what benefited me a lot from this class was the process of inquiry, in which I learned the conclusions I had learned before. Also, this is a course that requires cooperation and communication. It feels good to work with others for a common goal. In the past, I always attended classes and completed assignments alone, rarely discussing with other students. This also made me lack the ability to work with others. I got the opportunity to work as a team in this class. I experienced the appeal of teamwork when we had a discussion over some uncertain issues."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2951,"My greatest take away from this class is that physics plays hand in hand in our everyday life, as well as it becoming something I need in order to reach the next level with my degree. Though in my meetings with my advisors, they stated that taking physics for computer science is not really necessary because physics concepts do not really apply to computer science. maybe if it was a little more in depth, like for example making a game based on physics, or even just coding things that need to calculate real life actions where physics needs to be taken into accountability than yes. Other than that using physics for computer science is not really all that useful, but for other degrees maybe for engineering or even kinesiology, physics is extremely important. I also think having a good professor to teach you tough subjects like this is key, and I really appreciate our professor for teaching the material and helping us understand in the best way possible."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2954,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that I’ve learned a lot about how physics works through simulations and class activities. Rather than reading a textbook all day or doing online homework, I am able to see how physics work through simulations and small games. I am able to see how things such as how magnets work, or how electricity works, or how magnets attract or repel one another, and so on has a role in physics. I also feel like the group labs also helps me communicate better and hear new ideas, so I enjoy the group-lab aspects of this course. I’ve found physics to be quite interesting and fun actually, something I didn’t say before taking this course. This lab has also helped me with my calculus better, since it’s very math based."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,191,"My greatest take-away from this class has actually been teamwork. Being able to work with my peers and ask questions freely has been absolutely massive. The break out rooms are perfect for having a small group of people that can all put their mind to a single task, which is usually the lab and sometimes the post-lab work sheet. Overall, I think this class has been perfectly suited for group work and has opened my eyes to making a group. In the future, even if groups are not a thing in my classes, I am going to make an effort to find peers that want the same, an environment to work on the class and learn together. Ultimately, I have found my learning better suited when next to others. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2929,"My biggest takeaway from this class has to be the fact that I love doing experiments. I learn a lot better when I am doing experiments or when I am using simulation labs. This class helped me understand the material a lot better, I like how fun it is to work as a class and with other classmates. This is my biggest takeaway from this class. I hope that in the future I get to have such fun classes like this one. I personally believe that I learn better when I am working with classmates and specially when I am doing experiments and using online simulations taht help me better understand the concepts and the general ideas. Overall, this has been such a fun class and I look forward to doing more experiments in my future physics classes. It is interesting to me how I learned a lot more from lab than lecture, I just feel like in lab we did not rush through the topics, therefore I feel like I enjoyed this lab section a lot."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2939,"My greatest takeaway from this class was working together and learning together. I really liked how we paired up in groups this semester and decided to do each lab in a group, In my other physics class previously, we were forced to do labs with one person only. I feel like working in groups helped expand my learning and gave me new ways and approaches to solving problems. Discussing ideas with my group helped me confirm my understanding of the concepts as well as learn more about physics in general. I ended up learning something new every time my group meets up. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2941,"I would say my greatest take away from this class was the practice of teamwork in a learning environment. As a computer science major, I am constantly learning new techniques, programming languages, and tools in which some cases are used in development groups. That means working as a group is something that is necessary in the development field. This is why doing this lab in groups is a great way to exercise this skill."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2952,"My greatest take away from this class is that physics is a hard subject and I need to use my time wisely. I had to learn how to manage my time wisely, so that I have enough time to study this subject, while making enough time for my other classes, work, and my personal life. Although my greatest take away is not something that is academic information, I think I still learned something useful and helpful for myself in the future. With this knowledge, I learned to plan out my entire week at the start of the week. This way I can plan what homework I need to do on what day. With this technique, I was able to finish all of my work on time and it prevented me from forgetting about homework. I also wrote down what days I need to study a little longer on if I have an upcoming test."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2944,"My greatest take away from this class would be learning how physics is and its pretty simple in the end with all the theorems as long as you know when and how to apply them. I went into this course thinking it would be like calculus just fill of equations and we would be doing those all the time but I really liked how this course turned out with the virtual labs and meeting my lab mates especially in times of the pandemic where we are forced to be online and people did not interact with one another. I loved the experiments and the virtual simulations because we got to test all these physics topics without being in person and that made me feel like it made up for missing the in-person college experience. So, thank you professor for doing an excellent job in making this lab possible for all of us online and making it easy to learn in such troubling times. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2937,"I learned lots of stuff from this class. I saved all the simulation websites to use for one day. I really love the simulation because they create an ideal environment for the lab. In a real-life lab, we are always looking for an ideal environment; why don't we just use the simulation instead of a real lab. And the simulation is more environmentally friendly. One more thing that surprised me is how the magnetic train works. I love using real-life examples to introduce the physical concepts, so it's will easier to understand."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2936,This class showed me who cares about what you learn just get it done and submit it
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2953,The greatest take away that i got from this class is that physics is always happening around us even if we do not notice it. magnet fields and current are invisible to the naked eye but the particles that make it exist are still there. Its given me a better understanding of the world around me and how it works which is valuable to one  continued education. This class has also showed me that lecture does not have to be boring the professors interest in our lives shows that she cares more than just what grade we are going to get. This was a breathe of fresh air in a place where you could just be a letter.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,2949,I think that my greatest take away was learning about voltage and how electric potential/field worked. They were really interesting topics to work with and I learned that neutral objects can be attracted to charged objects based on how close they are to one another and the charge. We also were able to work with a group. We made one google doc and shared it with everybody where we could all look at the question and compare ideas to find out what the end result or answer should be.
