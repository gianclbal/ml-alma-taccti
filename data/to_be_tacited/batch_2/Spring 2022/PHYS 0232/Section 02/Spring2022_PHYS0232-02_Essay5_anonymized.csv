2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2841,"What is my greatest takeaway from this class?My greatest takeaway from this class has been being able to socialize and make friends, while also learning to cooperate with people who I'd only met at the start of this class. I learned that the only reason we can get work done is because we at the very least tolerate each other, but most of the time, being able to have fun together while doing work together keeps things going really smoothly.I also learned how to be moral support when my brain fries, so I can at least contribute in some way if not academically.I also learned that a lot of our work requires a little too much patience that I need to work on because I'm really bad at focusing on just one task for a long time."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2843,my greatest take away from this lab is how to handle equipment properly and be able to understand electromagnetism better than what I previously knew before coming into this class. This lab also helped me be more engaging not only with our experiments and technology but with our professor and the classmates that were in this lab. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2847,"This class taught me that magnetic field lines are continuous, producing complete loops with no beginning or end. We used the little compass and the bar magnet in the lab Report assignment to sketch and map out the magnetic field lines. The magnetic field vectors surrounding the bar magnet are mapped using the compass. It will always point to the field's direction. We had to consider the Earth's magnetic field for this lab project since we were installing a bar magnet near a compass. Because the bar magnet interacted with the Earth's Magnetic field, the compass displayed the bar magnet's Magnetic field rather than pointing north using the Earth's Magnetic field as it normally does. Prior to this lab project, I assumed that a compass always points north and that if it begins to point in another direction, something is wrong with the compass. However, it turns out that the magnetic field has an effect on which direction the compass is pointing."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2851,"This class has taught me to think more out of the box and just get out of my comfort zone overall as a scientist. While I love science, I have always struggled with the topic of physics. I think for me it is seeing all of the calculus and then suddenly feeling overwhelmed by all the steps I have to take, However, the lab helps put away that part of physics. This is my first hands-on lab using more electrical equipment because COVID hindered our ability to take an in-person physics lab last semester. This class in specific deals with a lot of specific wiring that can be easily messed up. When you mess up, it is easy to get frustrated because when one thing is wrong, the whole process is wrong. This class has taught me to take a deep breath and remember to have trust in the science that I know. It has also helped me create some team-building skills. It is very important in the lab that you work together and are aware of what your partner is doing so you don’t end up doing twice the work. Luckily for me, I have had a great team all semester."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2842,"One of my biggest takeaways from this class is to slow down and pace myself more consistently. Due to suffering from ADHD (Which is incredibly misunderstood unfortunately. In simple terms, it's basically a lack of dopamine in the brain) and anxiety, I have a hard time keeping my mind focused on one thing at a time without getting overstimulated and overwhelmed. As a result, there were a few instances where I neglected parts of labs that resulted in them being somewhat incomplete. I often feel rushed and don't like to feel like I'm behind everyone else, and this has had a detrimental effect on my performance in school in the past so it is definitely something I need to work on in the future.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2844,"My greatest take away from this class was that being in person and actually experiencing what we are talking about in the lecture is very helpful in understanding the purpose of what we are learning and how it can be applied to our every day lives. Today we used an oscilloscope in our lab. A few years ago I was doing an internship where I had to use one to measure the voltage over time of a certain device and doing this lab today helped remind me of how to use one. My dad also bought one recently to troubleshoot some electronics that he has and asked me to help him with it, so this came at the perfect time."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2840,"My greatest take away from this class is the social skills that I learned from working in a group. Since I am a computer science major, my ability to work in a group is my weakest skill. There are many small things that I need to work on such as monitoring my tone and the way that I word my opinion because I feel like those things make a big difference. Another one of my takeaways is that I need to work on my ability to give constructive criticism.The social skills I developed through working in a group are the most important takeaways from this session. My ability to operate in a group is my weakest skill, as I am a computer science major.I have a lot of tiny things to focus on, such as controlling my tone and the way I express myself, since I believe those things make a significant impact.Another thing I learned was that I need to improve my capacity to provide constructive feedback."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2848,"I believe my greatest take away from this class is the experience working in groups. Lab classes can be difficult at times because you are sometimes placed randomly in a group of people that you have never met before, and have nothing in common with. This can become increasingly difficult when you have different styles of working on laboratory reports and working on the hands-on section of the lab class as well. I think the thing that I learned the most from this lab class is how to work with different people. In my lab group specifically there are all different ages, majors, and backgrounds, which can be hard to hold conversations with. But through meeting every week, we have made a bit of an in class schedule where we set up a google doc and all work on there. Starting new labs is difficult, but as long as you're able to try new ways of working, then it shouldn't be too difficult. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2850,"I think there are many takeaways from this class but not a single greatest take away. I think this class is a great experience in order to learn how to work as a group and as a team. It takes main topics from the lecture course and then summarizes it into activities into this lab course. Being able to work with all of this lab equipment is also one of the takeaways from this course. This is my first in person semester at Sfsu, so it is my first time being able to interact physically during labs whether that be in chemistry, physics, or engineering. Being at home so long, I feel that this course brings students together and encourages to work together now and also in the future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2846,"My greatest take away from this class was that it was engaging every time I came into class, and that helped me learn the material that was covered in my regular physics class. It helped me understand the concepts and why we use the equations that are demonstrated in class. It is sometimes hard to picture on why we use the equations without any actual demonstration on how it is applied in a real experiment, so I am glad that labs are offered in the addition to physics alone. Another take away that I can include is the amount of help that the professor puts in helping us understand how to use some of the equipment that we use. Should be clear that when we are using the equipment, to also follow instructions. Everything that we are given is set up in a way so that it makes our learning experience easy and engaging. One more thing is the time we are given to complete our labs, it takes a lot of stress off when we know that we are given a good amount of time to finish our assignments. And in the time, we can also ask the professor and others for assistance if we are having difficulty understanding a step in the lab."
