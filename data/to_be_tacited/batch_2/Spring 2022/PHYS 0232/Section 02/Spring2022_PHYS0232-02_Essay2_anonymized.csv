2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2839,"I have many different goals in my life. The goal that is closed and that I can complete earlier is the goal of graduating from SFSU and getting my degree as soon as possible. One of my other goals is to be a successful graduate and get a good paying job for me to be able to be financially independent. I think this class will help me with my goals because it will help to look for a way to come up with an answer, and sometimes that is what I need. This class provides essential skills to achieve my goal."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2844,"I am not entirely sure what my goal would be beyond getting my computer science degree. Working with robotics and AI sounds really interesting and fun. This class will help me towards that as we learn about electricity and electric circuits.  I am currently trying to get an internship at NASA and I really hope that I get it. I hope to one day work on rovers that explore other planets. However, I have not had any hands on experience with robotics so I am not sure if I would enjoy it, but I do love to create things."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2846,"My goals that I want to achieve is to be able to work with a well-known company, does not have to be a major company. I just want to be able to work within my field of studies in which is computer science. To be more specific, I am wanting to work more into software development and create programs that can be interactive. For example, being able to create a program for an AI that can communicate with a person. This class might help me in achieving my goal by being able to understand how much energy the AI will need in order to operate in a sufficient way. Also, knowing more than just the basics of physics can help me come up with better programs that can be used to demonstrate how energy flows in space or even be able to simulate the attraction of opposite energy."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2849,"My goal is to trying to help others. Simple but also very complicated since there are a lot of ways to do it and there are a lot of different people that I can try to help. I honestly don't see too much of how physics can really help me besides being a class that I need to take for my degree. However, it doesn't mean physics can't be useful for me because things to come up, whether directly or indirectly, that I would think about something from physics. Voltage is on the more direct things because I handle a lot of devices that need electricity so know what to be care about with voltage is important. More indirect things would be thinking how 2 things might physically impact each other like would putting thing 1 here would cause thing 2 to move in any way and why would it move that way."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2845,"My primary goal in this class is to increase my knowledge. I want to learn the fundamental concepts of Physics, especially regarding electricity, because I am a computer science major. After I graduate, I would like to pursue a career centered around IOTs, or the Internet of Things. This lab allows me to work with circuits hands-on, which is a crucial skill I need to know. I have had the chance to learn some of these concepts on my own. Due to a lack of structure and guidance from instructors, it was hard to follow through. I struggled early on with the class as I was new to in-person labs. However, with time, the improvement is starting to show. Another goal I have set for myself is to try and incorporate critical thinking into my daily routines. To think empirically and to pay attention to detail. Physics is a fantastic way of exercising these qualities. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2847,"This subject assists me in achieving my objectives because Physics teaches us how objects move in the environment by incorporating mathematical principles into everyday actions. And in this class, we're studying how electronics operate and using what we've learned in lectures via hands-on exercises to better comprehend the topic. It assists me in comprehending how stuff would travel in a gaming environment. As a result, even if you ""fake"" the physics in the game, I'll grasp the fundamental ideas and equations. Even if I don't want to work on the physics in my game, you don't always get to choose what you work on in a game, especially when you're first starting out. As a result, physics is certainly useful in achieving my objectives."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2851,"My number one goal is to become a doctor. Obviously becoming a doctor means getting into medical school Similarly, getting into medical school requires excelling in school, most especially in science courses. Physics is science. It is a core science. Much like the rest of my science classes, this is a particularly rigorous course. I need to do well in this course if I want to grasp concepts they will discuss in medical school. Another big thing I must prepare for is the MCAT exam. The MCAT has an entire section dedicated to physics! This is why I take each and every lab as seriously as I possibly can. You never know when a certain question will come up and I want to have decent notes to review when studying. Another goal of mine is to walk through life envisioning how it works. I want to know why the roller coaster spins safely, or why a curveball curves."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2840,The only goal in life that I have right now is to graduate college with a degree and then find a job that is able to provide for me in life. How this class is able to help me with that goal is by allowing me to graduate when I pass the course since this is a required course. Another way that this class can help me with my goal is that it will help me improve my social skills and network myself. I think that the best thing for me to do now that will help me achieve my goals is to talk to other students more so that I can better my social skills and make friends that might help me in my future endeavors.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2850,"My goals during this academic school year are to try my best to learn  and stay motivated as much as I can. The longer I get into the school  year, it feels like more and more work. It's even more frustrating when  you put in the time and the work and you still can't seem to get to know  the subject or fully understand your assignments. Honestly, maybe it's  just me that feels this way but probably not. I'm still gonna do my best  to finish and understand my work. This class will help connect me to my  goals of finishing a mechanical engineer degree. This is the lab class  so this is where we will actually be doing most of the work. Hopefully,  this class will help me understand the concepts of physics better and  help me in the future as well. I am taking this class along with an online course so this is where my hands on learning will be."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2841,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?My goals have not changed from before. I plan to become more self disciplined, work a lot harder than I have before, and pass all my classes even if my grades are not the best. This class can help me better understand physics and allow me to have a better chance at passing my class. I have been making my own efforts at becoming more self disciplined by allowing me some time away from my computer desk and studies just going out and doing physical activity, spend less time playing video games, and eating healthier. My only worry is how long I will stay dedicated, and how my diet is very hard to control because of my love for food."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2843,"My academic goals consist of maintaining good grades, understanding the concepts in my classes, experiencing new technology, and finding ways to become more active as a student or a participant. This class can help me achieve my goals by reiterating concepts that I might have missed in the lectures or even going over topics and formulas that are important to take note of. Since my actual lectures are asynchronous classes, it is hard to get a hold of professors, but this in-person lab, will help me better understand some of the topics I may have not quite understood and allow me to be an active participant. Showing these skills in person will help me communicate better with my professors and help me ask questions when I am confused on certain concepts. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2848,"My literal goals are to graduate with a degree in Marine Biology, and this class is one of the requirements of that major. I believe it is a requirement because understanding physics and how that aspect of science works is a huge part of understanding the ocean and how it interacts with the weather, the tides, and itself. On a more theoretical side of things, my goals are to become a good learner, someone who adapts to different circumstances with ease, and someone who can pick up on different patterns in the world. I think that both of those things will help me in my goals as a person, but also in my academic/career goals. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2842,"My goals are to eventually graduate with a Computer Science degree and get a career in Data Science. This class will help me pursue that goal and succeed at it more successfully because this class will help me work better in groups, something that is very important in computation based areas. Due to my severe anxiety, both socially and in general, working in groups has always been a challenge for me. I'm able to do my part and cooperate with teams, but have a difficult time opening up and starting conversation, as well as sharing my opinions or ideas. As I progress further in this class as well as my career, this is something that I strive to achieve in order to become more successful in my career. In particular, I have been getting better with breaking the ice and brainstorming with my group whenever one us needs assistance. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2838,"I have many goals set for myself. But my ultimate goal at the moment is to finish my education and start my career in computer science. This class is one of my majored required classes so successful completion of this class means me getting one step closer to graduating and finishing my education. That's one of my biggest motivation in this class. Aside from this I'm also excited to learn physics. I feel like I'm more of a visual learner and this class complements that for me. In addition, physics is a universal and is applied in many aspects so it is intriguing to learn. "
