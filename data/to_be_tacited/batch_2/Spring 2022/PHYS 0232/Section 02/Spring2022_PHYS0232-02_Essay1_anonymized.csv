2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2838,"I want to go to STEM field for following reasons: I love to code, design, and solve complex problems. Coding challenges my mind just like puzzle solving would and I enjoy that aspect of it and wanted to make this my career. Even though my main goal is to be business owner but STEM career will help me accomplish that.  Second, STEM fields are extremely lucrative and in high demands. We're not going to stop using technology as a fact our reliance on technology is increasing daily. For example, since the pandemic most infrastructure for work/school was moved online to support day to day activities. With such dependance on technology comes a demand for highly skilled technology professional who are able to maintain, develop or create new systems. Third, being that my major computer science is a very board field. People who major in computer science can do different variety of jobs such as web developers, software developers, team leads, data scientists, and security specialists. That means I will always have options with this degree to switch roles. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2839,"There were different reasons why I decided to go into the STEM field, but the main reason for me was because my sister. My sister is a chemical engineer she graduated from UC Riverside and now has a stable job in San Francisco as engineer. She has really motivated me because she is a women in STEM and women in this field have always been minimized because men don think women can be as efficient as men. I want to be one of those women that come up and show the world that women can be great in a field of STEM and should not be payed less for the same work that a man does. Another this is that I am Mexican and the world of STEM is mostly run by white men, this is something I have been thinking since I started college that I am a minority in STEM, as a woman and a Mexican person so I want  make everyone proud around me by accomplishing and achievement in this STEM path, were I can inspire other girls like me to follow this path were we can show everyone that we are as good as the rest on doing hard work."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2840,"One of the biggest struggles for me is when people ask me, ""Why do you want to be a computer science major?"". I dread going back to Southern California to see my family because the truth is that I'm not even sure as to why I want to go into the stem field. Ever since I've been a young kid, I've always had a natural affinity when it came to technology. I constantly would take things apart just to study the individual pieces and how they would contribute to the function of the device. Once I was done putting it back together, I would take the pieces apart again so that I would be able to put them back together; This is how I spent a lot of my free time. Going back to the original question of 'Why do I want to go into the STEM field?', I want to go into the STEM field because want to get a well paying job that is able to support my family and I."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2841,"I grew up playing video games, there are so many games that shaped my childhood. I want to make games that will shape other peoples childhoods too. A lot of my time is spent on video games, and if computer science is the way to creating video games, I'm going to enter the stem field no matter how long it takes me. I don't have much tenacity to sit through a bunch of courses and not give up, I've done that before in many classes, such as almost every calculus class I've taken, and my last physics class, but honestly if I don't try to do more than my best, then I will worry even further about my own future. My future is one of the biggest things I worry about, like what will happen if I don't get a job by a certain age, will I be smart enough to do my job and so on. Taking these classes will help me have self discipline since I'd have to spend more time doing less of what I like, despite the process being really tedious and boring. That means that If I make it through a bunch of these classes with a good understanding of most things, I will be able to handle what comes later."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2842,"I want to go into the STEM field because I have always been interested in science, how the world works, and how we continue to develop advancements in science and technology to develop further as a species. One of the reasons I am a computer science major is because I want to have a deep understanding of technology, as it will continue to advance even further and I believe it is important to know the effect it has on society as a whole. I also enjoy working extensively on problems and developing solutions to them, as well as spend my free time using my knowledge to work on personal projects. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2843,"I wanted to go into the STEM field because it was a route that seemed stable and fit my characteristics as a person. Specifically, I am on the engineering route, and I was honestly nervous to go into the medical field ever since I was a kid so I didn’t pursue those areas. As a sociable person that is not afraid to get their hands dirty, I found civil engineering (construction management) to be a fit that would work for me in the future and with what I want to pursue. Being able to be in this field also challenges me, as this is a predominantly male type industry. By allowing myself to network and become closer to this community, it is so nice to perform with people that have the same drive and work ethic as me. Using my time as a student to be officers in clubs, work for the engineering department, and get an internship over the summer is very exciting for me and I can’t wait."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2844,"I want to go into the STEM field to challenge my brain and help enhance people's lives by developing programs that provide a service to them. I am not entirely sure what I would like to focus on specifically though. Robotics sounds fun to me and has always been something I was interested in. Electronics and circuits are very interesting and it is fun to make things work mechanically. I have never tried it, but I would love to build something and program it to perform a task. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2845,"There were a variety of factors that influenced my decision to join the STEM field. By the time I was about to graduate from high school, I had not given what I wanted my major to be much thought. I had formed a good relationship with our computer lab director. He suggested I look into the field of Computer Science. After looking through a few sites that described the field, I found endless YouTube videos on learning all these programming languages and how to build everything from apps to sites and everything in between. I saw the power in it and that the only barrier apart from the learning curve was my imagination. After transferring to the States, I quickly learned that the field was very Math intensive, which was kind of a discouraging revelation since math was not my strong suit. After a few Math semesters and one Physics semester, I started to not only see the significant contributions from these fields, but also the power in them. I didn’t struggle with these fields because of their difficulty, but rather due to a lack of genuine effort on my part. After a few bumpy roads, I saw the linear relation between my skills and the amount of time I spent practicing the problems. Not only did STEM help develop my quantitative reasoning skills, but I learned a valuable life lesson. If I put in the time towards these subjects, I would be rewarded with skills that not only help me tackle problems better, but also help me make critical decisions with rational approaches. I would conclude by saying the reason I want to go into the STEM field is to be a better person, and the critical skills this field provides are unparalleled.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2846,"The reason why I got into the STEM field was to learn about computers and how they work in everyday life. I was introduced to a computer in my earlier life when I was in my final years of elementary school but never thought of it as much. When I started my first years in middle school, I was shown how to mess with robotics, but it was a simple layout to help understand what goes on in the computer. Once I got into high school, I was shown how to create my own website in which helped me pursue my passion in computers. I later decided that computer science might be an interesting path to take and being able to take the class I found that it was something that I really enjoyed doing in the aspect of coding. Not so much in the theory part but there will always be times that I would need to understand the theory behind computers."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2847,"When I was in high school, I became interested in the STEM feild. I was enrolled in the ITA (Information Technology Academy) program, where I learned about coding, game development, and graphic design. I'd say I fell in love with it; that's when I decided on my major; actually, it was during my junior year that I knew it's the field I wanted to work in. I have no clue where I am heading from here,  though I am still figuring out what my ideal or target job is. I believe I will continue in the STEM sector, either in graphic design or in the gaming section. Most likely, I'll stick to making a game. I can imagine myself creating video game characters or creating games for people to play. Plus, I've always wanted to do something that I'd like, that was creative, and that I'd never get tired of. The concept of creating a game has far too many applications for me to list, and I don't see me leaving this sector anytime soon. I've often pondered what would happen if this or that happened in a video game instead of in real life. I'm completely enthralled with the notion."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2848,"I want to go into the stem field because I think science is a very important part of our development as a civilization. I am a Marine Bio major, so my work would be specifically in the ocean and how that related too scientific discoveries. I do believe that all aspects of science are important, but working in or near the ocean sounds like an amazing job, and one that I would like to do as I grow. I started out at SFSU as a Chemistry major, and although I still think that is a greta major, I think marine bio is a bit better for me. I wanted to be a science teacher when I was a chem major, because I had such amazing science teachers in high school and middle school who helped me learn how important science and research/discovery was. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2849,"I wanted to go to the STEM field because my biggest academic strengths were in math and science. In choosing the field to go into, I wanted it to be something that I has the capability to do well in. Also, I enjoy the problem solving aspects of math and science problems so that also lends to why I choose this field because I wanted to also enjoy the work I was doing. These 2 reasons would be the main reasons to why I choose to pursue something STEM related."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2850,"Why  do I want to go into the STEM field? Ever since I was a child, I  have always enjoyed playing video games. I've always been fascinated by  robotics and mechanics like when it comes to cars or robots. I would say  I first became interested in STEM when I got to middle school. In middle  school, I enrolled in the engineering academy because I thought I would  learn about robotics or mechanics. That year I learned a lot about  computers, robots, and 3d design which got me interested in the STEM  field. Since 7th grade, I have been in engineering courses every of high  school. During high school, I attended multiple engineering summer  camps to become more familiar with the field. I learned so much about  design and robotics and I think it's something that I want to pursue in  the future. Now I am currently enrolled in classes that will help me  graduate with a mechanical engineering degree"
