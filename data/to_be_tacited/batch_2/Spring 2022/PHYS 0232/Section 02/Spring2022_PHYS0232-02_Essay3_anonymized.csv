2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2844,"What is electrical resistance and how do I experience it in my daily life?The resistance of a wire or component indicates how difficult it is to transfer current through it. It is measured in Ohms. Things that can affect the resistance of a component are the length of the wire, the temperature of it, and the material it is made out of. Essentially, the higher the resistance, the more power you will need for your circuit. We have not explored impedance yet, but it is quite similar to resistance, however there are a few key differences. Impedance applies to AC currents only and includes resistance and reactance. All headphones have a certain impedance. The impedance varies from headphone to headphone. Typical earbuds that you get with your phone are around 30 - 40 ohms. These are relatively easy to power and can be properly driven off of a phone's headphone jack. Many higher end headphones have a higher impedance. Some even up to 600 ohms and beyond. The higher impedance does not designate the audio quality and should not be a way to check if a headphone is good or not, but it will determine if you need a headphone amplifier. The amplifier pushes more power to the headphones than your phone or laptop would be able to."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2840,"Question: How might capacitors be used to their fullest extent to help improve people's lives and benefit society?One way that capacitors can be used to improve people lives is that they can store power. Using capacitors and batteries allows people to use electrical potential energy. We learned that lowering the distance, thanks to the potential difference equation, we can increase the amount of charge that the capacitor can hold. I think that if electrical engineers were able to find the most efficient way to store energy, we can overall lower the amount of energy that people use on a daily basis.Another way that capacitors can be used is to power magnets. How magnets work is that electricity is used to flow through special wires that causes the wires to create a magnetic field. Therefore, more efficient capacitors are able to create stronger magnets with less energy. This can help society cut down on energy that is being used inefficiently. One recent advancement that is attributed to magnets is trains. Many modern trains are no longer using steam or coal to power the locomotive. Magnets are being used to hover the train over the track so that there is less friction. This means that the train is able to move faster using less energy."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2838,"There are several topics we covered in class that are generally applicable to daily lives. For example, today we did an experiment where we applied ohm’s laws. The experiment involved setting up cables and connecting them to positive and negative batteries respectively to observe the bulb’s lightning. Similarly, we use many electronic devices that use batteries and each time we must make sure the batteries are connected to right signs so that the power supply works.Furthermore, another good example we can look at is insulators and conductors. Insulators are materials that are not good at transferring electricity while the opposite is true for conductors. These materials are used commonly in areas dealing with electricity and purpose. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2848,"My question that I have based on my notes is: What is the difference between parallel and series circuits? In a parallel circuit, the voltage running through the wires meets a point and can either go to one capacitor, this is because electrons can only flow in one direction out of the battery, they cannot backtrack. Any charge that goes through one capacitor cannot go through the other. This concept was demonstrated in the lab today, with lightbulbs in a circuit. the voltage running through one lightbulb was the same as the other one. For capacitors in parallel, the value of Ceq = sum of C's.In a series circuit, the capacitors are connected in a straight line, one after the other. Every charge that goes through one capacitor has to go through the other capacitor. This is because there is nowhere else in the circuit for the electrons to flow, and they can't go backward under these circumstances. For capacitors in series, the value of 1/Ceq = sum of 1/C's. This is helpful to understand because this practice and information is used every day by electricians and people who are installing light switches in their houses. Most light switches in houses are run in parallel because the light output doesn't dim the farther you get down the wire. Every light gets the same amount of electricity. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2839,"A lab that made me  a lot was this most recent one specially the part where we had to connect the mini light bulb to the battery. It reminded me to a time when I was younger, I remember my mom used to have a really hold Honda civic and many times when we took to long to cross the border from Tijuana to san Diego the cars batter would die and we had to ask someone fro help that could help us pass electricity from their car to ours. I remember that the battery from the cars was exactly like the battery we used in the lab, just way bigger. The cable that we would use to run electricity from one car to another had to red crocodile clamps and two black ones, one of each for each battery. Thats the first thing that came to my mind when we were doing this experiment this is something almost everyone that drives standard car has done at least once in their lives."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2851,"How do forces affect the way we move throughout the day? I wanted to discuss the way our spines react to Earth’s gravitational pull. I read that in space since there is no gravity, the spinal discs are able to hold more spinal fluid. This is why some astronauts are so tall! They have great posture too. Meanwhile here on Earth, a large portion of our human population has god-awful posture- me included. People with bad posture often get back pain. This is caused by the constant pressure of gravity that is distributed directly onto the lower back because the spine is too relaxed. We must adhere to the correct forces of our bodies in order to stand upright and lead a healthy life with no back issues. "
