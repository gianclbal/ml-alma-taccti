2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2847,"Returning to in-person communication is definitely something to get accustomed to. I last took an in-person class in junior year, during the second semester. And this is the first semester I'm taking classes in person. When taking in-person classes, you must account for travel time, but it was a little more difficult to grasp the material we were studying to understand the ideas in some of my seminars. For example, in my lab class last semester, we conducted the lab assignments through simulation, and sometimes there would be technical errors, making it even more difficult to understand. So, with that in mind, I'm pleased we're back in person.The point is, while presenting a presentation online, you don't see anyone's eyes gazing at you, thus it's simpler to give a presentation from someone who has difficulty making presentations. And I used to be worried and terrified of making presentations in high school Spanish classes or other classes, so I was starting to get used to it. But now I'm back to being nervous and scared of giving presentations. I used to have trouble talking to strangers; now it's even more difficult because it's been so long since I've socialized, counting out  the individuals I already knew. On the one hand, this experience had shaped me into a person who will speak to anyone if I have anything to say or if the opportunity arises. But I'm not sure if I'm more open or closed off."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2849,"In-person classes have helped me a lot in terms of learning in class. There is a lot less to be distracted by and it's easy to find my point of focus because at home, it's easier to find something else to do. Additionally, in-person classes are helping me plan better because it makes me think of the whole day because my in-person classes have me stay most of the day on campus. It makes sure I have a plan for meals when that isn't something I really focus on when I have class at home. Looking at this, being given structure that I have from in-person class has helped me being able to manage time together. I'm not spending too much time not doing anything because that has been as issue from online classes. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2846,"For most of the classes that I am taking in person, I am only taking two but the transition from online to in person has made it a bit better for my well-being. The reason being, that I have been able to have more social interaction with my classmates that have benefitted me in my work. I have been able to get together with my classmates and discus homework we struggle in. The transition has also made it easier for me to stay active while attending my classes, since being fully online really accumulates by time and makes you feel less engaging in class in my opinion. My learning experience has been better, in the sense that I have been more engaged and have been more interested in learning material. The only concern I have is the new variant that has been talked about after covid 19 but for other reasons I have none at the moment."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2850,"I think transitioning from zoom/online learning has impacted my learning quite a bit. As for sell care, I don't really do anything as I almost have no free time in my day. My day starts at 6:30 and I have to leave at 7:15 to catch a bus at 7:20 to take me to another bus stop to take a bus to San Francisco. After all that I have to take the muni from the Bart station to the campus. Coming home takes even longer as it is about 2 hours and 20-30 minutes. Given the time I am wasting on commuting everyday, I don't have a lot of time for self care or self learning. I think the learning environment in person is better as we can talk to our classmates easier and ask the instructors any questions we have, but I feel that most classes up until now where not very complicated online. I don't have any concerns for in person learning, only the fact that I don't have very much time to study when I get home for 6 different classes which include physics, calculus III, Statics, and Engineering materials. As for self care, there's not really much I can do. I get about 7 hours of sleep usually for a 17 hour day so I just have to deal with the struggles and get past them."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2845,"Transitioning to in-class learning has been hard for me. It has had a positive and a negative effect on me. One of the main reasons is because of my living location and transportation. It takes me around 2 hours every day to come to school and 2 hours to get back home. Every day is 4-hour transportation in total, and that is something that drains me daily. That is time I could spend utilizing effectively like studying more, but it's not something I could change due to rent being even more expensive the closer I am to school. So I could say that this has negatively affected me. A positive way that this has affected me is I now have more opportunities to spend time with friends. Before all of this, I would spend about 90% of my time by myself since I would not go out because of the virus. The only times I would go out was when I needed to go grocery shopping. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2848,"I think transitioning to classes in person has helped my learning a lot. It is very easy to get distracted by things going on outside of the zoom meeting when you are at home trying to learn. In the classroom environment it is a nearly distraction free area, making it much easier to learn and focus on the topics being taught. Although there are certain positives to online learning, I believe that overall i can learn better and focus easier during in person lectures and labs. On the note of self care, I am giving myself more leeway when it comes to assignments. I still get all my work done on time, but I ""allow"" myself to take more time to finish assignments, and try and focus my attention to the most important topics and subjects on my to-do list of tasks. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2842,"The transition from online learning to in person has helped me tremendously. Being physically present and in the moment generally helps me not drift off as much (I have ADHD and despite medication, I still find myself doing this at times) as well as generally makes me more motivated to learn. In terms of self care, I try to focus on managing my extreme anxiety and susceptibility to overstimulation as well as learn how to deal with stress more effectively, as stress tends to have a detrimental effect on my mental health, ability to sleep, and performance in school as a whole. Something that I struggle with is my very low self esteem (something I battle everyday) which generally gets worse when I am not in a learning environment with other people so I'm hoping that COVID will not force us to have to return to online learning again this year. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2843,"PHYS 232 Lab Reflection 	 	 		 			 				 					 						Transitioning to in person classes has been a difficult process from not being in the classrooms for so long. I am a very hands on person, so the idea of going up to professors or being able to talk to my classmates has been super helpful, but creating routines for myself to present nicely in public. I have been trying really hard to give myself time to focus on me and my studies since I am an outgoing person that loves to connect with people. My social battery can also die easily and im trying to listen to my body when it has had enough interactions for the day. I also want to be able to workout again and be strict with those practices because it has helped me but since i was traveling over break and the week after, I need to get back into those practices.  					 				 			 		"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2839,"My experience going back to in class learning was really awkward because I knew my class mates just by their voice because in most of my classes we have  discord group, so when one of us needed help we would make a call and help each other no camera on just screen sharing. When we were told hat it was time to come back I was kind of nervous because it felt like the first day of college again. The one thing I was actually glad was that I had my friends from last semester so I was not feeling so overwhelmed knowing that they felt the same way. So I am glad I was able to make friends last semester because usually I would get to know someone and then after that semester we would stop talking to each other because we had no classes or major in common. Some concerns that I have is that I feel that I forgot how to study for quizzes/exams because when we were online professors would let us use our notes but now its different because it feels like they took everything always from us in the way that is only closed book exams/quizzes. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2838,"My transition to in-person classes was in two phases. In phase 1, I felt different about being on campus. There was a strange feeling of newness and disorientation being on campus since its my first in-person semester in 2 years. Phase 1 took some getting used. However, in phase 2, I feel comfortable. I look forward to being on campus and attending class every week. I enjoy the social interactions with fellow students. Even though there are some pros of online classes I miss but I think nothing beats in-person classes. They are better value overall but there should be equal number of online and in-person classes to accommodate all students.As far as self-care goes, my prime focus is on my health and my goals. I'm eating better, exercising regularly, and keeping up with my priorities with solid balance. My emphasis is on my well-being and my goals which are better money management and finishing up school by next Spring. So far things have been going in right direction and I'm making steady progress and hope to complete this journey successfully. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2844,"I think that transitioning to in person class has greatly improved both my own productivity and my ability to actually learn the material. When learning from home it is so much easier to get distracted and to not pay attention to a lecture or procrastinate on doing homework. However, this does not seem to be as much of an issue for me anymore when in class. It is far easier to actually pay attention to the lecture and learn the material. The only downside to having in person classes is that I have to commute to school every day. This becomes very tiring and expensive since I have a long commute. I practice self care by giving myself breaks in studying to do things that I enjoy. I also have been going on walks every week to clear my mind and to reset whenever I become too stressed. I worry that if I become too stressed I will burn out and will not be able to perform my best in my academics."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2840,"I would say that transitioning to in-person classes have positively impacted my learning because when classes were online, the teachers would always record the lectures. I would not go to class and tell myself that I would just watch all of the lectures when I woke up. I never did and this would cause me to have to cram more of my studies into a couple of days. This would cause me to not sleep for long periods of time. Not to mention that simply being around others and talking to others has have a positive effect on my well-being. Most people in a zoom classroom would not be interacting with the other students unless prompted by the breakout rooms function. What I am doing for self-care is taking walks so that I would spend time outside instead of being indoors all day. As for what concerns I have for my learning and well-being, I would say that my only concern is whether or not I'll be able to finish school in the allotted time."
