Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2916,"Reflection #1Since I was a child, STEM subjects have always interested me. I always wanted to know how the world and the universe worked. When I was learning musical instruments in grade school, learning about the physics of the instruments’ sounds would give me a deeper understanding of the music I was learning. I realized from a very early age that using STEM could help me actually achieve my creative goals and I started to use math to build projects and use basic chemistry to make my job as a dishwasher much easier. As I grew older I had met an employee from Google who once said to not ask a child what they want to be when they grow up but instead ask what problem they want to solve and what they need to learn to solve it. This person's quote reinforced my idea that learning STEM could help me throughout my life. In high school, I thought that learning code could help me develop tools for the community that makes their lives easier. To this day I have many ideas I want to fulfill and learning STEM is helping them become true."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2917,"I first chose to pursue a degree in STEM because I thought I would have the highest job security. That I would always be able to get hired relatively quickly and thought this today was aside from most other degree options. I then pick engineering was because, I thought at least, it was the most broad, where it includes Math and Sciences but is not a hardcore on either. On top of that I went into computer engineering because I see the future being heavy online. I also got into coding late in high school and found I was able to sit in front of a scene for long periods of time coding as long as I had music playing in the background. After a couple years studying STEM I find it more important than previously thought, the fact that the world we live in is not due to Counties and/or political leaders. It is built today as we see because of engineers, mathematicians, and scientists. And I think that is very cool on top of the career path I wish to follow."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2918,"Why do I want to be part of STEM? I want to be a part of the stem field because I have been interested in those topics all my life. I always found myself watching youtube videos about stem-related topics and learning about them. My family is also very involved in stem and that influenced me to continue to study it in college. My current major is electrical engineering. I decided to choose the major because I had a class in high school that is all about breadboarding and the use of a microcontroller. This class along with my experience in working with computers all throughout my youth and building computers piqued my interest in picking electrical engineering. Electrical engineering has been interesting and fun and extremely challenging all at different times throughout my college experience. However, learning more about it reminds me why I want to be stem and that this is the field that I like and works best for me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2919,"My major is Computer Science.Math has been challenging but mostly fun for me. I love being able to solve problems and get that ""eurika"" moment. I've also enjoyed playing with and learning about technology, especially now more than ever since I've built my own PC. So I put the few fields I enjoy together and now I'm on a path to coding. It is fun, interactive, and the puzzle solving (at least that's how I see writing code) is extremely satisfying when it all works out. Other than that, the career is diverse and salary is high.I also would like to become a teacher, most likely on a high school level, later on in life. Other than just the study of math and computers, I enjoy explaining these concepts to others. Furthermore, I find peace when I help others, and I will feel fulfilled helping students especially since they'll be the most vulnerable in terms of growing up and in the period for adolescence."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2920,"I want to go into the STEM field because from a young age I have always been into creating and building. Throughout my years in middle school and high school, I have always excelled in the math and science subjects, so when I transitioned into college I decided to stick to what I am roughly good and something I am passionate about. I know through STEM I will be able to create and innovate one day. I am specifically majoring in civil engineering to one day go into environmental engineering. I believe I have a lot to offer and I can bring in new ideas to this field. I know this a male dominate field which to am extent  discouraged me from even going into this field. However I will not let that stop me from one day becoming an engineer. I know that through this field I will be able to purse my dreams to innovate and create. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2921,"The reason why I want to go into the stem field is because I feel like the sciences have a lot of applications to real life. For example, engineers develop new medical devices, robotics, and automobiles. Even non-stem careers might even use some form of math and science. For example, highway patrol police officers can use calculus to approximate the speed a driver was going at a specific time to determine whether or not they were speeding. The reason why I wanted to go into STEM specifically is because math and science have always been my best subjects. I went into Mechanical Engineering specifically because of how often it's used in everyday life since it deals with engines or other things in motion. I also like this field of engineering compared to other fields such as Electrical or Computers is because the things you develop are more physical than conceptual."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2922,"Why I chose STEM field is that growing up, I realized I was good at Science and Math, and really bad at other stuff, so something in the field might work for me. I didn't picked up interesting hobbies like writing poems or drawing, but I was always enjoy building stuff with legos, or disassembling broken devices like a radio, so by the time to choose a field to work on, it's an easy choice of being an Engineer. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2923,"There are many reasons as to why I want to go into the STEM field. One of the main reasons why I want to go into that field is because I love technology. Playing around with computers is what really got me into technology. I want to be able to innovate existing technology or make new things. I want to be able to make a difference in someone’s life and I know technology has the capability to do that. I can actually see this when I work at Apple. There are a lot of people who depend on technology and I want to be there to either help them through solving their issues or making the technology that they are using. I also love to solve problems. Yes, in every field there is a problem to be solved. I just like solving issues in regards to technology. Usually problems with technology are challenging and exciting too. I am just a big tech fan."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2924,"I want to go into the STEM field because I really enjoy studying physics. Even though it can be tough computationally, I still love reading about physics and learning about many amazing things of our physical world."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2925,"My reasons for wishing to go into the STEM field, are more so matters of practicality rather than passion. My passion lies within the fields of the creative and performing arts. I love acting and making movies. My goal in life is to be an established actor, and possibly filmmaker. It was my parents who told me I should strive to have a job that can give me enough income so that I am not struggling in the pursuit of my dreams. Being an actor is hard, a lot of luck is part of it. I have already began writing the screenplay for my first movie. I have a lot of confidence in it being a movie that will touch many people's hearts. I think it would be much harder to successfully produce the movie, if I myself am struggling to have a job or source of income. This is why I chose to major in Computer Science. Tons of job opportunity, and I can basically live anywhere in the world that I want. If I go into a computer science involved job after college, it is not my plan to stay in it long term. It is just my source of support. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2926,"I have always wanted to work with technology and to know what makes mechanical and electrical devices work since I was young. However over the years I started getting tired of the math and school in general so I lost my motivation, this made it  frustrating to be in STEM and I started having second thoughts. So in my first years in community college I started avoiding the department in the hopes that while taking the GE classes something would catch my attention. None did, it made college even more disinteresting. Toward the end of my second year though I started noticing a lot of new advancements on the STEM field. Specially the advancements in cars tugged at my enthusiasm for cars. Not only that but hearing of Akon city got me thinking of third world places that are behind in tech, being an African I understand what it is to live there and there are many places without power, water and any shape of modern infrastructure. Sheer ambition is what got me back into STEM, after all STEM is what keeps the world moving so I wanted to be part of it even more so now than before. Though the courses will only get harder I have just made up mind to see them as tools for the future instead of classes I have to pass for a degree. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2927,Originally I wanted to get into the STEM field because I wanted to become a programmer. To become a programmer I decided I would major in Computer Science. At San Francisco State University to major in computer science you must take a couple physics courses. Last semester I was in physics 220 and I learned a lot more about the subject and it helped me better understand the world around me. After that course I’ve been a lot more interested in the subject and I am looking forward to this course as well as the labs. Last semester my labs were all online and I did not enjoy them as much as physical labs I have done in the past. I am really looking forward to the in person section of this course as I haven’t done a lab in person since highschool. I believe in person labs are more engaging and easier to follow.
