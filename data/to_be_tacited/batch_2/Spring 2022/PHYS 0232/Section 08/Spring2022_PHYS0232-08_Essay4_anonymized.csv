2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2921,"Before the pandemic, I never realized how important in person classes could be for my ability to concentrate in class. When the quarantine first began, I liked the idea of being able to attend class from home. Since I had been waking up early every week for the past couple of years in order to commute to school, the idea of being able to wake up five minutes before the start of class and still be on time felt like a dream. Furthermore, since most teachers did not require us to turn on cameras, I often found myself logging into class and then falling back asleep right after. Although this gave me a rest from commuting everyday, this did not do me good in the long run as I developed a habit of sleeping in instead of being productive. However, with the transition into online classes, I find that I'm able to be more productive."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2925,"Transitioning to in person classes has by far benefitted my learning. Being online made it very difficult to stay motivated. Online learning lacked the social aspects of in person classes. I felt disconnected from the professor, the course, and my peer. This semester was my return to in person, and it has made me feel better. I hope that masks go away for the next semester. Self care is something that I take seriously and has become a more prominent part of my daily routine since covid. I go to the the gym about 5-6 times a week. This along with maintaining a healthy diet has been a crucial part in my well being. I find that if I have a difficult day at school, going to the gym afterwards helps me take out stress and also reset my mind. My ability to complete assignments correctly and score higher grades on tests, goes up significantly when I am in a routine of constant exercise. I think that relaxing is also an important part of self care. Right now I am watching game of thrones. It is a nice show to watch after hours of doing school work, or being at school. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2926,Learning the flow of magnetic force through practically drawing and measuring the magnetic lines was much easier to learn. The concept of true north was easier to learn also with the use of an actual needle compass. It was interesting to see the compass' north be affected by the presence of magnets as well. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2916,"Transitioning to in-person classes has been a Bittersweet experience. On one hand I am glad that I'm able to interact with students and professors in person and not have to worry about the delay of  interacting through email. I like being able to ask the professor questions in class and to get feedback or help sooner. On the other hand I feel like it's more difficult because I have to take more time to get to class thus reducing the amount of time that I have in the day. Through taking online classes during the pandemic I have learned many skills such as time management and how to communicate with people who are not in your immediate vicinity. One of the things I have been doing to manage the transition is to batch all my errands and tasks into similar categories so that I can get them done more efficiently rather than switching to different tasks In a chaotic way like I have done before. In the transition from online to in- person classes, one way that the instructors and professors can help me and other students is to allow the students to attempt practice problems on the board and get immediate feedback and instruction so that we can learn more efficiently. Although at first I was weary of online classes I saw the strengths in it and found that having some classes in person and some online helps my productivity in other areas of my life. I now have the ability to allow time for myself and my social life because of my new hybrid schedule. I believe that the pandemic has brought questions about the future of Education; however, I believe that these questions will  lead to advancements in different ways in which students learn and maintain their mental health. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2923,"The transition to in person classes has impacted my learning even if I say online and in-person are the same thing. In person classes have enhanced my learning experience by bringing interactions into the mix. When you are online, it is very rare for people to respond. When you are in person, we are forced to interact but it brings about something that online classes can never achieve. I am exercising and going out more for self care. I still sleep the same exact hours I was when we were online, which is bad. This is because I sleep late and wake up early. I also talk and play games with friends when I can. My only concern for my learning is how long can I keep up the work since I have to commute at least 25 to 30 minutes one way everyday for school. For my well-being, I am just concerned if I am sleeping enough and exercising enough. The pandemic really affected my physical health as I don’t sleep enough and my drive to exercise as repeating the same thing over and over can get boring."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2922,"I really enjoyed the transaction from remote to in person classes. The first I noticed  is that I have become more physically healthy, back then I spent most of the day sitting in my room for online classes that I started to lack physical exercise and not having a reason to go outside makes it worse. Now that were in person,  I have to get up early walk to the Bart and walk around campus keeps me physically active and I have notice that Im actually loosing weight in the process. Another factor is the mental and social aspects, having to interact with people compared to just listening online really makes a difference with the mental health."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2918,"Transitioning to in-person classes has been all-around amazing for me. Online classes when they first came around were super difficult for me to adjust to. I could not find any way to focus on my own living environment. I found myself getting so distracted by my environment and everything I had around me to touch and enjoy. And on top of the fact that I was in such an enjoyable and would I say too comfortable of an environment, I also had the option to turn the camera off. That way I had no teacher or anyone to call me out if I am distracted or on my phone and the environment is just way too comfortable. However, throughout the course of having online classes and did grow and develop and was able to work with online classes better. But, it still would not compare to the consistency and the focus and feeling of going to in-person classes could ever reach."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2917,"Learning in person have most definitely needed a rearrangement and has changed my approach to some classes. For example in this class I have never before been a in college level lab corse before, and it has definitely help me learn more tangible information that is already in physics. I can also find that in some lecture classes however when some class I much prefer in person classes where the professor can better explain and/or interact with students for a better learning experience. But I find in some other courses like where the class is thought in mostly lecture sides with a lot of words on said lecture it is better for me online as during class I can easily access the lecture sides and have recordings of the class. I was also a little more convenient online but I understand that you have leave your house some times. For self-care I just try to take some days off, and try not to think about any classes I have. As some courses I am currently taking are a little confusing for me I find that not thinking about them for a while helps me better understand them later, gives me less stress, and I don’t get as much headaches."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2920,"The transition to in-person classes has definitely been a struggle. As we spent almost 4 semesters completely online, I became accustomed to recorded lectures and some more leniency for the most part from my professors. However online learning did take a toll on my mental health. It was very hard staring at a computer screen for 8+ hours a day. It just felt like a never-ending loop. I feel like the transition to in-person classes has been good for me. I have been able to take more responsibility for my school work. I am required to show up, and missing one class is missing so much. I can't rely on recordings anymore, so I pay even more attention to all my classes. It has also been nice seeing my peer's faces and connecting with them. It has improved and helped how me learn and retain information. The only downside for me is that as a commuter it can get a bit exhausting, while I can take every precaution to show up to my classes and on time, due to circumstances I cannot control I have missed some classes and I was late to a midterm. Overall the transition has been good for me and I look forward to seeing how my skills will continue to improve. A self-care practice I have picked up on has been exercising and going to the gym. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2919,"In person classes provided me a strict but set schedule on what to achieve for the week. It has helped me become productive, and lessen stress and anxiety with structure. Although I prefer the freedom offered by online or asynchronous classes, in person classes help me with discipline."
