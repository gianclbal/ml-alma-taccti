2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2920,"My goal is to one day be a successful woman in STEM. I hope to become an environmental engineer one day after I graduate in the near future. In all my STEM classes I have been struggling, so a more concrete and obtainable goal for me is just to pass my classes, while also improving my skills and retaining information. The way this class will and has helped me obtain this goal is through group work and discussions with my peers. Physics 230 has been very difficult for me to understand, and it's being online has made it even harder. I don't really talk to any of my peers there. However when I come to this class, which is in person, where we work in groups, and where the work is tangible. This class has helped me understand my physics classes and I have so far kept a good grade in that class."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2916,"Reflection #2One of my main goals is to become a software developer. I feel like this class will help me with my goals by helping me understand how electricity and furthermore how computers work. I feel like electricity and hardware are something that is overlooked in software development because most of the focus is on software. Many people from the outside view people who are good with software as people who are also good with hardware. If a problem needs to be solved it is very helpful if a person knows both parts of a computer because there would be no hardware without software and vice versa. Another thing physics can help me with is to create new input and output devices for computers instead of staying within the confines of just a mouse, keyboard, and monitor. To Summarize, I expect this class to help me expand my problem solving abilities and the ability to apply my new knowledge to things I am passionate about."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2926,"My goals for attending this class are, to be able to understand concepts of physics in practicality through this lab class. I think it is very important for students to have hands on experience of the physics lessons in lab, this helps get our hands dirty and prepares students for use of equipment. Especially myself as a person I always like to practice and work with my hands in order to completely understand a lesson, I think its because laboratories give complicated looking arithmetic and theories a more real life feel and makes them relevant in a way. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2917,"For goal that I can say that I have for my life outside this class is to be able and get a good job as a software engineer hopefully here in San Francisco. This class can really help into getting closer to that as firstly this class will help me get my degree but beyond that I think learning something I don’t understand is an essential skill for future success in any software engineer position Im lucky enough to land. And this class definitely falls under things I don’t understand, or at least fully understand, as I am pretty good with the math side of physics but what really troubles me is the application of formulas, laws, and set ups. So this class more than the lecture part is really helpful for me to get past that. After these past couple weeks I definitely think that I have been improving in this area.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2921,"My academic goal is to succeed in college by achieving high grades and an above 3.5 GPA throughout my 4 to 5 years here at San Francisco State. Additionally, during my time here, I also want to pursue extracurricular activities and organizations such as the American Society of Engineers and the Solar Electric Vehicle Team. By getting high grades and being involved in these types of organizations, I hope to build an effective resume that will help me attain a stable, well-paying job that I enjoy. This class in particular is crucial for helping me succeed in my goals because the major that I am currently pursuing, which is called Mechanical Engineering, is heavily involved with physics. By taking this class, I am setting the foundation of the necessary knowledge that I need to know in order to achieve the goals that I mentioned earlier in this reflection."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2922,"My goals is to be successful at the profession that I want in. And one of the knowledge and skills I need to be successful is the skill to analyze and understand what' going on around me. By studying physics and experimenting on its labs, will help me understand the concepts that are fundamental in this world."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2918,"My major personal goal at this moment and place in my life is to complete college. I want to finish college and get my degree in electrical engineering. Electrical engineering is a lot to learn and a lot of it can be very difficult to learn as well. On top of that, there is a lot of work attached to the already difficult content. So this class is a requirement for my degree which literally help complete my goal of finishing my degree in electrical engineering. However, I think it is more than that. I think classes like these can show me how to use group work, balance a workload, and how to ask questions, This might sound all rudimentary but it is an extremely useful tool that this class helps teach me to utilize which I can then use in completing my goal."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2925,"This semester my main goal has been to make sure that I am good at time management. Taking 2 asynchronous classes and 3 in person classes is a lot to take on, especially as a computer science major. But it is my goal to ensure I get my work done for every class. It is difficult keeping up with deadlines when we are online. It is much easier to do this with in person classes. This class can help me because if I get the labs done early I have more time to start working on homework for other classes. Another goal of mine is to improve my writing style, and these reflections are a good way to practice that. I have other classes where we have to write responses to prompts, and these reflections are a good way to practice that. This is very similar to the free writes I have to do in my social justice class. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2923,"My goals are to be able to pass these physics classes and  have a successful career in the technology space. I also want to be able to learn new things. This class can help me achieve these goals by helping me better understand the material we learn in the classes. I notice that with labs, I understand the material even more since we do things hands on while also showing that the material we learned in class is relevant to real life. It is hard for me to interpret the things we learn in class if I cannot see it in action. This class can also help me achieve my goals by teaching me concepts I will need for future classes that lead up to my goals. I know a couple of classes that have this as a prerequisite. This class will teach me other stuff besides physics that will set me up for future success."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2927,My goals are to understand every topic in physics 230 and expand my knowledge. These are my goals because I want to use this knowledge to help with future programming projects and further understanding of the world around me. My goals for this class will allow me to enjoy the in-lab experiments while simultaneously learning as much physics as I can. I want to get a complete understanding of physics topics by observing it in the lab. This lab will allow me to get hands-on experience in a lab which personally further enhances my understanding of physics because I can manipulate the experiment. I have been attending SFSU for 3 years but this will be my first in-person lab on campus and I haven’t been in a lab since my junior year of highschool. Labs have always been a highlight of school because it helps my understanding and I remember lab experiments.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2919,"First and foremost, this class is a mandatory class for me to get my degree. It is required along with calculus I & II, which I took already, and physics I. Other than that, physics is a very fitting subject to take because it is in line with what I like, math, and also applies logic and explanations to the world. At a basic level, it uses the language of calc, which is what I aim to teach in the future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2924,"One of my goals is to get experience on lab experiments and procedures. I want to experience researching in a lab and what it would be like to research something or conduct and experiment and record your observations, then analyze those observations. This class will help me achieve my goals because we perform many different labs on different topics while also learning about the concept."
