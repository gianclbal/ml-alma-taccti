2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2923,"How are car headlights so bright? Well to answer this question, we turn to chapters 9 and 10. Chapter 9 focuses on current and resistance while chapter 10 focuses on direct-current (DC) circuits. We know that there are different wattages of lightbulbs being sold. The higher the wattage, the more power the lightbulb uses. This also means the lightbulb gets brighter as power increases. Power plays a role in the brightness of headlights, but how does it get this power? We turn to circuits. Circuits can have resistors to limit voltage spikes. If the resistors are put into a series, the voltage drops and resistance increases. If they are connected in parallel, the voltage stays the same and resistance decreases. We want more voltage and less resistance as it will allow the lightbulb to be brighter. In conclusion, we can say that car headlights are bright because they are connected in parallel. This was proven in this week 7’s lab. When we compared the brightness between two lightbulbs when connected in series and parallel, the light bulbs connected in parallel were brighter than the one connected in a series. This information might be used to benefit society because a lot of people drive. Headlights are very important since they are able to help us see in situations where visibility may be low such as driving at night or driving in the rain. If the headlights are not that bright, they will not really benefit society too much and can put the driver and others in a dangerous position."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2917,"A question that has been in the back of my mind for the last couple of weeks hasn't really been a question more like me being confused but nevertheless it is the fact that the formulas for Gravitational source, force, and field are so similar to Electric source, force, and field. For example the formula to find the force done by gravity is G((m1m2)/r^2)n while the force done by a charge is K((q1q2)/r^2). This pattern where keeping the formulas the exact same persists throughout the formula for Field and Potential. The reason this has had me so perplexed is because I believe I can remember reading that gravity was unable to connect to the other 3 forces that we know of. The other 3 forces were Electrical/Magnetism, the weak, and strong nuclear force. Where the other 3 we can for the most part when manipulate where the weak nuclear force I think is used in nuclear fission, the strong force takes place in the sun a in a nuclear bomb, and of course Electrical is used every day to power our houses and everyday items. So having this much similarity for me at least that the ability to manipulate gravity is possible, giving us the possibility of an elevator to the moon, wormholes, and/or sci-fi technology can be real."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2922,"The best example I could find is also the simplest and feels natural to a normal person is DC circuits. The simple interaction between a batter/power source, a wire and a resistor/appliance have been very impactful in daily life. It almost seem natural to people that everyone knows how to plug in a battery and what voltage mean in terms of how it affects a device. For example, everyone knows that a battery is responsible in powering a remote control, everyone knows to use a battery to power it, and and when it dies, they know that the battery is now not supplying enough current to power the remote, so we replace it. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2919,"How does effective resistance work in a series circuit?Total effective resistance is the total sum of all resistances in a series circuit. In lab, we measured the theoretical resistance and our calculated resistance using Ohm's law. For theoretical resistance, we divided voltage by current. We calculated our resistance from adding up the resistances from all resistors. These two pieces of data were similar and within range of uncertainty, proving that total effective resistance is the sum of each resistance in a series circuit.For engineering, we can apply Ohm's law in a series circuit to cut costs and provide safety measures. Since we know that we can either use a powerful resistor or multiple weaker resistors and end up with the same voltage, we have the option to choose the cheaper option. Furthermore, multiple resistors can help alleviate heat easier than having a single resistor, which is safer to use."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2920,"One very important concept that I think can be generally applicable to people and their daily live's would be internal resistance of a battery, a concept we went over in lecture. I choose this topic/concept because I know that everyone uses batteries. Internal resistance is the amount of resistance to the flow of the current within the voltage source. Essentially, the lower the internal resistance of the voltage source, the more current flow. It is important to understand this concept as people who use batteries and voltage sources because internal resistance is a crucial factor when deciding which voltage source to use for any particular task or project. The internal resistance will affect the amount of power the source can deliver. There is resistors in our everyday practical appliances. It is important to understand internal resistance and how it increases as the battery becomes depleted. In some cases, wires in. circuit can become hot and even cause electrical fires because current is high but resistance is too low. Being aware and cautious of these things when choosing practical appliances for our home can keep us safe from electrical fires in our home. Most of the time we trust the companies who make these products, but it is important to be aware of these things."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2918,"In this class we have done a lot of labs so far so it can be difficult for me to find a topic that I want to write about that involves a questions that I am looking to answer with my on knowledge. However, I think I am going to develop a question on the circuitry aspect of what we have been learning and testing so far. My question involves the resistance in circuits. How does resistance affect the current and voltage after it goes through the resistance. In one of our labs we did lots of testing with resistors and used the voltmeters and ammeters to figure out the voltages and currents going through the resistors. However, with the format of a lab and how fast paced it is it can be hard for me to develop an answer that I remember. So in this assignment I will redevelop and answer to the question of, how does resistance affect the current and voltage after it goes through the resistance. So after looking at my notes in what I wrote It looks like increasing the resistance will decrease the current and it will also decrease the voltage. This is also apparent in ohms law."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2916,"One of the topics that I found interesting in the lab was electric fields. I found the shapes the fields make to be very interesting. I was able to see Art in physics. One question I can formulate about this topic is; How do electric fields interact with other signals such as radio waves. I formulated this question because in the labs I observed how electric fields react to each other and how the Magnitudes of the charges affect each other. Since these electric fields interact with each other and have experience with electronic interference, I wondered if electronic fields would react to other things. I looked through my notes and homework to see if I could find an answer to my question that I may have missed. Unfortunately, I could not find any answer there, so I decided to search on google and ended up finding a lot of information that led me to more questions. I found out if an electric field is strong enough it may be able to distort radio signals. I am looking forward to learning more about this topic in the future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2924,"Many concepts in electromagnetism are prevalent on the atomic scale, so it may be difficult to apply it to society and everyday life. However, one concept that I think we can apply to society is the idea of circuits in series and parallel. I was wondering if different circuit configurations had a practical purpose in everyday life, and it turns out that they are extremely important. Putting circuits in parallel is usually much more efficient, since two or more objects can both be at its maximum output, while using only one source. An example where this may be useful is in city infrastructure, where there are many lights or light posts aligned in a row."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2921,"Over the course of the semester so far, one topic that has interested me the most is ohm’s law. The reason why this topic is the most interesting to me is because so far this topic has been the most applicable to real life. So far, we have been using ohm’s law to figure out the voltage, current, or resistance of a circuit based on the information given to us. One question that I have regarding this topic is if it is possible for the voltage or current to be so significantly higher than a resistor that it would cause it to break? If it is possible, then how would this affect the circuit? According to a search on the internet, it is possible for a circuit to break if the voltage is high enough, which causes the resistor to burn. When a resistor is burnt, it is no longer able to resist the flow and any current passing through will remain unchecked. This can be most applicable to real life in the case of everyday electrical appliances such as lightbulbs or cars. When a resistor found in the circuits of these systems fails, the object fails to operate properly."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2926,Last week's laboratory covered electric potential. Electric potential is work done by the field on unit charges. We held simulations to test the varying potential differences in different distances from the charge points. We concluded that the further an the distance the more work done by the field whilst when the its closer the field has to do less work on the unit charge.
