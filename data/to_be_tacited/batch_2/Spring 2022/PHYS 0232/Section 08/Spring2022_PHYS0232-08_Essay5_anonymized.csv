2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2920,"My greatest take away from this class was that I really learned how to collaborate with my peers and I was able to really test the physics I learned through the textbook and lectures. I never actually had a class that was all group work and a class where my group turned in one single copy per group. Through this class I learned how to take leadership among my group, and also work with them to figure out a lab we had trouble with or a specific problem we were having a hard time with. There were a lot of times when we would encounter a hard problem, but when we all discussed it and threw out the information we all knew, we were able to work through the problem and solve it. This class was very useful because I know that in the future I will have many important group projects and presentations that will require me to work with different people who have varying opinions and of different backgrounds, and through this class I can say I feel pretty confident about any group project or presentation, or even just a group discussion.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2921,"Over the course of this semester so far, the greatest take away from this class was from the lesson about ohm's law. The reason why this lesson stuck with me is because it deals with how previously discussed topics such as electrical potential energy can be related to real life situations. What I learned from this part of the lab was that voltage, which is the difference in electrical potential energy is directly proportional to both current, which is the rate at which electricity flows through a conductor, and resistivity, which is a measure of a material's ability to resist current. Another useful lesson that I learned about this lab was how to calculate values for all three variables, especially resistivity depending on the type of circuit. If it is a series circuit, then the total resistivity is the summation of all resistors where if it is a parallel circuit,  it is the inverse of the summation of all inverted values of resistors. A useful skill I picked up from this lab was the difference between series and parallel circuits, where the former has +/- connections and the latter has ++/-- connections. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2923,"My greatest take away from this class is that physics is hard but with a team of struggling students, we are able to understand it better together. Yes, in the lectures, we learn all about physics conceptually and maybe some real life examples that are related to the physics concept we are learning. However, that really does not help me fully grasp and truly understand the concept. When we did the labs, it helped me understand the physics behind what was going on in the experiments. Although the labs were harad to do, I was able to do it with my group members. With their help, I was able to understand the physics in the labs and be able to relate it to our lectures. I was also able to learn physics with my group members since we all asked questions and tried to find the solution to the problem we were trying to solve together. Having a team is very important when you are trying to accomplish a goal and is very helpful when trying to learn new things.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2917,"The biggest take away I have taken away from this class, if I am taking strictly academic I feel that I have very much developed the ability to apply theory in to real world problems/solutions. As starting in this class that aspect was the one that I was most concerned with but as we have moved through different labs I found myself still feeling a little lost in the begin but have been able to figure it out faster and faster every-time. This is especially true as stated before when applying the theory into helping me better understand what the lab is showing us. And away from the purely academics of the class I haven’t been so super social over the pandemic but this class has brought me back to group work and the interaction that comes with it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2926,The greatest take away from this lab was the introduction to the use of an oscilloscope. I now feel comfortable this machine.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2925,"My greatest take away from this class has transcended beyond the actual course material that is about physics. This class has taught me more how to effectively work as a group. Each lab has been a group project basically. And each lab has to have a report. Me and my group have been splitting the work amongst ourselves in order to save time and get things down as soon as possible. When we are actually doing the procedure for the lab, we have engaging discussions if we are not sure what we have to do. When we talk about the lab, our brains are functioning at a very sophisticated level because we are all critically thinking. We help by pitching potential solutions, and then working together to try those out. In the end if we can't figure something out together, we do ask the professor to come help us and we all try and pay attention. If something the professor says doesn't make sense to one group member, the others try and re-explain it to that member. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2918,"Physics has always been one of the more difficult classes for me throughout my time as a student. This is ironic when I would say I am pretty good at math and also enjoy math. However, I always found myself having a lot of difficulties in physics but not math. I think what is so hard about physics for me, especially when compared to math is the setup of the problem. I feel like math is more intuitive for me while physics requires so many extra steps and uses so many different equations I find myself getting lost and overwhelmed. When I'm in the lab I found that using my hands has helped me learn the concepts a bit better. It also showed me to slow down and be more thoughtful and calculating when attacking a problem. So I would say that my biggest takeaway from this class is that I should approach problems more slowly and calculate to help solve not only my physics problems but problems in my life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2916,"There were multiple takeaways from this class that has stuck with me since the semester started. These takeaways include refining my group working skills, asking for help when I needed it, and taking data in multiple forms. Out of all of these takeaways, I think that the greatest one was asking for help when I needed it. There were many instances where I needed help throughout the semester. In the beginning, I would ask more broad questions about the topics and found that it was quite inefficient but as the semester progressed, I was able to work through a problem by myself and ask specific questions about the area I was stuck in. I not only refined this skill with physics but also in my other classes as well. As a result, my problem-solving skills have become more refined. I find myself solving problems in other areas of my life with more ease. To summarize, I have become more skilled in finding out what I need help with, specifically, and when to ask for help. I  also become more confident in asking for help as a result."
