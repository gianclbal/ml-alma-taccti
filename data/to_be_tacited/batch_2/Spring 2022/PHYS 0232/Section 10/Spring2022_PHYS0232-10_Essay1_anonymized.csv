Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2957,"I want to go to the STEM field because it's something that connect with my major, although I'm not a big fan of math, the Science, Technology and Electronics, I think those are the STE, is fun to do and something that isn't too math heavy although math will be included in most of them. It's also something that I could use in the future or not, but just having the excess knowledge can be useful."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2958,"I wanted to go into the STEM field because I love working on the computer and the only way that would be possible for me in the future is to get into the STEM field. There are definitely some ups and downs as there are times where I wonder why I am in this class and there are times where I feel that what I am doing is very fun for me. The biggest thing that makes me not enjoy the STEM field is how much math I have to take in order to pursue the field. I still don't know whether I want to pursue computer science or go into a different branch of IT that requires less math. On the bright side, I have one math class left and 1 or 2 physics classes left until I am fully hands-on with computer science classes. The STEM field is no joke and requires a lot of work from the person in order to succeed which was the biggest takeaway from the field that I have learned."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2959,"I chose the STEM field because I have always loved math class and was considering at one point to major as a mathematician. I took a morning class in middle school where I build my own bridge strong enough to hold something heavy and be able to withstand an earthquake. I also created an airplane and had to improve multiple times to get it to fly far. I thought both projects were fun and really enjoyed working in a team where we all build off each other's ideas and listened to one another. But my favorite project was when as a pair, we had to build a code to make our a mini robot move and do certain actions when we pressed certain keys. I loved playing around with the sensors on the robot and the coding process was really simple in my opinion. That along with other computer classes I took lead me to choose computer science as my major."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2960,"I actually did not want to go into the stem field. I just enjoy computers and programing the most out of all the things that I was thinking of doing. My family wanted me to be a psychologist or dentist because my family has already done that and it would be easy to follow those footsteps but I decided to do what I like. I wasn’t even going to do college because I was thinking of doing a camp with my friend for coding and then just start working immediately but then my mom told me the importance of college instead and essentially said I have to go. So that’s mainly why I am here, as a computer science major, but now I also have to learn certain things that may not feel all necessary for my future jobs especially since a lot of the time on jobs like that you learn things as you go in life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2961,"I would like to go into the STEM field because I like to learn more about science. Science is the main reason why the world become more and more advanced. There is a lot of technology that helps our life become convenient. However, that cannot be imagined in the past. People try their best to find more elements that can use in our life which is science. I am really interested in this STEM field because I know they're always are something that we haven't found yet, I would like to focus on these elements that might be used in the future. I would like to say if I want to find those things, what I need to do for now is know what is STEM field is and what do they have in that field. Taking that knowledge from them, and bringing them into a new field, that what I thought about.  I am a student and still young, so I want to continue my study in the STEM field.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2962,"I sort of always forget that I am in the STEM field. I never thought of it as going into the STEM field, just a pick a major and graduate as soon as possible. But if I had to answer I'd say that stem field is more than math and science. I'd say it helps with interacting with the real world. You can create and develop skills such as being creative, problem solving skills, and critical thinking. There's a lot of opportunity and new things I've never heard of and interacted with so I want to experience different things as much as possible. My mind is open to many things, and I would like that to be shared and for me to be able to learn about these unknown things. Computer Science was something I never really desired but it's the only thing out there that really spoke to my mind. Even though I may not be as good as others, I like the challenge and I believe that being in the STEM field puts me to the test to see if I can handle something I don't know how to do."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2963,"Growing up, I enjoyed learning how to problem solve problems in various scenarios, whether it was in the classroom or at home. After seeing that within me as a child I started participating in a STEM-centered internship. In this internship, I learned a lot about architecture, construction, and engineering by surrounding myself with people that worked in engineering and architecture firms. My first year in that internship pushed me to learn more about the stem field. After having weekly meetings for many months, we ended the year with a project that challenged many students and me. It was challenging because we were required to use the engineering and architectural skills we learned that winter/spring. The goal was to remodel a portion of Lake Merrit. While doing this, we needed to draw our plans to scale, calculate estimated costs of material/labor, and present our plans to a panel. The project was a lot of fun and stressful because we used basic skills and critical thinking that we learned throughout the time that I was in the internship. I want to go into the stem field because I would love to keep innovating and thinking critically in my daily life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2964,"The reason why I want to go into a STEM field is because I am fascinated with technology. I am amazed at how much technology has improved over the years. I've always liked seeing the technology in science fiction movies, and then seeing the similarities between sci-fi tech and the technology we have today. Seeing what was once fiction come to life is amazing. I believe that as technology gets better, our lives get better. Every year the technology we have gets smarter and smarter and it will only help our lives. I think it would be really cool and fulfilling to build a piece of technology that helps out humanity. That I could build something that will benefit others or myself. It could be something. I’ve already developed an app that would help students. I just need to find my next idea and build that."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2965,"I chose to go into the STEM field because I was always interested in computer and the concept of how it works. Growing up I didn't get a chance to learn much about computers so this would be my opportunity to grow and nurture my knowledge of programming. I'm not the smartest, but I work very hard and I believe I can achieve my goals to do so."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2966,"I have many times asked myself why I want to go into the STEM field, I think might can get a good job, might meet a lot of other people. I think the mostly idea is I can learn a lot of new knowledge to improve my skill or my mind. Going into the STEM field also can help me a lot in my Computer Science major, because sometimes it will need Math, Physics, Algorithm to support me in programming something, also going into the STEM field will open my mind to accept more newest ideas and things in the world."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2967,"I want to go into the STEM field, more specifically the engineering field because it offers a unique lens on looking at the world and I am fascinated by it. I feel that the field is where I would find work that I enjoy and not simply a job that gives me money. Ever since I was a kid, I have always loved playing with blocks and legos since they allowed me to explore my wild imagination. I loved making new designs and doing experiments to see if they would work. My passion for designing and building would further be fueled by my high school’s tech arts program where I had the opportunity to learn how to use countless tools and build projects based on my designs. I was able to design shelves, a lamp, a desk, a curved bridge, and many more projects. My final shop class involved lessons from mechanical engineering, which ultimately influenced my decision in choosing it as my major. Now I am in the next step of my life and would like to continue to pursue my passions in STEM."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2968,"The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is because of choosing Computer Science as a major, I feel that I mix my analytical thinking along with my creative side in order to solve problems that can occur in software, while also thinking of innovative idea to help shape the world and be able to see whatever I've worked on and solved be a tangible creation. When programming software, we have the ability to see what we have created in real time so that we can determine how useful is the program we created and there will always be ways to improve it and make it more efficient as time progresses and our knowledge of that language is evolved. Also, being in the work field of STEM offers really good job security and career earnings are a plus/selling point of anyone pursing a career in STEM. Overall, I would say that the ability to combine analytical and creative thinking is the reason why I chose Computer Science as my major and the fact that there will always be room for improvement, means the more I can learn."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2969,"I wanted to go into the STEM field as a computer science major, specifically as a programmer. The reason I wanted my career field to involve computer science was from the joy of playing video games. Finding out that video games were created through the process of coding/programming in different coding languages excited me, so much that I decided that it would become my career path. I started getting into the STEM field for my major during middle school, but never got any ""real"" experience from the class there, as it wasn't really a ""computer science"" course. That lead me to teach and learn by myself about coding languages. High school was where I actually got taught computer science, from independent coding websites, html, to java. As of today, I still am learning much more and more about different programming languages and trying different things that may/may not be related to the computer science field, but never the less, I am still enjoying it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2234,"I like dealing with math problems and figuring out how things work physically, these are the basic reasons that I chose STEM field; another reason is that I do not only hate dealing with words especially reading and writing but also not good at it so I chose to run away from them at the first place."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2970,"For me, the main reason as to why I want to go into the stem field is because of how vast the field is as well as the countless opportunities. I am specifically in the software engineering field and some of the things which I find quite unique about this field is the ability to create to your liking. Sure, there is definitely a lot of complicated topics but once you’re able to go get some basic understanding you can simply jump in. It’s also something many people overhype in terms of difficulty and I find it quite true that literally anyone can go into this field as long as they’re motivated and have the dedication to sit down and grind through materials for hours at a time. One of the other things which attracted me to this field was how impactful science and technology is to the world. Without it, we might still be in the stone age."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2971,"Hi my name is Kenley Galindo and I will be talking about why the STEM field is important to me and how it can not just impact me but others around me. Life is about learning and innovating without those 2 we would still be in the stone age. For example how Elon Musk is creating all new discovers and ways to explore Mars or how he is making electric cars perform better than gas cars is amazing. It definitely is scary to think that robots could be taking our spots in things we do but that's how life works, and I think that's something I want to be know for in life, being that man that created a flying car or a type of robot dog that barks and doesn't have robot behavior which is probably many years ahead of us but doing it with baby steps and those being getting into stem and it first begins with having passion because all these companies did not start at the top they build there way to the top. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2972,"I want to go into the STEM field because I want to learn about the world around me. I want to find innovative solutions to real-world challenges and I want to discover and develop new things. When I was kid I was really interested in the skies, the stars, the planets and galaxies. It always interested me. I have always watched the skies since I was a kid. When I got older I wanted to be a doctor to help people. I especially want to cure diseases for everyone but I wasn’t good enough for chemistry and biology. Then I changed my mind and decided to major in computer science. When I first learned about coding I realized it was fun and I want to continue as a computer scientist. I want to build robots and work with robots. Because I want to make people's lives easier. The STEM major is a very hard major. I know that it can make people stressed, burn out or you just want to quit but whenever people say “wow you must be really smart” when I talk about my major. This is a statement motivating me to keep continuing and reach my dreams. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2973,"Why do I want to go into a stem field? I want to go into the stem field because I like how engineers make things. I’m going into a computer science major but it wasn’t my first choice, when I first knew I wanted to become a stem major I wanted to become a mechanical engineer. I thought that working on engines would be cool. The first class I took for mechanical engineering was an intro to programming and I was really into coding so I thought I should switch majors because I liked mechanical engineering but I loved coding more. I loved the way you compiled a program and it ran successfully. So I talked to my cousins that are majoring in software and they gave me some pointers on what they did and all the different things that they could do. That was when I switched my major and loved coding. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2974,"Why Do I want to go into the STEM field? I want to go into the STEM field becuase I want to learn about things that can help me be more creative. I'm a Computer Science major and my intrests are in Artificial Intelligence , machine learning and robotics. I enjoy making cool little devices for fun. One big project I have in mind that I would like to get started on is making a robot that can follow me around. There are some things I don't know yet that could help me. If I'm in the STEM field, I would be able to gether more tools that I can use to help me with my personal projects. I like Art a lot, I would say that I am an Artist if I would describe myself. Math, engineering, etc is not my main feild per say but I want to apply its concepts in an artistic way. I like combining art and science to make cool projects."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2975,"Why I want to go into the STEM field is such a simple yet complex question. I could easily say that I am a computer science major because I wanted to get paid roughly 80k out of college or something along those lines but in all honesty I think it's more than just the money. Of course money plays a role in my decision but it's not everything. For starters I'm a STEM major that absolutely hates math. Math is my kryptonite in the sense that I understand it so little and care for it so little. Writing is so much easier and more gratifying in my eyes however computers, oh computers. I'm infatuated with them not just how they improve our lives but how they mirror them as well. Computers are the essence of art imitating life. When looking at a piece of technology I can only imagine the amount of humans required, in a previous lifetime, to do the simple task a computer does in seconds ranging from a complex algebraic equation to printing out articles. We used to need a room of mathematicians to solve the problems our simplest of computers solve today. That in it of itself is mesmerizing, the plain and simple reason I went into a STEM major or more specifically Computer Science was not because of the excruciating math classes or the complex, though interesting, physics classes. It simply comes down to, “I want to know the language that controls our greatest modern accomplishments.” To understand computers is to understand humans because to be frank, as of now computers are embedded in our future and I want to understand that future to the fullest."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2976,"I think one of the main reasons for why I went into the STEM field is mainly because of my passion for video games. Video games are a major hobby to me, and I wanted to return the favor by possibly being a programmer on the team, or even helping debugging a game. I also want to go into CSC mainly for the sake of finances, since I could potentially work on passion projects, while still trying to make a good amount of money for a stable job. And while video game programming may not be a sought out salary, compared to other positions such as software engineering or working for a big company such as Microsoft, I still want to at least find a career, while pretty niche, that I can potentially find some level of enjoyment in, even if it’s a pretty challenging one at that in terms of management and timing."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2977,"Hi my name is Andy Cho and I am a senior here at San Francisco State University. I want to spend part of my life in the STEM field because it is the pinnacle of human ingenuity. In computer science we learned about Moore's law, and how the number of transistors usually doubles every two years. This is also a reflection of how fast technology can grow and affect our society as a whole. Working in STEM allows for me to be able to have a say in whatever field I work in which is especially important for this mercurial environment. Because the field is constantly changing, it is important to be involved so we can continue to advocate for a better society through the lease of technology. It is an exciting field and a great way to contribute to the progress of our culture. This sentence reflects 150 words."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2978,"The main reason why I want to go into the STEM field is because I dream of being a good structural engineer and so help my community building environmentally friendly structures with ways that will impact the people around me and at the same time make the world a better place for everyone. Another reason why I’d like going into this field is because I like new technologies and I love science, Physics to be specific. My uncles on my mom's side work on construction, they work with structures such as beams, roofs, stairs and pretty much anything that has to do with steel. I think that also affected the way I see Civil engineering. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2979,"The main reason why I wanted to be in the STEM field is because it contains stuff related to computers. I am a computer science major, and I very much so enjoy working with computers every day. In particular, I want to use machine learning to understand patterns and trends. For humans to do these things, it would take a significantly longer amount of time when compared to computers. They are able to make connections that would seem impossible for the human eye. This is the main reason. Computers are the future, and I want to be able to help out in some way if possible. STEM is a fantastic umbrella that holds a lot of great fields. There are a lot of great and talented people in the STEM field. For me, I just want to work with computers, which is part of the STEM umbrella. I can’t wait to see what the future has in store for me in this field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2980,The reason that I decided to go into the stem field was because I was really fascinated with math and sciences. I have always liked science and have always been interested in electronics so I thought going into a stem field would be a good idea. I am really interested in getting a career in a science and electronics field so that I can work hands on with others to problem solve and get better at coding at the same time. The major that I decided to go with was computer science because in high school I was lucky to have the opportunity to be part of a Cs class and it really caught my attention.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,341,"During my 21 years in the Navy, I found my love and enjoyment for teaching.  The simple fact that you can share your love and passion on a topic/subject, and see the eagerness and excitement in their eyes and faces is heartwarming.  Also, when they finally understand and comprehend a difficult concept, they have that ahh-ha moment, is extremely rewarding.  For me, I want to continue to give back to those excitable and eager minds by sharing my love and passion for Astronomy, Physics and math.  I am extremely excited to continue my path to completing my B.S., then on to my PhD so I can teach in a 4-year institution.  While I wouldn't be disappointed to teach in a high school level while working on my PhD, my end goal is to teach and conduct research as an eventual tenured professor."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2981,"My interest in STEM began when I was 10 years old. For hours on end, I would watch YouTube videos about cars and how they are manufactured. Despite my parents' attempts to keep me away from the computer, I couldn't resist it.Even then, I would find a way to watch videos related to cars. As a child, I remember telling my parents I wanted to build a car after watching these videos.STEM is a great choice if you are passionate about it, if you understand that your unique talents and viewpoint can contribute to society in some way.  Make sure you don't choose it because everyone around you does or because you believe it is the hardest.You will go so much farther if you are passionate about it, rather than if you choose it because of peer pressure, because you think you will get rich doing it, or simply because it's challenging."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2982,"The primary reason I'm becoming a software engineer is so I can have financial security. I want to have money so I don't have to worry about money. Then I can spend my time doing things I actually enjoy. I don't have any great passions or noble goals when I decided to go into the STEM field. I just want to put the brain that I have to use so that I can have a stable life. Of course, learning, understanding and practicing coding is enjoyable to me. I think out of all the possible subjects in the STEM field, I enjoy coding the most, and that is why I picked software instead of the numerous other options available. That's pretty much my reasons for joining the STEM field. I enjoy learning about software and coding, and I want a financially stable future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2983,The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is that I personally enjoy learning about technology and the science behind it. I also know that people in STEM majors are more employable since there is a growing demand in the STEM fields. I like that I am able to create new things in my major which is computer science. I enjoy problem-solving and I think computer science is really cool because I get to do that. I also enjoy coding because it is really fun and interesting. I think it is really nice being able to create things just from coding such as a website. I believe computer science is a really good major to study if you live in Silicon Valley. I actually know a few people who studied computer science and now have really good jobs. They enjoy their job and are very happy with their careers so I am sure I will enjoy it as well.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2984,"I find creating games as interesting and rollercoaster of emotions while creating programs. Emotions such as anger, a feeling of accomplishment, happiness, and more frustration when a program does not compile. THe money is also a plus, since it would help me to reach my goal of opening a spa one day. The spa is my real passion, and computer science is my second interest. There are so many interesting things that coding can create and improve technology."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2985,"So when you are a kid people ask what do you want to do when you grow up and most of the time as a kid you don't know. I have said for years to anyone who asked that I was in STEM and more specifically Computer Science. It was just something I said to keep people from asking because It is scary not to know. Now that I have grown I have continued that lie and now I am living it. I still have no idea what I am doing but, so far this has been an interesting ride. I have enjoyed my classes and it provides a challenge and I do not hate it yet. It’s strange what started as something to get people off my back has turned into interest. I hope this major works out because I have spent way too much time not knowing what to do."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2986,"The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is because of what I see the world is changing so fast, since the computer and internet has become part of human's life, then the skill that requires for that stuff are for sure needed in the future, so in order to learn that skills, step in to STEM field is the fastest way, and not only that, but when you in this field you can also see so many different things and learn different things as well, tech and knowledge, just always want I want to explore more."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2987,"In short, I really like making things. There is something about it that's just satisfying and enjoyable. Coming up with a design, implementing it, then tweaking and improving the idea, is all fun for me. I even play games in my free time entirely built around designing stuff like this, be it programming or engineering. I would say it's the one thing I have consistently enjoyed doing all my life and now I can get paid for it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2988,"I would like to go into the STEM field because it is required for my selected major which is computer science. In coding, we use math all the time to determine things like a timer, creating pixels, etc. Even though many people say that Math is near being useless for coding, it is still very relevant to some topics of coding. If the STEM field wasn't required, it would be so much easier to pass classes however, not every good-paying job is easy to study for and that is why I want to challenge myself into courses that I'm not confident with."
