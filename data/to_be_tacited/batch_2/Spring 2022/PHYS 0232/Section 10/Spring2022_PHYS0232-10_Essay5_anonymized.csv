2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2969,"My greatest takeaway from this class would have to be how much electricity contributes to many of the physics concepts. In a more descriptive sense, circuits and batteries are heavily involved with multiple concepts. short circuits and capacitors are involved with energy, charges. Circuits are built upon a battery connected to wires to either a capacitor/resistor. There are different equations for energy and charges relating to circuits depending on the situation. Whether the charge and/or energy increases is dependent on the battery/circuit, if it's connected and if it's being affected by another object. The idea that whether the battery is connected or disconnected from the capacitor is the situation itself."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2957,"My greatest takeaway from this class is the knowledge I learned from this class and the experiment I've conducted. All were fun, some were confusing but in the end, it was great to learn and get a better understanding of this class about the current subject. The coding part was fun but annoying to do as the code won't work sometimes. Overall had a fun time and great professors."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2976,"I think the greatest takeaway from this class is how many different topics of physics often have a tremendous amount of applicable ideas to everyday objects that help to continue and advance our lives. Such as with circuits, we often use different kinds of man-made circuits that help to power on various objects from kitchen appliances to our lights. With electromagnetic fields, it can help with the medical field such as with MRI machines, or help to power on machines with the use of generators or motors. And something as simple as current, voltage, or resistance can help give us an idea on how much power we need to deliver to turn on any system or daily use item we have, and potentially not cause any fire hazards from trying to overload it. With all of these ideas in mind, they all bring back to once again, how they manage to continue and advance our lives until the future where technology might advance further and improve on what we have already."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2971,"As I complete my second year of college in San Francisco state, I’ve meet new professor’s, new friends and new subjects I can say physics of calc 2 was a very well taught subject and well learned. I had many obstacles through this year. The lose of some of my loved ones and health problems however I always felt a guide that helped me understand the subject I was being teached, For example, when we learned coding I was not familiar at all with it, I had no clue on how I would even complete that project since I was so lost. However during that week Professor Grigorescu you helped me a lot to compete the project, it even motivated me to pursue taking more classes involving Coding. I also loved how even though we were not in person it did feel that connection of being there with the projects and websites, I loved the battery project which showed me how current travels and what are some add-ons it comes with. I’m general I want to say thank you for a wonderful semester, I was glad I was able to take your class and be apart of the PHYS of calc 2 family!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2986,"I think the greatest take away for me for this class is that I learn how to work as a team and group, well I usually work alone, but for this class we need to do group work and submit as a group for most of the time and that change the way I do stuff, I become more patient and also slow down the pace as well communicate with other when I run in trouble or other did, try to help each other, which those experience that I did not have much in the past, so yea I will said I learn a lot of how to work as a team and group which I think is a good skill for me to have as well as in the future job environment ."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2978,"My greatest take away from this class is that I have learned pretty interesting and hard stuff I didn't know I could learn. This combined class which has a lecture and lab was very important for my learning because my major is very related and I need to feel familiar with these topics. For me the most interesting topics I have learned were forces and circuits, and how these circuits differ from others when we add stuff like electromagnetic fields or simple magnets. I feel like the hardest class was the lecture because I was learning very new stuff, and when it came to the lab, I felt a bit more familiar and could perform better. What I liked the most of this class was that we worked in groups for almost the whole semester and interacting with others and exchanging ideas was great, a bit difficult at first but after getting to know each other it was a great experience."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2974,"My greatest take away from this class is the inspiration I get when we did the lab experiments. My favorite lab experiment was the electromagnet. In class, we do small simple experiments but it inspires me to make it bigger on my own at home. It really peeks my curiosity about science and math and it makes me want to do more if it at home. I have a spare 12v battery and I want to make a bigger electromagnet at home just for fun. The other experiment I liked was when we were studying about parallel and series connections. I used that info to wire up stuff in my car. I get to decide if I want it wired up in parallel or series. I learned so much from this lab and I gained so much inspiration to do my own projects and also it helps me in my art projects. I really love how it helps me be more creative. Thank you, Mrs. G."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2980,My greatest takeaway from this class was that there is science everywhere. Although a lot of people might not see it; Science is a big part of how the world works. Another really big take away from this class was that I got to learn a lot about how current travels and how magnets work. I really enjoyed taking this class because it made this semester really enjoyable.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2973,"I think that my biggest takeaway from this class has to be working with my group. We have been able to get through a lot of physics problems together and have always helped each other out when we are stuck. We always make sure every single one of us has understand the topic and if one of us is struggling we help them out. This has been one of my favorite groups to work with I think we naturally just clicked instantly and never had a problem with one another. I also think that the way the professor teaches the class has made me a better physics student! Her teaching to me has been by far the best! I say this because I usually tend to struggle with physics but in this course, I thought she was clear and explained every concept clearly with a lot of insight. Also whenever we were stuck in the lab with our group she came in and helped us out and explained how to get the correct answer and what we did wrong."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2972,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that I have learned that electricity is a form of energy found in nature but that can be produced artificially by man. It involves the continuous flow of electrons from atom to atom. The movement of electrons also creates another form of energy. This form of energy is called magnetism. Electricity and magnetism are closely related. Flowing electrons produce a magnetic field, and spinning magnets cause an electric current to flow. Electromagnetism is the interaction of these two important forces. We did experiments to understand better how electricity and magnetism work. We use electricity to power computers and to make motors go. Magnetism makes a compass point North and keeps notes stuck on our refrigerators. Magnetism is a fascinating, invisible force – it influences the environment around it. A magnet is a material that can pull certain types of metal towards itself. Unlike many other forces, magnetism doesn't have to touch the objects it affects. Gravity is also an invisible force that acts at a distance. We used real-life examples, and there are numerous electric and magnetic force applications. A door catch is a simple device that uses the magnetic force of attraction to hold a door closed. Computer hard drives use magnetism to store the data on a rotating disk. There are numerous applications of electric and magnetic forces. A door catch is a simple device that uses the magnetic force of attraction to hold a door closed. Computer hard drives use magnetism to store the data on a rotating disk."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2965,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that I get to do collaborative tasks with my lab partners and we have fun with it. It teaches me teamwork and communication. This is probably the only class where I have people to talk to. Academic-wise, this class is all about hands-on labs and it helps us visualize the problem and to find the answers to them."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2966,"I think my greatest takeaway from this class is teamwork when the professor make a breakout room, we stay in a group and start to work on our lab, and we share our idea a talked to each other though. This is fun for me, when I don't know how to do it, I ask them and they will try to help me. For sure, if they have questions, I will try my best to help them. sometime in the lab pdf have many slides, we will make 4 part to do on our own and when we finish we will check other people's work is written right or wrong and do the discussion. Teamwork is really helpful and important in helping me learn Phys in this class."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2987,"I think for me, the biggest takeaway was seeing how these systems and formulas interact with the real world. Although I'm a computer science major, I do a good bit of engineering and design in my free time. This class has helped me a lot with that and being able to actually understand what I am making. For example, I made an electric bike a few years ago, and at the time I was just going through the motions and following guides. Now, I am properly able to understand what all the parts did and why different specifications matter, such as the wattage of the motor. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2983,"I would say that my greatest takeaway from this class was learning about electricity and magnetism. I learned that forces attract when they have opposite charges. Forces repel when they have negative charges and nothing happens when objects have neutral charges. I learned that electricity is a form of energy that results from the existence of charged particles. An example of electricity is the force that powers a lightbulb. This is because the lightbulb gets charged particles from the battery. Other examples of electricity are a washing machine, a dryer, and a laptop. Magnetism is produced by the motion of electric charge which also has an attractive and repulsive force between objects. An example of magnetism is when magnets stick to the fridge."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2968,The greatest take away that I have received from this class was the ability to communicate effectively with my group partners. This was the first class where I felt that I was actually able to engage in a lab where every member actively contributed and helped each other out. Another big take away from this class was that I am able to better understand the way that things work around me. I now have a better understanding as to why thing work the way they do.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2984,My greatest take away is how learning science and doing labs can be very fun. Especially when using online simulations or sometimes hands on at home experiements. Working in groups really helps me understand when I am lost since I can ask my group mates for help or an explanation. Though sometimes I realize that our calculations can be off sometimes or percentage error may be too far off and that can get really frustrating when doing physics labs.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2964,"My greatest take away from this class is all the useful real life appliances I can use from this class. With the knowledge I have been given I can use certain formulas or knowledge of physics to help in my everyday life. By using my knowledge of physics I can make things easier for myself and others. I can even know information that could possibly save my life. Like the information that I am learning in this lab. I make sure to remember all the formulas, not just because I need to know them for homework and exams, but because I can use them on my own. Physics is great to learn and can help with any situation I have."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2959,"Magnets are in almost everything around us. This includes the technology we use, for different reasons. I thought magnets were only useful to in compasses and to move metal pieces. Magnets attract certain metals which is useful when taking it out of trash. I also know of a toy I used to play with that involved a magnet. You would move around the dust particles and create drawings or spell. Besides those few uses, I didn't think magnets were that useful. Now I know they are so useful that they're in the items I will use daily. I also thought it was cool that current creates a magnetic field, and a compass can point out the direction.  Our lab today helped show those magnetic fields which I thought was cool. It made me wonder if that went around my house with lights on will the compass spin or be unresponsive."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2977,The main concepts I took from this class were how circuits work. Circuits are an important part of computer science because the hardware that the software runs on is composed of many circuits and different wirings. Somehow we use these concepts to optimize the hardware that controls our software. I also learned about how magnets work and different properties in creating magnets. This is important because it gives a rudimentary foundation of the world around us and how we can use these concepts to bolster our lives. Learning how to mathematical code was also important because many of the code we write is going to be based off of real world mathematics
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2967,"Besides learning new concepts and ideas about physics, I would say the greatest takeaway from this class is the new perspective it offers to view the world. During labs, I find myself playing with different simulations and scenarios and then being prompted to apply the new tools we have learned to the real world. Although most times we don't see the things we explore in our everyday lives, it still offers a unique way on looking and understanding the world around us. Plus since I am a mechanical engineer major, I may find myself needing these tools as I progress in classes and potentially my career. Another takeaway that I highly value is the collaboration aspect of the class. I find it extremely important to have good collaboration skills and this class essentially allows me to refine it. Regardless of what I plan to do in the future, I am most likely going to have to work with others, so refining those skills are very vital. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2958,"The greatest takeaway from this class is learning about forces and energy and how they both affect our daily lives. It's very interesting that everything we do and anything we may have a question about can be answered through science and physics. Another big takeaway from this class is learning how to work with groups to help prepare ourselves for the future in working with others. Overall, this class helped me understand physics through lectures and hands-on experiments that we were able to witness through the professor and also helped improve my communication and group working skills."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2234,"So far not only I have learned some interesting knowledge from this class like solving some calculus problems and graphing something that cannot be done by hand through simple coding; but also a passion for life from Miss Grigorescu. Thank you so much Miss Grigorescu, you are one of the best lecturers I have ever had at SF State."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2975,"So I am assuming this question can be interpreted in multiple ways, I am assuming this because this class has taught me two very important things but they aren’t something directly physics related. I’m not going to say that this class taught me how electromagnetism or how electric fields work, rather this class taught me something I think is more valuable. Coming into this lab I was genuinely scared, physics in general was a scary topic to approach and although I took a physics class before it's still a daunting task. However as every lesson passed and a week went by slowly I realized I'm well, learning. Not in the struggling sense where you have a hard time picking things up rather I actually kinda get it. Which brings me to my two biggest takeaways from this class. One you can literally learn anything when you put your mind to it. Two and arguably more importantly, physics just makes sense, nothing I've learned in this class made me think “what?” everything and I mean everything just makes sense. I think that's just the luxury of learning about something that is present literally everyday and minute of our lives, we experience physics no matter where we go, of course it makes sense. It's cool to understand how physics implements itself in our lives and technology and honestly my biggest and greatest takeaway is that well… physics is fun :)"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2962,"In this class, what I have learned in this entire class was working together in the labs, whether it was hands on or just group work with the pdfs. I always remember that I have classmates to help me if i can't do it on my own. I'm sort of independent so working with people is sort of new to me. But it's super fun to work with a group especially when you have fun ones. I hit the jackpot with my group mates. It helped me learn that I'm not the only one to struggle in a class and that we have each others back. Even if it's not in person, I feel it spiritually. Other than that, since i'm doing this since it's required for my major, i find physics to be complex and you have to really love it to understand most of it. I realized it's not just formulas, but more of finding what physics can do for you."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2981,"The most important thing I learned was to solve problems using the knowledge gained in the lesson. Usually, the hardest part is figuring out which templates to work with and how to use them together. This is the most important thing I have ever learned.Physics shows how our environment works or not. You know how microwave ovens use light with a shorter wavelength than lightbulbs. EverythingI learned in physics was based on math. Compared to other students, I have problems with math. Especially when I am given individual lessons, I understand the subject better and my memory is bad, so I cannot quickly and easily remember others. Let's start with what I know about physics. What we have learned from physics is that this lesson examines the physical properties around us. Physics is how objects move and how they move. For example, measurements such as speed and acceleration, as well as methods used in physics, are an important part of the lesson. Physicists study gravity, electricity, and the many forces that hold everything together. Physics studies large and small objects. Scientists study stars, planets and all other galaxies. They also study small parts of matter, such as atoms and electrons. This year I learned to read sound, light and waves. I also studied energy, heat, and radiation between objects. Physics helps us understand not only how objects move, but also how they deform from heat to cold and what they are made of. An example of what I learned this year is the movement of objects. Movement can be expressed as travel, distance, speed, acceleration, time and speed. I studied Newton's first law. A stationary object moves at the same speed in the same direction until an external force acts on the stationary object. Physics is an idea of ​​how the universe works and its hidden properties."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2985,The greatest takeaway from this class for me will probably not be the physics. It will be the teamwork and communication skills I gained working with my partners. We spend most labs discussing how to solve each question and it is vitally important to our collective success that we work together. I think my future classes will involve quite the amount of team work as I have heard that later CS classes devolve into group project hell so the practice here will be invaluable.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2979,"My greatest takeaway from this class is working on my problem-solving skills. I am a computer science major, and problem solving is an extremely important part of my job. Whether its from mathematics or physics, being able to understand a problem clearly and have the necessary equations makes the problem solving much easier. Having the ability to understand all of the knowns and unknowns in a problem can be the first step in solving the problem. I used to struggle greatly with how to begin approaching a problem. Once I understood that the best first step is writing down the knowns and unknowns, it helped me know where to start in solving the problem. In computer science, the best approach to solving a problem is spending time understanding the problem and working through possible ways of solving it. Planning should take about 90% of the time spent on the problem. This is something that I have tried very hard to work on, and progress ins being made."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2988,My greatest take from this class was learning to work with others. I am very shy when it comes to new people so the lab assignments definitely helped me improve my communication with others.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2960,"I think the main greatest takeaway from this class is that our group worked as a team. I think it is very important to do group work especially for my major as a computer scientist since in the real world, projects are not done alone. Collaboration is a key part of making a project succeed. That does not mean we can not do things alone, though we enjoyed splitting our work focus between people and discuss it together so one person would lead then everyone would piggy back on it then we would rotate. I think that was the biggest takeaway, as well as just having nice people to work with. We all understood eachother and what our goals were, so there was never anything that confused us with our personalities. We talked frequently after we finished our assignments anyway just to chat and I also enjoyed that aspect of our time collaborating with eachother."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2970,"From this class, I enjoyed going through the lab work with my group mates. I enjoyed going through the simulations and tweaking some of the things such as the voltage simulation. I also liked seeing the some of the projects we attempted to make by ourselves. In conclusion, I found that my greatest take away from this class were the interactions I made with my group mates during the lab sessions."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,341,"I found that so many concepts in physics directly or indirectly affect our lives in some way, shape or form.  There is so much we do know, yet even so much more we do not about physics and our universe.  I also found that professors, such as yourself, are great attributes to our educational system since you take into account the ""whole"" student, not just the academic student, which when life happens, you are quite compassionate, understanding and willing to work with us.  That is the greatest attribute, especially considering what we are finally coming out of for the past almost 3 years of the pandemic, life happens, and we have to help each other and make each other that much better for the future, so thank you!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2961,"My greatest takeaway from this class is how to do an accurate lab in this class. In order to find out the knowledge for every part, the instructor did some interesting experiments in the past few weeks, so I have a very deep impression about that after I obverse the result of the experiment. I also knew what is a good process for doing an experiment by watching the experiment that the professor did. All experiments belong to the physical, the physical can improve our life quality. That is why there are still so many scientists working on the physical area. After learning the knowledge about economics, I felt we can not live without that. Basically, we are using economics almost every day, so I would like to say that I need to focus on this part and try to find the more convenient part in the physical area. In conclusion, I think this class make me know the amount of knowledge that is used in our daily life. "
