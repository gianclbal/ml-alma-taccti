2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2969,"A simple circuit, a battery and a closed circuit(wires) connecting to a lightbulb. This was a concept known as simple and short circuits. We know that a fuse can blow in  a circuit, but in this instance, how many lightbulbs or of the necessities will it take to blow the fuse. Since this was done after the currents lab which involved circuits, I'll use some of that information. Having bulbs in series caused the current to decrease, and when junctions were involved, it made a lightbulb even brighter than the others. What about adding even more paths to that junction leading to the lightbulb, will having even more currents meeting up cause the lightbulb to blow? We won't be sure how many we need to break it, but it must be more than 2 as depicted in the lab. Circuits are part of our everyday appliances, so having the right constructed circuit gives us more conductivity and less fuses blowing."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2967,"I think one topic that I found to be extremely relevant and also applicable to my life are the simple circuits and short circuits section. That section for me felt like a little refresher as I have had the opportunity to learn about circuits in high school. I distinctly remember having a difficult time in my circuits class as I was unable to grasp the basics and apply it to the practice circuits. Everything felt extremely intimidating from the parts and wires to the symbols and schematics. My instructor told me to embrace the confusion and I found myself next week being the one leading the class and constantly finishing all practice circuits, including the challenge circuits prior to everyone. Personally I find simple information like how circuits work and how it being closed or open tells whether it works is essential information for me, especially as an engineer. I also believe it is critical for people in general to familiarize themselves with circuitry as they might find themselves dealing with it such as a light switch in a house. More importantly it might help people in potentially dangerous situations and what they should do, like if a circuit is short circuiting.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2966,"The simple circuits and short circuits lab gave me a big impact, we used the battery to make short circuits simulation and show it will make some shining thing. Why that short circuits will make some shining thing, this is my question for this. For this question, I check my note and find out a short circuit is an electrical circuit of lower resistance (almost zero) than that of a normal circuit. It typically results from the unintended contact of components and consequent accidental diversion of the current. To prevent short circuits people normally use fuses to protect circuit devices from current spikes. For example, when you are using a light bulb, if you use the light bulb for a long time and you also didn't use fuses to protect circuit devices, when it go problem, the light bulb won't work and the circuits will become short circuit and will easy to breaking out of the fire. To prevent the circuit devices will become short circuit and burn the deive, mostly we will put fuses to proctect it becasue it will help the circuit device prevent current spikes."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2980,A topic that we went over in class that really stuck to me was the circuit lab. It was really interesting learning about how the way you wire something can lead to changes in voltages and capacity. This can be applicable to someone's life if maybe they were either trying to connect two batteries to get a higher voltage out of them to power something bigger. Or it can also be used to wire the batteries in order to increase the batteries capacities to use for other things. The way circuits are made up they really make a difference how you set them up.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2975,"I have been traveling to Texas via plane for all my life to visit family that lives in Houston. Due to this constant flight I noticed something and pondered on a question I have had since I was a child, “Why don’t clouds affect us in any way? I mean as I grew older I slowly understood clouds more, as a child of course I thought they were like cotton candy. However the older I got the clearer it became that these objects in the sky are the same objects that produce storms, rain, lightning, and thunder so naturally I wondered how we easily fly through them like it's nothing. Then during one of our lectures we went over the concept of the Gaussian Surface, a concept that in a matter of one lecture completely enticed me. I became interested in the topic due to a singular fact, I learned that the objects inside a Gaussian Surface aren’t affected by outside forces which in an instance reminded me of my age old question. Well I went to google to find out if I had hit gold and walla it was true. Due to the concept learned in the class we can understand why individuals in a plane aren't affected by clouds, that I learned, electric fields. The plane serves as a Gaussian surface which is really cool to think about. With this knowledge the human race was able to produce safe to fly in planes that changed the world for the better. Society has been ever more connected due to planes, none the less planes that can withstand the high altitudes and far flights our modern society demands. It's crazy to think, physics is everywhere. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2959,"Why does my phone get hot? When I was in freshman year, I had an addiction to my phone. I used it for long periods of time on repeat. After some time, my phone would heat up despite me not using it much throughout the day. I also noticed it was not running as smooth as it was before. I always wondered why it would do this and how could I stop it. After learning about circuits and what can heat do, I have enough information to understand the general idea of why. A phone's battery has a voltage and internal resistance. The battery then is part of a bigger system that allows a phone to work. When a phone is being overused, the circuit has a high current which creates heat. With enough heat, the circuit can short circuit, forcing the phone to shut down. This is why your phone displays a message about your battery and won't allow you to use it until it cools down. But wouldn't the heat increase resistance countering the current? It is true that temperature has a direct relationship with resistance, but the problem is the heat trapped inside. There is not enough time for heat to dissipate."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2984,"Imagine a cyclinder shape, is it possible to have a vector represent the direction of the shape?No because every part of the cylinder represents a slightly different direction, so each direction of the vector would be different. Since it the vector cannot be perpendicular to the figure.In a situation where we point a laser to a cylinder, we are not able to touch alot of the surface area of the cylinder but only that point that intersects with the laser. Any type of electric force will only cover the surface of where it touches."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2961,"We usually use electronics in many places. As we all know that we cannot live without electronics right now, such as phones, computers, and some household appliances. To learn how current work, it is very useful for us to know how our life works. There might be a better way for us to improve our lives if we found something new about electronics in the future. How current work is very important for our life because the current in anywhere recently. Besides current, voltage is also important in our life. Voltage is the pressure from an electrical circuit’s power source that pushes charged electrons through a conducting loop. If we did not have electronics, we cannot convert electrons to the power that we used in household applicants. For example, we cannot see anything when we at night because no power to make the light bulb light. Of course, we can use many ways to produce electronics. For example, we can use the power of water full down from the high point to produce electronics and use the wind to produce power. These ways are good for both environment and ourselves than other ways, such as coal burning. I guess we will have better ways that are good for the environment to produce power if we learn deeply about electronics.   "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2972,"when a test charge is placed in an electric field, it experiences a force F=q0E. Where q0 is test change is a measurable point charge. If the test charge is moved in the field by some external agent, the work done is get it, by the field is the negative of the work done by the external agent. So I will tell that potential energy stored between the system of charge due its position, and also electric potential energy is defines as the negative of work-done by electric field to bing the chase from infinity. Q0 is moved against electric  field at R position, that negative is mentioned, q0 is store the every at R position How much that thing is Electric potential energy. Electric potential is used in day to day life when you see light switch off, but you cannot see charge are waiting in wire to flow. so that are are some distance evacuated , that are dr or r, that energy  stored electric potential energy. Example of potential energy * Battery like Store electic energy* Circuit board like Television,control board,because current flow all the circuit is worker when current flow. Potential is difference one point to other. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2977,"How do circuits designed in series differ from parallel circuits?Series circuits have one way in which current flows while parallel circuits may have many.The potential difference would be higher in series circuits as each part is dependent on another, sort of light Christmas lights.The potential difference in parallel circuits would be divided. Regardless, they all have three components: voltage, current, and resistance. This is a fundamental concept of ohms law. V=IR. With ohm's law we can calculate any part of the circuit. The amount of current is the same in through any part in a series circuit. The resistance in series circuits is the sum of each resistor. The voltage is also the sum of each voltage drop.In parallel circuits, the voltage is the same within each component. The current is equal to the sum of each branch. Each resistance is smaller than what it would be in a series circuit. We can use the same concepts of ohms law to calculate each component.The current and heat are also related to the geometry and material of the wire. As shown in our experiments, foil was used as a thin wiry medium versus a long flat medium to complete the circuit. The thin wiry medium would combust while the long-flat medium would have the geometry to support the current."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,341,"I think the concept of magnetic inductance.  How does magnetic inductance affect our everyday lives? Two important devices depend on electromagnetic induction are electric generators and electric transformers. Both play critical roles in producing and regulating the electric current we depend on in our daily lives. Electric generators use electromagnetic induction to change kinetic energy to electrical energy.  This also exists in electric cars with the battery providing power to the electric motor, turning the wheels, thus providing the electromagnetic(kinetic) energy from the wheels back to the generator, charging the battery as it is moving down the road."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2974,"I think people should know more about current. It may be helpful and beneficial to the society because of the changes happening in the world. Especially as we try to move towards renewable energy. We should know how to set up a solar system in our shed or home. It would be nice to know if you want a battery bank to be in series or parallel or a combination of both. If we mess up, we could start a fire. But, if we knew what to do, we could benefit from what we know. Solar panels are becoming so affordable and you can make your own battery bank at home. If more people get involved with renewable energy, it would be beneficial to society. Also, learning how to conserve. I was able to learn a lot during the week about current. It even helped me solve some problems I was having. I could now, calculate the current and voltage. I can design the solar system to the the needs of the equipment being powered. Learning all the formulas and being able to see how things work in the simulation helps a lot. If more people learn about current and start doing hobbies in solar power. The forums would be filled with more experience and people will be able to share their knowledge and help further develop better systems."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2986,"I do not think any of the concepts was helpful in real life unless you are aiming to enter the physics field, but the thinking and the group working of how to solve problems in labs are very useful in life, in the job for sure, and that is the concept I think is more useful than the physics topic, to be honest, the element of these are helping me when I doing my coding because I am CS major, and all those skills are useful when I either working alone or with others."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2962,"One of the concepts I did enjoy learning about was the electric fields. Obviously when you think of electric fields, it is literally electric that is actually covered with electric. One of the examples i used as a real life example with an electric field would be anything with a bluetooth like a phone or a radio transmitter. I would have never thought that a radio transmitter would have an electric field, I really never knew what it meant, I always thought an electric field was supposed to shock you or be applied on a fence. A radio transmitter works better when you are closer to the person you are communicating to and the farther you are, the further you are away from the electric field. they are both generated by electricity fields. An electric field will help the entire world with communicating. A walkie talkie was what we used back in the days before cell phones were a thing. Radio towers needed to be constructed, and I believe these radios were used a lot to pass information. I'm sure in war, this was needed as well. Now that we are more advanced, cell phones were invented and you need cellular tower for a better connection. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2964,"The information in this course can be used in everyday life. It can even be used to save some lives. If we have a deep understanding of the topics we can apply it. Knowing how circuits work and how electricity works can be really cool and maybe even pursue a career as a technician. Electricity can be used for many things but there are also many things we didn't know we can use electricity for. The topics in this course can be used in Computer Science, the medical industry, or even in our homes. We just need to know what we want to use it for and make it happen."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2981,"In physics, charge, also known as electric charge, electrical charge, or static charge, represents q. This is a property of a substance unit that represents the degree to which there are more or less electrons than protons. In an atom, an electron has a negative fundamental or unit  charge. Protons are positively charged. The two charges are equal and opposite. Whenever the number of protons in a nucleus differs from the number of electrons surrounding the nucleus, the atoms of matter are charged. If there are more electrons than protons, the atom will be negatively charged. If there are fewer electrons than protons, the atom is positively charged.The amount of charge carried by an atom is always a multiple of the elementary charge. That is, the charge carried by a single electron or a single proton. Negatively charged particles, atoms, or objects are said to have negative electrical polarity. A particle, atom, or object with a positive charge is said to have positive electrical polarity. A real life example of charge would be when brushing your hair, the hair will suddenly go in the direction of the brush. As a result, static electricity builds up on the surface of the object. At the same time, wool loses electrons, resulting in electron deficiency and  positive charge."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2988,"The topic of the question is about electric potentials and why it is so important to learn about them. As I did further research, learning about them is crucial to understanding how everyday things that require electricity are used. Examples of this include power motors, heaters, and electronics. It is very important to understand electric potentials to learn about electrical parts with more in-depth information."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2979,"Question: How are electric fields relevant in our everyday lives?  We are exposed to electric fields every single day. Whether is be through things like radio, smart phones, or other household appliances, we interact with electric fields in some capacity. For example, cell phones use electric fields in order to communicate with any given cell phone tower. Other things like radio are similar to that of cell phones, where they use electric fields to communicate. Many things utilize this, which we use every single day.   Electric fields are generated by charges that are either positively or negatively charged. Most notably, electric fields are utilized in capacitors. Capacitors are devices that store electric energy for a given circuit. The energy is stored in the form of an electric field. All electronics and household appliances utilize capacitors.   Understanding things like electric fields is important in having a basic and foundational understanding of how things work. If we have these basic understanding, then we can understand more complex things, like how capacitors utilize electric fields. It is a basic pushing force that enables us to initiate things like current flow. Being able to propel electrons within a circuit is important. Understanding this important tool can give us an understanding of how electricity can begin and continue to flow.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2985,"How do currents interact with junctions? First, we must distinguish the difference between a junction and a branch. A branch is a path connecting two junctions. A junction is an intersection of three or more pathways in a circuit. It can be represented by a dot on a circuit diagram and is sometimes called a node. Kirchhoff’s junction rule describes what happens when a current passes through a junction. Junctions cannot store current, and current cannot just vanish because the charge is conserved. The total amount of current flowing through the circuit must be constant. Every time there is a junction where current can travel down a different path it divides but as long as the circuit is complete it will function. To have this principle function the total current coming into the junction must equal the total current coming out of the junction. This is applicable in power strips that let you plug in more devices to your wall outlets. Not to mention this also ties into the real-world application of surge protectors they function similarly to power strips but have an additional benefit of protecting your devices from power surges."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2970,"Over the past few weeks, we have covered many topics but the majority of them are surrounded by the concept of circuits. We learned about batteries and how they affect the world around us. We learned about the different types of friction and how they are considered to be a force. We also have just learned about different types of circuits and how that factors into how the current supplies certain things. For me, circuits seems to be quite interesting and relevant to everyday life. I am an avid fan of electronics. I tend to play games on my console or phone almost every weekend. Being able to know the intricacies of circuits helps greatly for my appreciation for those who are able to create such complex circuit boards which power up the electronic device you are using. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2987,"How does current flow?I feel this is something we have gone into a lot recently. I like the water analogy a lot even if it isn't perfect. It covers a lot like paths of least resistance and even can account for the understanding of current and voltage. It even makes sense with I = V/R. Normally the analogy accounts for resistance to the size of the waterway, voltage to the speed of the water, and current to the volume of water flowing through. As stated this isn't perfect and I would imagine the formula for calculating water or electricity are different but it helps a lot with the base understanding."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2957,"Electric currents, how they affect our lives, and how much they can give or take from us. With electric current, we can do many things that are required of an electric current, but if the electric current is too strong or not strong enough, there will be a short circuit that will result in no electrical current and no power to power our machinery. Most things that we use today are running on an electric current and use electric currents via wiring and battery. The Motherboard of a computer, the battery of a phone, the heat that is generated from an electric stove. All runs on a current and without it, nothing will work as it is intended to be. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2234,"from this week's lab, I learned resistance is important in a circuit. So whenever I see a bare wire, I will make sure I won't touch it with my bare hand."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2973,"What is a circuit and how does it work? a circuit is a closed loop in which electrons can travel through to provide electricity. An example of a circuit could be a battery. A circuit is composed of different electronic components like resistors, transistors, capacitors, diodes, and inductors connected by a wire that makes electric current flow through. Learning the basics of what a circuit does and how it works can help with many things like knowing why the power goes out in your house when you have a lot of things plugged in your house or why the light dims in a room. The short circuit lab we did helped me understand how and why and how two batteries were able to spark a piece of tin foil and how they were able to make a light bulb turn on."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2971,"I wanted to cover the topic of voltage and electric current even though we may of not had this topic introduced yet it is something that I loved and fascinated about just because I do want to become a electric engineer and this relates alot to my major, I hope I get to learn how voltage works and as for electric current I got to learn how to generate power with batteries which is very cool and you never know how you may be in use of it, as well the formulas it consist of is fascinating to see how it outputs. I use electric current in my normal day life for example turning this light bulb on is consisting of electricity being transferred over! "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2982,"What are the components of a simple circuit? You would need wires, a battery of some kind to provide current, resistors to prevent voltage spikes, fuses in case voltage does spike, and of course, the object that needs to be powered. You would also need to create a closed circuit so that the current can properly loop back to the batteries. I think a simple understanding of electric circuits would help the average person in the case of emergencies, and sometimes it is merely convenient to know enough to fix simple electronics yourself rather than bring it to a shop. Being able to build something like a makeshift flashlight out in the wilderness or during emergencies where all the lights are out is extremely helpful. People can save money by tinkering with busted electronics like christmas lights if they understand the workings of a simple circuit."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2976,"I think the current topic of electric current is generally applicable to people's livelihood, mainly because of how we have different ways of setting up circuits for different circumstances. With series, it's very helpful when trying to make a simple circuit that requires one path, or possibly control the voltage in order to change the overall temperature so that it doesn't cause any overload. if we used a parallel circuit, it might help with voltage distribution because it allows different paths, but also increase in power due to the amount of current passing through. Examples of these two come from real life objects, such as using a parallel circuit for the lights within a house, cause if one goes out, the rest wouldn't. But for a singular lamp, it would just require a series circuit because of the singular lightbulb, and that it has a constant voltage throughout that isn't increased by the overall current within the wiring."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2983,"What Is a Resistor?A resistor is an electrical component that limits or regulates the flow of electrical current in an electronic circuit. They can be used in electrical circuits to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. They are used to provide a specific voltage for an active device such as a transistor. You can find resistors in your houses such as a Television, LED, and laptop."
