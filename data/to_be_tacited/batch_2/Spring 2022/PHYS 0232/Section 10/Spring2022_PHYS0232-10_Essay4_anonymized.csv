2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2958,"With online learning for the past 2 years, I notice that my schedule is more flexible which means that I get more sleep. Self-care wise I am doing great as I can spend more time with my family and not have to worry about waking up early to traverse to campus. Thankfully all the classes I chose are synchronous which will help me not procrastinate so as far as learning it has been good. However, in this current semester, I do have two classes that are on campus so it is a nice change of pace even though the ride back and forth can be tedious."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2967,"At this point in time I have become fully accustomed to distance learning classes, but that is not to say I don't like in person classes anymore. Both ways have their ups and downs but overall I would still prefer an in person class over distance learning. Although online classes are a bit more manageable for me since I can do most things in the comfort of my own home, it still lacks the person to person interaction that I think is vital not only for my learning but also my daily life. Online classes have made it extremely hard to meet new friends, especially since I came as a first year last year. Because of this situation, I make sure to reach out more and interact with others during class because the sad reality is that if I don't make an effort to make friends, then I will continue find myself bored without anybody to talk. Although not much has changed, I have definitely met people all because I reached out to them. I value my mental health a lot and I make sure to be proactive about it and do anything I need to do in order to have a good mental health. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2966,"The online classes have impacted me a lot because I was living in Alameda, if I have to drive to SFSU, I have to wake up super early and I need to drive 30 to 50 mins to school, also, I need to find the parking, so online classes will save me time to travel to school and I will have more time to sleep and rest before I taking the class. Also, in the online classes, I can use my computer to translate some words I don't know, and this is really helpful, it helps me understand the question or what the sentence saying. So I think online classes give me a lot of nice things and I will take more good care of myself."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2982,"Online classes have not impacted how I learn. Granted, I had to adjust how I study and work. This was not a large change to make, and I thought it was a pretty painless transition for me. Since I am not required to be on campus, I have to set definite time portions where I would be ""at work"" so that I stay focused and don't let distractions slow me down. I constantly check the weekly calendar to keep track of upcoming due dates. I am always ahead of my due dates by a couple days so that in case of emergencies, I would have ample time to resolve them. Most important thing to keep track of is my fitness level. Sitting at the computer all day, I need to not get weak and lethargic so I have to work out, run, lift more than ever because I'm not getting the natural movement from walking around on campus anymore."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2988,I enjoy online classes way more as I get more sleep and have more time for doing other things. I am also confident to ask questions in online sessions compared to in person. I also found it difficult to stay awake in in-person lectures whereas I'm more focused online. Online classes also allow me to do work on my own time before a deadline. One concern I have is passing some courses as the professors aren't updating my grades. I am starting to stress as finals are on its way.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2977,"Online classes initially had a negative impact on my well-being because I was forced to stay inside for all of my zoom-lectures. After an initial setback however, it turned better as I was more prepared to focus on myself and care for my academics separately. Now I prefer my classes to be online because I can prepare more for classes without the overhead of going to lecture. It also helps that some lectures are recorded and therefore I can refer back to them when studying for a midterm. As we transition back to in-person classes for Fall, I think I will have a bit of trouble since I will have to be more attentive for every lecture."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2962,"I know im late on this but i would still like to give my take. Online learning isn't super hard, the way I see it is that people are still visually seeing how the work is done. I feel like what is being lectured is the same as in class except that it's not a board and a marker. this time it's a apple pen and a ipad, or a pdf or slide show. I like online classes more than in person to be honest since we can re watch a recording just in case we forget something or didn't understand something. For self care, I am treating online learning like it's an in person experience. The only difference in all this is that, nobody is around you so it's a little weird. The presence of other people is a little more comforting for some reason. I have no concerns for my learning, because it is no different to in person. Unless it was a physical class, then it would be different, but a computer science major like myself does not require an in person in my opinion, i sit in the front of the class and sometimes it's hard to see the board, but online it's right in front of my face."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2972,In the beginning the online learning was hard because sometimes I don’t understand what teacher was saying sometimes Wi-Fi doesn’t work properly and you can’t get help from the teacher because some teachers doesn’t look at their emails  then I need to talk with some of my friends they also sometimes doesn’t know how to do it was a bit mess but after that everything turning to normal I can ask questions to teachers and I don’t feel pressure when I was taking exams because for exams doesn’t have a time limit and I can take the exam any day. When we are in the school it was big problem when I was taking the exams because I feel so much pressure and sometimes I can’t even finish or look back again to fix if I answered wrongly. But when is it online I can take time to do exams and feel less pressure. For the self care I spend more time with myself because I don’t have a time for myself when I was in the school. I feel more relaxed and less stressed. I also try to understand myself more because when I was young I don’t like myself and don’t forgive myself some of the actions I have done. But now I do loving myself more and forgiving myself. Staying at home also help me to connect with my family because we are always very busy with work and school. We don’t have a time for each other. When this pandemic happened I connect with my family more. It make feel happy. I also learned how to taking a step back because I always doesn’t take a step back I always push something’s to happen but I realized that it’s doesn’t help push everything. Right now I feel better now physically and mentally. I able to manage everything. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,341,"Online classes have been both good and bad since the pandemic started.  I truly was excited to attend college classes on campus following retiring from 21 years on active duty service at the age of 41.  Got to enjoy that campus experience for about 3 months until the pandemic hit hard by March 2020, causing all classes to move to the online venue we still are using today.  I found that remaining online did indeed help me maintain some form of routine throughout the heat of the pandemic and focus on something beside the great unknown at the time.  As time went on, it became the new norm and I found that it was great in improving the homelife with family, friends and pets, while also continuing my educational journey.  I had started using a therapist during the later years of the pandemic due to a divorce, which helped immensely before and after I made the move from San Diego to Palm Springs.  Along with therapy, my two pups were a great help in providing that extra love and distraction from life's challenges with having loving pets to care for and receive as much love and affection from as I can enjoy.  I don't have any further concerns for my learning or well-being at this moment in time; I am in a pretty good place on many levels, finally."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2974,"I feel like online learning is a huge benefit for me personally. I live far from San Francisco and I save a lot of time from commuting. That is extra time I use for doing my homework and assignments. I also have time to exercise and work out to feel energetic. However, I do look forward into going to school next semester in person. I'll just have to adjust my schedule. I'm glad there is a gym at school. I might use that when I am on campus. I have never been on campus ever since I transferred to SFSU. I'll be going into my 2nd year at SF State and it'll be my first time to step foot on campus. I am pretty excited about it. My only concern now is the commute travel time and how much time I will have left over to do homework and assignments. I really like to have more leisure time for projects and hobbies."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2961,"Actually, I have half of the class is in person, but I think the online class is very convenient to take because I did not need to spend time on the way, I can save more time if I take an online class. However, sometimes always staying at home is not good, I think it is good for me to go out for in-person class. I can excise on campus for my body. All in all, I know both sides have shortcomings and advantages, so what I would like to do is just enjoy my school life, and take care of myself. There is a thing about online classes is it might more safety than personal classes. However, the in-person classes also will allow me to take more chances to talk and communicate with others, it good for my social communication. Just like I said before, online classes and in-person classes both have advantages for students, so that is why I choose some classes in person and some classes online. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2957,"The online class has made learning a bit harder to focus on, but it provides a more comfortable and safe environment where I can learn and relax. It just makes getting to class a lot easier and less work to do of getting up early, getting dressed and all. My only concern is that online learning is limited to what we can physically do, but the overall concern isn't too much."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2969,"Been taking online classes for 2 1/4 years, including the end of my high school days. Online learning I feel works better depending on the type of class it is applied to. For example, the building our CS class gets frequent noises which wouldn't occur during an online session, well most of the time. In most cases, online learning gives you even more distractions, but also some type of comfortability being in your own household. I think my learning or my ability to learn is a bit better in-person, but at the same time not that much as a gap as expected. In the end, I think my learning is still the same, that is my ability to learn. Though with online classes, I don't have to attend physically, that is in a physical classroom and won't have to travel to the building, which is good for my lazy self."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2970,"So far during this semester I have enjoyed the labs well enough to attend most of the meetings. Though I find it a bit tough to do some of the labs I still enjoy working with my group mates. I really enjoy going through the simulations with them and being able to play around with it to see different variations. This was present during the lab which talked about the different series and where we would have to work with bulbs and switches. I also enjoy doing the quiz lab where the group works on the quiz together. Given the online circumstances, I still find this class very enjoyable and am able to process through majority of the information. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2987,"For me, online learned has been nothing but a gift. I understand that it can be an issue for many people and why classes are returning to in person, but I would much prefer they stayed online. With online classes, I don't have to worry about my commute (2 hours one way) and it gives me a much more relaxing environment to work from. If I am having trouble focusing on class, I can play some light music in the background. Also, it helps a lot with social anxiety, when I am in class I can focus on a class instead of other small meaningless things. I remember in an in-person class I was taping the paper I was using for notes so it was aligned to the blank paper below. The noise it made was much louder than I was expecting, suddenly, instead of focusing on class, I was distracted by thinking far too much about everyone else reaction (which was entirely presumed). From this, I lost a good 5 minutes of class time due to distraction, and it only made the following time a bit worse because I had to catch up with what was going on. This isn't a problem in online classes, I only worry about the class itself and can do what I need to aid in that focus. 'Hell is other people' and whatnot."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2983,"Online classes have been very helpful for me with my learning. I do not have any problems with any of my online classes and I actually would prefer having online classes over in person. The reason for that is that I have to do a long commute to campus and that takes a lot of my time as well as it is a huge hassle. Having online classes is nice for me because I can simply attend class while being at home. As for self-care, I have been trying to get back into exercising and eating healthier. I also enjoy doing at-home face masks and giving myself a manicure once in a while. Being a full-time student can be stressful sometimes and it can make you forget about taking care of yourself. It is important to always take care of yourself no matter how hard life gets especially with school."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2976,"With online classes, it helped me become more flexible with my time between self-care and doing work. Once class ends, I can always go off to do something else for a bit before coming back to work, and I can always go on my own pace since I'm living in my own house and I'm free to do whatever I need to do without having to travel from class to class on a large campus. However, looking at a screen 24/7 does get tiring since that's where all my work comes from, and it does get tiring and hurts on the eyes after a while, and I also am more frequent to family chores since I'm always available home."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2986,"online classes really give me more time to manage the work and life, and more time from the school wise, because I do not have to go to school everyday waking up early and spend time on just go to school, saving time and more sleep and easier class style that you do not have to sit in class, I feel online classes are giving me more convenience than usual and bring more time for me"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2980,Online classes have really impacted my learning since I don’t get to converse with my group partners and talk to the about work. Although I really did enjoy being able to do classes online since I have to commute to sf for my in person classes. Some concerns I have of my learning is that it might not stick like it would if I was to actually be in an in person class. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2975,"To be honest, I don’t feel as though online classes have impacted my learning as much as people would assume. I think it's a byproduct of the fact that I have never gone to college in person, all I have ever known is online learning, at least in my college years. If anything I'm more scared to go back to in person learning. Personally I believe I excel at socializing, it's fun and comes easy to me but what I've learned through online learning is I very much value my alone time. Talking face to face, commuting somewhere, sitting in a classroom all of that is exhausting. Yeah I can do it and yeah it's not difficult but it's just not really my speed. I've always wanted to work from home. It provides me with time and a sense of self comfort that in person doesn’t. If anything my mental health has improved because of online learning and I don’t need to do anything in terms of self care because not stressing about getting late to school, not stressing about how I look, not stressing about how to act around a professor, and overall simply having no worries at all is a byproduct of online learning. Do I think I'll benefit from in person learning, probably. I'll make more connections with people, probably learn better because I'm in an environment that forces me to learn, and overall I'll probably enjoy meeting new people and what not. However the last two years online have been a blast, scheduling things like hanging out with friends, work, and sports is much easier and managing my life overall is far easier than it ever was when I had to go to, let's say, high school. So to sum it up, I'm doing great and I don’t feel as though my education has been that impacted, especially since I'm a computer science major, and online classes have been the best thing for me mentally since ever. I'm scared to go in person, a little excited, but it's inevitable I think I'll manage but I can’t wait to get a position that allows me to have this me time again, to work from home and hey maybe when that day comes I'll have kids and be able to spend more time with them as well. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2973,"I feel that online classes have not impacted my learning as much as I thought it was going to. I will have to admit I had a rough start at the beginning of the pandemic because I wasn't as accommodated to everything being online. I hated not having the professors around to ask questions in person. But after the second semester of online classes I was able to get a feel of everything. I was able to do more online research of concepts I did not understand, practice more problems and do some coding for fun! This pushed my coding level a bit more and I was able to teach myself a couple different things before I saw them in class."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2978,"In my self opinion, I think online classes have a positive and negative impact on my education experience when it comes to learning because it has helped me a lot, but also has affected me in some parts of my learning. The positive part I can find is flexibility when it comes to scheduling classes and that I can take them at home, no need to travel and spend money on gas and parking, and sometimes I could even take classes in my own time without a schedule. Another positive impact was that I could repeat my recordings of classes that are difficult to understand. I was also able to manage my time and give myself rest and some exploration around the city, I think that has helped a lot. The negative impact is that during online classes I can’t feel the same excitement as If I was taking the class on campus, plus there are lots of distractions at home. As covid still exists, I am trying my best to avoid stress and be able to perform well in school. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2981,Online learning is more convenient for me since I need to work in order to buy a car. While online learning might be more convenient it is also hard at the same time because sometimes I lose track of time and end up attending class late compared to if I was attending an in-person class. My work hours conflict with my classes which can be hard for me because I have to choose between attending my class or keep working; but obviously earning a college degree is a major goal of mine so I choose attending class over my work. Since I have a lot of things that I am doing outside of school it can be hard being organized and staying on task but I use google calendar to plan my week and assignments that I need to complete by the end of the week. I am concerned that I would lose motivation for class since I am not in a traditional setting for my class.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2234,"To be honest, the online classes had a great impact on me. I got back to China the first-semester SFSU announced we are going to have online classes. On one hand, studying online can be really flexible for me, but on the other hand, I have to attend my lessons during the late night in China and this brings me some illness so I have to go to hospital very often also coast me a lot."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2984,"Online classes helped me relax a bit more since I do not like being around people too much. I am more of an at home person, and learning at home comfortably and at my own time helps me a lot. I have been working out sometimes and going on hikes since online classes means I barely go out now. Some concerns are only not getting enough sun and being in my room all day gets very depressing. It is alos harder to make friends in class, to help pass classes, though doing discord is also very helpful."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2971,"Since my first year of college I have been in a online learning term, since taking one of my hardest class being calc 1 and 2 online and not having that in person help you would get if it were to be in person. I had to come up with ideas of how I would learn and comprehend what I was learning, as well as how to no distract myself since being in home can be very distracting. I created a in home office in my room and made it into my small learning environment, I removed all annoying things from my room including my video games and phone when class started. Always trying my hardest to get my  8 hours of sleep and as well taking care of my eating habits. It’s like learning how to learn again. I had to try my hardest to make friends since all we saw from each other was a black screen in the zoom class. But overall I do feel grateful, some do not get the opportunity to be able what I am having."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2960,"Online classes have had a net positive for me I think. There are some downsides like the feeling of not syncing well with a professor and not being able to do much about it. As a gamer we can easily forget that we aren’t talking to a screen but a person on the other side, and I feel like that also is problematic for online classes. But regardless of that for my mental health and all that self care is great. I appreciate being able to do things at my own time and not a set time that someone else is forcing me to do because I work better and think better later at night, whereas I know I used to have classes all morning and I was just so slow. Retention was difficult as well. I take care of my physical as well by exercising and eating well with a proper sleep schedule of 10-6 sleep time but I am still bad at mornings so its great to choose my own time. I even was able to leave to mexico for a week because I did all my work earlier instead of being forced at certain times."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2979,"Transitioning from in person to online classes was not easy for me. I struggled very much so at the beginning of the pandemic with doing classwork. Online classes were very unmotivating for me, and it was hard for me to get assignments done. Over the past two years, I have gotten better at doing online classes, as I add everything to my calendar and try to get everything done as soon as possible. At the beginning of the pandemic, it was really hard for me to get motivated. I struggled a lot, and my gpa suffered. It was really hard for me to stay positive, but I eventually pulled through it. Online classes in general have been harder for everyone, even professors. Everyone is less motivated and people find it harder to submit assignments or even do assignments on time. I feel like having a combination of in person and online classes is the best thing for a lot of people. For me, I try to get exercise into my day to improve my situation. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2985,Honestly the whole stay at home thing is not getting to me. I am pretty worried about doing well in classes because I am getting stressed with deadlines from online classes because there is often not a reminder when assignments are due that that can throw me off.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2965,"I think that online classes have given me a positive impact on my learning, but not on my self-care. I say this because I forgot how to balance the school, work, and life schedule. I have more time on my hands to study and finish up homework and assignments have the class because I don't have time wasted unlike commuting to school and having to walk to class. I've focused a lot more, but it has taken a toll on my self-care. With the unlimited time, I forget that I have to end school and focus on myself. That's the challenging part of an online class or for me at least. I hope in the next semester I can balance out this and give myself a break from time to time."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2959,"I only have one online class this semester. It feels nice having it my first class on a Friday because I'm not in a rush to get there on time. I do however, tend to forget about assignments or if I have a reminder, I would set it aside while I finish my work for my in person classes. This is stressing me out because I dislike turning in assignments late. Compared to last semester where I only had two classes in person, I have way more late assignments this semester. I also liked my online classes because I was already home so I can quickly relax in the 15 minute break between my classes. I thought it was interesting but also makes sense. I spend more time traveling than I did when I had all or majority of my classes online. I have less time to spend on taking care of myself and any time I do is spent on my class work. "
