2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,341,"My goals, finally after serving for 21 years in the Navy, are to buy a house, finish my degree, being my Masters/PhD to achieve my major end goal of becoming a college professor. I truly love and enjoy anything to do with the Universe and Galaxy, and that love and desire helped me decide to change my major to Astrophysics. Initially my degree was International Politics, which after serving for so long, decided that I really don’t like the degree choice and made the change upon retiring earlier this year. I feel that in order for you to be successful and do justice to your degree and professorship, that one must love and be passionate about what they are sharing and passing on to eager-to-learn students. I believe this class is a huge stepping-stone in reaching that goal with taking my first physics class ever and using math that I have not used for over 20 years, haha. I feel that delving into the material, I’ll be quite knowledgeable and proficient in the ins and outs of physics. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2963,"I feel like growing up, we all wanted to be something specific like a firefighter or a doctor, but as I have got older, that feeling got more and more distant. I feel more lost than ever at this point in my life, but the one thing I am sure of is that my goal is to be a productive member of society by working in the civil engineering field to make the world a better place. I believe that taking physics will educate me with the knowledge I need to succeed in the field of engineering. After completing all the labs and lectures, I believe that I'll be prepared to go into the field and deal with various tasks that will be thrown at me. I also think that this class prepares me to work with others. Working with others to complete the main task is very important and can be more productive than doing it alone."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2984,"My goal is to open a spa one day, I have not figured out whether it will be a korean spa or a japnese onsen type. That is the further out goal, but short term goal is to find a new side job for school. Physics could help me incorporate  different ideas into my spa architecture or dynamics, but I would rather trust a physicist and an architect, rather than myself. I always wanted to try programming games or help create short films and I know that takes alot of knowledge in physics. Basically my main goal is just get a new job at the moment."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2977,"In the end my ultimate goals in academia are to get my degree. I've been struggling to get my degree for a while and have been in college for such a long time. This class would help me get my degree however it would also teach me fundamentals of electricity which could help me in the field. Knowing the basics of how capacitors and resistors, etc are used are commonly found in computer hardware. I was learning how to create simple programs in a breadboard which required this. Especially in the field of embedded systems I can utilize the knowledge I gain from this class. I also have a fond appreciation of how radio systems work and in a way the components in radio systems and radio software utilize the concepts that are taught in this class. Knowing how fields work are a fundamental part of knowing what can affect the range of a rf wave and knowing this would allow us to manipulate these frequencies with much accuracy."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2976,"My goals are mostly being able to find a sustainable job in life, while also being able to work efficiently in one. It doesn't necessarily matter what type of job that I find, all that matters is that mostly find one that I'm most comfortable in, while trying to use my skills of efficiency, communication, and determination to do swell at. This class, like previous labs, might help me since I have to work in a group while also trying to get lab work done as soon as possible. So by doing this, it can greatly help me with my future careers."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2974,My goal is to have a stable future for family and I. We plan to move to the Philippines when we save enough to start a small business and to build a homestead in the province. We plan to live as close to off-the-grid as possible and we only see it possible for us in the Philippines. This class helps me a lot because it helps me prepare for a career. I do hope to have job to help save up. I also can use the knowledge and skills that I learn here and apply them to what ever I may need them for in the future. I'm really hoping I can accomplish this within 10 years.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2965,"My goal for this semester is to get a B or higher in all my classes. I'm not the smartest, but I work hard and like to get things done. For this class to help me achieve this goal is to have a visual presentation for the lab, which we sometimes have, and I appreciate it. Also, a step-by-step process to get a better understanding of each topic we learn. So far, this class has been great in doing so. Especially the group work. Everyone is so helpful."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2959,"This is one of my heavier semesters so far because of all the math and science classes. It’s definitely felt like that so far and I can feel the pressure of understanding different lessons all requiring different versions of the same vocabulary. However, even with those difficulties I do wish to pass all my classes to help me stay on track on graduating within 4 years. That being said, science is not my strongest suite and physics was a challenge in high school and it was also a challenge last semester. But since I put in all my effort and more time to understand the concepts, I was able to pass the class with a B. I plan on doing the same for this course, despite it being tiring. I believe in myself and hope to form productive habits of writing down assignments with their due dates and built the habit of doing the work before it’s actually due. But I’m a procrastinator and it’s my biggest bad habit but I know I can work well to avoid turning in multiple important assignments only with a few minutes left. This is definitely not a good example, but I will take this as a lesson in why waiting last minute is not good. Especially when my group mates grades also depend on assignments getting turned in. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2972,"My first goal is to understand how things work from the first principles. This lab helps me better understand the subject. For example, one of the subjects doesn’t make sense to me in the physics class when we go over that subject in the lab. It helps me to understand the concept. It helps me think critically about the subject. My second goal is to make reviews on the subject. When I learn about physics, it makes me appreciate the beauty and patterns in the world. My third goal is that learn to study productively and efficiently. My fourth goal is to work productively in diverse groups. Also, drawing the diagram helps me understand the concept more. When the classmate doesn’t understand the concept, we try to help each other to understand the concept. Suppose I keep following these rules. It will help me to be successful in the class.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2973,"A couple of goals that I have for me are to be more self-motivated and complete good quality work on time. I want to be able to be proud of the work I do and ask questions when I feel stuck on something and not struggle through anything. This physics class can help me prepare for these goals by doing the work that I am asked to do with my group. It also helps me communicate with my group mates and complete good quality of work. I feel that this class also helps me be self-motivated by the way the zoom class energy is. What I mean by the classroom energy, is that the professor always makes the topics for the lab interesting which makes me want to do work. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2981,"I believe this class will help me achieve my goal because physics helps us to understand how things work around us, from lightbulbs, controllers,   and phones, to muscles, lungs, and brains; from pictures, to cars, cameras; from earthquakes, tsunamis, and hurricanes, to quarks, DNA, and black holes. The study of physics helps us to express our creativity, to see the world in new ways, and to change it. Another reason is that physics also opens doors to many career options. Lack of physics also closes a variety of career options. A person without physics will never be an engineer or doctor; they will be considerably less likely to become a teacher; their video games and animated movies won't look realistic; and their personal views on global warming will be less convincing. In other words my chances of learning about cars or being in the engineering field are extremely low."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2978,"My main goal is to learn way more about physics and enjoy it on my way there because I like it so much but also my civil engineering major has a lot to do with this subject. I think this class can really help me to achieve these goals because most of  the topics in this class are related with the topics I am interested in and also sometimes related to the topics my major is about. That makes me excited. I want to succeed in this field as well as to succeed in this class. I have taken several physics classes and sometimes don't even care about the grade as long as I am learning, but now I also care about my grade. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2982,"My ultimate goal is to find a decent job. One crucial thing I can do to become more skilled in my field is to improve my problem solving skills, and Physics is supposed to help with that. Although, the truth is, as I learn more about Physics, the more I realize that Physics really is not my cup of tea. This doesn't mean that I don't see the value in this class and its partner lecture class. I think that I am training my problem solving muscles when I do practice problems. But if it were up to me, I'd make sure that this quarter of Physics classes would be my last quarter taking Physics classes."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2966,"My goal is want to get a B or A grade in this class, to help me achieve this goal, I will come to class on time and work with my groupmate. Also, I will share any ideas with my groupmate to finish our lab, when I don't understand any question, I will ask my groupmate or professor because they are really helpful. this class is related to the PHYS 230, so I will also focus study the material in that class and use that class knowledge to finish the lab in this class. I think the most important thing is how to work with my groupmate because when working well with them, I will have fewer problems and can finish the lab early, they also can share ideas with me to improve my skill."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2969,"My goals I guess for my future would be to excel as a programmer. Not only a programmer but also as an artist (I love to make digital things/assets). This class is mainly part of the prerequisites for computer science, but there is also a positive side of things, I guess something that doesn't just say, ""I took your class only for the prereqs"". Physics include how an object moves, something needed if the programmer, someone working on a game of sorts, have objects that move around and having to simulate the idea of forces and momentum with velocity brings that idea to life, with a mix of math for path creation."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2968,"My goal is to become a full fledged Software Developer and to be able to create iPhone Apps or be a part of a big company, like Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc. and be a part of their iOS team and contribute in projects that will benefit society and make technology more user friendly. This class will help in a tremendous way because physics is a huge part of programming, for ex. in order for your phone/app to automatically change the orientation of your screen, we must understand the gyroscope functionality and be able to determine how to elongate or shorten the screen so that it has the most optimal output. Also if there is a function that we need to program, like a pedometer, we must use various physics functions in order to accurately record the data."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2971,"As a engineering major, PHYS of calc 2 is very important to me and related to my goals in person because I always want to be ahead of what I am capable of. I had a goal in the beginning of the year which was to not quite and get a B grade at the lowest, I did have times of slack and times that I did not feel like what I was learning would be important to me. I do feel like being in this class helped me with my other classes since this was my more advanced class. As well My goal is to become a electric engineer so stuff like current and magnetic poles are interesting and have gave me an idea of what are some things I will be doing in the future. I do plan to also take calc 3 over the summer so refreshing my brain and learning things that will carry over is always a must have!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2961,"My goal is to deal with the different kinds of questions from science in my academic study. If I can solve those questions, I can know what different contents and physical knowledge and use them in my other aspects. If I can handle a different kind of knowledge of physics and science, I will know how to use them in my daily life. Also, my major is computer science. If I know to use this knowledge in my academic study life, I can do a better program in the future. Therefore, I will know why the physical context comes from, and I will understand that knowledge more clearly. When I am doing the lab, I can know every step of the process of exploring physics, so I can handle physics more and more familiar. All in all, the lab can make me practice my scientific thinking. In the future, when I think about the other lab, I know how to do it and how to make this lab more accurate.     "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2975,"I’ve stated this before that I have this innate ever growing interest for technology, one that pushes me to further understand what allows society to function at the ever increasing rate it does today. Understanding subjects such as Mathematics and Physics are a byproduct of this in turn being another sub interest. Though as time passes I slowly start to come to terms with a lot of realistic realities modern humans are faced with. I love technology. I'm fortunate enough to be entering a field that corresponds with my interest but I believe I am ever more fortunate that the field can provide me with an income that allows me to live a comfortable life. I don’t know if my changing mindset is due to a change of heart or if it's simply the passing of time getting to me, but I grow ever so tired and ever so, with lack of a better term, selfish. I want an easy income with benefits other professions can’t provide. Time management that allows me to start a family, at home work that allows me to tend to that family, code that allows me to mindlessly type with minimal effort. I guess my goals come down to, I want to have an easy and happy life with a middle class income. If my hunger for learning about technology is fulfilled as a consequence of that easy life, then all the better for me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2964,"Some of my goals are to pass my major courses with the highest grade possible. This course is one of my major requirements and I want to know all the content so I can practice my degree to the best of my ability. This class can help me achieve that goal by learning skills that will help me out in the future. How to study properly, how to communicate with others during labs or any other group work, and how to ask for help when I really need it. Understanding physics will help me in my development with computer science. If I ever need to program something where physics is involved, I can already know the steps to building a proper program with physics. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2985,This class is a requirement. I don't know how I will apply this class to my major. I suppose learning about the physics behind a circuit board might be helpful but I am not sure what else it can help me in. I don’t really understand what physics has to do with CS other than the electricity parts of physics. I don’t plan on working with hardware or repair so I don’t think this will be very helpful. I don't know what I am supposed to do about the rest of physics 1. The topics in physics 2 are more interesting but hardly something I would think about in my daily like or even professional life. I guess I just have to keep working on this until something clicks. I enjoy working in groups and group work is fun but I don't think team building is part of the curriculum.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2987,"I think my goals aren't entirely aligned with this class and physics and cyber security have somewhat limited overlap. But I find I lot of value in what I learn here for personal enjoyment and because some topics will be extremely important to my future. A lot of modern computer tech is built primarily with physics skills, for example, Wifi relies heavily on understanding EM waves and the EM spectrum. I even have a parabolic Wifi antenna made for picking up connections at extremely long ranges and it helps to understand how exactly it works to make better use of it. But getting back to my point, cyber security requires being crafty and intuitive. Why find a Zero Day to get into a system when you can shimmy the door to the server open? Continuing my understand of the world is fundamental to my career and this class in an important part of that."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2957,"My goal is to finish college with a degree in Astronomy, Astrophysics? who knows but Astronomy is what I'm trying to achieve and get. This class is one of the many steps towards my goal, the lab is to help me further understand the concept of physics via doing physical or technological tests to show how this physics concept works. Physics still confuses me, even when I ""finally"" understand some of it, but it's a process that I must go through before reaching my goal. A long process that has no shortcuts, only just a slow and steady learning moment in my life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2962,"My academic goals are to purely graduate school as soon as possible. It's easier than done, but that is the only goal I pretty much have right now and then I can go look for a job. I just want to settle down in life and build it from when I have income. This class will help me by passing this class and having the units to be able to move on to the next class. I'm not sure what other goal I would have in mind right now, for a small minded person like me, I can focus on one goal at a time, though i would like to focus on multiple. But someone told me focusing on multiple is okay even when it takes longer because life isn't going anywhere. And sometimes I like to rush things, I tend to forget i'm considered ""young"" and that I need to slow down."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2970,"My goals in this class is to completely grasp everything within the labs. I’m trying my best to make sure that the lectures we have are under my full attention so that way I don’t have too much trouble when doing the lab. I’m also trying to make sure that the material we cover is something that will stick with me for future references. So far what we’ve covered in class has mainly gone over electrical charges as well as the intricacies of an electrical field . I feel that so far with these labs, I have been able to retain most of the knowledge and I’m quite happy with that. This is so that later on I can possibly apply this knowledge into some possible future problems."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2980,My goals are to continue studying computer science and eventually graduate and get a bachelors in computer science. My goals connect to this class because this class in one of many required classes for me before I start getting into actual major classes. This class can help me achieve my goals by helping me get through the next steps into my computer science degree. It also helps a lot that we can meet other people that may be  in similar majors which can also help you a lot in the long run. The more people you meet is more help that you can get whenever you are getting stuck
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2986,"My goal is to have more thoughtful ideas and careful execution when doing things, so the lab can help me practice how to think through the process and then lead to the result that I will need to do the lab carefully and since my major is computer science those 2 skills are most important because when writing a code you need to think how you going to write it and then input it carefully because one mistake can end up making your code not working. So in this lab class, I feel like I can learn these 2 important value skills that very helpful for my future career."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2988,"My goals are to understand the fundamentals of physics so I can use them to write useful code that will benefit me for fit jobs in the future. Although many people say that math isn't always needed for coding, I still believe it is very important to fully understand the topics for computer science. In this case, when we learned about the electric fields, the topic stems to engineers but it also goes into the computer science fields such as computer engineering where students learn about motherboards and how it operates."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2958,The main goal that I have at SFSU is to graduate in the IT field. I want to graduate then get a well-paying job so that I won't have to struggle for the future. This class is a stepping stone in helping me achieve this goal because physics is one of the core requirements for graduating in the IT field. Some long-term goals that I have are traveling to different countries and trying different types of food. This class can help me achieve my goal because working together in groups and doing problems together helps with my social skill which I will need in the future and learning how to work as a team is also another skill that I will need. Other than that the only other way this class helps me is that this is a prerequisite for other classes that I need.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2979,"One of the main things that I want to get out of this class is a better problem solving method and skills. I am a computer science major, and solving problems will be my entire job. Physics is very different from something like coding, but the strategies used to solve problems are somewhat similar. In computer science, the best way to solve a problem is to spend 90% of your time trying to map out the solution and 10% actually writing the answer. This is somewhat similar to what we are doing in this class, as I need to map out the problem in order to solve it. Creating a diagram, writing down the equations and knowns/unknowns is a great way to set yourself up for success when getting the answer. This class makes you do all of these things, which is great practice for me. I hope that my skills in problem solving methodology will improve as a result of this class. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2967,"My goals in this class is to have a strong understanding and foundation of physics that I can use in the future when moving forward onto more advanced physics classes and engineering classes. This class and the participants in the class have greatly benefitted and helped me on working towards this goal. Although this class is all online and my interactions with other students and teachers are very limited, this class in particular is more lively than my current and previous online classes. I don't find myself feeling alone and unmotivated when I have an active class that has helped me understand topics I first found confusing. One prime example of this is my lab partner, where in the beginning I worried about going into breakout rooms and facing nothing but silence and black screens, but my lab partner has been the complete opposite. I find myself more engaged and understanding the material better since my lab partner and I are constantly interacting, whether that be on the actual lab, or simply talking about our day or life experiences. He has helped me when I find myself stuck at a problem and I have helped him in similar scenarios. Overall if participation from this class continues as it is right now, I am confident I will accomplish my goals by the end of the semester. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2983,"My goal is to be happy and successful in what I do. I want to learn and do well in all of my classes so I can achieve my degree. This class will help me with my goals because it will help me learn physics as well as help me achieve my degree. This class is one of the requirements in order for me to achieve my degree. My major is computer science and being able to know physics can be very helpful. That is why I am glad I am taking this class. I believe achieving my degree will be one of the biggest accomplishments for me in my life and that is why I am pursuing it right now. After graduating, I hope to get a good-paying job and become a homeowner because that will make me happy. I believe that is success in my eyes, graduating and having my own home."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2960,"I’ve probably talked a lot about my goals because this prompt feels like it keeps coming up for my physics labs. I think long term it might not help a crazy amount but obviously it is a requirement for my degree so it is necessary. I’m not too sure exactly how it will help really because all of my friends who are already in the programming world are also confused why I would need physics but oh well it is what it is. I think another goal though besides academics is to be happy, and kind of a lot of things are going on in the world like russia and china events that are occurring on top of the bad that already has been occurring which doesn’t add to my happiness really. At least a new video game came out and it has been keeping me a bit more distracted but I also like this class because it’s longer on fridays and it gives me something to do instead of checking the news or something so I think that also is really beneficial for me, whether it's intended or not."
