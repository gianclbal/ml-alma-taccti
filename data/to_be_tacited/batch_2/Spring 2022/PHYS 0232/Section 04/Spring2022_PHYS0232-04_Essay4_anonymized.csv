2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2874,"In my opinion, I think to be back into in person class is better that online learning. The reason why is because I took online lab before and the learning vibes really cannot compare with in person class. For in person class, we can ask question to the instructor when we have question and sometimes is better to explain and show working face to face and we can focus and easy to follow the syllabus. However, for online class, we can have the interaction with people and people doesn't ask question even they are curios about something. So, I think in person class is way. better than online lab."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2871,"I've really enjoyed the transition from online learning to in person because it's easier for me to interact with the teacher and students during class. I am also more focused in class because of the classroom environment. I like being on campus as well to use the resources we have like the library and the ability to meet up with other students to study or work on projects. I am glad we're still all wearing masks indoors and that hand sanitizer and the ability to wash our hands and keep ourselves clean is alway available because it makes me feel a lot safer. I also like that the school provides on campus testing just in case we need it. For self care, it has been a little hard to balance my school work and my other hobbies and interests, so I've been exploring a lot of different ways to manage my time. I always need to remember to fit in time to relax and let go a lot of the stress that school gives me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2883,My transition from online to in person class was difficult at first many of my classes were quite and had no type of energy. Everyone including myself felt out of place and in a sense timid. But as weeks went on it became more familiar and a breathe of fresh air. I actually prefer in person classes it easier to learn and pay attention while zoom class is full of distraction. Also feels like you could have a relation with your professor. I've been meeting a lot of new people as well and networking is always easier in person I feel.  As far as self cares goes I haven't been eating a lot money has be tight so I don't feel my bad but I know sooner or later things will get better. I do try to get my occasional workout in but it does take up a lot of my energy. I just try to stay positive and when I do eat I make sure its something nutritional that'll give me the energy to get through my day. But besides that I feel great and I am in a cheerful mood to learn and get good grades. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2877,"Transitioning to in person classes have been hard especially after getting used to being 100% online. Im liking online to be a lot better than in person because of the fact that I am able to do it from my home or wherever im at. Some concerns I have for my well learning and well being is, getting used to not having access to those online lectures whenever I like. The one thing I loved most about being online was that I was able to go back to the lecture recordings and go over what we did in class. It will be hard to transition from that knowing I won't be able to go back through it. I need to get back in the loop of going to class and taking very thorough notes, and be attentive. Its already hard enough for me to pay attention in my classes due to my ADD, but its something I personally need to work toward. For that being said, for my own self care, I need to make sure I get plenty of sleep the night before and create a planner of what I will be doing that day. I also take 30 minute breaks if I am sitting down to much just so I can focus back in and get my work done."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2880,"Transitioning back to in-person classes has been a snap back-to-reality moment. Prior to online classes, I would wake up, get ready for university and attend live lectures. Although, after the change, I would wake up, open the laptop, and join the online class. Now, the process has been reversed again with more precaution. These alterations have definitely caused changes in my study routine. In addition, for self-care, I spend time with friends and family. I feel relaxed and calm the most when I am with them. In short, most of my day's stressors would vanish when my close ones were around. Moreover, one thing I do enjoy about live classes is my tendency to not procrastinate. When I'm at university, I'm surrounded by people that want to learn. However, when I'm at home, I have a strong desire to postpone work. Due to this desire to change, I am now on top of my tasks and homework."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2296,"The transitioning to in person classes impacted my learning subject in different ways. The first thing has changed is the transportation. We now have to taking buss or driving a car to school instead of having online lecture at home, which mean we having to wake up 30-1hour early. During that moment I have to take of myself preventing getting any healthy issue, since we are still under the danger of COVID. The other important thing is making relationship with other student. Since we are now having in person lecture, so it would not like the quiet situation with the online class meeting. Online we are working independently because people having technical issue which not allow them communicating like In person, and now we are focusing on the collaborating aka team work. Students who didn't feel like they were a part of a school community became even more disengaged during distance learning. Additionally, students who were less experienced with digital platforms had difficulty keeping up during remote instruction."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2879,"When classes became remote over two years ago, I definitely felt that I was not getting much out of my college. It just felt like online learning was not for me because I learn way better when I am interacting with the people in my class and I just feel like having a good discussion about what you are learning is the best way of getting grasp of a topic.  When classes started transitioning into in-person, I could definitely breathe a sigh of relief because I was excited to go to college in person. I wanted to get as much knowledge out of my courses as I can. So, I was very comfortable and happy while transitioning to in-person instructions. I feel like I am learning a lot better now and interacting with my classmates has improved my understanding of topics.  I am taking care of my well being by minimizing my workload and focusing mainly on my major classes. I did not register for any class that is on Friday so that gives me a 3 day weekend. Only concern that I have for my well being is that I hope I don’t feel lonely and make a lot of friends."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2870,"I am not a great student online, it is very hard for me to maintain focus because there is so many distractions. Having the option to have class any where you want is dangerous because nine times out of ten we chose the bed. Then the trickle effect happened we get complacent and for get about class and work. The in the end you struggling to catch up in the last month. In person classes keeps structure for me and does not let me waiver from what need to be done. When I get in a routine of doing something I tend to follow it to a tee. There were no incentives for taking online classes. At least for in person classes if you do not go you do not learn and you will eventually fail. It has been rough because this was a hybrid year and was very different  trying to manage everything and start regimented. My well being and mental did suffer a little bit but slowly but surely I am getting better."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,58,"Coming back to in person classes has been great i was able to make friends but it wasn't all positive i got home sick the first semester then i also was struggling to make close friends. I had ""friends"" but looking back they where just fake we would only hang out to go to parties and we would always just be drinking. Adapting to in person class once again was also difficult since you actually need an attentions span to be in class . I was so use to being on my phone wile my class was playing in the background i had to learn how to be away from my phone from class time. I didn't thing i was addicting to my phone till i came back to in person classes. you also have to make time to get to class i had to start getting up a little earlier since their was no being able to show up to class wile being wrapped up in my blanket "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,1046,In-person classes have been very enjoyable and I've appreciated the transition of going back to in-person classes. I didn't always enjoy taking classes exclusively over Zoom and I think it took a serious toll on my mental health. I feel much better now that I am back taking classes at the university and seeing my peers again. I am much happier with my current classes than I was in previous semesters. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2869,"Transitioning to in-person classes has been a great benefit for my physical health. Online classes don't have that sort of interactivity and living feeling that in-person classes do. Seeing everyone in my class was neat compared to seeing names on a zoom screen. There are a few drawbacks, though, as some classes worked a lot better online (like my computer science classes), and being in-person for them brings on a lot of problems that I would've done better with online.For self-care, I guess some of the things I do is sleep early and try not to have as many early-morning or later night classes. Unfortunately as I'm progressing through my major this becomes more problematic as a lot more classes are at times I don't want and I have to juggle their workload a lot more. I just want good in-person classes at times that work for my health and unfortunately this semester didn't work out for me as well as previous ones. This lab was cool though."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2876,"To be honest the transition to in person has both its positives and negatives for me personally. But so far, the good things about in person learning, is that the labs are by far more engaging than the online labs. The online labs just had people in breakout rooms who would just prefer to work individually because coordinating an experiment over Zoom was too much and too awkward for students. My experience with this lab has been great so far since I can physically touch and set up the equipment to do the experiment. Additionally, this time I have teammates who I can work with face to face. In person also made it easier to cooperate with other groups who might be struggling with the same problem and it is also extremely easy to contact the lab instructor in person as well. The main problem I have with in person classes versus online classes is the commute. I sincerely despise the commute time because I feel like so much of my time is wasted doing nothing on public transport which was not a problem during online learning. In online learning I was able to squeeze out every last second of time I had and got a lot of value out of it. In terms of mental health, I dread school but I generally feel that when it comes to school so it isn’t that big of a deal."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2882,"It was challenging to transition to an in-person class. I believe that online classes were useful; they were challenging at first, but they finally proved useful. To get to the university, I now have to commute for more than an hour. To get to my classes, I had to get up early. I take care of myself by getting enough sleep, eating a nutritious food, and making time for me. Some of my fears include the possibility that I will struggle in some of my classes as a result of the transition."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2881,"I think that transitioning to in-person classes has improved my learning in some ways and hurt it in others. I definitely benefit from being around other students and being able to talk and learn with them. But the fact the in-person lectures can't be recorded is definitely a minus there is only so much you can glean from notes and slides. As for my self-care, I'm not exactly sure what context this is meant in, like just in general? or specifically, surrounding learning and classes? I have been trying to make sure I keep a good routine so that I can get up in time for my classes without losing sleep since you can just wake up and turn on the zoom normally. I would say that I have been doing a decent job. So overall my main concern for my learning is just the loss of recorded lectures. And for my well-being, I just need to make sure I prioritize my health and sleep."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2878,"In-person classes were helpful for me because it's definitely better in some ways than just interacting with people on zoom. One thing that makes it better is the fact that you can see the people and interact with them in real life. This has made our communication and teamwork much more efficient and productive than on zoom. One thing I liked about zoom classes was the fact that I didn't have to commute all the way to school for class, this has saved me a lot of money and time that I can spend working on things at home. For self-care, I take breaks in between long work sessions maybe every 2-3 hours, and just walk around outside and get some fresh air and sun. I think it's important to have some downtime and spend some time relaxing and taking my mind off studying because it can help make you more productive when it's time to go back to studying. I honestly don't have major concerns regarding my well-being and learning I am thankful that I am doing as well as I am right now. My main focus has been trying to learn how to be more productive in my studying so that I can learn more and study less so that I can have a balanced work-life in this distractive world."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2872,"Transitioning to In-person hasn't been as dramatic as I initially imagined, I thought I'd be struggling to socialize and learn good habits aka not being too dependent on my devices but so far it's been going well. I definitely feel like I learn better in an In-person classroom as opposed to zoom learning. The biggest difference between the two is that I am able to get help almost immediately when class is in-person, on zoom it's kind of a hit or miss with getting help with obstacles like communicating through a screen, being able to effectively screen share, and overall, having a stable wifi connection. Those aren't a concern for when I'm in an in-person class. For self-care I take time for myself and keep up with my favorite shows like Brooklyn99 and American Dad! My only concern for my learning and well being is to balance both effectively and not get burned out or fall behind."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2873,"I learn better in person rather than online, although online does offer mroe time for me to study. Commuting used to be a problem for me as I used to live two hours away from school, but recently I moved only thirty minute away so I don't need to rush to school and then tire out myself by the time I reach there. Some concerns I have is the pace of school work. With online everything was much easier as professor just posted all resources online and we can go back to review. But now with in person classes some professors actually prefer only giving resources if we are present in class. Personally I find that super weird considering we are learning in school, we didn't pay tuition to have resources withheld from us. That's one thing I don't really like about the whole in person process."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2875,"It’s really crazy since I have been wanting to be in person but when it was time to go back in person, I was not feeling the idea of leaving the house and traveling all the way to school. Now that we are in person, I catch myself just wanting to miss class all the time. I have been working out a little more and I have also been making sure to eat before getting on the train. Having to be conscious about the time I take to get ready. There are so many new things to consider now  that we are in person but it’s very much exciting. I have also been meditating to keep sane."
