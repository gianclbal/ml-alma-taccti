Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2869,"Honestly, I went into the STEM field wanting something fresh to do. I kinda didn't know what to do going into college and I thought the STEM field, specifically computer science, would be something that's fun to jump into. From what I've experienced with 3 semesters done, it IS fun and I've been enjoying comp sci. It's nicely challenging, a lot of subjects flow quite nicely into one another, though (not to be rude but) I don't know how physics really relates into that. Maybe I'll figure it out later down the line. I also went into this because the STEM field plays a pretty important part in our modern society. A lot of computer science has evolved since the mid-1900's and it will likely evolve further, so I want to see how I can contribute to its evolution and hopefully do something with the knowledge I gain from this field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,58,I want to be in stem because i feel like you could make a difference in this field. I feel like you can learn a lot of how thing works. It can give you a better understanding about the universe around you.I feel like stem is less greedy than other fields such as business or doctor. And most importantly cause Im really bad at english and cant see my self writing essays math isn't  to  bad . But most importantly cause it is interesting i want to learn more about our universe and stuff. Its just something that grabs my attention. Something that distracted me something that puts me in the zone. Something i know Im capable of doing.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2870,"All my life I have been in love with learning how things work that is why computer engineering piqued my interest. It always intrigued me to know why things worked how they worked. Day in and day out I would conduct “experiments” that would usually get me into trouble but I have found out useful information. I often found myself taking things apart and either putting them back together and or enhancing them. One day I took apart my computer and couldn’t figure out how to put it together and no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t figure it out. As technology grew so did my fascination with them, the short answer to the question is I love to problem solve the harder the better! Especially when I got to college I quickly realized that it is the only field I'm interested in and want to be in. Technology and its knowledge is so wide, vast and endless. I want to contribute to the culture and grow my passion for this feild. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2871,"I want to go into the STEM field, specifically as a computer science major, because I know that it's a subject and a part of our lives that will always be improving. I feel like even though computing and sciences that have to do with computers have come a long way already, but we are only going to keep innovating things to make our lives better. We're going to need technology and computers forever, so I feel like it's the most sustainable subject I could learn about to help improve things like the phones we use everyday, video games, computers, websites, cars, and anything with a computer in it. Math and science have always been subjects that are more interesting to me than History or writing. I'm more confident in my STEM skills than anything else and what I've learned in STEM subjects have related to my life the most."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2872,I want to go into the STEM field because I find the subject matter to not only be interesting but because they also help our society evolve with new technological breakthroughs that further increase our capabilities as the dominant species. I also wanted to go into stem so that I can represent my ethnic background in the realm of science. I wish to learn more about the world as well as having an impact of some sort.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2873,"Going into STEM was not my first option, I was initially going for Economics. But I really did not see myself doing any business-related things in real life and found myself liking the computer aspects rather than anything else. I used to play alot of video games and this would be my main reason as to why I'm so interested in computers. I initially thought it would not be a good idea to go into STEM as my math is not that good as well, but I do have some sort of interests in math as the more I learn the more I see how it applies to the major I am in. I want to be able to build something from what I learn and experience, and see if it can be used in real life too. I just find inventions very fascinating although I have not started anything yet, but I hope i do one day and so that is why I went for a STEM major."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2296,"Science and engineering professors focus on critical thinking and innovation, logical thinking processes, and problem-solving to help students develop thinking habits that will help them succeed in any field. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics courses challenge students to think critically and come up with their own solutions. Pursuing STEM careers can provide job security and a strong sense of being an indispensable force in our market! Other jobs in IT, computer science, engineering, and other fields have strong job prospects, and those skills will not be replaced for a long time to come, so STEM jobs and careers will be stable. Of course, the most important thing is to enhance personal value by learning the knowledge."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2874,"First of all, one of the reasons why I want to go into STEM field is because my dad told me to study civil engineering major at first and I followed what he planned for me. However, slowly I found that I have my own plan, dream and interest in STEM and my major because I like the satisfaction that I got when I solved the problems. It makes me to be happy and motivate me to learn more in STEM field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,1046,"I really enjoy the idea of being able to create something useful. When I was a child I always wondered how a computer could power on at a push of a button or how they even worked at all. Now that I have more knowledge about how computers work and how to code, I only feel more encouraged to continue studying what makes computers so special to the world. I also want to create something with my knowledge of STEM that will either be useful to the world or very entertaining, hopefully both. As I am graduating this semester, I have no doubt that I will continue to feel strongly about my science education and continue to study further."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2875,"I want to go into the STEM field because I never see anyone who looks like me doing it. I feel like that alone is something that can discourage someone and can also motivate someone depending on how you look at it. The longer I have been in the house talking to other people about the field, I realize that I am not afraid of what’s to come from the field and I feel like I can make a major impact within it. Aside from emotions, I feel that Computer Science is super interesting. Now that I have been relearning Java and now currently taking a Web Development course, things are starting to get very interesting and this is what I was expecting when I first chose the major. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2876,"The reason why I entered the STEM field and more specifically computer science was because I found math and technology interesting to me as a child and became more enveloped by it in middle school. In middle school I was taught the basics of how to code and do online assignments which made me wonder how we made these softwares I use, work. Since programming revolves around logic and math also revolves around logic, it really intertwined with each other. Eventually, this would lead me into wanting to study STEM in college and do computer science in order to become better at math and learn more about how to create my own technologies. There are also other reasons as to why I wanted to pursue a computer science degree, and that is because of job stability and monetary value. The tech industry continues to grow, so I feel like my future job will always have value, but also pay well. The STEM field is quite harsh, but I want to push through all the way to the end of the tunnel."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2877,"I would want to go into the STEM field because I feel like S.T.E.M. is much more than just science, technology, engineering, and math. It is ingrained in our daily lives. S.T.E.M. education fosters the abilities of imagination, inquiry, research, solving problems, and separating fact from opinion, which are critical for the development of coming generations of innovators, critical thinkers, and decision makers. Science is ubiquitous in the world around us, and it is utilized to impact humans and all living things on the planet, which I find intriguing. I feel like anyone can find something in STEM. The focus on solving problems and creating knowledge in STEM can branch off into many things. There are labs, or even stuff in the field. I personally am more interested in the lab aspect, or even space. STEM professions branch out into many different things and have so much diversity, and that’s why I think that STEM would be a great career choice for me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2878,Why do I want to go into the stem field is a good question and there are a lot of things that led me to pursue this field. Both of my parents work in stem fields and growing up they would always help me with my math homework. They are the ones that inspired me I would say the most to pursue a career in the stem field. I also liked to play with puzzles and legos growing up and my favorite movie genre is sci-fi. I knew that I always wanted to get into the stem field because I have a dream of creating a product that would help a lot of people. First I wanted to become a mechanical engineer to build things because I liked being hands-on.  Upon doing research in my senior year of high school I realized that mechanical engineering careers were kind of stagnant and were not growing that much so I couldn't see myself doing it. I finally decided to major in comp sci since I had already taken a couple of courses in high school and was familiar with it. It also aligned with my goals since I can create software that can impact a lot of people and the job outlook for it looks promising.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2879,"Ever since childhood, I have loved solving problems. If it be mathematics or just logical reasoning, I just love the thrill of solving problems. Solving something and making a way out of a problem gives me happiness and makes me fulfilled.   Since I was 12 years old, I have always been intrigued by how good computers are and I have loved working with computers ever since. I was always curious about how softwares work and I wanted to build my own softwares. I started learning programming and animation and just fell in love with it. It was then that I knew I wanted to study computer science in college. I built my own small programs and made simple webpages just to get the hang of it. STEM is for people with logical problem skills and I identify among them. I chose stem also because of the kind of people I would meet that would help me better my problem solving skills."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2880,"The reason I want to pursue a career in STEM is straightforward. Growing up, I was always interested in STEM subjects characterized as SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, and MATHEMATICS. It was one of my most essential and practical topics in high school. I am always eager to learn new things and learn more about STEM. STEM subjects, in my opinion, are always fresh and intriguing. It's a constantly changing topic, as there are always new and inventive things to learn about in fields like medicine, technology, and engineering. We are currently in a technological and scientific era. I'd like to be a part of the change and discover new and creative STEM objects. As a computer science student, my goal for the future is to come up with new algorithms to solve unanswered issues. The reason is I believe that the STEM field will help humanity reach a new level of modernization. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2881,"I think the reason I want to go into the stem field, first of all, I think this is going to be on everyone's reasons at some point or another is the opportunity it gives me a little bit of relief that I won't have to worry about if my job will be relevant or the field is shrinking or anything like that. also am going into this field because I have been a gamer so I've also been around computers and also I've always been good at math probably up until calc 2 so I felt that a stem field esp computer science was the most natural. I think now that I have gotten past a bit of those surface level reasons I am not so sure on my major anymore but I, at least right now, want to try to get my degree and figure it out after that. I guess also something I enjoy about my major and I guess the classes I have to take to enter the stem field is the problem solving I think solving problems has always given me a sense of satisfaction."
