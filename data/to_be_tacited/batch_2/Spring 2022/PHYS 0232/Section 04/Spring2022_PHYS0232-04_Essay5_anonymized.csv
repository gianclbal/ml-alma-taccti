2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2876,"My greatest take away from this class is that teamwork and clear communication is important when conducting experiments. The tiniest of errors can cause an experiment to go wrong. For example, if something is unplugged or not plugged in properly, the data we will most likely be incorrect or the experiment might not work at all. This why clear communication is important when setting up an experiment because we delegate tasks to teammates on what they should do in order to setup the experiment properly. We should also double check each others work when setting up to ensure that the experiment runs smoothly. Teamwork is important because of efficiency, which means getting tasks done much faster than being alone. In terms of physics concepts, I think learning about magnetic fields was the most interesting because I did not realize how important magnets are for many devices like credit cards or hard drives."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2875,"One of the biggest takeaways from this class is just getting the chance to learn about currents and electric fields in person. I wasn’t there very often but when I was, the in person experience made it much more interesting and understandable. Learning about currents and having the power go out and having to use flashlights was one of the coolest days. Some of the other take always involve just being challenged and being able to find the answer to complex lab assignments (lol). Ken is an awesome lab instructor and he knows his stuff pretty well."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2870,"My greatest take away from this class is perseverance. Like I said in a previous reflection is is not about how smart you are or how clever you are. It is about who is willing to do the work and who is willing to stick through it and overcome Andy obstacle thrown at you. I had a lot of fun and interesting times in this class. From not knowing how to use equipment to almost blowing myself up. I do not think this class was designed to be rigors but to be a collaborative effort and to show you, you can do anything you put tour mind to. I enjoyed this class a lot and I am glad that I was able to take this class. I truly had fun despite everything I had to go through this year. This class showed me a lot about myself and how I need to carry on in this field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2880,"Since the beginning of lessons, my physics knowledge and experience have grown at an exponential rate. This class has introduced me to new physics topics in a fascinating and engaging way. Experimenting with new physics technologies like oscilloscopes, resistors, and voltmeters, for example. This lesson is interesting since it covers issues that are similar to those covered in my physics theory class. To put it another way, the concepts we cover in the physics lab are similar to the topics we learn in physics theory class. This becomes a sort of revision and study of previously taught topics. The most important thing I've learned in this class is to work as a team to finish the assignments. To avoid wasting time and sharing ideas during the lab exploration phase, it is critical to operating as a team. As a result, we will be able to learn the content in more depth as a group. It's also crucial to communicate. This, in my opinion, is an important tool for success. To sum up, I enjoy this class and believe that teamwork is essential."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2873,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that experimenting really helps with understanding. With lectures it's just numbers and reviewing terms, but labs are different because we have to get hands-on with the experiments. It helps with the visualizing and overall is the reason why I can understand some of the questions and answers the lecturers give. Whether it's engineering or Physics or some STEM major, I think it's very important to know what we're doing since it's not like we'll be sitting there and writing formulas all day; we do have to understand what we're doing in the field. My first Physics lab was very hard because it was my first time learning Physics and I didn't know exactly what we were supposed to find, and groupmates also struggled so we kind of had to power through the labs as hard as we can. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2877,"My greatest takeaway from this class has to be all the hands on work we have been doing. I feel like some people learn alot more about a topic when they are actually conducting the lab and rather then reading it on a piece of paper. The most essential thing I learnt was how to use what we learned in class to solve problems. The difficult aspect is usually deciding which models or equations to use and how to combine them to address the problem. Another thing I learned is a lot about myself and how I learn, including how crucial it is to keep attempting and practicing tough issues and making errors in order to learn anything valuable."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2874,"My biggest take away from this class would be learning, experimenting and understanding to all of the topic that so far we have learned in this lab session. I found that studying from the textbook, learning and finding method to solve the question for exam and quiz is not the best way to understand deeply to the topic. This lab gave us a chance to participate on doing the experiment about the physics topic which can make us to be more clear about the topic and get the concept of how to do and how it works from the theory that we learn. Learning new things is not hard, but always remember what you have learn before is hard. So, I think the best way to always remember what you have learn before is to do something practical and understand the concept of how it works and this is what we can really get from this lab session."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2883,My greatest take away from this class is learning how to work as a group. There were several times everyone has to do their part and contribute and collaborating was really cool. It was also useful cause once you start your career many jobs require you to work as a group so it definitely good experience. It also helped me gain friends and connection that I never knew I needed. So this class was great in that aspect. Working in groups made solving the labs easier as well because 4 brains are better than one. The labs were also fun because they were mostly hands on and we got to use real equipment. Unlike other classes where we mainly just write down what we see and do paper work. Overall this class was really useful and a lot of fun I will always remember the friendships and connection that I have made in this class. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2882,"The knowledge I received about physics is the most important thing I took away from this class. After two years of being online, being in class was quite beneficial. When we were in class, I think I was able to focus more on what we were doing than when we were doing it online. The instructor is also fantastic; he takes us through each lab step by step. In this class, I had a great time with my classmates and the instructor."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,58,My greatest take away from this class is that when doing science experiments your results may not always be the correct one. Their is a lot of space for error to happen you may be doing all the right steps but some times its just the machine or the place that you're doing your labs in might give you a totally wrong answer. Don' be frustrated and learn how to ask for help. It tought me to take most scientific data with a grain of salt since most experiments are not being made in a controlled environment and their is a lot of space for error. I think this class thought  more than any other class this year cause it is important to remember their mistakes are every where and the slightest  thing can cause them. I also learned how to work together with my group we learned how to divide the work.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2869,"It took a while to think about this, but my greatest take away from this class was that Physics was VERY much present and applicable in everything we do, even if the labs or the specific class itself weren't as practical in showing that. The oscilloscope and the cathode ray lab were probably the most obvious in their application, since a lot of electronic screens used that tech before they advanced. Something like magnetic fields could be used for reading and writing data on a disk for a hard drive, or in something like an MRI where a really strong magnet is used. Electric fields could be used for batteries, since they're made of materials that could conduct and hold a charge, or for other stuff that I kinda forgot but I know are important. Overall, I'm a lot more knowledgeable in how electricity and magnetism play a role in our everyday lives and our modern technology."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2881,"I would say my greatest takeaway is even though this class is early it’s always worth it to show up because even if you think you aren’t missing anything you never know. That kind of attitude can extend to maybe things for this class just turn in what you’ve got which is better than a perfectionist mentality I sometimes can have. Which then I think could translate into perseverance even in scuffed situations like our labs sometimes. So regardless of your circumstances, in this case, maybe old equipment and somewhat faulty results there is always something to learn In any situation. Because you shouldn’t use those as excuses and just persevere and glean as much as you can from the situation. And you never know if you just give up and blame the circumstances you gained nothing but if you stick it through you could still reap the benefits of learning."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,1046,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that I can apply the conceptual parts of physics to a real lab setting. Even if I don't pursue physics work on engineering in the future, the experience gained from a class like this is incredibly valuable to my overall education. I sincerely believe that these labs create more robust students in all the fields of science and engineering. I enjoyed the input I received from the lab instructor when we got stuck and I feel like this class helped bolster what I learned in my physics lectures."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2871,My greatest takeaway from this class is that I was able to learn from watching and leading others equally rather than just staying on the side waiting for someone to tell me what to do or ask for help. My group sort of automatically let me lead experiments even if I didn't fully know about what we were doing for that lab. I was glad that I had a really supportive group and we were able to work together well because we just wanted to learn. I'm glad that I was able to learn from mistakes as well because we did struggle a lot of the time but we came from some of those struggles with more experience in physics than before. I'm happy that I was able to lead a tiny group and that my group members trusted me to sort of keep things together and learn.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2878,My greatest takeaway from this class was learning about the physics of electronics and electric charges. I've been looking forward to this class since I have always been interested in electronics and actually wanted to major in mechanical or electrical engineering and I've always wanted to learn about how electronics work. My favorite topic so far has been circuits since it has been a topic that I have been able to easily grasp conceptually and practically. So far the labs have been great but it feels like its outdated since the worksheets are old and difficult to understand. It sort of expects that you know all the terminologies and are familiar with the complex equipment that we use in the labs.  Other than that my other biggest takeaway has been learning how to work with others and learning the material with them. Its been nice working with people in person since we had been online for my previous lab;
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2296,"The greater takeaway from this class is that experiment is fundamental to Physics. So that Lab instruction has historically been a cornerstone of physics education. First, the physical theory has to be falsified by possible experiments. Physics must be rational, that is, there is a theory, logic must be self-consistent, and inconsistency is nonsense. But it is not enough just to be reasonable, but also to experiment, to verify through observation and practice. Second, the real world is too complex, and different scales interact to become a system. The simple model of physics is always out of touch with reality under certain circumstances (scale). In this case, the applicability of the model must be verified by experiments. So theory naturally thinks itself to be the truth, and experiments will tell the boundaries of its dominion. Third, the real process is often nonlinear or even chaotic. When physical theory can not accurately predict (calculate) complex multibody processes, or the amount of calculation is too large to be realized, experimental observation is necessary. It is concluded that the theory and experiment of physics are consistent. Theory must be able to test falsification, that is, the experiment can kill the theory, the experiment is the ultimate authority. Experiments can be inconsistent with existing theories, but a successful theory can not always be blind to certain experimental facts."
