2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2878,"One concept I remember a lot has got to be electric charges. There are two types of charges negative and positive and they are called protons and electrons. Protons are positively charged particles and electrons are negatively charged particles. With respect to each other, two of the same charges when brought close to each other whether positive or negative attract each other. However, two opposite charges repel each other. The interaction between these particles are influenced by what is known as the electric field. In an electric field, positive charges will move in the same direction as it while the negative charge will move in the opposite direction of it. The magnitude of the electric charge is a quantity whose units is Columbus. A positive and negative charge both have charges of 1.6 * 10^-19 Coulombs. This represents the charge that they emit. A proton will emit a positive charge and an electron will emit a negative charge. The positive and negative signs for charge represent the direction in the context of an electric field. In a protons electric field the field lines will move outward from the charge. In an electrons electric field the field lines will be pointing inward. Visually the closer and more field lines represent a greater magnitude of electric  fields between charges."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2881,In what ways are circuits applicable to my everyday life? Well you’ll better understand situations involving circuits so essentially anytime you put anything into an outlet. You can understand why something might get short circuited or overcharge the outlet and cause an outage. This involves a general understanding of circuits but also an understanding of resistance. That’s really about it as far as impacting my everyday life. For the general public maybe this knowledge could create a safer environment around electricity by just have a baseline understanding of circuits and perhaps why some ideas are not a good idea but also how bad they really are. For example understanding what circuits in your life invoke series and which involve being in parallel can help you better understand the results you’re getting as far as brightness and such. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2880,"What is Gauss’s Law and how is it applied to benefit everyday life?       Generally, Gauss's Law is a relationship between the electric flux through a closed surface and the net charge. The net charge enclosed divided by the conductivity of empty space equals the flux of the electric field across any closed surface, often known as a Gaussian surface. A great visual reference or analogy of gauss's Law is water flowing through a pipe or students inside a classroom.       Gauss's Law applies to a closed surface in a variety of situations. Mainly, gauss's Law is a method to evaluate the electric field when certain conditions are met. For example, when there is no charge on the closed surface, the flux will always be 0, but the flux will be negative when there is a charge around the surface.        In everyday life, gauss law is used in a variety of phenomena. One, gauss law is used in printers. Inkjet printers, for example, employ the nozzle to spray tiny ink droplets with an electrostatic charge. The droplets are then directed to the appropriate locations on the page using a variety of computer-controlled mechanisms. Two, gauss law is used in Xerography. In short, Xerography is a dry copying process that is applied by using electrostatics. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2883,"Question : What is an electric field/ potential?These past weeks we have been learning/ experimenting with electric fields and their potential and seeing how the energy is being distributed by electron and/or protons. Well what is an electric field? you may ask, its is a region around a charged particle or object within which a force would be exerted on other charged particles or objects.When the field is made up of protons the energy around the field is being pushed outwardly. The way the distribution of energy is the further the energy is from the center of the proton is the weaker it potential is. The opposite could be said about an electron. Since its a negative particle its forces the energy to move towards its the potential of the energy is higher when its further away rather than when its close to the electron."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2869,"Something from a few weeks back I would like to discuss would be electric capacitors. How does a capacitor work and function? How is energy stored in these? Capacitors in general store electrical charge and energy, to calculate the capacitance of a capacitor, you divide the maximum charge by the voltage across the device. To move electric charge and energy across the device, it moves electricity between two parallel but not touching plates, with an insulating material in between. It should remain electrically neutral.Capacitors play an important role in most electronic devices. Because they store electrical charge and energy, it has allowed electronics to have a much wider variety of uses, not being entirely reliant on a singular power source. It allows the electricity to be used for later rather than being entirely spent on in the moment. Stuff like our modern smart phones or TV's or other electronics today rely on capacitors"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2871,"Our lab on the electrostatic field was the first hands on lab I had ever done in college so I think that was a great learning experience for me. Not only to learn the physics content better, but to work more with other people to problem solve and get our wires in the right place and to have our electron beam working correctly. A questions I have about it is what more could we have done to get better readings about where the electron beam was on the x-axis because we seemed to only be able to move it up and down the y-axis. Looking back on it now, I think that we could've been able to play around with the wires and connections more if we took more time to understand the device we were measuring voltage with. We didn't have all the time we needed because the power did go out at school but I'm sure if we just talked about what we were doing more, we would've been more successful. Problem solving and working together with others in any setting where the whole group is not 100% sure how to continue their experiment or task is a good way to practice social skills and for me leading a group because i have a lot of experience being a leader even when I'm not sure about the task we're doing. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,1046,"I don't do the lecture as I'm technically currently retaking the lab, but one thing I would suggest is thinking about batteries. Do we apply a certain voltage to it? Can we put a resistor on it? These are many topics I think of when I when I think of my experience in school involving electricity and magnetism. It's very interesting!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2872,"One question I have Is how is it that we discovered how two points on a same-level plane and E-field can have the same amount of potential?The name ""equipotential surface"" makes it clear that a plane has a surface consisting of a continuous distribution of points having the same electric potential.This information might be used to benefit society because electricity has changed the way we live in todays world and understanding how power gets distributed will allow us to maximize the capabilities of not just electricity but other sources of energy as well! One real life example of equipotential E-fields is the touch screen on our cellphones, capacitive touch is a common technology and a capacitor is all about E-fields."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2876,A concept that was covered in class this past few weeks is the idea of parallel and series in circuits. This can be applied to both capacitators and resistors within a circuit. A parallel circuit can be identified as having n amount of capacitors or resistors in parallel with each other. A series circuit is when you have n amount of capacitors or resistors that must go through each other. When you have a series of capacitors you simply just add up their sum together where as with parallel capacitors you add up their reciprocal forms and then do the reciprocal again to get the value of the capacitors in parallel. For resistors you would do a similar thing but swap the equations for series and parallel. Meaning resistors in parallel is simply adding the sum of resistor values and series would be the adding the reciprocal values and then doing the reciprocal of that value again.This information is beneficial to society because having knowledge of these properties we can build more complex circuits to have specific voltages or currents to help power our electronic devices without blowing a fuse or making the circuit too hot. This is important because otherwise we would have to replace the circuit or cause a power outage due to using too much power. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2882,"I will talk about some of the concepts that we did in the lab which includes Gauss's Law, Potential energy and potential difference. The relationship between the distribution of electric charge and the electric field that results is known as Gauss's law. The amount of energy it gains as a result of the potential difference is known as potential energy. An object's potential is its ability to perform a task. Example of a potential energy would be when a spring is compressed or stretched. The spring has more potential energy. The potential difference is also known as voltage and is measured in volts (V). When charge carriers move through electrical components in a circuit, energy is delivered to them. To determine the potential difference, we use a voltmeter (or voltage). This information is useful in everyday life, for example, when it comes to power. Every day, we use power."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2877,"Electric flux is the measurement of the electric field through a particular surface in electromagnetism, despite the fact that an electric field cannot flow. It's a means of defining the intensity of an electric field at any distance from the charge that's creating it. The field of electricity at any location in space, E may exert a force on an electric charge. The gradient of the potential is the electric field. Electric field lines are thought to start with positive electric charges and end with negative ones. Negative field lines are directed into a closed surface, whereas positive field lines are those directed out of a closed surface. Every field line directed into a closed surface continues through the interior and is directed outward somewhere on the surface if there is no net charge within the surface.In our daily life, I believe electric flux is used everywhere. An example would be when you turn on a light, a generator somewhere in the grid is most likely producing the voltage you need. It's also the computer you're typing on. Other great examples may be found in the switch mode power supply. Without electric flux, nothing in our universe would operate. According to Maxwell's equations. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,58,i think circuits are something ill be thinking about in my day to day life like it could be useful when trying to built a house like how to maximize power considering most the circus in standard houses are parallel. It help me understand why the power goes off if we have to many electronics plugged in and stuff. They are also just something fun and nice to learn about 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2870,"I will be talking about emetic field from week three, that topic interest me the most and I gradated toward it for some reason. What is a eletric field is the question to answer? ""An electric field is the physical field that surrounds electrically charged particles and exerts force on all other charged particles in the field, either attracting or repelling them. It also refers to the physical field for a system of charged particles."" How does electric field relate to electric potential? ""The relationship between potential and field (E) is a differential: electric field is the gradient of potential (V) in the x direction. This can be represented as: Ex=−dVdx E x = − dV dx . Thus, as the test charge is moved in the x direction, the rate of the its change in potential is the value of the electric field.""How are electric fields used in real life? In daily life everybody is, to a greater or lesser degree, exposed to electromagnetic fields. Examples are the fields produced by kitchen appliances, radio transmitters and mobile phones"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2296,"Base on the past few weeks lab, I’ve learn that Electric field theory is the basis of electricity and provides a basis for future study. The core content of electric field includes electric field force, electric field force and electric potential energy change. Electricity and magnetism are inseparable, there is an essential relationship between electricity and magnetism, from the magnetic effect of current to the law of electromagnetic induction, promoting the further development of modern industry. Static electricity is a common phenomenon in daily life. It is a static electric charge that moves after friction, resulting in static electricity phenomenon, which is difficult to cause harm to human body. As we all know, positive charge is proton, negative charge is electron, when two or more objects through friction, will produce the movement of electrons, the object to gain electrons will produce negative charge, and the object to lose electrons will bring positive charge, positive charge and negative charge will be neutralized after meeting, and then form static electricity.The frequency and intensity of static electricity are determined by an object's ability to gain and lose electrons. The stronger its ability, the more likely it is to produce static electricity. For example, in our daily life, when we take off sweaters in winter, we often see sparks, and when we touch objects with our hands, we often get electric shocks."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2874,"The concept that I think is the most relatable and useful to human is Charge. The reason why I think is charge is because almost everything happen in the world is related to charge. Charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience force when placed in an electromagnetic field. Charge can be in two different ways which is positive and negative and like charge will attract to each other and unlike charge will repel to each other. Other than that, absence of charge called neutral. The most common things related to charges is magnet, it repel with same sign of charge and attract with different sign of charge. The examples of charge related to our daily life are hair sticking up after pulling a hat off, dust build up on the surface of fan, dust and dirt attracted to TV screens and computer monitor and etc. Another example of charge in our daily life will be lighting. Lighting form by the friction of cloud when it rubbing together and form a negative charge at the bottom of the cloud and positive charge on the top of cloud, as the charge gets larger and larger, the electrons at the bottom repel each other and lastly causes lighting."
