2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2879,"My Goal is to be the best computer programmer that I can be. I want to learn how to code effortlessly and not make mistakes in my code that prevent it from running. I feel like this class can help me in many ways one of which is by helping improve my logical reasoning. This class uses a lot of maths and solving math problems can help you improve your logical reasoning skills and develop your problem solving skills. Programming requires a lot of rational thinking and having a clutter free mind. This class can help me achieve that kind of mindset by solving problems in physics and calculus II. Physics in general is used a lot in computer science and it helps us cs majors get a better understanding of how computers work and how everything inside a computer, like the physical components, work.This class has already improved my math solving skills and I look forward to developing my logical reasoning. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2881,I wish to find and enjoy what I want to do in life. I am hoping that computer science is involved in that so this semester I am working more earnestly than I have in the past on my schoolwork. That of course includes E&M as well as the computer science courses I am taking this semester. So more specifically I wish to understand my physics courses well and most of the time get a little lost in lectures so the lab helps me review material. This class will help me better understand E & M which is a class I have taken before but I did very poorly. I feel more comfortable in this class perhaps because we are given actual material in class to work on so I can directly ask questions on those. I think also the group work helps me understand where some of my peers are at too so I get a grounding of how everyone is doing in this course.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2877,"My goals for this class are to help me learn more about the diversity of computer science and maybe pinpoint another career choice. This class can help achieve this goal because I do enjoy what I do in this class, especially with hands-on labs. I'm really interested in gaming, I've always been interested in maybe creating my own game, whether that is a first-person shooter game or even a sports game. If I were to build one with realistic effects, I would need both math and physics. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2874,"My goal is actually to be successfully graduate from the SFSU and become a civil engineer. I plan to do some construction work and even become a developer in my hometown. This class help me achieve my goals because everything I learn in this class will be my basic for chasing my goal and everything I learn should apply to my work in the future. So, the knowledge that I get in this class in very important because without the knowledge and basic understanding to the engineering course, it would become dangerous on our work in the future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2872,"My goals for this semester is to improve my problem-solving abilities so that I may better apply them to my day to day life as well as the profession I want to go into. This class can help me achieve these goals by providing windows of opportunity to sort of ""flex"" the problem solving muscle I want to work on. I also would like to be a better team player in group assignments and this class is perfect for that goal because a lot of the work is done in groups so I am constantly collaborating and learning alongside my peers. The work im doing in this class is helping me become a better problem-solver and a better group-oriented collaborator."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2875,"My goal for this class is to understand how things work. I feel like even if I don’t fully understand everything that is going on or being taught, it does give me an idea Science is all around us and that most of the problems presented in this class can help me get an understanding of how to solve problems. No matter which way I go in my career (because I am uncertain of what I want to do in my field) I feel like getting this level of problem solving skills will truly help me grasp the idea of asking myself a question and looking at the details of the situation of understand what it is that I am trying to solve. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2878,My goal for this class is to learn and understand as much information as I can. There is a lot of information to take in so I feel like I have to practice learning and implementing concepts in order to retain all the information. To do so I will try and spend at least 2 hours every day dedicating time to practicing concepts learned in class. Something that would make it harder for me to achieve my goals would be distractions and other responsibilities like taking care of my little brothers but I will try and limit other distractions that I can control like not using my phone as much or just wasting time on the internet. I want to be able to increase my critical thinking skills and I think this class would help me do so. It helps me because it allows me to think in a way that is connected both conceptually and mathematically and putting those together takes effort and hard work. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2882,"My goals for this class are to understand each lab we conduct in class. In addition, where necessary, to participate in order to obtain a better knowledge of the problem. To succeed in this class, I will ask questions if I don't understand any of the concepts or questions. I'll do everything I can to improve my grade and pass this class."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,1046,"My goals are to become a more robust scientist, and this class should help me make progress towards achieving that goal. Even though I am a computer science major, I still thinking subjects such as physics are vitally important to other important topics in computer science. Electricity and magnetism are useful subjects and are something I might apply when I create a product or a fun personal project. I'm not an electrical engineer, but I should be able to get enough done such that I can create things using the knowledge I've gained in my physics classes. Doing so will help me become the best scientist I can possibly be."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2870,"My goal in this class is to absorb as much vibrant information I can. I am not very good at physic but I want to do my best in understanding the material to the fullest extent. My biggest goal is to be able to excel in every aspect f the computer engineering field. I understand that I do not have to be the smartest nor do I have to be the go to person. I just need to stick with it and not give up that has been the biggest testament in the STEM field. There are so many smart people that give up and the ones that stay are the ones that persevere and get through all the obstacles no matter what. I cannot wait to see what life has in store for me, I understand I will not be perfect by no means but there is a reason why I am still here."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2873,"My goals are to graduate and with the things I learn, I hope I can find a job related to my major. Physics 2 is a core class for my major and it has many things from Physics 1 that are involved in it. This class will help me achieve my goal as Physics seem to play a big role in the engineering field, and I hope to get out of it many things that will be used in the future. Labs are very hands-on, making it more challenging and better to learn as we can see first hand how the Physics work. If I pass the class then that would mean I learned much and can now work on further core classes in which this class is prerequisite to."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2296,"I believe that everyone has a great deal of curiosity as a child and I am no exception. Through my own experience and research, I’ve discovered that physics classes aren’t just teaching us something about how anything works in everyday life that we don’t know about. More important are the two core competencies developed through the course: the ability to think in mathematical logic and the ability to model real-world scenarios using mathematical tools. These two core competencies can go a long way in helping you understand the world, and they can be applied to understanding a large part of the world. Personally, my future career aspirations are engineering. So it’s important to apply tools to understand, track, and deal with equipment issues."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2869,"My goals are to get a good job so I can support my family, and to find one that I would really love doing for the rest of my life. To achieve that, I've stuck with my comp sci major for almost 2 years now and for the most part I'm seeing progress, I've really enjoyed what I've learned and everyone I've been with has been just as lost as me or been entirely helpful. On the other hand, I really don't know how physics relates to comp sci though, I guess working together as a group and knowing how basic physics work are important for CS stuff but I'm not entirely sure. All that I know that are important are the programming and assembly languages and the math behind the calculations, like statistics and calculus. Maybe I'll figure this out along the way like I did with my last physics class."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,58,"My goal is to built stuff I want a job were i could built and feel productive. This class will help me achieve those goals by helping me understand the materials better, know how certain materials react to currency and waves. I want a career in something hands on and to achieve that you need, to understand physics or i don't know its just a requirement. But it seems reasonable why they are asking for such. It just seems to be a requirement for any engineer. I hope to get a job were i feel productive where i feel like i made a difference and i think engineer is just the path for that"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2880,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals? This is a simple question. I have a lot of life goals that I hope to fulfill in the near future. My long-term ambition is to work for a large software firm and earn an excellent salary. As I would like to pursue a computer science career in the future, physics would be highly beneficial in building a person's information technology skill set. For example, by understanding physics, we achieve better problem-solving skills about forged concepts of daily life. In correlation, computer science students require the same talents in order to produce better code and tactics. Moreover, my immediate objective is to finish my degree with a high GPA. This class would assist me in achieving these objectives because it is required for graduation and serves as a stepping stone to success. Getting good grades in this class would help me achieve my goals."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2871,"My goal is to get a better understanding of physics by being in an in-person lab. During my physics class and lab last semester, it was hard for me to really understand a lot of the new concept I was learning. I was used to the online learning format of science classes but physics isn't an easy topic for me and I needed more help. This semester is going a lot better so far, and I'm sure that I'll be able to understand things more with more people physically around me to help. I'll be able to ask more questions and see concepts in front of me to help me better understand them. It'll also be important for me to review what I learn in this lab and try to relate to to things we've gone over in the class and it'll help me with my work. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2876,"My goal in this class to pass my prerequisites for the computer science degree since PHYS 232 is a required class along with PHYS 230 in for the Math and Physics portion of the computer science degree. Outside of just fulfilling prerequisites however, I want to learn how to electricity is related to computers/circuit boards since I am a bit interested on how computers work on a hardware level since I am more familiar with how computers work on a software level. Additionally, this class is now in person which means I can actually work with teammates face to face and this experience should help me learn how to work with teammates/as a team better than I did in PHYS 222 because that class was all online. Learning how to work with teammates is essential to any career because oftentimes working as a team can get more work done, than doing things individually. I have already experienced this effect with my teammates because we divide up the work in the lab and things get done more efficiently than if I were to do it alone."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2883,"My overall goal is to become successful and prepare myself as much as I can for my future. Although this is a required course for my major, this class will teach how to work in a group which I could apply to my future job. Physics also teaches how things in life works which is really interesting. Beyond just being successful I want to make new friends and overall learn new things which I believe this class will help me achieve. I am enjoying this class a lot can't wait to learn more subjects."
