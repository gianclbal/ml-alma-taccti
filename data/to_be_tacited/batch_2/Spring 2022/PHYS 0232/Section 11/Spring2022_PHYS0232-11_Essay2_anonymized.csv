2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3010,"My goal is to get an A in the class so I can have a higher GPA to get a master's degree education. I feel I’m currently doing good and found nice friends with our group mates. They are really nice and helped me a lot. Even though sometimes the lab is hard but it’s still acceptable. However, some time when we have to do things we don’t even know will be challenging. I feel I’m on the right path. The only thing that’s difficult is to keep up the good work with the team and we will find success in the end. I feel there is nothing for me to ask the professor about, but when it’s needed it would be a good thing to do. My goal is to get an A in the class, and it’s still my goal of the class. I will try my best to get that A I wanted."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2999,"My goals are to be able to have the strength to achieve my education and recognized the importance in my life. Another goal I have is to become someone in the medical field. This class helps me achieve these goals by learning different concepts of how life makes things work. From the everyday motions to the things around us can help me be knowledgeable about the purpose of the movements of different objects. This class is a prerequisite to my goal of becoming a biology major, which will help me understand the movements of different objects and people. This class can help me understand the movements of things and how force may affect their position. For example, pushing a needle into someone’s arm consist of an angle, pressure, and position it is at. This all comes back to applying the lesson we’re learning in the procedure, of how far, what angle, and when to stop forcing the needle in. Another lesson I can learn from this is the electric fields, such that it can help me be prepared for what can happen. Physic can help me understand beforehand how important it is to apply the lessons we have learned to our daily lives and objects. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2021,My goal is to be able to create any sort of program when I want to . I personally have times where I get caught up in certain topics for a while then won’t really move on unless I am satisfied with my understanding of the subject. I think this class can help me achieve these goals in that they would help me have a better understanding of real world environments. Having some background knowledge on how physics work can help with the method I tackle problems in coding. In physics you often break down the problem into smaller segments then finally combining it all to get the solution. This same practice of breaking down problems can be used to effectively code and build larger programs. This is why I think it can be helpful to me in terms of my goals and career path. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3016,"my goals are the complete this course and continue forward into my major. this class will help me through my goal with the knowledge i will learn. my major is computer engineering, and with an understanding on circuit and electric flow on computers will help."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2998,"My goals for this class is to acquire a better understanding of study material throughout each week. Since my physics lecture is asynchronous, its hard for me to grasp onto ideas and principles without the help of a teacher or supervisor. This class gives me a chance to reinforce what I've understood and learn things I've overlooked. During the mini lectures at the beginning of each lab, I get to learn more about that week's topic than I would studying by myself. To achieve these goals, I like to refer to the lecture slides a day before class in order to familiarize myself with the general topics that will be tested in the lab. Even during the lab, I always like to refer to the lecture slides to help answer lab questions. Lab collaboration also gives me more insight at the material at hand. Every lab, I learn one or two things from my lab partners while going over the lab activity. I've been putting these methods into practice and am able to leave the lab feeling more confident in my knowledge and understanding."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2996,"In the future, I hope to be able to live a happy life and get a better understanding of it. I believe this class can help me get there because a lot of physics topics are connected into everyone's daily lives and what the do during and outside of school. The labs in this class are also very educational and I am learning new topics that I didn't know about before. I want to be able to understand how everything works on a deeper connection. I believe that learning new topics allows one to obtain new skills which can be useful later in the future. I hope when i am older i have more knowledge. I enjoy doing labs and learning new physics topics so, this class will help me get there. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3018,"My goal has always been to challenge myself. I always wanted to challenge myself at doing something that is hard and overcome that objective because I had always felt I was not capable of doing something hard and I thought that If I can at least do one thing that was hard I would be able to overcome a lot more. My biggest goal was getting into college. Successful or not, I am proud of this goal because I was able to do what a lot of doubters said I couldn’t and I am still here. My new goal is to keep moving forward and achieve more because, sometimes it gets hard though and I want to give up then I remember that It can be done. So I want to keep on moving forward through all the stress, anxiety, and issues that may cause me to want to give up but instead keep going."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2995,"My goals are to complete college and take a step forward in my career while I am in school. This class can help me because not only is it a requirement, I do believe it is good to learn physics as well because if I ever want to go down that field in computer science I will have some knowledge of it. I don't have any specific goals at the moment, but I would like to try a lot of things out and hopefully get a job that could be my first step into my field of liking. Physics can't really help with that but as I said, it is still nice to have this knowledge."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3015,"I have a few goals that come to mind when I think about the classes that I am currently taking. Since I am a computer science major, I am striving to become a great problem solver. So what this class provides me is the chance to work with a group to solve the lab problems. This is an example of how this class is helping me by using equations, simulations, and informative slides."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3012,"First, the SETM field stills has good prospects from an employment prespective. Because society can't grow without science, technology, engineeing and mathematics. There is still a great demand for related ETMS practitioners in the society.  In my country, people often say that learning mathematics, physics and chemistry well will not scare you anywhere in the would. It means studnet of ETSM filed can find the job easily.  Second, in personally, I think that I enjory the process of soving the problem. When I spend time on sovling a problem and I feel a sense of accomplishment. to feel ones progress and to explore the territory of ones's place are the primal dirves of human beings. I have a good foundation in mathematics in my high school, which will help me to be more relaxed in learning this field. Therefore, I chioce the SETM field. I believe that SETM field has a good future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2992,"I am a computer science major, and my ultimate career goal is to work in the computer science industry and become a software engineer. After taking this class, I hope to become more methodical and precise with my work and thinking patterns. Furthermore, this class will help deepen and advance my critical thinking skills, which is an important skill to have in any career."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3001,"My goals are to learn more about Computer Science so that I may see if that is where my passion and interests lie in the future when I try to find a career that makes me happy in life. This class helps me achieve my goals by being a requirement for getting a computer science degree. It also teaches me about physics which might be useful later on in my life, but I am unsure of that for now. So far I have learned about electricity and it is pretty difficult to understand entirely so I hope it does not get harder than this later in this class. Physics also has the benefit of teaching kind of how the world works in a sense of why things are the way they are. I think it never hurts to have a better understanding of the laws and nature of the world that we live in."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2994,My current goal is to accomplish my education and get the degree and knowledge I will need to be successful in my career. I want to be able to pass my classes and in the process learned as much as I can. This class will help me to accomplish my goal by teaching me the knowledge I will need to successfully pass the class and help me be more prepared for the classes to come. By learning and understanding the material this class will help me maintain in the right direction towards my overall goal. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3017,"My recent goal is to get an A for my Physics 230 class this semester. Because it’s all online class, the teacher can not help me to figure out everything face to face. I have to go to youtube or any tutoring website in order to finish my HW correctly. But, this lab class gives me more help on physics understanding and interest in learning physics. We’re doing a lot of experiments during class, even though they’re online simulators. But it’s still helped me understand more above the concepts of physics. Practice is the truth, you can’t learn anything without practice. And also, we are doing group work. Study physics alone is a terrible thing I ever have. Struggle, boring, and tired. But, when I studying with my groupmates, the situation is totally changing. We help each other and sometimes make fun with each other. The best time of studying physics is with my boys. Not boring at all. Right now, Phys 232 lab is helping me get a couple of A of HW on my physics 232 class. Keep it up, I will go through it smoothly."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3003,"My main educational goal is to continue with my education in the field of computer science. I need to finish my BS degree, then decide what I want to do with my gained knowledge and experience. What I will learn during my time in Uni will be the main and total knowledge in my field for the future. The experience I experience will also shape how everything turns out in my career. Although there are many more factors to this. But my main goal is to get my degree and learn as much as I can in the field of Computer Science. To get my gree, I need to complete the requirements that are needed. This course is both a requirement and a subject that I will need in my degree. So I need to complete this course and pass it to the best of my ability. I also need to take the next Physics course, so it's important to do well in this course, as it reflects the next one. I am comfortable in my ability to do what it takes to reach my goals. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2997,"My goal is to graduate summa cum laude next year so getting an A in this class will help me achieve my goal. I think I'm on track to meeting my goals. I got a 4.0 last semester and I am doing well this semester. I really want some sort of distinction when I graduate, I feel like it will make up a little bit for lost time. I also, want to get an internship for next summer that would transition into an entry-level job. I think having some distinction on my resume would help. JUst being more disciplined and consistent is another goal I have< I haven't missed class this semester, So I think I am on track. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3008,"My main goal with this overall major is to dwell further into the world of tech by providing myself with par more knowledge through computer systems, information technology, and programming to understand what my clear calling through CS. I want to impact my Community in a beneficial manner through the world  of Computer science as it continues to fascinate me as I push forward. How this class is going to benefit me toward achieving these goals is that by having fundamental knowledge of applying formulas and functions into the real world in physics, I’d be able to technically have some ability in applying the to knowledge formulas and functions for complex problems that can be solved using programs."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3002,"My goals are to get very good at programming so I can a job in software engineering. Physics can help me with my goals by giving a solid understanding of how the world works around me. This understanding can be needed when working with physics that are trying to emulate the real world, whether it be in game engines or other simulations. However, I think what is more important is that I become better at the skill of problem solving, since that is what makes a good programmer. I do not know how much physics problems will appear in programming, but it is better to have a starting point in physics than to not have one, if physics concepts do come up. Even though it can take a bit of time and work to understand these concepts in both lab and lecture, I think it can be beneficial if I come across problems that involve learning concepts rather than just making mathematical calculations. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3014,"My goals are to understand more about physics to build my understanding of the world around us. Especially as a Computer Science major, and a person who works with hardware, there will be many times where understanding the way electricity and physics works helps. Also, another goal of mine is to further my ability to work with others as a part of a group. Group work and communication is an incredibly important skill that is often overlooked in favor of other skills, but working with others is more important in my opinion since no matter how smart you are it doesn't help if you can't communicate. I think that by working with others as a part of a team in doing the lab questions I will improve my own communication skills and the skills of my group members. I also think this is important since it provides me with others I can ask questions to and check my understanding with."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3013,"I don't really have any goals as concrete as I perhaps should, but there is of course the obvious point that this class is a requirement for my major and will help me to graduate. I do also want to try my hand at game development, so having a good grasp of physics concepts and the relevant equations could help with physics engines. While a lot of the topics in this class center on electricity, which I don't think is as common as mechanics in that regard, it is still probably worth considering whether concepts are somehow replicable in a game engine, especially (so far) those relating to magnetism. Glancing at future topics, there is a week called ""Intro to Mathematical Coding in SAGE,"" so that seems likely to be more directly relevant."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2991,"As a computer science student, my goal is to seek a software engineer internship and graduate after finishing all of the classes this year. It is not easy to finish many significant classes as a transfer student. This class, PHYS 232, looks like the extension of PHYS 230. I prefer to see this class for another review and improvement. Class 232 will focus on many basic, detailed examples to demonstrate definitions. Look through the process of doing lab exploration, and it will be the same in the future internship. Each team has its tasks; communicating well with teammates would be the first step. Then, the logic processing and solving ability will be necessary for one software engineer; we have to know how to split the enormous task into parts and explain the logic of our codes. Moreover, after we finish the lab, we will summarize and give real-time feedback. Real-time feedback helps any work for the next try. That’s all my idea this class can benefit me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3006,"I think that there are two main goals that this class is helping me to achieve. The first goal is that, since I’m a computer science major, I’d like to become better at thinking through problems logically. I think that the scientific process used to solve physics problems can easily be applied to computer science despite the very different natures of the two subjects. Additionally, one major goal of mine is to just be able to have a better understanding of how the world works, which I believe having a greater understanding of physics would definitely help with. There are a lot of fairly basic phenomena constantly happening all around me and I feel that improving my knowledge of physics would help me to recognize and understand them to a much higher degree; increasing my appreciation of them."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3019,"My goal for this class would be to graduate college because this class is a requisite for my major. I am majoring in computer science and I finish this class with a passing grade and this will help me take the higher division class. The problem solving and logic that we learn in physics is integral to computer science. They also both require calculus so it makes sense that this class will help me with understanding computer science and the problems I might encounter. There are lot of a physics application in computer science like computer hardware, realistic simulations, and computation."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2989,"My goal is to become a game designer/ game developer and this class will help me to achieve the goal by making me understand the mechanics of how things work in the real world so I can implement them into the video games we will be making in the future. However, in order for me to make that a success, I will have to pass this class and all the other classes that I have currently and will have in the future. I hope I can pass in all my classes and I will try my best to pass all my classes with a C or better so I won't be wasting a semester of learning away. I also hope my groupmates will work together to pass this class because we can't do this alone. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3009,"I have two main goals with this class: I want develop a greater understanding of physics, and I want to learn how to apply this heightened understanding of physics in my everyday life. Last semester I took two physics classes: PHYS 220 and its lab counterpart PHYS 222. The classes helped in my understanding of mechanics, learning about concepts such as gravity, acceleration, force, work, and friction (in addition to many others). And while we are not yet even a third of the way through the semester, I have already learnt about concepts like charge, potential difference, and flux from this semester's classes: PHYS 230 and its lab counterpart, this class. As I stated earlier, I hope that in the remaining weeks we are able to learn about ideas such as capacitance and resistance, and that we are also able to use this information in a way that would help us design and understand a basic electric circuit, which I see as being the real world application of this physics material."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3020,"Physics for me allows me to develop my skills when it comes to problem solving. Problem solving is something I feel like is very useful for me and needed especially with me entering the field of computer science. During my reflections for physics 1, this is something that I have also thought about and after taking and finishing that class, I found it quite beneficial in terms of how I would tackle and solve problems and apart from that, It has also changed the way I view and conceptualize things around me. Examples of this can be found through simple observations, either it be walking past a group of friends playing soccer and you wonder if the ball they kicked will reach their intended placement or a goal for example."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3005,"My goals are to graduate from college (and earn my degree) and to get a good (well paying) job to support myself and my family. Although this class is online and is not as fun/engaging as it would be in person, it can help me achieve these goals because it is one of the courses required for my major. Having a lab for this course (PHYS) helps because for me, it acts as a visual and helps me by providing a deeper understanding as we go through the lab in our groups."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2990,"My goals are to get my computer science major and find a job. My major, formally, needs this class in order to graduate. Looking deeper, this class teaches analytical thinking in the form of labs, which is vital in computer science and in jobs. As a lab class, it also promotes teamwork which is essential in jobs. My CSC 413 professor always says that no one works alone in the industry. This class helps me achieve the goal of becoming a better team member and critical thinker, which are skills I will need in the future."
