2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2995,"Well, one that I can think of on the top of my head would be circuits and how much we use them in everyday technology. The very lightbulb in our room is using some form of the circuit to run it or even our phone or computer. It's quite interesting how we use many of these concepts and uses but we don't really know them. What I mean by this is that an average person doesn't realize something like the number of circuits they are using in their everyday applications. The people who know this information are able to innovate and apply the concepts to things such as phones and computers or cars to make something that benefits society, for the people who aren't well educated in this field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2996,"My question i formulated was why potential difference doesn't depend on the magnitude of the test charge?This is because potential difference is equal to gain in energy per unit charge when it is moved from one place to another place, which is independent on test charge. This is relevant to daily life because there is a sport that uses potential difference, archery. When the archer pulls back more, the potential energy will be gained due to the bow stretching and when the bowstring is released the arrow shoots forward very quickly. Another example is a rollercoaster. At the highest point of the rollercoaster, the cart stops and is held for a few seconds because of potential energy. Potential energy is contained due to the height and the weight of the people sitting in the cart. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3002,"One concept we covered in class is electric current. Current is the flow of charges caused by a potential difference in a circuit. It is the rate at which the charges flow. Current is defined as the charge over time, or using ohm's law, voltage over resistance. Its units are amps, which are 1 coulomb per second. It is important to know current because it is often confused with voltage. A simple way to understand it is current is the rate of the flow of charges, while voltage is what causes the flow, similar to pressure. Current is also relevant because it is evident in a lot of our electronics and machinery, powering things like our phones and trains. Understanding current is also important for those working with electricity when getting into things like direct current and alternating current. In all, it is good to understand the basics of current to have a better view of how the world works, and because understanding it is a prerequisite to working on electronics, electricity, wiring, and other technology. I think I still have a lot to learn about current, but getting a basic view of it in class was helpful for me to clear up confusions I had before. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3013,"What is the reasoning behind Gauss' Law?We can think of the electric flux of a point charge as an infinite amount of lines coming from it. To measure the amount that passes through a surface, we simply 'count' the amount of lines passing through it (obviously infinite, but we can count the proportion of them). This is why angled objects receive less flux; fewer lines pass through them.This brings us to Gaussian surfaces. If we imagine a point charge completely surrounded by a surface, we don't have to painstakingly measure the proportion of lines through it with any calculations; every line must pass through it to leave the surface. If these 'lines' originate from inside and end up outside the surface, they must therefore pass through it at some point. Therefore, we can do away with the proportion component of the equation altogether, ignoring angles and surface size; the only relevant thing is the actual charge inside.There are two other interesting points: one is that this is not exclusive to point charges, it is simply easier to imagine and explain. Since the rule of lines originating inside and ending outside is not dependent on the shape or even number of charge inside, we can simply take the total sum of all of the charges inside, ignoring their number and shape. This is what gives us the 'sum of charges' component.Second, If the idea that larger surfaces receive more 'lines' of flux may seem contradictory to the idea of a gaussian surface, which receives all of them. The amount received should be proportional to the inverse of the square of the distance. Thankfully, the surface area of a sphere is proportional to the square of its radius; in other words, as we imagine larger gaussian surfaces, the surface area required to cover the entire area around the charge increases at the same rate that the lines per surface area decreases. In this way, the total lines remain constant."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2997,"VOLTAGE.At a junction, if a circuit goes into a parallel circuit, then branches into a series circuit, what happens to the current and voltage?At a junction, voltage splits but the voltage in = voltage out. Voltage = potential difference. Ohms Law V=IRResister is a material that provides a specified resistance in a circuit, obeying Ohms law. In a series circuit I1=I2=IR and Vtotal = V1+V2+...+Vn In a parallel circuit V=V1=V2=Vn Itotal = I1+I2+...InAs the circuit approaches the parallel branch, the voltage stays the same in all branches of the parallel circuit and the current gets split between these branches depending on resistance. As it exits this parallel branch into a series branch, the current is now equal at each register while the voltage is split between each one.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3019,"My question is from Week 6: Simple Circuits and Short Circuits and it is what is the relationship between the variables in Ohm's Law? Ohm's Law consists of V = I x R. V stands for voltage and this is the potential difference. The variable I stands for the current of the formula and this describes the rate of flow of charge. The symbol R represents the resistance of the circuit and the units is ohms. The resistance of the circuit depends on the material used in the circuit. For example if you were to use a highly resistive material like tungsten, it is more likely to prevent an over-voltage compared to a less resistive material like stainless steel. This information can be generally applicable to people's lives because it might help them understand how electricity flows within their electronics and houses. Knowing this can also prevent any accident if they would want to try to repair something. For example, when changing out a lightbulb, you wouldn't want to change it out while there is still currents going through that circuit. Same with electrical sockets, it is recommended to turn off the power to that room before trying to mess with it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3012,"1, The battery and tinfoil fire method: the middle of the folded part of the paste close, there is a certain area, the use of the outer layer of paper insulation control heat gathering parts of the fire. Then the metal part is connected to the positive and negative terminals of the battery, in addition to alkaline batteries, ordinary batteries with high internal resistance. Tin paper is equivalent to another kind of wire, and the battery ends connected, almost forming a short circuit, there will be a large amount of instantaneous exothermic, which can be ignited.2, The principle: because the tinfoil conductive, when the tinfoil ends and the battery poles are connected to form a circuit of current, in the case of the same voltage, because the voltage is equal to the current times the resistance, so the smaller the resistance, the greater the current, the smaller the cross-sectional area of the tinfoil, will lead to a larger current and thus the temperature rises, so the narrowest strip of tinfoil will burn.3， When you are outdoors and do not have a lighter and matches with you. You can use chewing gum packaging tinfoil and discarded dry batteries for emergency fire"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2998,"Electric fields have the ability to penetrate surfaces. It is stated that the amount of electric field passing through a surface is the electric flux, so I wondered if the type of surface mattered at all. Say, for example, comparing an electric field penetrating glass compared to concrete. Does the material of the surface affect the electric flux? Looking back at my notes, I am reminded that the electric flux depends on the charge enclosed by said surface. Thus, it doesn't matter what type of material the surface is. The electric flux is dependent on the charge enclosed by the surface."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2993,"Oftentimes we overlook how physics affects our daily lives, but most people do not understand how it improves our society. For example, with the use of physics, we use that knowledge to make cars more safer. For things in cars such as type of metal used, battery design, and sensors design for cars. We covered things such as the types of circuits a car uses, because if it uses a series then it would be inefficient. That's why cars use parallel circuits because it makes it so if one fuse goes out, the other parts are still working. Which is an important safety feature that cars use, to insure that the vehicle is still functable when for example one headlight burns out. This physics concept also applies to other things such as Christmas lights which often use series. That’s why modern lights use parallel series so they still function even if one bulb burns. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2990,"Circuits: Can circuits run without being connected?Wireless charging is a technology that sees use, but how is this possible when circuits in the lab require a solid wire connection? Wireless charging can save a lot of waste in the world on charging cables. My theory is that the circuit is actually connected but not physically. The circuit can actually complete itself in either air or whatever medium it passes through. My next question would be what determines the distance between the ends of a wire that can complete the circuit. The answer, I think, can be found in the lecture section, where the equation of an electric field includes the permittivity of free space. The permittivity of free space is probably what influences the distance that needs to maintain a circuit. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2991,"The most impressive concept is on the electric Current. Electric Current is defined as a stream of charged particles. Current is a rate quantity; following the velocity rate, the current unit equals one coulomb over one second. From the formula, it shows as I = Q / t. Moreover, there are two ways to describe the circuits, parallel and series circuits. Each resistance-like bulb will work in one circuit in the series circuit; if one bulb is off, others will stop either. In another way, we can say each bulb shares voltage of the power supply, and more resistance will affect current and reduce the efficiency of the devices. The parallel circuit is the combination of several series circuits shown as parallel. Each branch has the same voltage of power supply. The closest connection is the circuit in our home. The arrangement is parallel circuits. Please imagine when you plug in phone, TV, hairdryer charges into one socket, have you ever met efficiency reduction situation like phone requires more time to fill to 100 percent. Taking care of the home circuit will help avoid potential danger. If one branch or one socket exceeds its maximum efficiency, the possibility of fire will rise higher. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3011,"In week 6 of the lab, we created a circuit with a battery, cables, and aluminum. This experiment allowed us to witness how a circuit works and how it handles different scenarios. My question for this reflection is: if a path of less resistance in a circuit leads to open air, where will the electricity go? I came up with this question because my grandmother the other day told me to unplug my phone’s charger because the electricity was escaping into the air and would run up our electricity bill. I pondered for a bit and I feel like it makes sense considering the air around us has some moisture. What also helps me make sense of this is that when we left the wire dangling, it did not build up more power. I made sure of this because when the aluminum was placed on the wire, the amount of damage it causes seemed to be somewhat the same. I would also make the comparison of batteries being left alone and still losing charge, but I am not completely sure how other factors can hinder a battery’s life span. 	This knowledge is very valuable to people who want to know how to keep their electricity costs low. But something that also interests me is trying to fix a motherboard I have lying around. Understanding the circuits could bring me closer to finally fixing the motherboard.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3003,"One question I had was about the difference between electric potential and electric potential energy from lab 5. Electric Potential Energy works very similarly to gravitational potential energy. If you lift a stone off the ground, you do work to lift it, and in the process, you give it gravitational potential energy. The same thing happens with charges. If you move a charge a distance from another charge, you do work to move it and you give it electrical potential energy. In either one, when you release the stone/charge they will move back together.The problem with the analogy though is that for gravitational potential energy, you need another mass, in this case, the earth to create the gravitational field you are interacting with. In electrical potential energy, you don't actually need a charge in the other location. You could just have an electric field created by a changing magnetic field or something. We don't have any other way to create gravitational fields so having something like gravitational potential just isn't useful for anything.Electric potential gives us a way to describe energy in a field without depending on the charges involved. You can pick any two points in the field, and find the Electric Potential between them without knowing anything at all about the charges. This is useful, because there may not actually be any charged objects involved. Then, if we do actually want to know something about energy, say we drop a charge in there, then simple multiplication can tell us how much energy it has.I think this concept is important because I myself would always confuse the two, and I am sure others do as well. But now I have a clear difference between both, and others should know about this as well, making it very relevant. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3010,"This reminds me of the electric Current lab we just did. In the lab, we have to set up an electric current to make the light bulb works. When we put a battery into more than one loop, each loop will become individual of its own current and brightness/speed. The more light bulb they have in the loop, the less bright/slower it will be. Therefore, the current is different between each loop. This reminds me of how we use our electric power in our daily life. when we are using both plugs on the wall, the electric current will not decrease or be limited based on how many plugs are we using. each of them is individual and by themselves. Another example would be if we are using one plug to light up 2 light bulbs, the brightness of the light bulb will decrease. when the loop is closed, it's likely that the other loops don't get any current at all. It would also take longer to light up all the light bulbs than lighting up a single light bulb. I wish we can cover more things like this that we can find it during our daily life. I loved the lab and looking forward to seeing something better than it. Thanks. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3009,"One of the most interesting concepts covered in the labs of this class is the idea of equipotential lines from week 5. What was counterintuitive about this for me is the fact that a charge can move around along a circle that has another charge at it's radius, and even though there is a movement of that first charge, no work is actually done. One question I have about this is: is this the equivalent of how in gravity you can toss a ball up into the air, catching it at the same high you released it at, and no work will be done?  Another interesting fact about this I see is that the formula for potential is V = kQ/r while the formula for for electric field is E = kQ/r^2. It's interesting to see how these quantities that seemed so different at first have such similar formulas, and how the formula of electric field is actually just the formula for potential divided by another r (E = V/r).  The most immediate real world application of this knowledge about potential has to do with batteries. Different types of batteries have different amount of voltage, such as a 9V battery being equivalent to 6 1.5V batteries. The knowledge of what potential is and how it is related to electric fields helps to understand what it means for one battery to have more voltage than another."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3014,"Circuits are not only important but the foundation for appliances and electronics we use on a daily basis. From our phones to our computers, to even our bedside digital clocks we are around circuits every day. In our previous lab, we experimented with creating a short circuit using batteries and foil and learned the difference between ""in-sequence"" and ""in-parallel"". A question I would have related to this topic would be: What are logical circuits or logic gates, and how do those concepts apply to physics? Logic gates are an important concept because they allow us to link together many in order to create processing capable units. As far as I know we start at the basic level of components like wires and a battery, and then we can build circuits with those components, and combine those circuits into logical circuits, which we can combine even further to make some sort of basic processing. For example, we could have a logic gate where if two inputs are powered, then the output turns off. allowing us to invert the combined signal of the two inputs. It's interesting how this concept it applies to both physical logic and digital logic that we can program, and I think that's also why it interests me as well because I can see it through the lens of programming."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2999,"How are the electric current of a parallel current and a series current different? Similar?In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each branch remains the same while the current in every branch varies whereas, in the series circuit, the current flowing in the circuit is the same while the voltage across each element differs. The parallel current will flow through a junction to drive the current while the series current is all in one loop and does not have a junction to drive the current. In a series circuit, all components are connected end-to-end, forming a single path for current flow. Series circuits are designed so that the current through each component is the same, whereas parallel circuits are designed so that the voltage through each component is the same. In a parallel circuit, all components are connected across In a series circuit, the current flow through each of the components is the same, and the voltage across the circuit is the sum of the voltages across each component. In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each of the components is the same, and the total current is the sum of the currents through each component. The current through the network is equal to the sum of the currents through each component. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3005,"question: why are circuits important?In our daily lives, we use things and electronics/devices play a large role. We use light (in the form of lamps, etc.) to be able to see during the dark and lamps/etc. use circuits to be able to turn on and/or off. If we did not have circuits, the lightbulbs won't produce light. And if we don't have light, we wouldn't be able to see during the night/whenever it's dark. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3020,"It happened recently , while I was studying for my midterms this semester, sometime at night, a sudden incident happened. The power went off at my room. Living at the dorms here at SFSU, I initially thought it was the whole building though upon further realization, it was only my apartment, more specifically my dormates' room and mine. As time passed by for us thinking of a solution, we managed to fix it through a simple solution which was resetting the breaker. Initially, I thought to myself what could have happened and the first thing at came into my mind was the things that i've been currently learning in physics. What we've learned in lab is the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance. Relating it to the situation that has happened, there could be two main  culprits that triggered the event. It is either that the circuit overloaded, or a short circuit has occured. In an overloaded circuit, this is when a circuit is trying to draw a greater electrical load than intended. While in a short circuit, it is triggered by an increase flow due to a lowered resistance. In our case, no other trips occured after the reset so the most probably cause was due to an overloaded circuit (I personally would blame it on myself but im not gonna get into why)."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2992,"One topic covered in this class over the past few weeks is charge. The basic concept of charge is that like charges repel and opposite charges attract. So, two magnets with the same charges would repel and two magnets with different charges would have an attractive force. Learning more about this would benefit society, because electricity is all around us and basic concepts such as understanding attractive and repulsive forces are important for advancing and maintaining electrical luxuries."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3001,"A concept that was covered in class in the past few weeks was the idea of how wires are used in circuits. Wires are used to carry electricity from one place to another place. The material and size of the wire affect the electric capacity it can carry, If it is too small, then the wire might combust due to it being unable to hold the amount of electricity. Some materials also can hold more electricity can others like copper which is a great conductor for electricity. This information and knowledge can be applicable to real life in cases such that one needs to transfer electricity from one point to another point like a generator to a light switch. One would need to know what material and size of the wire they need to transfer electricity without it combusting due to it being unable to carry the amount of electricity while also desiring to make it the cheapest as possible in terms of the cost of material and money. Another broader example would be electricity from a solar panel farm where massive energy is generated and wires are needed to transfer this energy over massive distances if the energy farm is far away and people would have to figure out what wire. size, and length of wire they need to transfer it to those objects that need the electricity."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3006,"What are some major differences between series and parallel circuits?One major difference between the two configurations is the number of electrical “paths” that they consist of. A series circuit consists of a single path with one or more components along it, whereas a parallel circuit consists of more than one path with at least one component each. Another major difference is that the voltage across a series circuit is equal to the sum of voltage drops across its components, whereas the voltage across a parallel circuit is shared equally by its components and network as a whole. And in terms of current, series circuits have a uniform current shared by each component, whereas parallel circuits may have different currents with the network total equaling the sum of the individual currents.The reason why this is generally applicable for people’s lives is because all electronics that we use rely on circuits to run. One of the most basic examples of this can be found within batteries, which consist of several cells connected in series used to obtain a specific voltage to operate."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3018,When I think of the work I have been doing in the course Many of them stick out to me on what they contribute to the world. Studying physics has changed how I now look at the world because it is the world that we live in so how can we dismiss it. But one stuck out to me that was interesting because I enjoyed the topic and it was Electric flux. Electric flux to me is interesting because I have talked to many people who do not think about the energy in lights and how it contributes to how things work in the day to day life. Well I find it very useful when you are designing a car and need a specific light and power to make the car headlights function properly or you will get yourself in some trouble. A lot of flux is necessary to find out when designing a headlight to be able to produce enough light to see and for others to see during night time and is really important because accidents can happen. I found that pretty cool because the power needed to pass through transparent objects is pretty cool to talk about. I always wondered what makes a light brighter and or how light travels through objects and if an object reduces that initial power. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3000,"One concept covered so far this semester is Circuits. I feel that circuits are very useful for everyday life as it helps in providing electricity and energy for people to use in a safe manner, whether its to power their toaster or to use a bulb. We tend to not realize how dependent we are on circuits and how its used in every way to make life easier. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2994,"My question is, What are some more environmental friendly sources of energy we switch over to?This question might seem like an easy question but in really it is not. The problem is not that the question is hard, the problem is that the vast majority of the people are not educated in the options that are out there for sources of energy. Solar panels capable of producing energy from sunlight is a great alternative to coal consumption for energy production. Windmills is another great sources of energy. In the automotive industry, electrical cars are becoming more and more popular and they are a great way to bring down our oil consumption. There are many different great options out in the market today for sources of energy but people are not well informed of these options. Natural resources have been used for centuries as sources of energy and to change that people would have to be properly educated on these new technologies and products that would change the history of energy. As our natural resources are being depleted, now more than ever it is time to switch to other more environmental friendly and less harmful sources of energy. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3015,A topic that really resonates with me would be how electric fields work. I found that this topic was the most understandable and most useful in for what we are doing in class. Most of the other topics are taking part inside of an electric field and they are being affected by them. An example of what we learned would be how a positive charge moves the field outward and a negative charge pulls the field inward. This was really easy to understand because of all the slides and pictures that was provided by the professor.
