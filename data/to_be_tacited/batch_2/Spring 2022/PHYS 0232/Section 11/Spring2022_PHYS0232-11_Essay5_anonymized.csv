2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3010,"I believe the greatest take away comes with the experience and how it's connected to our daily life. This class gives us the opportunity to put what we learned into our daily life. when we are doing labs, it's not only just an experiment for the theory. it was showing that this can be down in the reality and it's been happening around us. This helps the subject become interesting and fun. I still remember when we are trying to set a paper on fire with a battery, I knew that can be down since high school but I never had the chance to practice and really see it can be down. I feel Physics is so close to us instead of just knowledge in the textbook. This class really helped us to see things in our daily life. Instead of just walking around thinking things should happen in a certain way, we now start to have the mindset to try to understand why is it working in that certain way."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2998,"My greatest take away was the amount of content from Calculus 2 used in the study of physics. I really couldn't see applications of things like integrals until taking this class. There are a lot of applications from other fields, such as computer science. SAGE was my more favorite parts of the labs. It was interesting to learn about a new language and see the functionality of it. We put in many rigorous integrals and derivatives that would be too much for basic calculators to handle. However with SAGE, we are able to get answers within seconds. As a computer science major, I am looking forward to see if I can perhaps utilize SAGE for different reasons. One of the more practical uses is creating graphs. Creating and plotting graphs is a useful visual tool that will be seen time and time again within the industry. There are many things I can take from this class and apply it to the career I have down the road. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3011,"My greatest take away from this class is how understanding physics can help me approach problems with technology more logically. Instead of watching tutorials and copying, I can understand the steps taken to get to the final result. It’s also increíble to see how far students have come, from understanding basic algebra to applying it to physics. To think that everything we leaned up until now can be put to use is really satisfying, especially when revising something we might have seen as useless at first. I loved the experiments in this class because of how the physics were tied in so well to the demonstrations. These demonstrations always helped me better grasp the material, reminding me that math and sciences are not just plugging numbers into an equation. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3005,"Working in groups on the labs. Especially because this class is online, it's a bit harder to focus and working in groups provided help with doing the lab - including that helping each other when doing it. Additionally, I've taken a physics class in high school but the teacher wasn't very good at teaching though I recall the teacher starting of the course by teaching circuits without diving into explaining the basics of physics. When I took my first semester of physics, we were taught the basics like definitions."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3015,"The greatest take away from this course would be the teamwork effort that we practice with every lab. I feel like this will benefit us more than anything that we have learned. It is a skill that can transfer over to any class or work environment. On most job requirement's they ask if you are good with working with a team. So by practicing that now we can get ahead and learn teamwork skills. Another take away from this course would be the learning style that we use. First we watch some slides, then we get hands on experience on the topic. This skill can transfer easily to any other class that runs the same way. It helps build our learning skills and allows us to grasp topics faster. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3020,"Honestly, one of my greatest takeaways from this class is to pretty much learn how the world works. Being in a major and pursuing something that is totally quite unrelated to this course, I feel like this class helps me cover these missing knowledge. This class also does introduce alot of problem solving skills which I think would greatly benefit me in the future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2995,"My greatest takeaway from this class is definitely all the materials I learned. Not only that but how beneficial it is to work in groups and also how to better work in groups. Not only am I learning physics, but I am also learning how to communicate with my peers and also learn alongside them. We all move as a team and learn as a team. I think this is a very important skill set/experience to have because where would we be if we don't communicate with others and bounce ideas from one another. I really enjoy lab and I enjoy working alongside the group I have now."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3003,"My greatest takeaway from this class is the materials I learn about general physics topics. Physics is everywhere, and knowing the things that we are learning in class, gives me a great idea of how things around me operate. So my greatest takeaway from this class is the knowledge I gain from it. I will use the knowledge and try to see where I see the topics I learned in this class in their daily activities. Additionally, in this class, like other classes, we learn more than just the material. We learn to show up. We learn to complete tasks. We learn to participate and follow instructions. The teamwork has also been a great practice to work with others. Also, specifically in this course, we learn to work with others in a group. So another thing I take away from this course is the practice of these skills. Which helps me develop these skills, and use them in my future life. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3002,"My greatest takeaway from this class is to always reinforce what we learn in lecture classes with practice and experiment, and by coordinating with others. After we learn something in lecture, even after finishing homework problems and quizzes, there seems to be gaps in the fundamental grasp of the topic. I think lab really fills in these gaps because we get a mini lecture, more visualizations of the topic with simulations, and finally practice with these simulations. I think filling these gaps in can be possible in things other than physics. In coding for example, we can learn the theoretical side of the code in our classes and even practice some of it for homework. However, to really fill in the gaps in grasping the topics, we have to practice on our own to reinforce our knowledge through repetition. We could also reinforce this knowledge by communicating with others. In lab, we do our lab exploration together in a group. I think understanding others' thoughts on the topic, and seeing how they solve the problem in comparison to ourselves, is a great way to become more familiar and more knowledgeable with concepts. In code, we could do this as well, seeing other people's solutions to problems, and getting to know their thought process in coming up with these solutions."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3008,"My greatest takeaway from this class is getting exposure to the online lab environment where I had to cooperate with different students every week. It felt like a commitment that was educational when I did not understand the concepts of physics lecture, that being PHYS230. I had to muster up a lot of motivation to continue to commit to the weekly schedule due to various instances of negative events that impacted my life to this day. I did gain some insight into circuits which was an interest of mine to look into, but at the end, I understood that what I cherish more than the equations for circuit is is the back-side programming applications that come to it. I am very thankful for your leniency with my work ethics and hope to one day repay you in any way I can in the near future. Thank you."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2993,"My greatest take from this lab was working with groupmates to complete assignments. As that was what made the class the most enjoyable. Working with other people made it feel more like a group effort. I also enjoyed taking the class online as it made it so I didn't have to drive to campus all the time, saving me time and money. I learned that physics surrounds us in every aspect of life such as how the world works, the reason microwaves can heat up food, and many other aspects of life. I also learned how to work with other people to complete assignments. I also learned more about my professor as she works every hard and how grading work is difficult. She always tried helping us so it made each lab more fun as the professor was always cheerful. She also helped on us on our labs so that we could complete them and would check up on us. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2999,"My greatest takeaway from this class is the relations physic has within our actions and world. The way physics relates to our daily actions and the actions of things around us. This class has taught me that there are many more aspects to the way an object moves and stays in place. After learning the different concepts in this course about the actions among everything around us it surprises me how many things there are to movements and the different meanings to the way it moves. From the way, electricity flows to magnetic interactions involves physic to unravel the movement of the different objects. Physics can be used in ways to resolve many questionable situations that involve movement. This class also gave me a good understanding of the reason why things work the way it does. For instance, physics is used in the fault of a car crash, the electricity within our homes, etc. The importance of physic is how it is included everywhere around us. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2997,"I think the greatest takeaway from this class is that there are laws and rules of the universe that cannot be broken. Physics is something that is absolute, It gives you a list of rules that cannot be broken that describes the physical world around us. Physics allows us to describe things that occur in the world around us in a mathematical sense. It allows us to apply math to things that we would otherwise think are magic. This is the greatest takeaway. In have gotten from this class is that things do not occur by magic, there is a way to describe all physical things that occur around us. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3004,"The greatest take away from this lab class has to be the importance of each topic and how there is plenty of uses for them. There have been many times where I have been very confused on the topics, or I am not sure if my knowledge on the topic is correct. This class has shown that doing experiments really does better help my understanding, and has showed me physics isn't just math. Physics involves a lot understanding and why certain equations work the way they work. Specifically, this class I learned how a generator works and how the equation for faradays law is well consistent with the reasoning we made during the lab. I knew what the equation was, but I didn't understand how important the coil and the strength of the magnet play in faradays law. I was able to take a lot out of this class, the lab class made sure I had a better understanding."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3014,"My greatest takeaway from this class has been a few things. Firstly this class has helped me build my skill as a team member. Being a reliable and capable team member is often an overlooked but crucial soft skill. It's one of the many skills that can't be taught directly but has to be experienced and developed, and this class has provided me with the medium to do that. Another takeaway from this class is that it has reinforced my objective thinking skills and my ability to process what a problem is asking and to analyze things in a scientific way. Along with that this class has also given me some knowledge relating to tools that could be useful even outside of this class: The mathematical coding in the SAGE lab. I found that lab really interesting because it both pertains to my field (Computer Science) but also goes to show that there's always more to learn."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3013,"My greatest take away from this class so far was that a lot of concepts that seem extremely confusing at first glance aren't so bad once you start trying to understand them, especially if there are examples. For instance, Gauss' Law has a lot of intimidating diagrams and equations, but the underlying concept is comparatively simple. This means that if there is a new concept that seems impossibly difficult to understand, it will often pay off tremendously to just give it a shot. I have a terrible habit of being overwhelmed by work I haven't started, especially if I don't have a clear path towards finishing it. As such, it helps to have the repeated experience of trying something new and having it be, if not easy, at least much more doable than expected."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3006,"My greatest takeaway from the class was probably the importance of having a team you get along with. If a team is formed with members who do not get along, then they are going to be significantly less productive and rely on each other to a much lesser extent. But when a team works together well—like in the case of the team I was a part of—everyone is much more open to helping each other out and cooperating, getting work done significantly quicker and while enjoying it much more. I feel like I would have had much more difficulty following along with and tackling each of the labs on my own, so having a team I could trust to work alongside me with each lab helped me to be much more productive and learn a great deal more."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2989,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that physics is easy to understand once you understand the concepts however, you also need to practice and practice to get it into your head since physics is like math and we need to practice in order for it to stick into our head. I think another takeaway is that everyone takes in information slower the others since everyone is different in their own way. I think this class also help me understand the importance of working as a team instead of as an individual. I believe this is important because every job in the world will require us to collaborate on a lot of stuff.  Since we are able to work as a group in this lab I think it helps everyone understand how working on teams can be hard if we don't communicate effectively."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2996,"I think the greatest takeaway for me from this class was that physics was apart of our daily lives more than i thought and that there are so many different topics to learn within the physics subject. After doing the labs, post-labs and writing a summary, I realized that physics relates to almost everything we do from just walking to driving a car. Before taking this class, I never really thought hard and deep about physics and what it really does. I always thought that it was just another normal topic for students to learn at school. This class made me realize that physics is basically everything we do. I really enjoyed doing the group labs and learning how it affects our daily lives. This class was very educational and learning about the magnetic fields and different laws was also fun.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2994,"This class was fun and interesting. learning how things work and why they work like that is very important to learn and understand. Apart from learning the class was fun. Testing out how things work was fun and engaging. I think my greatest take away from this class was the learning of how things work. Every day things we use in our house holds yet we do not know how they work, what physics make these things work. I learned a lot and I got a good understanding on electrical currents, magnets, conductors and many other different subjects. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3017,"What was my greatest takeaway from this class? This is an excellent question for me to conclude about the time I spent in the lab. The greatest takeaway from this class for me is building a great friendships with my groupmates. I love Instructor Hoo let us make a group to discuss and finish lab work during class. We finished work efficiently and quickly, and also I made two friends in group work. It's been a two-year stay at home, I don't have any physical friends in my real life, and I never went to the campus before. But, Esau made me feel like I was in the classroom with my actual classmates. We encourage each other and help each other out. During this semester, we built a great friendship is my big takeaway from this class. And also, I feel more confident to continue my steam study career. I am seeking friends and happiness in the further physics class. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3012,"In this class I learned about the electromagnetic aspects of electricity and related experiments. The biggest reward is learning how to cooperate and communicate with teammates to solve problems.This class has developed my skills in how to solve problems and how to think. This will help me to do my job better and work with people when I enter the workplace in the future. What I have learned in this class may enable me to determine what the problem is when there is a problem with an electrical appliance in my home.   Second, in personally, I think that I enjory the process of soving the problem. When I spend time on sovling a problem and I feel a sense of accomplishment. to feel ones progress and to explore the territory of ones's place are the primal dirves of human beings. This is reason why I think physical is very impotant, although my major is computer science.  Finally, thank you for your teaching. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3018,One of my biggest takeaways from this class is my view/observation. It really changed how I look at things in the world and how things work. I have been doing some construction and tree cutting for work and now since taking the course it really helps me on how I make a decision to cut a tree or how to put up a foundation for a home because of the forces acting on these objects. I feel that the course helped me make better decisions based on using real life examples in their assignments or practice problems and that helps you use it in the field. Anything you can take away from the class and apply it to day to day living is a plus and I find it very helpful. Another takeaway is the group work. Being in lab groups helped me a lot as well as a team player because when you have a group who are all on the same page it is always a great work environment and teaches you to be productive in a team in the field. Having to communicate with each other and sharing Ideas was a great experience for me because we all came to an agreeable solution and helped us get the job done swiftly and complete.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3019,"My greatest take way from this class is that physics has a lot of different major that it can interact with. For example, I am majoring in Computer Science and I noticed that during the recent labs, we had to use SAGE as a coding language and it is able to help out solving physics problems much easier. As well as the problem solving nature of physics helps with computer coding. Computer science helps enhances the application and makes solving physics problems, especially ones that can take a lot of time to solve, to take less time. I think this application of computer science is very important because it shows that physics and computer science can intermingle with each other."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2992,"My biggest takeaway from this class is improving the ability to think logically. As a computer science major, I am used to thinking logically, but taking a science class helps improve that ability drastically. I also really liked how a portion of this class was relating physics concepts to everyday life, since it made it easier to digest the material and it helped me realize how physics is a part of our everyday lives, whether we realize it or not."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3009,"I would consider my greatest takeaway from this class to be the understanding of how we can analyze how electricity works in different scenarios. The previous semester of physics was good for what it covered, but it was limited by the fact that it could only cover a few aspects of physics. What made this class interesting was how it used the same principles of understanding physics, but this time for a completely different group of topics. Also, specific to this being the lab section of electricity and magnetism, I liked how we could play around with the physics simulations to see how different changes we might make to a circuit could affect it. All the labs we did helped to expand upon the material I learnt in the lecture section. The ideas were all the same, but this helped to show how they interacted with each other, as the physics simulations all involved multiple physics concepts. I also liked how we learn how to use Sage, as this could help in doing calculation later."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2021,"The greatest takeaway from this class is that it helps us reinforce our knowledge of these concepts.  Showing applications of these concepts we are learning about in our lectures helps in thoroughly understanding them. Being able to play with these concepts in simulations or in-person, I am able to have a better understanding of the concepts in our lectures and textbooks. When I make these connections it helps me reinforce that knowledge and make it more memorable for me. Without this class, more than half the knowledge taught would have been forgotten. In the most basic form, these concepts are simply equations that are easily forgotten. This class helped in breaking down these concepts into components that are easier to understand. Breaking down the problem into these components, and watching how they interact with each other when we change one of these components is what truly helps me fully grasp these concepts."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2991,"It is so quick that this class is going to end. The greatest takeaway from this class and they will benefit from future learning comes in two ways. The primary key is to ask the professor any topic or related questions as soon as possible. However, since we will ask questions, we must make sure we put a lot of effort into it. Sometimes I may ask some obvious questions which I feel as stupid. I believe it is the skill of asking questions. The importance of asking questions reflects in it.  Another way is how to realize efficient cooperation. It is lucky to form my current group, and everyone will do personal work first and then help each other. We tried to work together, and each person provided ideas, but the process came slowly, so we turned it into the current group work plan. The concentration increases, and everyone has more time to interact with the problems they face. I appreciate this class brings me more than learning knowledge."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3000,My greatest take away is that given enough time to any concept the concept will start to seem more and more logical. Many times specifically in physics I would just be fed equations and words without actually knowing the purpose or application. In this class I was able to see the actual application and understand the importance and correlation between each concept. This is all due to thoroughly looking at all the concepts and seeing how it works in the world. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3001,"My greatest take away from this class is that the world is so complex and can be studied and scrutinized to the very details on why things are the way they are in the world. On the outside, I have never questioned to had curiosity to why the world is the way it is, but after this class I began to realize the depth of physics and how it is always prevalent in our lives whether we are aware of it or not. I gained a lot of respect for anyone that is an expert or studies this field with passion due to the difficulty and sheer required will power to learn some of these topics. This might not be the subject for everyone in the world, but I am glad there are people who study this and teach this, since I now know the importance and beauty in physics even though it is intimidating."
