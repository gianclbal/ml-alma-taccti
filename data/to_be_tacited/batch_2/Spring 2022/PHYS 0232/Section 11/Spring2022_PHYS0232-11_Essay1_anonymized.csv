Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2989,"The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is that I really like games and technology so I want to learn how it was made. I also want to try to make a game myself one day and hope that it will be entertaining for people to play. By going into STEM I want to be able to produce different types of games that people of every age can enjoy and have fun playing or at least watch when YouTubers play the games as well. However, to achieve this I need to learn physics and coding so I can make this a reality. I hope from this class I will be able to gain some knowledge that will be very helpful in my future career as a game developer or website developer or whatever my profession is going to be in the future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2990,"I want to go to the STEM field because I like the empirical thinking that goes with the field. I think that it resonates with who I am and I can't imagine being in any other field. Something like art, marketing, or social studies seem to be very different from what I like. I like doing small-scale problems and going through them analytically. As a computer science major, most of the coursework I've done so far is just that. Especially when I'm coding small projects, I enjoy my work. There's a thrill about being stuck on a problem and going through to check your work and finally solving it, only to be given more problems. It's something you can't get in many different fields and it requires continuing education to be able to perform at the top of your profession."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2991,"To be honest, my first step into the STEM field came from future planning. Choosing an excellent major will be the key for me to work in America. That's the reason why I chose computer science as my major. Computer Science is one problem-solving subject with physics, math, and so on. Once I didn't really understand why I should learn linear algebra and basic physics. After I had some work to do about math problem solving, I feel lucky that I have learned before and understood the importance of the STEM field. Otherwise, the STEM field will practice my mind in a logical way. For example, one physics problem requires us to arrange the connection between equations and it will make the question easier and more understandable. It is similar in programming, we have to figure out what class should be in the program and which method should do what work. That’s my way into the STEM field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2992,"I wanted to go into the STEM field when I realized my interest in certain classes. From a young age, I always preferred science and math classes over my English and history ones. Furthermore, I realized that I wanted to go into a field in which critical thinking and problem solving would be involved, and because of that I chose computer science. I specifically chose computer science, because technology drives everything around us and will continue to do so in the future, and it’s interesting learning about something that impacts everyone in their daily life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2993,"The funny thing about me was that I did not go into a stem field knowing that it was a stem field. I mostly chose it because I really liked math over English. In school, math was my stronger subject and I loved playing video games. So I told myself what better field to choose than video games. In the end, I became a computer science major and have enjoyed it ever since. It has been quite the ride with many ups and downs but so far I am enjoying it. I find learning new things to be very fun and interesting. So for that reason, I think this field is a fit for me. I do have one question about the topic that is presented and why do professors always ask this question in a physics lab. Is it because there aren't as many people in stem fields?"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2994,"I want to go into the STEM field because of the wide range of options with in the field. Also the demand for this field is great and constantly growing. My major is Electrical engineering and I chose that because I like to figure out solutions to problems, to work with my hands and come up with ideas to solve problems. For the work force, engineering is a well paid profession with a lot of opportunities for advancement. Adding all of these things together make the STEM field a very good option to have as a profession. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2995,"I am a computer science major and I heard that computer science is actually a mix of all the STEM fields. Why I want to go into the STEM field is because this is something that is focused on and this is something we will rely on in the future to advance. Not only will I future proof the longevity of my job but this is also something I am interested in personally. I always liked technology, science, engineering is fun, maybe not so much math, but it is still interesting. It was always something that I could just listen to being talked about since I was little. Just thinking about advancing and also being part of the advancement is one of the many things that drive me towards the STEM field. These are a few of the many reasons why I am pursuing computer science and have an interest in it. It is also why I am in college now to learn more so that I can hopefully contribute to the future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2996,"I decided to go into the STEM field because i was always interested in coding and technology. I also believe that going into the STEM field and majoring in computer science can help me improve my creativity and gain other new skills. In my opinion, I like to think that I was always good at math which also made me think to go into the STEM field. Also, after graduating and finding a job, the ones in STEM field and make good money and help me live on in the future and support myself. Also, in the STEM field there are many different paths to try, so if i don't like one I could go down another. It gives me more options and at the same time i'm still doing what I enjoy doing. I think the most important thing to do is to pick a major you like and go down that path and i chose a major in the STEM field. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2997,"I want to be in the STEM field because I like asking question and answering them. I enjoy solving problems. I really like the whole process of solving problems so Computer Science is a great fit for me. Computer science involves a lot of complex problem solving. Huge problems with hug solutions. I really like taking the time to find the solution to these big problems. Big problems can neb broken down into a series of smaller problems. This whole process of breaking down the problem is really rewarding for me. I love it. This is the main reason I want to go into the STEM field. Another reason I want to go into the STEM field is the career stability. There are always high paying jobs in STEM, you just need to get into the industry first and you will be ok. High paying jobs and demand for work are a big reason I want to be in STEM."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2998,"I want to go into the STEM field because it is a professional frontier that can always be expanded upon. Our technology advances every day, and being a part of the STEM community allows me to see progress in real time. Especially within my field of study computer science, there are many avenues I can take with my professional life. Right now, I think I want to go into cybersecurity. As the digital space becomes more accessible and important, cybersecurity will be needed more often than before. Digital security is a big concern for many big companies and people alike. The STEM field is a vast area of study with so many ways to contribute to society. The digital age can only progress from here, and we see new trends and concerns arise every day. Within recent years, cyber attacks have been happening each and every day. Sensitive information can be breached and given to the wrong hands; This threat is why cybersecurity is such an interesting field for me. Being able to provide clients with good cyber protection is something I can see myself doing as a living. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2999,"I would like to go into the STEM field because it is the best way to understand rather than writing multiple essays. My major is biology concentration in psychology and my minor is in Asian American studies. I love learning and am excited when I learn more about us and everything around the world. Biology helps me understand the life of human beings, etc. Hands-on problems help me understand more than sitting and continuously writing about things that are hard for me to explain. The best way for me to learn is hands-on, it helps my brain figured things out faster. I am also very interested in the STEM field rather than the other since it is difficult for me to understand the purpose of the concepts. The stem concept helps me understand it easier since it has more hands-on actions, I learn through hands-on or seeing it happen. The way I learn leads me to have a good interest in the STEM field. It has been good for me so far and it is getting me more into it with all the various topics there is to it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3000,"I want go into STEM for multiple reasons. First, all my family have always been in the STEM fields so naturally as a child when talks in regards to STEM would circulate I would adopt an interest in similar things as children do when developing. Second, With this interest I always was fascinated in creating and understands how to world is structured and how it works in terms of STEM. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3001,"I want to go into the STEM field, because it seems the most interesting and also pays a decent amount too. Growing up, it was hard to find something I liked in school in terms of an academic subject. I always enjoyed school only for the ability to socialize with friends. Every class or course seemed like a hassle except for one subject, computer science. The idea around being able to create something which had virtually limitless potential lit a tiny spark in my heart. After taking a computer science class in high school, I realized that it was probably my favorite subject in school beside history, but I realized as I grew that one field was more employable than the other so with that factor in mind, I knew history was interesting, but just didn't have the usefulness as computer science in this present day and age. Computer science was my best option."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3002,"I want to go into the STEM field because I've always been interested in computer science, especially with software development and coding. Even before doing computer science, I was majoring in nursing as it was another career in STEM I was interested in. Ultimately, I wanted to go into computer science because it had more things I was comfortable and enjoyed doing, such as more math, puzzle solving, and less direct working with patients. Of course, there is also the ""prestige"" of majoring in STEM because of the good paying jobs and the difficulty in its curriculum. I think there is truth to this notion, but with passion, people can make any major work. As for the future, I think it is important to have a stable career or something I can at least manage before trying to move up to higher positions. It is exciting but also daunting, but I will try my best to make it work."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2021,"I want to go into the STEM field because there is always something to do. Technology to me is something I was interested in, watching how things worked was fascinating to me and sometimes I would try to recreate it myself. I love having the ability to create something, and is why I chose to follow Computer Science. I believe programming allows me to create something from nothing. I'm pursuing a career in coding because It feels like it's never ending. There is always something new I have yet to see. When trying to figure out things I start somewhere and I wind up somewhere else because somehow they all build on each other. There is also the fact there is never one solution to a problem, I like how many different ways you can approach something and still end up with a solution. I know for a fact that in STEM I can always find something that will keep me interested in learning about."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3003,"I want to go into the STEM field, particularly the Technology Field so that I can pursue of interest in technical analysis, web development, and video game development. I have had an interest in technology and computers from a young age, and I know that’s what I want to do with my future. I would really love to go into the video game industry, in hope of becoming a developer or such. I would like to work with massive teams and great people to create AAA video games for youngsters to enjoy. As I do right now. I want to create content for people to enjoy, honesty anything that involves technology. I also have an interest in web development. Who knows, I might even create my own application or website as an entrepreneur. What I know is that I like doing these things, and the road ahead of me will be a difficult one. But I believe in myself."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3004,"The reason I'm in the STEM field is because I love science, I also really love learning challenging things. There is a type of satisfaction you get when you understand something so complicated and really interesting. Money is also factor in why I'm in the STEM field, but getting money in the STEM field is harder so money doesn't really place a big factor why I'm in the STEM field. I'm also in the STEM field to meet new people who are interested in the topics I'm into (networking), being a shy person this should probably break my shell. I also think I'm in the STEM field is because I want to work on a project that will change people's lives, something that would everybody would benefit from. Also, since most of my family comes from a poor part of Mexico, I would love to advance the technology they have available there. It would be cool if we finally got high speed internet up in the mountains. I think the huge reason to why I am in the STEM field has to do with my family I knew this field would be hard to take on, but with family support I would be able to graduate."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3005,"I decided to major in Computer Science since I was in middle school (7th grade specifically) and I took classes in high school, as well as doing a program outside of school related to Computer Science to help me when I get into college. As I took those classes (and continued in college), I learned that STEM fields weren't as diverse gender wise, where it was more men dominated and not many women being in those fields. Why I want to go into the STEM field is not only to change the way they're men dominated and to hopefully get more women to join those fields, but to also help myself learn more academically and to grow as a person. I recall reading an article on the topic of STEM fields being male dominated, and I found that one of the main possible reasons to why not many women are joining the STEM field is because they would get comments regarding their skills in difficult subjects like math and science, leaving them to give up on their dream to join the STEM field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3006,"I don’t think there was a specific reason I decided to join a STEM field other than the fact that the major I’m pursuing happened to really pique my interest. I was originally going to school to become an actuary, but took a Computer Science class because it was recommended for my major. When I took the class, I ended up getting much more interested in the class than in the previous classes I had taken for my actuarial classes. So, to test out my interest a bit more, I took on more Computer Science classes the next semester and ended up getting hooked on the subject. And since then, I’ve been passionately pursuing Computer Science, since it was a subject that really resonated with me. I guess it boils down to the fact that my way of thinking was better suited to Computer Science since I enjoyed thinking through problems logically and not through some sort of memorized manner. That is why I wanted to go into a STEM field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3007,"I want to go into the STEM field for the money and long life stability. At first , I did nursing and didn't like it. My cousin who currently works at facebook ended up doing Computer Science as a minor in his university. So I thought to myself "" IF he can minor in it then I can major in it and become just as successful"". The money is well deserved for the work you do in the field and it is easily the best way to set up yourself for a long life financially and mentally. I want to get into Web Development and build websites and try to get really technically when coding , that is my main goal and try to evolve as a human just like tech is in the world."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3008,"I want to go into the STEM field because I wish to be able to present more opportunities through technology to my community I have been raised at. To be able to make people's lives convenient in some way is essential to my life, but to do so through technology, an interest I had since I was little, will ultimately make my goals be fulfilled.I love the concept of ever-growing evolution of technology, this in turn has made me very open to new learning knowledge every time new technology is introduced to my life and work environment. That is where so far I am prepping to be able to speak to anyone with technology by taking part of sales opportunities with tech products, such as HP and Intel Computers. I learned a ton from STEM field jobs, which I have been taught that essentially everyone is trying to reach technology to make their lives a little easier, a concept that corresponds to my goals.I however do not wish to stay in sales because I want to be able to create that technology or software that makes people's lives much easier, which is where my career pathway stands.I also have the influence of the way my city is basically turning into a city of technology, something that promotes me to want to be exposed to this wave of tech, but to apply it as well to the goal I mentioned above."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3009,"The main factor making me want to go into a STEM field is the element of creativity and problem solving that is required to succeed in this field. For example, when solving a mathematical problem, either a purely mathematical problem in a math class or a science/engineering problem that requires math among other skills, one must first think of the formulae that are needed to solve this particular type of problem, and combine this with previous experience in solving similar problems, in order to figure out the result. This is a type of problem solving that has clear rules and a clear goal, which makes it a field with practical, concrete problems, whereas the problems found in a different field such as English are far more abstract. The answers given to problems in an English class are for the most part open to interpretation, but the answers to STEM problems are either true of false. This is one of my favorite things about STEM fields."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3010,"AS a CS major student. STEM means the future of the industry. Most of the STEM jobs are highly demanded since the need for them is what pushing natural sciences, math, engineering, and technology-related fields forward as a country. As a CS major, I can feel the pressure of it. STEM is also generally high pay rate jobs. Therefore, many students were attacked because of it. I chose the STEM field for the same reason. I was being introduced to the CS major during my second year of high school. My uncle’s job was to make websites for other people. I feel it’s so cool that we can make websites with code, so I start to get in touch with the website development. Later I found out that website development is a low pay rate job, and I also like to make apps for people to use. Therefore, I start to learn C++ and java. I’m currently aiming for a master’s degree in CS."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3011,"I am in the STEM field because ever since I was a kid I was fascinated with science. I enjoy seeing the world discovering new things that move us forward and investigating how we can make different processes work with higher efficiency. I have spent most of my life with computers so I felt like it was logical to pursue computer science. My time with computers did help me, mostly Minecraft. Minecraft was the most interesting game for me because I could design mechanisms to automate actions. When I saw my friend build a logic gate in the game, I became interested in the logic programmers use. Learning to solve problems was a big deal for me. I was once stuck in the mindset that all learning was just memorizing up until my second year of high school. I took an AP class to check if computer science was my true passion and figured out I love it. I got to design applications, make them, and share them. Designing the application and coming up with an original idea was demanding, but I really enjoyed it. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3012,"First, the SETM field stills has good prospects from an employment prespective. Because society can't grow without science, technology, engineeing and mathematics. There is still a great demand for related ETMS practitioners in the society.  In my country, people often say that learning mathematics, physics and chemistry well will not scare you anywhere in the would. It means studnet of ETSM filed can find the job easily.  Second, in personally, I think that I enjory the process of soving the problem. When I spend time on sovling a problem and I feel a sense of accomplishment. to feel ones progress and to explore the territory of ones's place are the primal dirves of human beings. I have a good foundation in mathematics in my high school, which will help me to be more relaxed in learning this field. Therefore, I chioce the SETM field. I believe that SETM field has a good future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3013,"I want to go into the STEM field because of a few reasons. The process of figuring out solutions to problems through logical processes has always appealed to me. There is also the idea that, most of the time, 'success' or 'failure' in terms of scientific experiments, computer programs, and the like is a lot more clearly defined than when writing papers or studying history, for instance.    The pay for jobs in STEM is also appealing, but the primary reason the STEM field is appealing to me is the  aforementioned idea of problem-solving. A scientific concept or  discovery, or a computer program, or a functional machine part can be  used as a step towards a larger problem, until either the original  objective, or a newly discovered one has been achieved."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3014,"The field of Computer Science has always interested me. I decided to pursue a career in STEM because I feel as though it is the gateway to advancing technology and understanding. Technology has always fascinated me and being able to work with it directly and be a foundational member of software engineering is my passion. My passion also lies in teaching, as many of the concepts can be hard to understand, and if I can help just one person learn then I have made an impact. Another reason I decided to focus my career in STEM, particularly Computer Science, is that I am a member of a minority group. As a member of a minority group, I feel as though Computer Science has given me the opportunity to represent my community and show that anyone can learn. It can be incredibly demotivating to be the only person of color in your class or workplace regardless of the field, but STEM particularly is affected by a disproportionate amount of non-minority men."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3015,"The STEM field has always been my favorite section of education. I am not suited for arts or literature because I get bored easily in those types of courses. The way things are graded, judged, read, or assigned just makes the process of studying those fields unappealing. Half the time in my English course I was tailoring my writing to things that my professor wanted to see. There is no way to get a “correct answer” when writing an essay. In STEM fields, there is typically a solution or a formula for things. Problem solving and working out those solutions is interesting to me. We get graded on whether we get the correct answer or not. Also, I am majoring in computer science because of my love for technology. Writing programs and watching them work after hours of debugging and planning is very satisfying. I found this passion after taking one intro to computer science class during high school. However, STEM courses were always easier for me to handle than any other field since middle school. Now I get to learn more about coding and web development all while having fun studying it. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3016,I joined the stem field mainly because there is a good career behind it and I have a bigger interest in the sciences and technology. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3017,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field? This is a good question for my college career. Be honestly, I don't have any reasonable goal that led me to join the STEM field. The main reason why I go into the STEM field is about money. Because as a STEM engineer, you can get well pay than other jobs. I need this money to support my other hobbies, such as travel, playing sports, and buying stocks on the finance market. So, this is why I want to go into the STEM field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3018,"The reason I chose to be in the STEM field is because, I always was Interested as a child in anything that had to do with science so, as I got older I got into construction so it pushed me to go into engineering. If I was not doing Engineering I would be doing Geography because I enjoy the world and its Natural Beauties. Stem is a hard field as well and I always wanted to test myself pass or fail to better my mind and give me better understanding of myself. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3019,"I want to go into the STEM field because I enjoy coding. I enjoy learning a new language or a new way to code. Having multiple ways to code is fun to me which is why I am majoring in computer science. I have also enjoyed playing with computers since I was young and I thought this major would suit me quite well. The STEM field is also a field that has a lot of positions and it is great o know that I will have a decent paying job when I graduate. And hopefully I will be able to find a job that I find fun and comfortable enough to live on. Since computer science has a lot of different languages and different styles of coding, I hope to find something that I really enjoy doing. Preferably I would like to be able to work as a developer for a gaming studio. Maybe create my own game or be some sort of app developer."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3020,"Personally, I want to go into a stem field for my interests and computers and to try and explore a whole new world apart from what I usually love to do (creative aspect). Growing up, I found myself constantly choosing on what career I wanted to pursue and venturing into the whole tech field, I love the variety and diversity in careers that I could go into which also could involve things I love to do. Ultimately the major that I have decided is Computer Science. Being able to code a project from 0 to a program which can potentially be anything you imagine from games to something more lifesaving and personal. This is what amazes me and what I personally find interesting that made me choose going into the STEM field."
