2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2994,"Online class although they have been very convenient they have been much harder to learn from and keep up with the classes. I live 40 mins away from SFSU and that aspect has been great. Time wise and economically online classes have been good. On the hand online classes have really messed up my learning. I feel that being online is much more draining mentally which makes it that much harder to stay focus and learn. Online classes also seems that you never get the appropriate help and resources need for you to be successful in the class. What I try to do is to allow plenty of time before my classes to mentally prepare for them. I also try to take my classes in a quiet room free of all and any distractions. I am concern though that my academic level has gone down, that it will be harder for me to get back on track once the university is fully in person. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3005,"When it comes to online classes, I attend them in the comfort of my own home though the downside to that is all the distractions around me. I tend to lose my focus in class because of that as well as the motivation to be productive and learn what the professor is teaching/showing on the screen. Majority of my classes are online though there is one that is fully in person (though our homework is online) and another class that is hybrid (where we meet in person one day and online on another day), in addition to being a computer science major - this results in staring at my laptop a lot and sitting for hours a day. Though what I do for self-care, I tend to just make sure I take breaks and do something that doesn't require staring at a screen."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3017,"Honestly, maybe I have different opinions from other students about the online classes. I love the online classes. Online classes save a lot of time for me. I don’t need to fight for the parking lot around the campus every morning. I don’t need to walk through campus to the teaching building and find the perfect spot for the class. It saves a lot of time for me and saves my daily energy too. Online classes are also flexible. I can watch lectures or do homeworking wherever I am. Usually, I will finish my daily workout and my job first, and then watch the asynchronous course’s lectures. I think I am a self-conscious person, I can handle my daily plan pretty well, so I don’t worry about being lazy for fully online classes. I don’t have any concerns about my learning and well-being. Just keep doing great and don’t give up, I will be successful in the future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3002,"Online classes have impacted my learning positively and negatively.  For the positives, I am less stressed when getting to classes and when doing assignments, because I have slightly more time turning them in. For the negatives, I sometimes doze off more during classes that are later in the day. I think it is due to being in my room and not having the classroom setting. As for self-care, it has been more difficult. Since I do not have to keep myself as presentable anymore because classes are online and almost everyone's camera is off, sometimes I let my hair and facial hair grow out without noticing it. Also, I do not get as much physical activity as before when walking around campus and whatnot. I do not have much concerns because I make sure to put as much effort as I would in physical classes, since I know a lot of the things I learn in classes is important for my career. For my well-being, I think I just have to take a break sometimes and look at how I am doing physically and mentally. I think I'll be fine."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3011,"I am unsure if online school directly correlates to my decrease in motivation for school. I do not feel as motivated as I used to and I feel like I am being left behind. It is difficult to keep up for me which was not an issue in the past. I feel like learning in person has caused me to appreciate the amount of focus this type of instruction can provide. For my in-person class, I don’t feel left behind but I still lack motivation. I really appreciate not having to commute to school but it is difficult for me to focus on the online environment. I wish to try and find what caused my sudden decrease in motivation, I had a great workflow for my last three semesters online, and then suddenly it all disappeared. Those three semesters I was happy to be online and enjoyed all of my classes, but I believe that the online era may have overstayed its welcome for me. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2999,"While transferring to online classes became a struggle that is hard to normalize. Although I anticipate it to be hard to handle, it allowed me to focus on my self-care. Online classes impacted my learning by trying to understand the concept without being in a focused environment. Not only does it affect my focus, but it affected the practices of my time management. Practicing time management was one of my main focuses when I attend school, but I have lost my focus on time management. Online courses have allowed me to focus on my self-care, I was able to designate a time to have some time for myself. The time I spend on self-care is a spa day, thirty-minute exercise, or a glam day where I dress up. Not only does a self-care day help my mental health in this pandemic, but spending my time with my family allowed me to interact with others. While this pandemic is affecting our mental health, being strong and fighting through this time will only make us realize how strong we are. My concerns during the transition are that if I can handle the workload and be able to study without a quiet environment. Nevertheless, it worked out since I am still able to take summer classes and stick through this chaotic time. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3007,"The online class system helped me a lot in my daily life. It saves me really good time and makes me manage time actually better than before. I get to have more time to go to the gym and do actual errands for the house. I don't have to commute anymore so I have time to study more at home. The only concern I have is I'm sometimes late to my assignments or class just because it does get tend to be relaxed more at my house but other than that, no complaints."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3013,"Online classes have been both a blessing and a curse. It is tremendously helpful to be able to work from home, but at the same time, I think that sleep, leisure, and schoolwork all taking place in the same room and from the same place has had a deleterious effect on my mental health. I have been unable to focus on any of my work, whether due to the aforementioned reason or otherwise, and it is taking a serious toll on my grades and well-being. I have recently tried to set a rigid sleep schedule for myself and tried to block out specific times to work or relax to combat the muddying of the two, and it has helped a fair amount, though it still remains a problem."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3018,"Online classes have actually been pretty good for me because it helped me a lot with being able to manage my life and school much better. It was hard to commute to SF and then come back to the East Bay and have stuff to get done after. Now I was able to wake up, go to class right from home and do my work right here as well. That left me with studying for the next class. Then I was able to get my day going for work or running errands. It has been pretty beneficial for me and I kind of enjoy this way of learning. I don’t have any concerns for my learning because we have the luxury to go back and see recorded lectures so that we can repeat the information in our head and it's pretty helpful and you rarely get that option in person and would have to take extreme notes and or remember the material so being online is helpful. Some classes are meant for in person but so far it's been pretty good."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3001,"Online classes have impacted my learning in various ways. In one way, it saved me bunch of time in a sense that I do not have to go to campus directly which would use about 2 hours of my daily time and instead allocate that time into other categories like homework or free time to take care of myself. Another way to look at this was that my quality of education might have gone a little bit down since online teaching is probably not as effective as in person teaching overall in my personal experience, but I feel like it all depends on the course and professor. I personally do not mind it as much as other students I have heard them, because I enjoy not having to travel to campus which saves me time to do other things. I think both options should be available for all students if they prefer one style over another. I have been trying to stay in a good mood by entertaining myself through the internet with content that makes me smile or laugh to keep my mental health in a good spot."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3020,"I honestly have split thoughts about this prompt. Online classes has given me upsides and downsides when it actually comes to learning. One thing I definitely love is flexibility. Having the opportunity to take classes without the hassle of travelling to campus / wasting time on the go is definitely something I really like. It allows me to have extra time to study and review things rather than focusing on driving or walking. Online classes (with recorded lectures) is something that also helps me when it comes to learning as I get to look back and immerse myself more with what has been taught. With this ""luxury"" i'd say of having no commute, one downside is actually getting to focus on what is going on with all the distractions around me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2996,"Online learning have impacted in good and bad ways. I think online classes have made me lazier due to the fact that we are all at home and in pajamas. I feel like I am not as active as I was when classes were in person. However, to fix that I go on walks everyday to try and be more active. There were also times were I did lack motivation for school, but I believe that happens to everyone at some point during online classes. I think online learning is actually easier for me than in person classes because it allows me to follow my schedule better. I am a somewhat slow pace learner, so online classes gives me the ability to learn at my pace more. However, I do miss in person classes because we can be more social and interactive. I believe it's healthier to be social with people in person rather than online."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2998,"Online classes have really tested my self - efficacy and time management skills. In class, the class schedule and agenda is more streamlined. For an online environment, most of the learning is achieved through the student themselves. From study habits, to allotting enough time for home work and studies, there are more responsibilities that the student bears during an online class. Online classes have tested my time management skills, and there are a lot of things to work on. For self care, I've been documenting my weight loss as of recently. I was bulking up all of 2021, so I'm beginning to cut body fat for 2022. I've managed to lose ~9 pounds, so I have a long way to go. So far, this class is doing a wonderful job operating in an online environment. All of the labs are easily accessible through online means and I'm learning as much as I would in a physical environment. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3009,"Online classes have definitely had an impact on how my school life operates, and this class is probably the class I'm currently taking with the most notable difference. This is because it is a lab class. My other physics class is a lecture class, which means that the difference between in-person and distance learning is smaller than the difference for this lab class. This is the main area of note for me; self care is not much of an issue here. One of the most important things to do in order to get more out of distance learning in my experience has been to have out of class discord meetings with other students. This involves creating a conference call with some of the students found in a particular class, and we can then discuss any material that we don't fully understand yet. This helps to make up for the decreases student to student interaction during zoom learning hours, and has the advantage that we can have an easier time scheduling and attending meetings."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3003,"I'm in class every Tuesday and Thursday from 10:30 to 6:00 with only 15-minute breaks between classes. Being stuck at home all day in front of a computer for synchronous classes sucked, so I started walking around my block between classes to mimic walking from one class to another on campus. This got me out of the house and into some much-needed fresh air and got me moving a bit. I didn't start this until halfway through the semester, but it definitely helped me decompress a bit and I'm going to continue doing so next semester. As for my learning, it has been a bit harder. Many say there are distractions at home. My problem hasn't been so many distractions, but everyone else disappears. This semester a lot of my classes have been participation heavy, and I've ended up ""carrying"" the participation and it just made me feel burnt out and bitter at everyone else for not talking. I get it, people are distracted and not fully engaged but part of what I'm a person that I loved is that I can bounce off of other people and not be the only one interacting with what we learn."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3004,"Online classes haven't really impacted my learning in a way that I can say has damaged me or negatively affected me. I like having online classes and doing them in the comfort of my own home. I will say though with online classes it's harder to keep a good schedule and procrastination has become more of a problem for me then before. Also, with the transition of most classes being in person I have to plan out my day very strategically. It becomes more stress inducing, but this will always happen with changes in schedules, and since most classes don't require for me to be in class all the time, it's giving me a good transition for next year where most classes will be in-person. The only thing that I worry about from online classes is my test taking abilities going back into in person. Since most professors don't have a way to know if your cheating during the test, they make the tests open notebook. So now I have to adjust to building a good studying habit and get used to the time pressure."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3015,"how online classes have impacted your learning and what you are doing for self-careI have mixed feelings about online classes. First, the pros, which would be flexibility, time management, and self-discipline. Being at home and planning my day with the workload given to me for the week is pretty nice. I can either take a full day to finish my work for the week or take it easy and finish an assignment per day. I manage my time according to what is happening with my classes and personal life. Lastly, having everything depend on my work ethic boosts my motivation to get my work done. The downsides of online classes are the heavy workload, less communication with peers, and the learning experience. Compared to an in-person class, I noticed a large increase in workload. Though professors give a lot of time to do it, the workload is a lot heavier. With webcams and mics being optional, people tend to stay quiet and just listen to the professor run through the slides. It eliminated communication with classmates and it can sometimes be bad when it comes to group work. This ties with the learning experience because we are just staring at our screens hoping we can learn something. It definitely feels inefficient. As for what I am doing for my self-care, I take a day off from my work and just relax. Normally, this is when I plan my week and gather my thoughts. It helps whenever I feel overwhelmed.  What concerns do you have for your learning and your well-being?I wouldn't say they are concerns but the way I am learning is changing. I rely on having a day or two of time for an assignment. Also, my note-taking strategy is changing. If lectures are recorded then I pay attention and try to grasp the concept on the first run. Then on another day, I re-watch the lecture to write notes. I find it really effective, but it might not work for others. For my well-being, I try to make free time for the things I like to do."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3008,"This entire semester for me has been very hectic, where this class has been one of the affected classes that has led me to be unable to catch up due to the commitments I have outside of class. I come to class mostly every day, to leave this one for last, ending up in not being able to turn in weekend work as I am filled with piles of work to do during the week that extends to the weekend. I believe it has been this way for me because of the fact that I have not established a well form to cope with a mix of online and in person learning, as I learn best in person. I more or less lose some interest in the concepts learned through online learning which has affected my attendance in the past. It was not until last semester when I told myself that I need to get as many in person classes, but it backfired due to limited classes offered in person, not to mention the fact that we started the first three or so weeks online.It has been hard to recover but I hope that I am able to end off with passing the classes I am struggling the most on, such as this class, to rebound for next semester. I apologize for having to negatively reflect my ethics to you professor, but I hope we can work out a way to end things right. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3012,"The online courses allow me to have more freedom in my schedule, but also have the problem of not being as attentive during class and being easily influenced by cell phone ads, etc. I think I should keep my phone away from the class and turn it off. This will improve my learning efficiency. My self-care efforts include running every morning and joining the boxing club for group training on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I hope that I can continue this good habit in the coming days. It is important to keep a healthy body during the new covid-19 pandemic that is not yet over. On the other hand, I think I need to improve the pratice outside the class, becasu I found that it is net enough if i rely on the topics thaugh on the class, and sometimes, I cann't solve the different problem in exams very well. Therefore, I should more concrate on this class."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3006,"Contrary to what I originally thought, I actually found that online classes have actually improved my mental health and productivity. My schedule is now significantly freer than it had previously been while attending in-person lectures, since I could go straight from bed to class without needing to prepare anything. And because most classes record their lectures, it is much easier to review anything without worrying about missing anything in my notes. And having all assignments online, it is much easier to keep track of deadlines, making it easier to manage my time. One thing that worries me about this switch is that I may become too reliant upon the new conveniences it gives me, making it more difficult to transition back to in-person lessons. Additionally, not being able to interact with or really see one another gets rid of the more personal aspect that I’ve come to appreciate about school, leading to less personal connections and forged bonds."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2992,"Online classes have definitely made the learning experience more difficult last semester. However, this semester since classes followed a hybrid schedule, it was much easier paying attention in online classes, since it was a different experience than that of March 2020. I think the way that the world is progressing on the Covid situation, I don't have any concerns for my learning and well being as of now. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3014,"Describe how online classes have impacted your learning and what you are doing for self-care.I think I'm one of the few who really appreciate online learning. Online learning has helped me focus more on my classes and the material since I don't have to worry about the commute. It used to be that during my commute I would be so tired and forget about what I learned that day. For self-care, I've been getting out and exercising as well as spending my extra time with loved ones. Another benefit of having remote classes is that I have more time to spend with my family.What concerns do you have for your learning and your well-being?As weird as it sounds I have a concern about going back to Campus. Not only am I immunocompromised but the commute will bring back my original struggles with classes. Another concern I have, related to my well-being, is that I won't have as much time to take care of my dad, as I do now. Taking care of my dad is very important to me, and being able to make his meals and make sure he gets to his doctor's appointments is important."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3010,"Since we had 2 weeks off from the spring break, I was able to get some rest and put myself into the work with more focus and attention. However, lab 11 was really disappointing since I really feel it has nothing to do with the phys. All we did was putting simple python code to form couple of math equations. I really don't see the point of this. If I want to learn python, I can learn more by watching a 40 min youtube. Therefore, the lab was not as fun or useful as the other ones we have done. If we can get back to phys and keep doing the fun lab we have been doing, I think we would have a great experience in this class. I think this is what's bad about the online classes. it gets kind of boring fast. We were doing good. next semester I'm going back to the building so hopefully, it would be better."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2989,"During the online classes, I have noticed that I can't focus as well as when I'm in an in-person class. During the online classes, I would be on other tabs somethings on my computer instead of fully paying attention to the lecture. Some self-care I did to get better at this is to have a cup of tea next to me and I would have zoom open full screen so it will make me less likely to change the windows on my computer. Some concern I have is that maybe I'm not learning efficiently enough because I know that I learn better in person. Other than that I think my well-being is fine and hasn't changed since the pandemic started."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3000,Online classes have impacted my learning in many ways. Some for good and some for bad. First with the good is that it allowed me to be in the comfort of my own home and that has been very beneficial because if I may be in need of support I can be close to my family. The bad is that learning hasn't been as intuitive so its sometimes hard to grasp a concept within the class time to I have to find different ways of learn the concept better.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,3019,"I think online classes have impacted my learning positively and negatively. I think I prefer online classes because I don't have to waste time going to class and I can easily access my zoom meetings. This saves me a lot of time and it enables me to be able to work from home more often. However, I will admit that it can affect my learning by allowing me to be distracted at home. Because it is an online class, there are things that I can get away with like some classes not having mandatory zoom meetings or graded participation. For self-care, I have been trying to not allow myself to be holed up in my house and try to go out as often as possible. During the pandemic, I wasn't able to go outside and I think it affect my well-being. I do have some concern about going back to in person classes because there are still variant of COVID-19 still out and having to adjust back to in person will take some time doing so."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2991,"Since the Covid, my first-year online class has to start. Unfortunately, I cannot take some classes on-site. The standard campus teaching form transfers a lot. The online classes bring us a new way to access classmates and professors, have teamwork online, and talk through discord. I believe the online classes bring me different ways to access classes. If I miss any significant classes and require to review them, the software Zoom provides me with a platform that can store video recordings. Otherwise, the efficiency of group works highly improved a lot. I once worried about teamwork because some experiments classes are not suitable for working online. In this way, sharing screens and efficient group talking simplify teamwork idea-sharing. For the self-care to Covid, I have bought many medical masks and a self-test covid kit. The disinfection cannot ignore, like using alcohol to clear your phone when you go back home. I hope the Covid will be cured, and we can return to regular campus study."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2997,"Online learning has definitely impacted my ability to ask questions during class. Also, it has impacted my labs because there is not a physical thing I can touch and feel. This is very helpful to my learning. I am just trying to keep up with my classes and get all A’s. I think keeping busy is good for my mental health, and also making a clear separation of weekend and weekdays has helped me have free time to myself. I am concerned that I don’t get enough physical activity because I am so busy with school."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2021,"Online classes have impacted my learning in ways I didn’t expect it would have. I went directly to College after graduating High School. My life schedule was basically working around a school schedule. After COVID essentially shut-down everything, a large portion of my schedule was freed-up. Since I now longer had to account for commute time and many other things, it took a long time before I got used to having all this free time. Not realizing how important it was for me to follow some sort of schedule I developed bad habits. Being stuck indoors for a long period of time messed up my sense of time and eventually caught up to my academic life. I performed poorly in school so much that I skipped classes without realizing it. After realizing how much my GPA tanked I knew things needed to change. I tried coming up with a schedule to follow almost everyday to get back that tempo I once had before COVID took it away. The schedule wasn’t necessarily set in stone but more like guidelines of things I would do before moving on to the next. Slowly I started to gain back that momentum. After picking up some hobbies and following a schedule I'm doing much better than I did at the start of COVID."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,11,2995,"Online classes have given me more opportunities to do things and also the ability to stay safe in the comfort of my own home. It saddens me that the university is trying to get students back on campus. I know we are having a better battle against covid but the reality is that not everyone will feel safe and the school is pressuring too many students. It really feels like they are giving us the fake pity words and then telling us to ""get it over with"" in a nice way. Nothing is wrong with providing recordings of lectures for students who wish to school safely at home online while also providing an on-campus option. There are many other universities out there that have in-person classes but also provide lecture recordings. Right now, my self-care is to get up as much as possible and walk around. I still interact with my classmates via discussions or other social apps. I do everything I can to make online learning work so that I can remain to feel safe. The only thing I need is for SFSU to start listening to students instead of finding excuses to force students back in person."
