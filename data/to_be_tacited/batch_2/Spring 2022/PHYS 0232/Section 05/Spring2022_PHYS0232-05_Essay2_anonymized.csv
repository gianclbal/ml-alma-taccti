2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2892,Honestly my goals right now are just to graduate with a Computer Science degree and get a job in the field. This class is very important to that due to the fact that it is a major requirement. It is also important to me because I have been lost in my physics 2 class and I feel that I learn the materiel better in this lab then in my lecture and my lecture is also a degree requirement. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2884,"My goals for this class is to learn as much about the topic at hand, and have a good understanding about physics. This class would help me understand more about electronics and how they are used in the real worlds and how we can use electronics to further the world. Things I can use to help me achieve this goal is to just keep coming to class and learning as much as I can. Other things that can help me achieve my goals are going to tutoring and trying to correlate between class and lab more often so I can have a better understanding about whats happening. Other thing that would help me achieve my goal is to try to do my own research for real world applications that apply to the topic at hand an doing a in depth research into it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,170,My goals in the grand scheme of things is to become a teacher and have gained enough life experience to be a good high school teacher specifically. That’s my only real goal. This class was a great example of teaching the way the professor was able to stay calm and direct people. The way he was able to joke and handle everyone was always great to see. I want to become a teacher like he was. Other than that you know the purpose of this class is to help me get my degree and that’s what this class is leading me to and the faster I become an engineer the faster I can become a high school teacher. That’s more or less how this class will help me reach what I want to become
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2901,"My goals for this class would be to be able to do all of the labs with little trouble and be able to gain an understanding in class. I want to be able to finish this class with an A or B and to have been able to contribute to my classmates during our lab work. Physics has never been my strong suit and I have always had a hard time understanding the topic so hopefully I can try studying even harder than I did in the previous semester. Luckily for me, it would seem as if my group mates for this class/lab are very friendly and very knowledgeable in terms of physics so I can rely on them for questions throughout the lab work. This class can help me achieve my goal of gaining a better understanding of the topic by… I honestly do not have any clue. I could definitely try paying more attention in class and taking more notes, as well as studying more."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2898,"My goals are becoming a civil engineer and successfully creating my first, sturdy bridge that can withstand air resistance and cars. The only way these goals can be possible is by using an education provided by a university. This class is in my required courses so it must relate to my future careers and goals. Since we are discussing the gravitational force and how it relates to electrical, I can see how it can relate to bridges. By multiplying the mass with gravity we can see the weight that will be placed in the bridge. Only by calculating the normal force of the support systems on the bridge can we determine a safe and strong bridge. This lab class also discusses electricity which is also a necessity on bridges. You can't see without light and that's where the lights on the bridge come into play. Determining the electric particles going through the circuit can we light up a long bridge."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2891,"As I said in my last reflection, I found that coding was something I liked and that is why I am pursuing my degree. And part of that involves general education, but at the same time, I realize this physics class and lab are what I got myself into for going into STEM. So far I am liking this side of physics more than I did with PHYS 220. I suppose I appreciate the lab? We have only had one so far at this point (bc power loss) but as we did that first worksheet in person, we were practicing things that we learned in class. We were able to verify our knowledge of the material with each other and got the lab done quickly. This is a lot better than my previous online class where the labs were pretty much extra homework problems. So I think this class will help me better understand what I am learning and help me pass the course."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,1887,"My goal at least for this year is to feel like I actually retained information from my classes. Ever since the pandemic started and we started online learning I felt as though I did not retain as much information from my classes as I used to. My goal is to feel like I actually learned something. This class I believe will help me achieve this particular goal because it kind of is like having my physics lecture again but this time with a very in depth example. Another one of my goals is to miss as little class as possible, while some certain health issues have already kind of messed up this goal my goal is to miss no more classes than I already have. These are both short term goals that this class can help me achieve as for the long run my goal is to graduate with a computer science degree, and this class will help me get there because it is a degree requirement."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2890,"My goals in life are to graduate college with a computer science major and make my dream video game project. After completing these goals, I can die happy and make my parents proud. I also have side goals such as meeting new people/friends, staying happy, and building an art piece out of milk jugs. As for how this class can help me achieve these goals, I would argue that this class would help me graduate college since Physics 2 is one of my requirements in the STEM field. In addition, this class can also help me achieve one of my side goals, which is to meet new people/friends and stay happy. It's safe to say that my time spent within the class has been delightful since everybody in that classroom is funny/entertaining and nice to each other. As for my goal to create my dream video game project, hopefully, I will achieve this goal later in life. The same goes for the art piece out of milk jugs. I like to take my time when achieving goals."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2888,"Broadly speaking, I would say that my primary short term goal (ignoring all kinds of specific little things like improving certain hobbies or getting in better shape) is to finish school which is really just a vehicle for my long term goal of gaining some stability and agency in life. I've been a member of the work force for about 15 years at this point and somehow still feel like I haven't quite gotten ahead. Much of my schedule and my lifestyle is dictated by my employment situation. Can I go visit friends this weekend, or do I have to work? Can I afford to buy that tool or game or nice meal that I want? This puts me into a very reactive situation which I hope to overcome by gaining a professional foothold as a software developer. I chose this for a few reasons: First, it pays well (which is undeniably appealing). It can also be done over the internet, which gives a huge amount of flexibility in terms of schedule and where I live. It is also safe and low impact which means I don't have to worry about aging joints or an unexpected injury knocking me out of the workforce. Finally, software touches nearly every industry in our society which means I can explore anything from physics, to the medical field, to video games, and limitless other fascinating topics.This class helps me achieve these goals immediately by satisfying a graduation requirement. On a larger scale, it also teaches topics that are directly related to my interests, which are computers and electronics. I would like my career trajectory to be more focused on low-level hardware focused problems (versus something ""high level"" and abstracted from the machine, like web development) for which an understanding of math, physics, and electricity is essential. Outside of professional goals, it's also just fun to know these things. I love to build things, including tinkering with electronics, and this is one more piece of the puzzle."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2885,my overall goal is to be able to make machines and technology using my own hands and this class does help to achieve that goal. this class is one of the few instances I will have in my college career to get real hands-on experience with physics. or at least this class makes the concepts being taught in my physics lecture way easier to understand. not only that but the lab reports are way easier to follow than the homework for my lecture with my homework for my lecture I always find myself feeling disconnected from the topic because the questions feel to specific to be used on a wide range of topic. while the lab reports that we fill out in class feel more connectable to all the different topics that that apply to. overall this class really does help me come closer to achieving my goal the only thing i wish we had more of is more technical work like work with tools
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2897,"So far this class has been going great. Even though this week which as professor claims was going to be our most interesting week by far because we were finally going to be able to do a hands on lab in person which would have been my first ever hands on lab in college ever. After seeing professor demonstrate the lab through video he was 100% right, that lab would have been amazing if everyone would have gotten to do it but there was nothing we can do about it as the power was off all day at school. This class is definitely helping me reach my goals by helping me see more visually about physics for example how certain conductors work and the math behind it. I feel that me getting better and always attending this class really helps me with my lecture which is online so it’s not the best learning experience."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2889,"My goal is to have a better understanding of computer science and the logic and physics behind why we write code the way we do. How physics helps with reaching that goal is if I code an object that requires a certain parameter that has a physics estimate to them. I would then need to be able to accurately do both the math and physics equation in order for my object to work the way it is intended. With a better understanding all around of what I am doing and what I need to do, I can hold a better appreciation of how this applies both to my major and the world around me. It helps me better understand the concepts and how to do the math in areas I still don't fully understand in computer science. Right now I don't fully know how to do all the math as I'm pretty bad at it however this class will help give the chance I need to better understand the concepts and ideas behind them."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2902,"My goals are to learn how to code and maybe build my own pc in the future. This class can help me by helping me calculate the current going through the circuits in the motherboard or in other parts of the computer. By using the material we learned in class we are able to use to calculate circuit, power, resistance, etc. This can be useful to check if certain parts are shorted and need to be replaced or if that part is getting enough current to work properly. By using the concepts we have learned in class I am able to repair and replace certain parts of a computer if needed, it can also be used when repairing other electronics but may have a different process. I'm unsure how this class can help me with coding unless I use the concepts to code a calculator for those concepts. This is how this class will help me achieve my goals."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2887,"My goals are very vague. I think I would be happy if I can live a comfortable and relatively stress free lifestyle. My job doesnt have to be something that im very passionate about. As long as it supports me and I have enough money and time to explore things I enjoy outside of work. This class helps me get my degree, which is in computer science. With this degree I can get a job that fits this criteria."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2886,"One of my goals this semester is to pass my Physics class on the first go. I don’t want to have to retake it next semester, it will put me behind with major requirements. This lab will help support me in passing that class as it offers supporting material and real life applications that will better my overall understanding of the course. Another one of my goals this semester is to sleep more. Having scheduled this class at 12:30PM makes it easier to get adequate rest before class. Last semester I had class at 9:30AM and my sleep suffered. I also feel that I didn’t learn as much from that class as I was half asleep and just their for attendance/participation. I hate to admit that, but now I’m doing better. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2894,"A short term goal of mine is to finish the semester with all A's especially my linear algebra class as its supposed to be my final math class for the rest of my life. I will never willingly take another math class so long as I am concious and coherient. A longer term goal of mine would be to finish my college education and earn my mechanical engineering degree, hopefully finding my way into the work force shortly after that. Physics is in my top 3 favorite subjects that Ive taken so far and it really does not take much for me to be interested and want to be involved in a lab or experiment. Thankfully physics is a large part of my major and classes that im genuinley interested in, I tend to do better in. But physics seems intuative and at times can be less challenging than my other classes, this is perfect for me as having a class that I feel comfertable allows me to spend some extra time in areas of other subjects I may not feel as confident with."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2900,"Currently my goals are to get an amazing grade for ALL my classes this semester so I can move forward to getting my degree. This class will only help me move forward towards that goal if I put more and more time and effort into the class. Personally there was a lot of times where I really wasn't in the mood to go to class or even to work on assignments I know I should be working on, however if i push past that and focus on my goals, I should be able to accomplish anything I set my mind to."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2896,I'm trying to get get finished with my computer science degree and of course this class is a part of that requirement so in that sense this class helps but for real this class does help me understand the main psychics class topics a bit better given that I'm taking the more hands on approach over the look at equations and sit through a lesson plus it helps have something to do on wednesdays over that big 3hour gap till the last class starts. I think honestly speaking the physics class lab between the two I'm taking is a bit more enjoyable just by the fact that we are getting to do lab things (even if the power was off for this lab but whatever...) which will help for when we got to do that final for the psychis class which requires us to find a topic that relates to psychis in the real world and experiment collecting results and data then write them up so the more physical labs the better.
