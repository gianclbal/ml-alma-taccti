2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2890,"I would say that the biggest takeaway I received from this class would be the in-person experience and the fun I had while completing the labs. It's been two years since I did an in-person lab, which was cut short due to Covid-19. I recall I was taking a biology lab, and before covid struck, we were doing a lab revolving around bacteria. Sadly we never had the chance to see the results, and the future labs were not collaborative or interactive. It is safe to say the current labs are quadruple more fun/interesting than any zoom/online lab. In addition, the class’s energy, energy, and humor make the labs more enjoyable. As for my favorite lab, I would say the magnetic field of a coil was the funniest lab so far. Hopefully, in the future, there won’t be another epidemic that causes global change/deaths throughout my lifetime. I can not handle another life changing epidemic."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2900,My greatest take away from this class is the understanding how electricity works in many of the tools and devices I use every single day. It really is crazy to think of the different ways that our society really revolves around electricity and the laws and rules that are put in place so that electricity can be used for ourselves. I think learning about all this in class really puts in perspective that what we learn in lab is constantly being applied to everything. Personally I would love to work with furthering these devices and find new innovation when it comes to the use of energy and reduce our reliance to electricity. I hope that in the pursuit of these goals everything I learned from lab and in class would come in handy.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2891,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that teamwork makes the dream work. I know at the very least that we are placed into groups due to spacing and lab equipment. However, lab work does benefit greatly from the collaboration of multiple people. I enjoy the labs for the practical experience they provide for the material learned in class. Through these labs I have seen firsthand how certain mechanics work and have learned to use some of the lab equipment. But at the same time, not all of the labs were easy to understand. By going through the lab manuals together with my group, we obtain a better understanding of the procedures involved and bounce off our knowledge with each other. This experience of doing the lab together allows us to complete the labs in a timely manner and ensures that what we are learning is accurate."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2898,"My greatest take away from this class is that it takes team work to complete goals. That sometimes you can’t complete tasks without the help from those around you. In this lab we have many assignments where one person can be the writer, the other calculating and the other testing the experiment. We can be given roles and by playing each role to the best of our ability we can finish our work on time. These lab assignments can be related to our future careers where we aren’t working by ourselves in a project and that we need to work together to complete the project on it’s due date. I also took away from the lab that we have to make sure we pay attention to every detail. By forgetting on part in the lab can allow us to get the wrong data leading us to getting the wrong answers. However with more people on the project the less chance of getting the wrong answer since there will be a lot of people focusing on everything."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2889,"I would say my greatest takeaway from this class would either be that collaboration is important, and also the small details make a difference. As, without paying attention to the small details, you can end up with a vastly different answer than the correct one is. This also coincides with why this class helps teach cooperation is key. When you make mistakes, small or large, having a group of people helping you through will help you correct or notice your own errors. This allows for a better learning environment as most of the time big mistakes won't fall through the cracks. That is what I feel this class taught me most as even with today's lab I know I'm going to make mistakes and so are my lab mates, however with good communication we should be able to get through it with little to no big problems."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2901,"My greatest take away from this class is that I should not even think about taking an asynchronous class for my science classes from now on. This is because in every lab for this class, I was always lost and could not contribute besides giving snacks or doing things not related to the work at hand. I also need to start studying harder regarding the topics that I have trouble understanding. I tend to not study in general because no one really likes to study and I have a hard time with self discipline so that the moment I do not like something, I just drop it and turn on my pc games. By taking synchronous classes, I will feel more pressured to take my learning more seriously and will be not as laxed(?) when it comes to studying for my topics. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2896,"I'd say is figuring out how to use new equipment quickly a truly useful skill for these spontaneous labs which is quite a realistic event that happens in our everyday lives though not frequently is going to happen to us all whether it be learning a new device or getting use to new tools. I'd also say learning effective teamwork in order to get the work done in an effective matter was one of those great take aways granted future careers will require that from you. I guess a final take away from this class would be all the new experiences that I had while taking this class its something I wouldn't really forget but it was quite interesting getting to apply some of the concepts we learned in the main class into these labs (from my past experience I never really get to use these devices the most a lab has provided is vinegar, a paper magnifying glass, and a scalpel)."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2897,"I would say my biggest take away from this class is being able to do hands-on labs mostly, I have never done a laboratory on this level before and this class has definitely helped me learn a lot of things about physics. I don't think physics is a great class. You can really understand the laws behind it without physically acting with it in real life. Even the first lab we did was online but we actually did hands-on work. When we had the tape and taped one side to the table and the other piece of tape to the back of the table tape to negatively charge and positively charge the tapes and we got to physically see them attract to each other. That made me never forget that charges of opposite signs attract and charges of the same sign repel. Also I think my favorite lab so far was the Aluminum foil fuse because I like fire."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,170,"What was my greatest take away from this class well I’d be that there are a lot of things even if I study engineering and no matter how much I think I’ll get a grasp on physics I will still always have only ever scratched the surface of what physics is and the. I did enjoy it. I wouldn't go any deeper than I already have though because it seems to be a lot more than I can handle. I'm comfortable with my mechanical engineering level of physics. The more I think of it, here's a few other things I got from the class not specifically tailored to physics. One professor casually drinks a gallon of milk a day (at least in my mind he does). Don’t explode aluminum foil on a wooden table; it will leave a mark. That’s the main take away from this class for me overall I’d say one of my more Fun labs. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2887,My most important take away from this class is the importance of teamwork. Being able to effectively work with other people in a group is a very useful skill to have. When you dont work well with your team things will be much harder for you. In this class I was able to work well with my group and found that even challenging assignments can be much easier when collaborating with others.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2894,"My greatest takeaway from this lab class would be the knowledge learned today using the oscilloscope. I have used multimeters and different power sources throughout my short engineering education but the oscilloscope has been my most wanted to “mess with” piece of equipment since I first saw it in high school. Then, the lab involving this tech was just a demonstration as my high school physics equipment had broken down over the years so this would be my first chance to examine electrical current visually. More than anything I wanted to press all of the buttons, turn all the knobs, and make a pulsing line draw something on the screen. Today I accomplished all of those. I'm familiar with sine, square and saw waves so all I had to do was apply that knowledge to what I also knew about electrical current and following the lab was extremely simple. I was able to measure and display lines of different sizes and voltage values on the oscilloscopes display and I hope to use it again in a future class."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2893,"Honestly I feel like the gap between the lab and lecture class is quite wide. By this I mean that the content differs a little in terms of application. Having the physical lab it kind of hurts my brain from the things I considered in lecture. It is almost as though the things that are covered are not as in-depth or gives me understanding about the actual physical physics. I do believe the application is a but much and is not too accurate but it makes sense. Its sort of misleading in a sense that most if bit all numbers in lecture will always be accurate since they are the given values. A couple things still confuse me though, like the machines for example in lab. A lot if them test and or read charges or variable numbers. It kind of freaks me out and I wish there was a way to know and there were steps in that lab itself to follow that are easier to follow. Sometime it feels as though the person who wrote them have a really  bad sense of the english language. Anyways its always fun to be in this class but I do wish there were easier and shorter labs."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,1887,"My greatest take away from this class is that physics is not always boring. I very much enjoyed doing the labs that involved the simulations, they were entertaining to me and it was the first time that I actually understood what I was doing in a physics class. The times I did attend class I also enjoyed how the professor had an upbeat attitude and did not make physics out to be so serious. I genuinely enjoyed going to this class and realized that maybe physics was just boring before because I had a hard time understanding and maybe also because my professors made it so serious. Another take away from this class is that while I knew physics was everywhere in the ""real world"" it is found in places where I had never though before. For some reason I did not think oof electric fields as physics. I do not really know what I classified them as but I realized that this made physics even more widely used and now I think that everyone should take at least one physics class in their life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2892,My greatest takeaway from this class is a better understand of how electricity and magnetism works and how it effects the world all around us. I’m a computer science major so learning how these work helps explain to me how computers actually run and how I can take advantage of all the amazing devices we have that run off electricity. I’ve always been curious on how things like mother boards work and now that I know much more of the basics of how electricity works I feel like I have the foundation to u seat and how these more complicated electronic devices work. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2888,"My greatest take away from this class has been a more intuitive understanding of how electricity and magnetism are used for practical purposes. I found it especially interesting to study magnetic fields and Faraday's law because it helped me to understand the difference ways we can use induction to perform some specific function. I was previously aware of induction as a concept but never understood how it happened or behaved. I learned that inductors want to oppose changes which is useful for creating circuits like a power supply. During the lab we were using a function generator to change the field in a loop, and we used a pickup coil to measure the resulting field. The pickup coil was on the end of a long arm, and every time someone bumped the table we would see a change on the oscilloscope while the pickup arm vibrated momentarily. I had a realization that maybe this is how accelerometers work to detect motion? If there are two fields positioned close to each other, and one of them is allowed to move relative to the other, it could produce a measurable EMF that would indicate motion in a certain direction. Maybe its done in some other way, but it was cool to have a bit of an epiphany where my understanding became more complete and I was able to start seeing useful applications instead of just formulas."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2884,During this Lab/class the greatest take away is how to work with others. Over the span of the last 15-17 weeks we have had some interesting work listed to do and having to coordinate with other engineering majors has been the most inspiring and fun part. In engineering major in general so far we as a student body don't have to communicate well and some engineering students don't have the best communication skill to communicate. Nevertheless being in groups every week has helped not only me but other students come out of there buble and learn how to conversate. Also my professor has played a big part in that by making a positive relaxed learning environment. If it wasn't for this lab idk if id still be interested in this part of physics .
