Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2884,"Hello class or to whomever is reading this, my name is philip montgomery , I chose the stem field because of the science part. Specifically mechanics, this is why I am pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering. Mechanical engineering interests me because it allows me to put my creative mind to work in many different aspects that would change the world . My main goal is to change the world for the better. There are many paths to help the world but for me I believe that this is the right one out of all. To be specific  I would like to create mechanical limbs to help people who don't have lims anymore due to underlying disease or to help people who got into accidents or even veterans who have got hurt overseas. But going through all of these classes I am currently understanding this would be harder than ammigained and doing what I'm doing now has made it a little discouraging but I am determined to finish ."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2885,I became a stem major for a variety of reasons. the main reason is I've always been interested in learning how things work down to the base level. this is especially true for computers. when I was a child I would always disassemble old computers my dad would give me. While I would mainly just destroy them I was still interested in how it worked. so I went into computer science to learn how the brain of a computer works and to hopefully one day create my own machines for random tasks.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2886,"I am going into a STEM field (Computer Science) to obtain financial stability. I know most people would never claim that straight up, but the reality of things is that software engineers have job security and make good money, so it's where I need to be. Growing up, we never really had more than we needed if we even met our needs for the month. Money was always a strain, and while I can agree it doesn't buy happiness, it buys convenience and stability. When I was younger, I used to be the go to person to jailbreaks and iCloud resets. I was always into tech, so it made sense for me to venture into the programming world. Now that I'm studying comp sci I am super satisfied with my decision. While it can be very difficult and time consuming at times, I feel like there's a certain gratification you get that you can't get with other majors.(5 minute timer went off)"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2887,"I want to go into the stem field because I believe it provides many good opportunities for me. Stem careers on average also pay more and usually have better job security than other fields. I am also personally interested in stem, particularly computer science. I think I am good at programming and I feel like I will be successful if I go into this field. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2888,"I want to go into the STEM field because I have always been interested in understanding how things work. Formal study of science and math has so far helped to give me the tools I need to better understand the world around me. I also like to tinker and take things apart modify them and build new things to satisfy this curiosity. My desired goal for studying Computer Science in particular is to unlock the skills I need as a software developer which will let me tinker and build things in a virtual world instead of using physical objects. I think of programming like LEGO where you can build anything you want, but there is no limitation on running out of materials or not having enough space or waiting for parts to come in the mail which means you can dive straight into almost any project right away which I find very liberating. As an added bonus there is a good chance that I can land a lucrative career where I don't have to worry as much about age or injury hindering my ability to work, and all the while I can do work that I enjoy."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2889,"I want to go into the stem field primarily because of how it's interested me ever since I was a kid. Like how do computers work? How do games work? All of those types of things. I am highly interested in all of that. The other reason why I plan to do Stem is that it has a lot of great opportunities within the bay area. For example, my dad is a police officer but knows a lot of different people because of it that work for big companies like google and apple. So I have a better chance to get a good career right from the start once I take advantage of those opportunities. So all in all the STEM field had the best and most available opportunities for my life to take, but also because in general it highly interested me. I'm excited to do more with this class to help me get more out of my plans!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2890,"The only reason why I entered the STEM field is because I want to major in computer science. The reason why I want to major in computer science is because I want to make video games. I believe it is important to note that video games have been a major part of my life since I started playing video games at the age of five, and I never could let go of the hobby. In addition, I somewhat see video games as a third parent figure since video games have taught many life lessons. For these reasons, I see video games as a way to bring people together and an interactive/expressive art piece. So far in my coding experience, I made some simple text adventures and learned a ton of math. For the future, I am unsure if I would be an indie developer or join an established gaming company since I lack programmer work experience. This semester I hope to learn more C++ language and improve my coding skills by doing more strange text adventures. But whatever video game I put out there in the world, I hope someone will enjoy my video game and potentially learn from it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,1887,"I want to go into the STEM field because I have never seen myself as being in anything else. I’m not bad at writing or art or anything like that, but it has never really been that interesting to me and i find it to not be challenging enough for me. I have always found science interesting (biology in particular), and i have always loved math, so i always knew i would be in STEM but i never knew what exactly i would be doing specifically. I had an interest in coding after i was introduced to it at a young age, and later on i took a couple computer science classes in high school and that’s when I decided that i would be a computer science major, I also found out that many people in this field get paid handsomely and just like everyone else, i like money :) "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2891,"Growing up, I found that in school I tended to like the STEM subjects like math and science more than I did other classes such as writing or history. I was also around computers quite a bit for school or some games and that developed into a proficiency that earned me the place as the ""tech person"" for my family. So when my high school offered Java classes and a robotics class, I had to try them out. And through those classes, I discovered that coding was something that I enjoyed doing and so I decided to build a career around it. The building up of not-so-physical parts and the type of problem-solving coding requires are the aspects that drew me into computer science and it is the reason that I am at SFSU today. Also, as time progresses, technology gets more integrated into our lives and being at the forefront of that seems very appealing to me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2892,"I want to go into the stem field because I find science very interesting. I want to discover new things and be able to communicate my results clearly to people. I  like staying up to date on new tech and being able to use it. I find computer science very interesting as well because i like to code. It is fun piecing it all together, every thing i like a puzzle you have to solve so i have a good time with it. I find stem just to be more interesting then the other options for degrees because it is more challenging and interesting to me. There is always something new to learn and discover. There a whole world of information out there to analyze and figure out and that inspires me to keep learning every day. Over all it is just the best option for a degree, plus it is where the money is at."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2893,"The biggest reason that I am going into the STEM field in terms of major, is because with my degree in science, I want to go into medicine. I believe that having a physiology major, with its required classes for the diploma, it will help me study and learn topics that will help me on my endeavor towards medschool and most importantly understanding the topics on the MCAT. Recently, I have been wondering about the case of what I want to do in the future and it's been hard to find more than a couple reasons to go into this field. Ever Since, I was a kid I've always wanted to help and understand people and becoming hospital personnel always spoke out to me. Being able to shadow/intern at hospitals in the past really opened my mind to the many possible futures and lead me to daydream about me reaching the job title of Medical Doctor who would go on rounds in the ICU helping those who need care and families who need solace for problems that they themselves do not know what to do. I think another thing about being a Doctor that stands out to me is the stories that can be told about the work that they've done and how much mental fatigue or stress that occurs within the ward."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2894,"It all ties back to the 2001 feature film, Fast and the Furious. Seeing Paul Walker race in his r34 and then later in the movie drive up to his friend's own mechanic shop with outdoor car lifts and shinny performance parts was what initially got me hooked on cars and the idea of designing and building my own performance parts. Ever since I was young and could hold a screwdriver, I've been taking things apart and putting them back together after adding my own ""upgrades"", and the final frontier of this hobby that's now much more than a hobby is cars. Two things really drive me to continue down the stem path, one is the need for speed that has undoubtedly taken over my driving habits and the majority of my free time, and in the most childish way possible stickers. When you see a track car, not a full race car and no longer a streetcar, they are covered in stickers. These stickers are from all of the manufacturers that made it into that car and fundamentally make the car fast. It is a badge of honor to have a high-performance brand sponsor your car to send you parts and I want my name (or company name) to be in that same group of fully pedigreed performance engineers."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2895,"I want to go into the STEM field and specifically computer science because I've always been engrossed into coding from a young age so it's been something that I find myself doing well in and also something that I can imagine myself doing for a long time. As for more general terms for STEM fields, I like to think about my life in often times more scientific and objective ways so it's something that also fits up my alley for how I think about things. Like for example giving reasoning to how we as humans make decisions and how we think about things is something that I like to think about a lot."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2896,I'm going into the STEM field because I wanted to really get into the programing side of things and maybe even get a chance at joining some of the bigger names that are looking for coders and through the STEM field I can get a more organized path to learning coding. I also kind of wanted to gain some better reputations when applying by getting a degree so hopefully when it comes to applying for some of the bigger places whether it be google Microsoft or even a gaming company I'll have some credentials that they would like to see (besides the degree). I guess lastly I joined so I can possibly meet new people who'll be under taking the same field as me so it doesn't become as isolated as it seems even if I'm a bit of an introvert and usually need that extra push to really get to meeting and interacting with others but I have been getting much better at it.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2897,"The real reason I chose to go into the STEM field is really because of the M, I really love math and it has been my favorite subject since Elementary. Knowing that something is either right or wrong gives you a reason to want to learn more in my eyes. But later on in life I learned that Computer Science involved a lot of math and I knew it was a growing field of study and I wanted to be a part of that. Also I was in the tech academy at my high school so I got to have different Computer classes like Digital Media Arts using photoshop and such to edit pictures then later went to Internet Engineering learning how the components to computers then later learned how to put them together. I find coding and problem solving very interesting and similar to the mathematics I have been learning all my life so yea thats why i joined this field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,170,"Hello my name is Jeremy Herrera and I chose to go into mechanical engineering this was a choice I made back in my senior year of high school no real reason honestly I just liked the way I thought it would go and it has gone pretty well all things considered my dad was a welder and that's the real thing that made me want to go into some form of making things and it was the like the level up of a welder and that's really it. I have truly enjoyed working to get this degree and wish to continue maybe as a part-timer in school because the work and school life is extremely time-consuming and doesn't leave time for much else but in the end, I will still get the degree so that's all that matters. I'm glad to continue this class and many others for a degree u randomly chose on a Tuesday and have not been interested in anything else since then."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2898,"I want to go into the STEM field because I believe I can help better my community by designing and building structures. From building a new city government to creating a bridge that can connect two cities parted from an ocean, there are many things I want to help create. The only way I can gain experience in building a new bridge or program building that helps the low income is by gaining experience in Engineering. I want to understand pressure and support and enough knowledge in mathematics to determine how much weight can be placed on a structure. The whole point in STEM for me is Engineering and math since these will be the two subjects I will be dealing with in my future career as a Civil Engineer. I have many people who supported me this far and I want to accomplish my dream by pursuing STEM. I want to help others in ways that can only be accomplished through creative thinking and problem-solving."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2899,"Living in the Bay Area, I've always been exposed to various components of the STEM field. Factor that in with my childhood dominated with playing as many games as I can without being yelled at by my parents. I guess you could say I've always had an interest in tech, haha. But legitimately, ever since I was a kid I've always had a genuine curiousity towards technology, specifically computer technology. As I grew up, and understood the endless possibilities that being in the STEM field can bring, it only amplified my interest in Computer Science. I loved the fact that you can start from just a simple idea and you can build out this idea to a fully-fledged application/product, etc. All you needed was to be committed to what you set out to do and you can do whatever you set your mind to. Also, I never enjoyed being a writer and I always found my English classes pretty boring. I immediately that wasn't something I wanted to go into. Overall, this is why I wanted to go into the STEM field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2900,"For me, the reason why I want to go into the STEM Field was not something that I really considered until the pandemic started. There was a time where I really did not know what to do and I instinctively went towards Computer Science because I knew that jobs were pretty abundant and that it was a good decision for financial stability for my future. However, since the pandemic started I really got to thinking what I really wanted for myself. Although now I still don't have a concrete answer to WHY I am in the STEM field I know that one of my personal passions is video games and creativity and if in the future I have the chance to take part in the creation of that type of media, I would be extremely happy whether that be in my current major or something else entirely. Who knows what the future holds for me but I know the STEM field will get me to the places I want to be."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2901,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field? I never really questioned myself when it comes to this. It’s always been something that I’ve been set on since I was in middle school but over the years, I kind of stopped thinking about it and just became used to the idea that I was going into the STEM field. In middle school, I took my first computer science class for only one year. In that class, we used the website, Scratch, to learn how to code and make little projects like games, animations, etc. What stuck out the most to me from that class though, was when we started programming to make miniature robots (finches and mini bb-8s!) to run through mazes that we made around the end of the year. It was so fun that I knew immediately that I wanted a future in Computer Science, even though my mother was set on the idea of me pursuing a career in the medical field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2902,I want to go into a STEM field since I feel like everything in the field will continue to change and advance as time passes. I want to pursue this field and keep with it even though it will continue to advance. I've always loved the topics in STEM though some I do struggle on. I hope to continue in this field and never give up on that passion.
