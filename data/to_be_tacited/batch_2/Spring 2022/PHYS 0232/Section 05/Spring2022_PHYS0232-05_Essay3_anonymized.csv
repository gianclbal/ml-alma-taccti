2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2897,I would say the lecture and labs going over volts in batteries is very relevant. People everyday depend on voltage from many batteries that supply energy to their appliances and most likely do not even know how it works. Knowing this sort of information can help the average person that isn't interested in physics but is interested in maybe how they should configure the way voltage moves through their appliances to get the most efficient use out of it. For example when we were doing our Aluminum foil fuse lab that was the first time I saw heard the fact that you are supposed to line your batteries up in series positive to negative so your voltage will add up.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,1887,"One of the things I learned in class that I think are relevant to everyday life is the idea of electric potential. Electric potential is the amount of work needed to move a charge from one place to another, this idea is also related to electric fields and other electric concepts which is why I believe it to be important. A specific example I can think of that involves electric potential is the idea of how people get shocked when they touch a live wire. This example also has to do with loops but when this was explained to us in class it was an electric potential example. When a person touches a live wire they disrupt the closed loop that the wire and the ground have due to the difference in electric potential. This gives the current a different path to take and since currents are not picky they will go through any path given breaking the loop and electrocuting the person. I feel like this is important information because people should understand why exactly touching a live wire is dangerous that way they know exactly why they are told not to do something that way they are more inclined to listen."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2892,"What is the point of calculating flux?Flux is the amount of electricity passing though a specific area. This is important so we can actually measure how much electricity is flowing through a specific thing and with the formulas we can calculate it for all different types of shapes. We can use this to describe our field strength at any distance from a charge so we always know how much electricity is at any point. This can help can help us determine how much energy is going though a wire or an object as well, not just an open area in space. Knowing how much electricity is going through a wire is important so we can actually use electricity to our advantage instead of just zapping ourselves."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2896,In week 6 we learned about Resistance and of course I'm going to ask about how the materials affect this resistance value (you know a simple question). The material affects the resistance (along withe the geometry of the conductor) you know R = pL/a = (4pL)/(pi*d^2) that gives a number in ohms. knowing the type of material you plan to use as the conductor can really affect this number that's why in the real world there is almost this agreement to use copper wires for most wiring due to their relative p(ohm*m) of 1.68*10^-8 that allows a relative safe amount of current through the wire (of course safe in the sense that it wont randomly set your house on fire or so safe that no current is going through thus making it useless) and its really this balance of safety and efficiency that really makes its presence in the real world thus if you know this info it comes to really help make you self sufficient at wiring your fuse box to some appliances like for instance the washing machine with the right wiring knowledge you wont have to call in the electrician to help wire it for you and you'll pretty much be in control of the amount of current going through (I'm honestly starting to think of speakers given my dad makes them and the wiring in the box is important in generating the right amount of amps I believe he uses copper wires for this).
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2898,"In physics we covered how positive follows negative by using pieces of tape. In this lab we had two strips of tape and placed on on top of the other. Then we stripped the two pieces of tape off of each other. By doing this there was a transfer of electrons being stripped and added on to the other piece of tape. The question is why do the two pieces of tape become magnetic and why do the repel when met with the same charge? To answer this by using the experiment, the two pieces of tape being stripped from each other exchange electrons. Where one loses electrons and becomes positive and the other one gains electrons and becomes negative. This will force the positive to being attracted to the negative because they want to become neutral in charge. Pieces of tape that don’t have a neutral charge will also follow neutral objects because they want to become neutral in charge. However when one loses electrons and they meet another object that lost electrons they will repel because they both are missing electrons to become neutral. This also applies to objects that gained electrons where they will repel because they both have a over capacity of electrons."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2901,"One concept that was covered in the physics lab class was regarding electric fields when we did a lab on it on Wednesday. My question for this reflection was on how do we know which part of a battery is negative or positive if the symbol indicating it is positive or negative was gone? Looking through the labs that we did during physics lab class, I would think that one way we could try to figure out the positive and negative sides of a battery would be to kind of repeat lab Electrostatic Field Deflection. In that lab, we made power using two or more batteries and foil wires. We can repeat this experiment in order to find the positive and negatives sides of the battery and this works because if we put the two batteries together by the negative or positive sides together, then we would not really generate much electricity. However, if we were to put the negative and positive sides of the two batteries together, we would generate a lot more in terms of electricity. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2887,"We covered resistors and their role in circuits. My question is: how do resistors effect a circuit? Resistors are used to increase or decrease the current in a system. Current is amperege which can be generally known as the amount of energy flowing in the system. So for example, more current means you can power more things. Resistors decrease or increase current depending on how the are placed in a circuit. There are two important ways a circuit can be placed: in parallel or in series. When placed in parallel, current increase. When places in series, the current decreases. This means we have to be considerate of how we place resistors in a system depending on the goal we have. For example, if we want more energy to power bright bulbs, then placing the bulbs in parallel would be a good idea."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2888,"My question is: How does resistance affect our ability to distribute electrical energy across our power grid and our homes? Since we know that resistance is a function of a material's resistivity, as well as the object's length and cross sectional area, this could mean that we need to be careful about the material we make our conductors from as well as their overall size. When transmitting power over any distance we usually choose a material with a very low resistivity such as copper or gold. When the current in the circuit is high enough, we must also be careful about the size of the conductor so we don't generate too much heat due to resistance. We can lower the resistance by increasing the cross sectional area, or reducing the length. In the case of the wiring in your home, there is usually a fixed distance between the power source and the appliance being powered. This means that we are limited in how long the wires can be before we run out of space. When drawing large current from something like a toaster we must be careful to have wires with a large enough cross-sectional area so it can support the current without overheating. Power distributed across the grid must travel very long distances. As such, the wires must be very large to carry this power to its destination and make sure enough current is available at the other end. By Ohm's law, we know that Voltage = Current * Resistance, or Current = Voltage / Resistance. So, by increasing the voltage we can also increase the current available in the lines. If the resistivity of the wires were too high, the current would be limited or the wires would risk overheating and failing."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2899,"The topic that's stuck with me the most is Voltage. This is a key concept that is used in all things electricity. When you plug into an outlet, there is voltage going through the cord to power your device. In today's society where more & more devices are going online, this is used in every single one of these. Even our cars nowadays are electric. In a society where we're reaching towards achieving a more sustainable future, EV (electric vehicle) cars are going to help us get there. This is why it's important for society to understand this concept. Without it, we quite literally wouldn't be anywhere near as advanced as a society today."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2900,"In the last few weeks learning about current and Ohm’s Law gave me such a better understanding about electricity and the relationship between conductors and different points. I always knew how electricity sorta works, in the way that wires are used to transfer an electric current from one point to another but I never really understood the concept of resistance and the voltage. The way that we directly compared Ohm’s law and electricity to water flow really helped me a lot when it comes to fully understanding and getting what Ohm’s law is all about. This information is literally found everywhere and is the basis to all the electronics used in the house. The most immediate example I can think of is lightbulbs in the house, with electricity and currents flowing all throughout the house in the walls. With the flip of a switch, the current flows through the wiring of the house to turn on light fixtures that are around my house. While that is the most immediate example I can think of, there are countless examples of current that I can think of that aren’t even in my own house. Personally, being a Computer Science major, I am sure that this information will help me in the long run fully understand the capabilities of hardware that is required for the job. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2895,Somethings I’ve learned these past weeks that could benefit society would be understanding how electric charges and currents work to create and fuel the technology that is constantly growing around us. Everywhere and every day we use technology that wouldn’t have been possible without the fundamental understanding of electrons and electric fields. From the lightbulbs that allow work beyond the day to phones that have access to the internet and more. They all use circuits to functions and improve society to higher levels of efficiency.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2885,"for this reflection I will be talking about how voltage works and how it is applicable to people's everyday lives. voltage is used to maintain current and can also be seen as the potential difference between to ends of a wire. due to this difference energy will travel along the path of the wire to the end with the lowest potential difference. this allows energy to be transported and then used by different devices. this concept is used in almost every technological device we have and use in our everyday lives. when we want to turn something on we need to give it energy in order for it to work. by supplying voltage to a wire we allow the current in the wire to transfer energy to the device allowing it to be used. also knowing how electricity is used in your home can be very beneficial to your electricity bill each month. if you know how to efficiently use the outlets in your home you can optimize the voltage that is being passed into your devices. for example, if you have two outlets and something I plugged into each of them then the outlets are being used in parallel but if you were to try to plug in two devices in the same outlet this would be using the outlet in a series and this would result in less voltage being supplied to each device."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2891,"We have learned about how charges interact with each other, part of which is the electric field they produce. Then there is voltage which is the work required to move charge within that electric field. This learning has brought us to batteries which is an object that holds a potential difference, one end being positive, the other negative. Given that current is the movement of electrons in order to balance out the potential difference in a circuit, my question is why do batteries in series not drain each other? If we connect the negative of one battery and the positive of another, why do the electrons not balance out between them? Would it not leave behind half charged batteries? This would be useful to know as it would explain why we get a sum of their voltages when connected in series."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2884,"Recently in class we had a lab titled electric potential simulation . In this lab we learned about electric volts and their potential and used a simulator in which we could see what would happen if you put multiple or one or more volts in the sma e are just inches or feet appar what would happen. Also how to determine the strength and direction of voltage. This might be applicable to someone's life if they're trying to find how much energy a battery cell or light bulb might have. Others who might use this would be electricians or construction workers . My question , whats the benefit of calculating the e-field? "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2893,"I think that the topic of Ohm's law helped me understand a lot about how energy works in a system when connected with wires and or nodes. It's something that I think will stick with me in the long run and really benefits society with how much power we use on a daily basis. Things like our phones, to the light systems that we have in and around the buildings we use, and they are so important to learning as well. Like the time in class where we literally couldn't do the lab because we need electricity to learn as well as complete the assignment. This all has to do with the wiring of electricity in San Francisco, and if we were to look at it on a broader scale, affects everyone in and outside of the city. The fact that we are able to go in depth and learn about the resistance of certain materials or resistors, to the application of things in series or in parallel  within a circuit greatly affects how much and the way voltage is used. Overall, there is a lot that physics has taught me and how I was able to connect it to the things I witness in my everyday life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2890,"My question will revolve around what we learned in week 3 of Physics with Calculus II Laboratory, electric fields. Before I can build a question, I need to include some information. There exist two parallel conducting plates separated by a distance d. Let, L=1.5 m, and d=2.0 mm. We place a charge of +4.5 μC on one plate and a charge of −4.5μC on the other plate. Now I create a question, what is the magnitude of the electric field between the plates? Using Gauss' law, we know that electric fields become E= sigma/epsilon naught, and epsilon naught = 8.854×10^−12 C^2 / NM^ 2. However, the magnitude of charge density was not provided, thus we need to use the provided information above to find our magnitude of charge density. To find the magnitude density, we can set sigma = q/A^2, where our q= +4.5 μC, which becomes 5.4 *10^-6, and A =1.5. Plugging in our values for the sigma equation will result in sigma = 2 *10^-6 C/ m^2. Now that we have the charge density, we can find the magnitude of the electric field between the plates. Plugging in our values to the electric field equation will result in, (2 *10^-6 C/ m^2) / (8.854×10^−12 C^2 / NM^ 2) = E=225886.605N/C. As for how this question may apply to people’s lives and/or how this information might be used to benefit society, well now people can use the provided equation to find the magnitude of the charge density on the inside surface of each plate and the magnitude of the electric field between the plates."
