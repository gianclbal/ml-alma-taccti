2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2896,To be honest I feel like I'm taking much more notes now compared to when it was online which means I'm paying much more attention to classes in person. I do miss having a longer period to sleep in and I especially miss not having to come back at 6 because it cuts off a lot of studying / preparation time unless I'm wishing to have no sleep (at least on Sundays and Tuesdays) so this means that transitioning to in person classes have made me much more proactive in class at the expense of being in an insomniac state where I'm just tired and have the option of focusing on only a single classes hw depending on how long it is (I could get another done but it depends on how much the hw due the next day is). The concern I'm having is that I feel like I just don't have time for things due to being in class from 10:00 to 4:45 but due to the Bart+bus I have to get up at 7 and arrive home by 6 a giant chunk of those two days taken up. as oppose to the ones the following days that are online where it starts at 11 and ends by 1:50 simple 3 hours leaving the rest of the day open to complete hw or what ever else. of course safety while riding Bart is a concern but I have been riding the Bart to campus for nearly 4 years so at this point I'm used to riding it.  
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2892,Transitioning to in person classes has been a big adjustment. On one hand it is a lot easier to pay attention in class do to less distractions but on the other hand I find my self much more exhausted in class now that I have to commute again. I am not keeping up with self care nearly as much as I should and find myself always stressed out and exhausted. I am concerned I am starting to burn out during this semester and have started preforming much worse in all my classes. It is definitely an adjustment that just is going to take time. I think I just really need to buckle down and get into the library grind till the semester ends to hopefully keep my grades high and pass all my classes.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2895,After transitioning to in-person classes it felt more tiresome to physically go back to classes as getting used to online classes was and saving time transporting to class was something I had to readjust to. Though going back to classes was tiresome it also felt more refreshing to be able to interact with people face to face unlike when its through screens and interacting is something that feels forced. For my self care I try to keep clean if I’ve interacted with lots of people like showering after school. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2893,"I think that coming to in person classes have helped immensely, especially to me. Being online and having lab I feel that most of the lecture and assignments have been following the lab instructor or inline videos which is easy to witness but understanding was definitely a fallout. I found that it was hard to know what we were talking about but even so I was able to pass physics 220 as a miracle. Otherwise, I think that it also is scary to be in person. Although I love being with new people and eventually growing or having friendships with new and old, Covid still exists and though it has halted sort of since the last time we had an outbreak, I think eventually it might start getting bad again. Honestly though, I’m very happy to be able to see people again though. By being in person though life has been hard to come back to San Francisco and truly be on my own."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2894,"The transition back to in person classes has been somewhat difficult so far. Things are similar yet very different for me at least on campus. I was originally on campus going to in person classes as a freshman and i'm now a second semester third year student. I did not have my car on campus freshman year and now living off campus, finding free parking everyday is a struggle. I would have had several opportunities to meet with advisors on campus about internship opportunities and attend meetings in person but I'm now feeling pretty left on my own when it comes to where and who to talk to regarding such opportunities. Zoom meetings were available during the pandemic for advising and certain CoSE events, but times of the meetings were often misaligned with my schedule or not as exciting or enticing as an in person offering. Also, largely the social aspect on campus has changed, people seem to be much more quiet and reserved than before, I also have yet to want to go to an event being held on campus this year."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,1887,"During quarantine I thought I wanted to go back to in person classes and partly I am happy about it because I feel as though I retain more information this way. I feel like a classroom environment is easier to learn in because everyone is there to learn so it makes it easier to focus so it has helped in that sense. It has also made it harder to attend class though since up here living is expensive so working and going to school have been tough to manage. So there is that, there is pros and cons to in person learning but over all I feel like being in class has made me feel more productive. For self-care I have been stressing about things less, I unfortunately have adopted an it is what it is mind set, I do try still, but I try not to stress out if I know im trying to the best of my abilities. I am concerned that I will not be able to learn everything I want to due to lack of sleep or missing class I have the same lack of sleep concern for my well-being. Working nights is hard :/"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2890,"After transitioning back to in-person classes, it is safe to say that I have felt more confident in my understanding of any new subject thus far. I know this is true since I stay more focused throughout the class, and I have more opportunities to ask questions to improve my understanding. However, I want to admit that I do not enjoy my time waiting at the Bart or enjoy my long schedules at school. I only miss the benefit of staying at home in my bed while listening to zoom classes. As for ways I do self-care, I wear my mask while commuting, I bring enough food to eat at school, and I work out at home to ensure I stay somewhat healthy. As for my concerns, I am worried about getting robbed while making my commute or coming across any shady business person. As for covid-19, I am not worried about contracting covid since I received all my shots/booster and would not mind staying at home."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2886,"Transitioning to in person classes has been a little hectic. It's been really hard trying to break habits that were formed when the pandemic started, for me that was senior year of High School. A ton of students in my school including myself worked part time jobs and our school ""allowed"" us to miss school if we were working in an essential infrastructure. Starbucks was deemed essential, so I was working. I feel like I subconsciously elevated the importance of work to surpass the importance I give school because of this, and that is something I am trying to reverse. Focusing on work too much isn't good for my mental health because I tend to drop other important things in my life because of it. Sometimes we have to remember that we just work wherever we work. I've been making sure to make the most of my days that I don't work to really ease my mind and make room for more important things. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,170,"The move from online to inperson was really interesting. It was both difficult and easy . Getting there in college was easy. I thought it was going to be more difficult but the actual planning around it, considering travel time and how things are going to work with what I do after or how I’m going to get back home, was an experience. The class room I thought it was going to be more awkward but then the moment I was in there it felt immediately like I’m a college student again. I'm here to learn and have fun and really experience college and that was nice. I think I do want to continue my all in person or all online I think doing both like I did this year was extremely not worth the hassle. I'm probably going to try all in person this upcoming fall semester because it was really fun going back on campus. Those were my thoughts on going back to in person. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2887,"In person classes have made learning much easier for me. I have trouble paying attention to online lectures. I also enjoy being on campus and talking to my peers. For self care I like to bake breads and take long showers. I also like to play catch with my dad, pick flowers and hit the club with my bros. I also like to make cupcakes. I dont have many concerns for my education. I am vaccinated so covid doesnt worry me too much. This semester has been very stressful so that is something that is bad for my well being."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2891,"The spring 2020 term when classes went from in-person to online was my term back to school after taking the previous term off. At the time I was somewhat renewed in my school efforts and like everyone else I found myself in a new situation. I had never attempted nor wanted to take an online class simply because it was not the learning mode I was used to. At first it was fine, but I gradually became lazier; the environment of school and home are not the same. Having gotten used to the home environment, this return back to in-person after two years has been made somewhat difficult with the differences between the two. One of the major changes is that on top of having in-person classes, I am a recent transferred to SFSU. Not only is the school new to me, but it is also far from where I live so the three-hour roundtrip takes away some of my free time. However, at the same time, in-person classes make me feel more of a priority/investment in my education compared to the times of waking up ten minutes before class. There are less distractions or reasons to get up in the middle of a classroom as opposed to sitting in my room with the camera off. Also my schedule has some downtime on classes where I can go to the library and work on school stuff with better focus. Once back home I do finish up whatever work I may have left and spend the rest of my time doing whatever I want. However, that does not occur often because as I said my time is taken up by BART rides. So those rides become my time to browse social media or watch videos even if it does not feel like free time to me. Now it is only on the weekends that I truly get relax and I am fine with it, that’s how things worked before the pandemic after all."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2885,"the transition from online to in-person classes has affected me but it has only really affected me, in the same way, the transition from in-person to online affected me two years ago. the main thing about the transition is the change from something I had been comfortable with. after we went from in-person to online classes I found myself struggling with balancing responsibility and comfort. classes were less intimidating when they were online. but now that I'm back in in-person I still find myself less intimidated by them the only problem now is I know I would rather stay home than leave to go to class. but I feel that going to class is good because the environment is more suitable for learning. when I do go to class I become a very task-oriented person even if I don't want to do work I just tell myself that this is how I become a productive member of society and I just need to finish my work. Overall I'm fine with in-person classes it just means I need to be awake and somewhere at a certain time."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2889,"Transitioning from online to in person class has been a bit of a culture shock if I'm being honest. I used to be a highly responsible student, always getting homework schoolwork and all of that done. Due to online learning, however, I taught myself bad habits such as putting minimum effort in for maximum output. The problem is though now that I'm back in person with 18 credits I'm constantly drowning under school work while simultaneously doing sports and trying to relearn my good habits. It's not an easy task to undertake, as most of my current classes are highly advanced mathematic essentials that I need to know. How I am practicing good self-care and well-being is forcing myself to take breaks, even if it stresses me out. The longer I go with no breaks, the more likely I am to burn out, so the breaks helps lessen the grind."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2898,Well transitioning into in person classes has been quite stressful for me since I am commuting to school. I have to get up and travel two hours before my class starts so I can be there on time. By the time I come home I have to study and finish up homework. My school life is usually all work and no play. In order to comment to self care I have decided to not study while in the trains and bus. I usually listen to music or listen to podcasts. I also occasionally watch movies with friends. For self care I also get close to my classmate during class. I asked about their and have a conversation before and after class. I realized you can make friends as long as you talk. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2899,"Online classes were very tough for me. I found that being in an environment full of distractions, my room, paired with my self-proclaimed low attention span was hard for me to fully conceptualize the topics that we learned in class. I felt that during online instruction, I was more focused on surviving & passing the class, rather than putting more emphasis on learning the material that I can use to my advantage later in my career. So naturally, I was very excited that we could go back in person. At first, it felt super out-of-place to be back in person. Something I hadn't done in about 2 years. However, as the semester went on, it just suited me a lot more and I felt that learning became something that I actively did more during in-person classes. For self-care, I mainly just hang out with my friends from home and play video games. They help me immensely as an escape."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2884,"In my opinion , returning to in person classes hasn't been the easiest from me, the adjustment isn't easy at all. I will explain this by saying that getting to school has been hard because you never know when traffic is going to be light or heave . Then being around people isn't the easiest either , because of the fear of people might having the virus . Another reason why it was hard for me is because the teachers are giving the same amount of work as if we were doing the work from home and I dont think thats okay . For self care I try to workout and sleep as much as possible but I don't have the time due to work and school. My  concerns for wellbeing on learning is that the teachers are giving a lot of hard homework and class work that can't be finished."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2888,"Transitioning to in person classes has been slightly inconvenient because I usually prefer online classes due to the flexibility when scheduling classes alongside work and other life obligations. Fortunately I live near the campus now which means I don't have the long commute I had in the past. Even though I dread heading to class each day, I always feel better after taking the walk to school since it forces me to get out of the house at least once per day. For self care I am making sure that I have at least some time each day to enjoy my hobbies and do things that relax me like taking a long shower or riding my bike while listening to music. As far as concerns for my learning I am worried that my next (and final) semesters will be very intense which stresses me out a bit. I'm looking forward to the impending graduation which helps me hold onto hope and motivation. Recently many of my classes have been recording even the in-person lectures which is very helpful in being able to review things at my own pace. This is very helpful and alleviates some of the stress and time pressure of a heavy work load since it provides flexibility."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2901,"Transitioning to in person classes have impacted me significantly regarding self care. I have become much more active now because I’m forced to get up early everyday in order for me to make sure that I get to my classes in time. Also, the fact that my classes are in person and sometimes, I have a lot of time between each class gives me the opportunity of more freedom. I live with a really strict mother who use to not let me leave the house unless it was for something like school or an appointment. I was essentially trapped in my own house. Nowadays, I’m allowed to just head out to wherever whenever I want to as long as I let my mother know. By having more time for myself, it’s really helped me mentally. Also, having in person classes was something that I was, at first, very opposed to. I really hated having to wake up early and having to travel to school but recently I started taking up skateboarding again and now I look forward to the commutes because I’m still learning to skateboard and so the early mornings are a great time because not much people are out on the streets. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2897,"I think In person classes are the best thing to happen for me during my time at college so far. It has helped me stay on a consistent sleep schedule because some days I have to wake up at 7: 30 AM to be able to get to school at 9:30. The commute can feel annoying at times but I know it’s in my best interest to be at school on time and ready to learn. In person classes have also helped me stay on top of my work as a whole. There is no way for me to ignore my lecture while I am at school. Even though I have 2 online classes I take them while I am at school which just gives me a better environment to learn in and better focus. Before in person classes I used to go for a walk near my house for about 30 - 40 minutes but I do not do this anymore since I am at school and it's almost dark by the time I get home, so now for self care I focus on school all week and I just chill with my girl on the weekends."
