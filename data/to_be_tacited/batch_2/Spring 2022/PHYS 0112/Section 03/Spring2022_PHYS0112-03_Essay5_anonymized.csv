2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2698,"Growing up, I understood the sacrifices my parents and older relatives made for me and m siblings to be where we are in the present. This fundamental understanding grounds me as I embark on my life and the experiences I'm able to have like college. I am a first generation college student in my family and with this title I have, it can be quite pressuring, yet my family motivates me to continue. When I'm feeling discouraged with continuing with school, I often reflect back on my family and my humble upbringing which drives me to continue pushing through school. I believe that a college degree I earn, is a degree for all of us (entire family).  Also, being a Pacific Islander student with little to minimal representation, I believe it's necessary for me to continue pushing to finish higher education to display the abilities Pacific Islanders have! It's not common for Polynesians (Pacific Islander) to continue higher education, but as one of the few, I believe this is the start of a new shift in college dynamics."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2693,I think something that I always have to remember is to just not give up. I get tired and unmotivated to keep going sometimes but I remember the importance of always trying again. I tend to get distracted easily and so I struggle with keeping focus on work and being consistent and punctual with my assignments. My family like many others are very hardworking and are always very optimistic. So I guess I would say I’ve learned a lot about trying over and over again. However this doesn’t mean I expect to do things good in the end or to have certain outcomes but just to improve and be better than I was the last time. My mom tends to say that there’s nothing but time and I think if you take that in a positive perspective it helps when you’re struggling at doing anything. If you add to many factors to it though this phrase becomes scary and untrue ofc so I wouldn’t really add it in things I try to keep in mind. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2704,"My family's values have almost entirely helped me navigate through college. They were the ones who instilled in me the value of education and are a testament to how many doors receiving an education can open. I am fortunate and grateful for my family and their values because they are the ones who taught me that the thing that matters most is that I do the best I can. While I do aim for the highest grades possible, I believe that I am lucky to have a family that supports me as long as I believe I tried my best. I know that these values will carry me far as I go on with my college career but throughout life as well."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2699,My family has been a tremendous help to my experience navigating through college. My family does everything they can to make sure I can focus on my schoolwork. My family has also instilled values in me that have helped me be successful in college. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2692,"To me, the values of my community or family have informed, in a more neutral or multi-faceted way, more than directly helped me navigate through college. In other words, having a more complex relationship with this culture — which comes from an older student's life experience — rather than directly mirroring them is what has helped me the most.Now in my mid-twenties returning to school, I feel I have a stronger connection to what my goal is in attending college. Rather than following the more common path bestowed on me by a culture, a family, or a peer group, choosing to return to school out of my own volition has helped me appreciate the benefits that attending college offers.Maybe I'd flip the prompt on its head: Returning to college has helped me appreciate the values of my community. Moving away from my hometown in the Bay Area and starting a career elsewhere, then returning years later to attend SFSU has helped me realize what makes San Francisco culture distinct. While I don't plan to stay in San Francisco, I feel thankful that returning has given me a clearer idea of what makes the Bay Area unique."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2705,"The most frequent values that my family has taught me is the importance of being diligent. This means concentrating on the tasks that matters the most, and when it matter the most. It is because of these values that I was able to maintain a clear memory on the topics that I have learned in class. Examples of such classes are including, but not limited to, anything that involves math or science. This is because math and science are my favorite topics to learn, which is why I consider them my strongest subjects. Anyways, some other values that I was taught by my family is to be respectful of others. Of course I did not learn this from just my family, but also from my friends as well. Another value I learned from my family is responsibility. Back when I was young and naïve in middle school, I always did whatever I felt like doing. However, I never considered the consequences behind those actions, and there were times when they came back to haunt me. Fortunately, I learned from those experiences with the help of my family."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2690,"The people within my community have been mostly young adults or young students in a similar position as me hoping to succeed well in our educational career as well as do well in life and be overall happy and healthy. Having individuals in my community with a similar goal and similar mindest to succeed has helped me stay motiviated to acheive my goals in college. Individuals in my family support my goals as well which makes stressful situations less stressful knowing that you are being supported. I know not all students have the support they need but there are plenty of inidividuals in our community willing to reach out and help, knowing that is available to me as a student is extremely helpful in navigating college. "
