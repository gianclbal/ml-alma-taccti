2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2699,"I have many academic and professional goals. This class is helping me achieve them. This class is a prerequisite for my major so to graduate I need to pass this class. This class is also providing me with knowledge that I will be able to use for the rest of my life. Part of the reason I enrolled in college was to learn about different subjects not just to pass the class. I want to get into physical therapy school as well so this class will teach me things that I will be able to apply in graduate school. This is a prerequisite class for most physical therapy programs, so I need to get a good grade in this class. This class is also a steppingstone towards my ultimate professional goal of working as a physical therapist. This class will help me to achieve this goal. I must stay motivated and remember my goals.   "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2691,"My goals for this semester is passing all of my classes with grades that I am proud of. Recently, I was finally accepted as a biology major so now I am entering into a big transition and needing to pay a lot more attention to my academics. This class is going to help immensely with finishing my road map with getting my degree in biology. Being able to fully understand the lessons I am learning is extremely important for myself and my career. This semester is a lot more different than the past semesters I have had here at SFSU because most of my classes were primarily online. So, another goal of mine is finally being able to fully transition out of the system and comfortability I had with being online because it really has been a hard transition.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2698,"My goals for this course is to effectively understand the material in a way that sustains throughout my educational journey. I'm not too focused on getting an A or achieving perfect scores, rather I'm interested in understanding the material effectively so it can carry on for my personal needs for my future. I think this is the most distinct difference with college because in primary and secondary schooling, we were focused on attaining high grades over complete comprehension, but in college all of the materials and courses taken are personally valuable for the future, especially career wise. This course is helping me achieve this goal because I'm exposed to various concepts that apply in everyday life which allows a fundamental understanding through relevancy. This course is also helping me take my time learning because usually it's just straightforward concepts from my other courses, yet this one causes me to tap into critical thinking which takes more time to solve problems."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2704,"My goals include graduating in 4 years and having a well-rounded knowledge of the sciences. This class is helping me achieve those goals by helping me meet the number of units I need to take each semester in order to graduate on time as well as educating me in physics, which is an important subject in science. This class contributes to my knowledge of science by applying the information I learn in lecture to real-life, tangible experiments. By witnessing these concepts with my own hands and eyes, I develop a much deeper understanding of physics. Taking this class helps me achieve my goals by also providing me the foundational knowledge and experience needed to take more advanced science classes in the future. Being able to take more advanced courses would not only allow me to receive my degree, but allow me to understand science at an even higher level."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2690,"One of my goals for this year is to get my foot in the door in my career field and acquire some sort of professional job that is related to my major, personal interests and or career goal. So far, I can say that physics is allowing me to practice my critical thinking skills which is a skill that can be transferable to all other aspects of my live. I have been able to learn and understand how things function in my daily life in detail, for example why a ball has a certain trajectory or why objects move a certain way due to acceleration. Unlike other mathematics classes I have taken, I have more confidence in the fact that I will most likely encounter some problem in my career that involves physics and I hope that I retain the knowledge provided by this class for when that time comes.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2692,"I like using code to make images, but rendering has a lot of math, which I am not so good at as an animator.Some of the basics, like shooting rays out of a camera can be done with the basic math I am able to understand, but I am not as good as it as I could be. Even ignoring the techniques that make calculating them efficient, there is so much physics in bouncing light rays too. I'm looking forward to learning how to solve these kinds of problems more in this class!At the same time, I want to do well in this class for multiple reasons. Because this is my first of two years before I plan to transfer, this Physics class is also one step to fulfilling the General Education requirements of the school where I hope to transfer: USC, a school known partly for animation."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2694,My goal for this class is just to be able to fully understand what is going on in class whether it's lecture or lab. I want to be able to help my table mates with the questions that they do not understand and I wish for them to do the same with me. I want to actually be able to understand what is going on for the basics of physics and not to just memorize the equations and the way problems are solved in the lecture class.  i want to be able to get a good grade in class and not just pass with a barely passing in order for myself to actually know that I took in the information and was able to show that through my work. I do not aways believe that grades are a reflection on what you have learned in class but it would be nice to get a good grade in physics because it is known to be a challenging subject and just getting a good grade would boost my own confidence.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2693,"My goals are pretty simple and similar to everybody else’s. I want to live a comfortable life with a job that pays me well. I honestly just want to live a happy life. However in order to do this I need to have a job that pays well enough in that I can pay all my bills and so that’s what my goal is, I want a job that will pay for my needs. I’ve always dreaded the fact that I’d be working for someone else if I worked in healthcare because being self employed always seemed so cool to me but I don’t even know if that would work out and time is very precious to me. Not to mention the fact that I’m a very impatient person. I eventually settled for a career in the medical field, specifically the veterinary field mainly because I thought I’d enjoy working with animals more instead of people (patients) and the pay seemed enough. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2702,"My goals this semester are to expand my learning skills in all of my courses. Also to pass each course with an A. This class is definitely helping me expand my learning abilities with physics. Physics is a subject that I was never too familiar with so that is why I decided to take this course. It’s helping me learn about how the world around us functions through force gravity and motion. I’ve learned a lot so far and I’m expanding my skills by developing new strategies of note taking, studying, and doing the lab assignments. I find it better working with others because I get to be a part of their learning strategies as well and it teaches me things. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,980,"Keeping it honest, the only way this course is related to my goals is a stepping stone for my degree. However understanding physics does help me understand the world around me and how things interact with each other. Trying to get into kinesiology physics will definitely help understand the in ear workings of the human body. After that being a househusband would be cool too."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2700,My goals for this class is to be able to full fill out a requirement for either medical or nursing school. I known some schools require students to take a physics  class I think that although they ask me again to take it I will already come prepared with what I am going to learn in this class. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2695,"My goals, in the long run, are somewhat achievable but there are, would be, a lot of sacrifices I would have to do to achieve such a hard goal. Becoming a dentist not only requires a lot of my time but also a chance at getting accepted into dental school. The small percentage of being accepted and a smaller graduation rate creates anxiety for me even though it is not as far nor as near from the current present. This class helps me understand physics, which is a very complicated subject with all the different equations, but interesting nonetheless. This class and my other lab class both take very long but one of my favorite classes throughout the week because the class is mostly hands-on and I can understand most of the material better. This class specifically is great since during lectures, or even when I am doing homework with my friends, I get confused with the current topic so lab helps a lot with understanding."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2701,"A general goal I have for this semester is to holistically stay organized, in all facets of my life, even outside school. By making sure I stay generally orderly, other facets of my life such as school work, and my personal life will begin to fall into place. I additionally want to work on being able to have more courage to ask for help and reach out to my professors more often, particularly during things like office hours and any type of available study groups. During this class, I am primarily aiming to use the content we learn in this class as a stepping stone/tool of sorts for the lecture portion of this class. During lectures, I tend to find myself running to catch up with the content and the professor. So being able to work on slower-paced work, still related to content from lecture, is very helpful. I plan to achieve these goals by thoughtfully doing the homework/labs and taking my time to make sure I understand what is being discussed. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2696,I have many goals in life to achieve but I tend to make small goals so the big ones seem possible to get to. The small goal I have for this class is to pass the class and engage learn physics. The big goal I am achieving will be bypassing this class and earning my bachelor's degree. I am striving for my master's degree in nursing or might be going to medical school. I have yet to decide what route I would want to take. Passing this class is just one step into my ultimate goal. Other than school goals I am also working on personal goals for my mental state. Putting in 100% effort and not procrastinating Is another goal of mine. This is a hard one to complete since it isn't something I can complete just once. This class will help me achieve a little bit of my personal goal but all of my school goals in life. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2705,"Basically, my goal in this class is to simply pass with good grades in order to graduate with a degree, and since a lab was required to graduate I chose this class. However, that is not the only goal I had in mind. Some of these goals I had in mind was to make some friends and have some fun memories while I am studying this class. There was also some desire to review my knowledge in physics and math but that is besides the point. This class is helping me achieve the goal of passing good grades by teaching me the necessary knowledge that will be tested in order to earn the grades that I want. In addition to this, the group labs that I participate in will allow me to interact with my fellow classmates and possibly make some friends as well as having fun talking with them. I am also having some fun and satisfaction learning and solving physics problems, so that is a plus."
