2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2696,"The resources I have to support me through my academic career and personal life are thankfully a lot. For my academic career I have the resources of professors, other students, the school, government and family. My family supports me somewhat financially and same with the government with FAFSA. The resources I get from my friends and professors is help with hw or other projects. I would say the school definitely helps out a lot with guiding me down a path of success. My personal life is supported by resources of my work and majority family. My family is always supportive of the decisions I make. They help guide me in life also with helping me get a job in medicine to helping me financially. Im thankful for all of the resources I have and luckily living in california provides so many more resources than other states or countries. Use the resources as much as you can like grants and free money from the government.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2705,"The resources that I have to support me can be a lot of things. One of the biggest resources I have is probably my access to the internet. With it, I can search up almost anything I want to learn and gain a better, general understanding of it. It is also my source of entertainment and news. This also includes my laptop, which provides various tools I can use together with the internet to enhance my understanding. Another resource I have is also my job, as it provides me with the money I need to pay for things that support me. Another big resource is also my parents, as they provide me with plenty of emotional support as well as financial support. Without them to raise me, I probably would not have the things that I have now to support me. Which is why I am very grateful for their support."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2700,"The resources I have on my hand are all the members that compose my support net in my close circle, this can include my friends and work colleagues. I think that our relationship is strong enough that in case I need something I think they would have the connections necessary to help me reach out them"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2704,"I know that I have resources available to support me such as the student health services (which includes counseling), TASC/tutoring, my professors, and my academic counselor. I know that there are also SCI classes for many of my science courses which provide additional support for subjects that students often struggle with. I feel supported by most of my professors-- not that any professors seem unsupportive, rather, there are professors that express their support more than others. I also know that I can receive emotional support from on-campus counseling. Lastly, I always have my own person support system from my friends and family."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2692,"Aside from the resources that SF State offers, I am thankful for my friends and family, whose knowledge and experience I can draw from in a call or text conversation. I have a habit of falling out of communication with people, almost always by accident. I'm a bad texter, but one upside is that re-connecting with people more infrequently makes every conversation more meaningful — more like an event and a chance to catch up. Already I can think of a few friends with whom I have no reason not to still be in contact with, ones who I'm sure wouldn't mind me being proactive and reaching out. I'm thankful for the discourse among young people today that tries to dispel the feeling that many of us have: that reaching out to people is a burden on them. That's a hard feeling to shake depending on your personality and how you grew up, but the more we can notice it and rethink, the better. The people I spend time with are my resources, and I'm thankful to be around them."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2693,"I would consider my family as a big resource because they are the most supportive and the reason why I am here in the first place. I don’t say that what I want to do is because of them for the majority because that’s not true but instead something that I think will allow me to help them in the future while still being something that I am passionate about. Another resource for me are my two closest friends since they also help me out when I need it whether it’s for school work or other mentally draining issues. I think the school provides plenty of resources as well, which is very beneficial to those that need them. A resource that the school provides that I think I would benefit from would be tutoring. A resource that I use everyday would be my gator pass for transportation. That’s a very helpful resource for me. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2691,"There are a lot of resources I have around me that whenever I am in need of support. My main resource I use would be my friends and family, whenever I am having a hard time whether it be with classes or just personal situations I always have my friends and family as a support system if I ever need it. I am extremely grateful to be able to have such amazing people in my life who are there for me no matter what. Besides that I know a main resource that I have which is away from home is on campus, SFSU has numerous programs that are there for me for any type of problem that I encounter, whether it be for academics or my mental health. Although I have not used these resources to my full advantage I am glad that I have the option if I ever need it. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2698,"I believe that some resources you provide that allows support for me is the opportunity to make-up the lab reports in cases where we got in contact with someone who tested positive with covid, contracted covid ourselves, are uneasy about being in a closed space (the classroom) during these times, or have personal emergencies. This truly allows support for myself because I am a commuter this semester, around two hours away from campus, so this option is beneficial in my learning. I believe that emailing you is highly convenient because you provide fast responses as an effective way of communication. This ensures support for me because you maintain the communication and it builds awareness that I can always reach out via email to discuss any issue with the course. Lastly, I believe you provide a safe space in the classroom setting which supports any needs: academic and emotional, to share anything that's on my mind. Thank you for the many resources you provide."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2699,"I have many resources available to me for support. If I am having a hard time with school, I can go see a counselor. If I need help in specific subjects, I can go to TASC and request tutoring. If I have health problems, I can use the school health services. If I have financial problems, I can go talk to the finance office. There are also many grants, scholarships, and financial assistance options that are available to me. I also have my friends and family as resources. They provide me support in all of my personal and emotional problems. Teachers and faculty are always there for me as well. If I have problems at school or in class I can count on teachers to be there for me. Career assistance and guidance is another resource available to me. San Francisco State has a great career guidance program and HandShake to help me achieve my career goals."
