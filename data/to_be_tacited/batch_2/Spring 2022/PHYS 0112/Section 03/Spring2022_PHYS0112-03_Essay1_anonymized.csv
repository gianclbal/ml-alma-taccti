Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2690,"I could simply say I am required to be here because of the Major I am enrolled in at the school I chose to attend, but there are also some fine details I could add to that. Beginning with my personal interests, I have a large amount of respect for our environment and ever since a young age I have enjoyed all types of outdoor activities. This interest of mine is what sparked my curiosity about how things work within our environment then leading me to pursue an education that focuses on solving problems within our environment. So really I am here in order to gain as much knowledge as possible about how systems in our world function. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2691,"The main reason as to why I am here at San Francisco State University is because I want to make my parents proud. I am the first person in my family to go straight into a university after high school and actually be able to graduate college. I am extremely grateful that I am able to have the privilege of putting my academics first and having the opportunity to branch out and find interest in what I would like to do as a career.  More specifically, the reason as to why I am in this class is because it was recommended for me to take this class by my advisor. Since I am trying to get into being a biology major, this class was one that would fulfill my GE requirement, but also give me a head start on my credits for biology. So just in case I am not accepted as a biology major this class will still count for something. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2692,"I like this question because I had to answer it a lot going back to school as a 24 year old! After high school I took 6 gap years in a row to make YouTube videos with my twin brother. 1 million subscribers is a good stopping point though, and it's way better meeting people at school instead of on a screen."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2693,"I know that I’m here because I need this class for my major. However this class isn’t meaningless to me. I always thought physics was interesting in high school but my teacher and friends would often ruin the experience for me. I think that if things were different back then and I was also different in the way I viewed certain subjects It would have been one of my favorite classes. I think this class will be a great opportunity for me to learn more about physics and experience it while in a different environment than before. I love science and I always wanted to learn more about nature whether its plants, humans, animals, any living organism really and how it all worked. So with that I think it would be good to learn more about earth and something that’s a little more outside the box. I never really think about how physics can open more doors for me mentally on how I view things but I have a feeling it will…..maybe. One thing for sure is that I’ll know more than I did at the beginning. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2694,"Since this can be interpreted in many ways, I will talk about his in many different ways. I am a student here at SFSU because not many schools have my major, and those that do are really expensive. I am here taking this class because it is a requirement for my major. Not only that but lab is also a better way of getting help with the lecture class (so i probably would've attended this class regardless.) I am here in this world because my parents wanted a third child. I am here because I want to do something with my future and make my mom proud of raising here daughters the way she did. I am here studying and taking classes to give myself a better future and give my mom a better future. She spend her life working to give her children a home they can be proud of and I will give my mom the world because she sacrificed her youth (20's/30's) for her kids."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2695,"“Why am I here?” is a constant question I ask myself when I struggle to find meaning in the work I do. Is it to pursue my own career or to make my parents happy? To find something I enjoy doing or the find something others may enjoy? Up until recently, I have failed to grasp the idea, nor the reasoning, in which I chose the path I am on today. It is true I do enjoy the path I am on but was there a sort of bias somewhere along the road in which I let others influence what I wanted to in life? I chose the path I am on and yet I still feel like I have made a wrong decision, but at the same time, I feel happy on this path. The conflicting ideas and the thought that other people may have influenced my path into my future bother me enough to the point in which I choose to think like this like I have a sense of undeniable regret."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2696,"The reason why I am here in this physics class is because it is a required class for me to take to complete my degree. I am here at the school because I love the whole vibe of the city. San Francisco is not that far away from my home. On the weekends I can go home and work or relax with the family. I am at school because I want to get my degree in nursing. I had to take a little decor with the route of nursing. I have to get my bachelors in kinesiology and then my masters in nursing. I wasn't able to get into a nursing program as a bachelors program so thai is the route. I hope to learn more about the movement of the body and physics will help me understand the idea of movement. I am here to pass the class and have fun doing it, if we are being honest. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2697,"I am here on this Earth because I was born into it without consent, it just happened that I was born at that time in that location. I am here at SFSU to get a good college education and learn as much as I can to help me get a good job later in life. I am taking this course because it is required for my major which is Kinesiology. Growing up I was really intrigued by physical therapy and now I realized that I want to become one. That is why I am mainly here. I want to grow and learn to the best of my knowledge in that field so I can become successful when I am older. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2698,"Why am I here? This dynamic question resurfaces my mind periodically throughout my life. I believe this occurs when I’m feeling unmotivated or lost with focus on my goals. In this context, my interpretation centralizes my physics lab. Why am I in Physics? Well, I hate to admit it, but the main reason I’m here is because of my major requirements. Yes, my major requires this course as a lower division major course. I am an Environmental Science major, Geography major as well, but I wasn’t always an Environmental Science major. I changed my major from my initial major, Sociology, the previous spring semester. This will make it a year of me switching my major. I realized that I’m here in Physics Lab because I’ve grown a deep passion for Environmental Science that I’m willing to study or take any course necessary for my major. I’ve taken physics, but have been exposed to physics material in my various years of Calculus. Honestly my experiences with the Physics material from Calculus shifted my mind into not being a fan of Physics. However, with my deep passion for Environmental Science, it drives me to overlook this inaccurate disliking and open my mind to learning Physics in a hopeful sense."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2699,"I am here in Physics 112 because I enrolled in the class. I enrolled in the class for a few reasons. This class is a required class to graduate for my major. This class is also a prerequisite for the graduate program I want to get into. I want to go to physical therapy school, and this is an important class to take in order to achieve that goal. I am also here because I love to learn. I was not a great high school student but have learned the importance of a good education. A good education is a privilege that not everyone is lucky enough to have. I want to take advantage of my opportunity and learn as much as I can. More selfishly, I am here to get a college degree so I can get a good job and make enough money to support my family.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,980,"Im in this class to further my degree progress, I'm in school to get a degree for myself and my family. I'm not completely sure why I am on this planet but i know what i want to do. I want to enjoy my time on this planet with those that are around me and hopefully leave positive impacts in my wake."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2700,"I am where my destiny have brought me, I am here for a reason that has a meaningful purpose after all but at the end of the day, I am the one who decides where to go. I have been to many places but here is where at the moment call home but home is where all my loved ones are and they are everywhere."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2701,"Why am I here? I'm here because I'm passionate. Passionate about a lot of things in my life. My family, my friends, my city, and even science. I am born and raised in the bay area, beginning my early love for the bay area, I’ve also been fortunate enough to have an amazing family and friends located nearby. Despite moving away from home into a new city, I still feel an immense sense of comfort knowing my friends are attending schools relativity close to the city and my family can stop by to visit at their own leisure. My passion for science extends into almost every single facet of my life and I’ve found one of my greatest passions is helping others. Through volunteering and internships, I’ve come to realize how much I love interacting with individuals and working in clinical settings, something I plan to pursue after my undergrad!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2702,"All my life I have had many goals and aspirations. I always dreamed of having a career in the medical field and being able to help people's health. I have always had a passion for science and I have always been pretty good at it as well. Ever since elementary school I loved doing science experiments and learning about our bodies. After highschool, I knew I wanted to pursue a medical career in college so that's when I decided to apply to State. Since then, I don't regret my decision as I'm really enjoying all my classes and all the things I'm learning. I know that I'm on my way to completing my degree and I also know that I will become very successful. So that is the reason why I'm here in this class and here at the school. This class is one of my requirements for my degree, but I also chose it because I think it's very important that everyone takes a physics class since it teaches you a lot of how the world we live in functions. I hope I can succeed in everything I do and accomplish my dream career."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2703,"I feel like the question is interpreted in such a weird way for me. I ask that question to myself most of the time. I've always had this irrational fear of moving forward or change. Knowing that I'm moving back to San Francisco after two years into the pandemic made me feel anxious because I fell out of a routine abruptly. I had a lot of opportunities that would make me achieve my goal. So now that I'm back, I'm here to finish where I left of. To be able to the things I couldn't, like perform on stage, finish my degree, and to live again without fear. Knowing that I'm already here makes things easier, and it's in the right direction."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2704,"I am here because it was a required class for my major. I am here because I believe that hands-on activities that we do in a laboratory setting are necessary for a full understanding of the concepts we are learning. I am here because I believe that education is important and will help me get to where I want in life. I am here because I genuinely enjoy learning, especially in science. I am here because we were told to stay home for class for the first three weeks of school in order to minimize the spread of COVID. I am here because I have to be here in order to stay enrolled in this class."
