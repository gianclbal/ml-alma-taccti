2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2699,"When life gets challenging, I try to not get too overwhelmed. When life is challenging, I can get stressed out easily which will not help me get over the challenges. To stay calm when obstacles arise, I like to take it step by step and focus on one task at a time. I have found that when I focus on one task at a time, I can reduce the anxiety I get from very stressful situations. Challenging times have seemed to happen very often for me in these past couple of years. I get better at handling them each time something comes up. I feel like the challenging times make me stronger and a better person overall. I have gained a lot of resiliency through my past challenges. I think that getting depressed about a challenge will only make it harder. I am always better off when I take the challenge in stride.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2695,"When life starts to get challenging I try to start thinking rationally and more logistically. Thinking about how a certain problem arose in my life and letting my emotions take hold makes it seem like I can't grasp the problem properly and I lose my mentality and spiral. Whereas if I started to think rationally, I can start to have control in my life and really figure out solutions to how to better tackle this problem head-on. Having control in an aspect of life where it seems like all of it is through fate and not understanding reality, or the grasp of the world creates a sense of peace for me knowing that I can handle this problem by myself. In my own terms, to control the problem and understand how you feel, you can start to think clearly and really grasp the situation and think about a proper solution than relying on instinct."

2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2690,Recently I have been finding myself to feel more stressed or more overwhelmed than usual and I am typically really good at managing stress but recently it was been giving me a lot of anxiety which I was never used to. What I usually do to help when life gets challenging is I like to break down tasks into manageable time periods. Having a sense of control of what is going on in my life rather than letting the challenging things take over helps me gain confidence that I will overcome whatever difficult situation I am going through. I also try not to get discouraged about not being able to overcome a challenging situation by reminding myself that failure is a part of life and you can only learn from it. Lastly I will always try and reach out for help from others or by using whatever resources are available to me. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2697,"When life gets challenging I normally get really stressed out which tends to make the situation even more challenging.  I try to think of the positives in harsh situations but it is very hard to see them which is why I result in being stressed out and more agitated. One way I try to think of the positives is, for example, if I had a test tomorrow I say to myself in twelve hours this will all be over with and I will not have to think about it anymore. This however only gives me brief satisfaction and does not help with the challenging situation at hand but it is nice to think about."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2701,"When life gets challenging I tend to go back to my roots. Especially when I find myself becoming overwhelmed with the things going on in my life I work to center myself and try to organize exactly what is the root of my stress is. From there I tend to do some self-care, which typically consists of cooking myself a comforting meal and curling up in bed or on the couch watching tv. When I get holistically stressed I also like to go out and do some kind of activity completely unrelated to academics or schoolwork, being able to get a refresher and some space from my work often helps me see the issue with a set of fresh eyes. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2698,"When life gets challenging, I often step back and reflect on the issues that are causing life to be challenging. I tend to try and find what the root causes are for such challenges which allows me to continue in trying to solve the problems. I mean I first have to understand and identify the problems or issues before trying to tackle them. After that happens, I go and seek solutions that help me mentally and emotionally to solve the issues. I often journal about the issues as a stress reliever. I also like to discuss or vent it out with my younger sister. Lastly, I reassure myself that I can defeat these challenges and that I can get through them. That is often how I solve my issues when life gets challenging. I also like to be reminded that it’s ok to not be ok and that it’s completely normal to take my time in trying to get back on track. I learned that rushing a crucial process is hazardous to my mental health and my overall well-being. Also it’s not productive or effective either. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2693,"When life gets challenging, I take a step back because if I keep pushing through it sometimes it just gets worse and I rather take my time to catch my breath and restore my mental health before I just decide to give up. I think everybody should do the same because not everything happens at the time that you think it will or should so it’s important to take breaks and then resume. There's no shame in putting things on pause for your own sake. However some people find it more motivating to try harder when there is an obstacle in their way so I guess it’s what everybody prefers. On a less motivational note though when life’s challenging I eat like crazy and binge watch shows to relieve stress. Some of my favorite food combos involve mixing candy with spicy chips. Now I’m just trying to meet the word count :)"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2704,"When life gets challenging, I usually take a step back and reflect on everything. I try to put things into perspective and analyze what is going wrong and what I can do about it. I do my best to plan things out and take things day by day. I try to remind myself why I am where I am in life and what I want to do in the future. I do my best to tell myself that it’s okay if things don’t go as planned as long as I choose to keep going and don’t give up. I have let obstacles get the best of me in the past and was very disappointed with the consequences. I do not want to let life’s challenges get the best of me like that again, so I push myself to see the bigger picture and imagine how my choice to push through or not will affect me in both the present and the future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2691,"The thing I like to do the most when life starts to get challenging is going on a walk. I recently started taking on this habit because I noticed that when I would get extremely stressed out I would walk around in circles in my room to distract myself and let off a bit of steam. Since this is my first semester actually living in San Francisco I began to see more often that people here like to go out a lot and just walk, especially since where I live is right next to the park. So, I decided to take advantage of this and begin to go on walks whenever I feel like things are starting to get too suffocating. I enjoy doing this so much as a way to clear my consciousness, it sort of takes me away from reality for a second and when I am done I am ready to overcome whatever it is that I find difficult. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2700,"When life gets challenging what I do to make it easier is to talk to people, they have to be different people that give me different vibes and can give different reactions to whatever I will going to tell them. Another thing that I do to deal with challenges is working out. I like to bike a lot whenever I am overstressed, which helps me to clear my mind; but in the end, I think I will be going to find different and new ways to deal with tough moments in life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,980,When life gets challenging I usually pull an ostrich maneuver. The classic head In the sand which has caused so many problems. I usually pretend the challenges don’t exist and deal with them only when I can work up the courage or when it becomes a necessity. I’ve been homeless before and I hope to never be again. In situations like that in which my entire life is effected I source and possible solutions that could be a remedy. The best solution I’ve found to help in challenging situations is to reach out to others despite how badly I would rather not. I would never recommend ignoring problems but it’s only a little sad I can’t listen to my own words.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2702,"Some things that I do when life gets challenging is seek support. I either go to my friends and family or my mentors and advisors here at SF state. I go to those who I can trust and feel comfortable with to share my problems. I ask for help in whatever area I need It in. Another thing I do is look for ways to maintain clam and stress free. I go for a walk/jog, I begin reading, I clean, listen to music, and many other things that help me free my mind and allow me to really think of what decisions I want to make next. I like to stay calm and always remember that things will turn out good in the end as long as I try my best and not give up. It is really important to not over think or be negative about your situations. I like to trust myself and follow my heart and I know that I will be fine in the end. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2696,"When life gets challenging for me I tend to take a step back. When life gets hard I believe it is for a reason so I know the lesson I will learn is a good one. Taking a step back and examining the problem is a good way to take on the problem. Life could be hard for many different reasons but when you step back it could be just a problem you need to take a different approach. Also, another way is to ask for help. I work problems out in class and in life by talking it out much better than in my head. Being able to talk it out makes me understand it much more or even asking for help to guide me down the right path will help me solve the problem too. It is never bad to ask for help in. my opinion it only tells others that you are willing to ask for their opinion on the subject. This could help them too. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2692,"What do I do when life gets challenging? To me, stepping away for a bit helps. An extra night of sleep, a warm shower, a gym session - all of these things at least give me a chance to get some extra perspective. Otherwise, it’s harder to see things from another angle or find a new solution.Calling an old friend helps too, and it’s a way to get some extra ideas or new viewpoints even if they can’t always relate to my specific situation. Whatever it takes to “shake up the snowglobe” seems to help - otherwise, it’s too easy to spiral down into an unproductive place.When life gets challenging, I personally find it helps to get that bit of extra perspective: anything that helps remind me that what I thought was bothering me will be gone eventually. When I look back on this in a few years, I know I’ll think “what was I worried about?” If it helps me get to that place sooner, stepping away and getting some new perspective is what I’d like to do."
