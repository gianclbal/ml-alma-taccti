2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2731,"When life gets challenging, I tend to take a break from life or what I’m doing and just breathe and relax. When life gets challenging I tend to listen to music, watch an episode of a tv series, or pick up a book and emerge into a new life. Depending the circumstance, I dissociate from the world for a bit or I ask others for help. The ones I typically rely on are my family or my best friend. When life gets challenging, I believe it’s better to face the music rather than to let it become a bigger problem. When life is too much it’s always good to, in my opinion, cry a few rivers then get back at it. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2741,"When life gets challenging, I tend to look for ways that will make me feel better. I am a student athlete, so often I find myself struggling trying to keep up with all the competition around me. I am used to being the most athletic person in the room, but when everyone around you is just as good as you, or better than you, it can become mentally and physically exhausting. So, outside of practice and team events I need to do whatever it takes to be the best version of myself once I return to the gym. This includes eating good, nutritious and tasty food, surrounding myself with the people I love, and giving myself some extra self care. When thing get challenging in my personal life, I always need to recognize how I am feeling, and why I am feeling the way I do. Once I am able to identify it, I come up with solutions to solve, or cope with the circumstances. For example, if I am feeling stressed with school work, I know I can always have better time management skills. I will plan out my whole day by the hour, and assign myself productive things to accomplish what I need to do. If things get tough wiht my home life, it always helps me to talk to others, or distract myself form the situation. Often when I have trouble with my loved ones I will even distract myself by a whole day of cleaning. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2735,"when life gets to be a tad much I try to work on my hobbies or get extra hours of work to keep my mind off everything that is currently going on in my day to day life.  I think the most constructive activity is something that promotes productivity like working extra hours or reading a book to clear the mind of any stressful thoughts.  If we are being honest a nice cold refreshing beer could also do the trick, of course I don't always turn to that, just when I think I have earned it I will partake.  Reading books has helped more than anything because I am not only taking a glimpse into another world but I am escaping the chains that have been restraining me the entire week(i.e. homework, work, family stuff)."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2736,"When life gets too challenging for me, I usually try not to think too much about it but I know how ineffective that can be at times. So, for my most recent challenges, I learned that it is beneficial for me to vent about it for a bit, and when that's out the way, I try to come up with the best solution possible that will get me out of that difficult position. I also learned that I tend to withdraw from situations that are threatening to send me toward a negative path, and in most cases, I can get myself out of it. However, when I make a mistake and tend towards that negative direction, I like to remind myself of what's important to me, and whether or not that situation is worth losing everything I worked hard for. In conclusion, life will always have obstacles and I'm still working on the best way for me to address those challenges in a productive manner. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2740,"When life gets challenging  i have two plans towards this.I first make out a plan and look at the patterns in my life and see what challenges I have struggled with. I then try to Assess the optimal outcomes and make a plan for how you can achieve them. And most times I find time management as one of the biggest issues that I have faced.Secondly I seek help and support from the appropriate  sources . I also commit myself and mind to be open and willing to accept the support. On the side too I train my mind to think positively. I also try to  practice awareness through mindfulness techniques and meditation. After applying both techniques,IOutline and define my goal then  plan the process for how to get there by  Performing  researches to see how others who have come before md have done it. I also take  count of my own skills and ideas for how to be able to do it better."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2743,"When life is challenging I like to listen to music or like write down my thoughts. I think writing is a good way to let go of frustrations because when you write them down you can stop thinking about them if you want to. I'm also into songwriting, so I like using the things I write down as lyrics to songs. I think listening to other people's music is also a reminder that you're not alone in the world and that there is probably someone else that has been through the same thing as you, well for the most part. Sometimes I also just sit in silence and think of ways to calm myself down because I don't like being frustrated when life is challenging. I don't think it's healthy to go through life holding onto anger, especially if you can easily release it in a healthy way. I'm also open to the idea of talking to my friends when I'm sad, but that can be hard for me because I tend to be closed off. I think it's important to have someone to talk to even if it can be slightly uncomfortable. It's important to find a way to relieve yourself of feeling stressed."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2737,"In times of stress, I usually take a moment to relax, stop doing whatever I am doing at the time, and then go about doing things bit by bit so I don't overwhelm myself with too much work. Also, sometimes things happen to you that you don't control, so I'd remember that things will change. When other people are around, I will like to talk about the challenging stuff with someone to let all the stress out, and hope that someone will listen and offer some good advice from their own experience. Sometimes I would drive to the beach and take some time to go out and walk around alone, taking my mind off of everything and just focus on my health. Some time also taking a nap then waking up will have less stress from thinking so much which would help me get things done."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2732,"What I do when life gets challenging is I watch shows or movies either alone or with family. I also play video games by myself. I also hole myself up in my room and just relax, watch shows or even game livestreams. I like to keep myself hydrated though and go outside. I go on walks with my dog or just go outside to play with him. I like clean my room and try to draw or do one of my other hobbies, like journaling, sticker decorating, and jewelry making. The games I play can either be Animal Crossing on the Nintendo Switch or Halo Infinite on the PC, along with other PC games. The shows I watch can be Supernatural, Outlander, Business Proposal, and even cartoon ones like Total Drama Island to help me forget about the mental state I’m in. I like to organize my stuff and look at old journals or things for a while, trying to remember the past me or what happened in the past. I don’t do that often and I feel like my memory is definitely bad, I can’t even recall old movies or shows. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2738,"When like seems to become challenging or I start to feel overwhelmed, I try to disconnect. Sometimes I forget to make time for myself and what I like to do. I feel that when I take a couple days to disconnect from what needs to be done and focus on what I really like to do, I can come back even more motivated than before. When like gets stressful sometimes all you need is to take a step back and take deep breath. I always try to keep a hobby that I like doing and keep up with it. That way I feel like I am still doing things for myself and my own mental health. Nothing is worth your mental health, and it is important to always remind yourself of that. I also feel like I often times get overwhelmed with tasks and what seems to help me the most is making a to do list to get them off my mind. Checking things off a list is satisfying and also not having to keep a mental list of what I need to do alleviates some of the stress. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2745,"Depending on what the challenge is my reactions vary, in terms of sudden changes I feel I can be really reactive and hands on in terms of coming up with a solution or ways to work with the challenge but I feel in regards to slow drawn out changes I can be really avoidant and closed off. I'm honestly not the most reliant person as I don't really ask for help until its way past the breaking point which is a really bad habit of mine but I have been trying to mend that reaction. I mostly react in ways of ranting to my friends and letting my emotions out and then hopefully come up with a plan to combat the issue. In terms of emotional challenges it can be really hard to dig myself out of any emotional pits and come back to the crushing reality of deadlines and the need to perform well but I've definitely progressed from my habits in high school. My most practice reaction is escapism, I'll read a book, watch a show, or immerse myself in a hobby to distract myself from whatever is the issue until i absolutely need to solve it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2733,"When life gets challenging, my main strategy is to do what I can to keep perspective. One thought process I’ve developed is to think of my life as a story I’ll tell in 5 or 10 or 20 years and think about how I’ll tell what I’m currently going through. When I can describe it as “difficult things happened to me” or “I made some mistakes” or whatever it happens to be it helps me see the way I’d respond if someone else told me that which helps me to have compassion and understanding for myself, which can be hard for me to do. If I can think about how I’ll look at my current struggles in the future, it also reminds me of the temporality of this struggle and that my mental state, regardless of how severe it is in that moment, will in fact change. As I’ve become an adult I’ve found that’s something much easier for me to do, not only because I can reflect on past experiences when difficult times have passed, but also that I’m just stronger than I used to be. I know that there are things I can do now that I couldn’t do before not because I specifically learned how but because I gained the wisdom and strength to push through. Similarly, I know there are things I can’t do right now that I will be able to do in the future. Keeping these thoughts in mind helps me get through hard times. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2744,"Jessica Martin04-06-2021""What do I do when life gets challenging?""             When life gets challenging, I find it most helpful to take a step back and reflect on why I am doing what it is that I am doing and remind myself of my goals. I find that scheduling time for the things that I care about important. This includes taking breaks and spending some time outside. Going on walks to just get out of the house. I find that prioritizing these little things to be very beneficial in both calming myself down and reminding me that whatever challenge it is that I am facing is very minuscule in the long run and that I will be able to overcome whatever it is that I am facing. And if whatever challenge I am facing does not end up not going my way, I know that I will be better for it and I will learn from it and I will not give up.   "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2742,When life gets challenging for me I like to do different things to help. At times when I feel very overwhelmed and anxious I like to listen to music and watch my favorite comforting show or I like to go for a drive. When I go for a drive and listen to music it helps me relax and lets me regather myself. When I feel sad I also like to feel my emotions and if I need to cry I will and then do something after that helps lift my mood. I also have a few friends that I talk to everyday so when I feel upset I am able to go to them and talk about what im feeling and they comfort me or give me advice. At times I may go for a walk and listen to music. Something that has always brought me comfort when I feel really upset or overwhelmed with everything I like to go to the beach or being here now in San Francisco I like to go by the Golden Gate Bridge and look at the cityscape because it helps remind me that I make problems bigger than what they need to be. I also like to play with my dog or take her for an extra walk because being around her makes me feel happy and helps me reground myself and appreciate the little things more.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2734,"What do I do when I get stuck in a challenge. I give up. I know it's cliché when someone says ""don't give up,"" etc. But I give up, because why would you want to get into a deeper depressive hole if it's only going to make you unhappy and miserable. In terms of school and education- keep pushing and strive for that $10,000 piece of paper, but when it comes to your own personal life. Just don't. Fight the challenges that will make you happy but don't fight the inevitable or something that will make you depressed. In my personal take; If I'm in a challenge I find my loopholes and get my things done. I go on walks, go on my phone, play with my dog, cook myself something, or just rest. I just take a moment for myself and refresh my mind so I can go back and solve that challenge. "
