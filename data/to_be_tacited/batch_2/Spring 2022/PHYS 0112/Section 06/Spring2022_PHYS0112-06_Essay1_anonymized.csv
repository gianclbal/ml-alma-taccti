Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2731,"When prosed the question, ""Why am I here"" I tend to think of the big picture, like why was I born? In regards to that, I think that I am here to find my purpose and to live life to its fullest for the 78ish years I have on this planet. But when thinking about why am I here in the class right now, I think that this class is a degree requirement for my chemistry degree. In order to succeed in my degree, I need to take this course and pass with at least a C, but I'm trying to aim towards an A. In order to follow my dreams and accomplish my goals, I need to take this course. This course is a stepping stone to my true goals and aspirations, so that is why I am here. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2732,"I’m in this class because I’m a biology major and this physics class was a requirement I had to take. I want to pursue a job in the field of biology. I’m in this school because I really do want to explore more of the city that the Bay Area is known for since I’ve been born here but haven’t even explored around a lot. My knowledge of the Bay Area is very limited, it’s embarrassing so I hope to change that by going outside of my comfort zone and choosing to enroll in a school in the city. I also don’t want to move anywhere and so I can just commute to SFSU and SFSU is known for being a commuter school since it’s hard to find housing in SF in general. I do want to study abroad, though I’m not sure how that’ll work out since the pandemic and everything, but I hope to! If not, then I’ll just have to take a semester fully online and go live somewhere on my own for a semester. Currently, I’m staying at home and I don’t have a job or anything so it makes more sense for me to be here physically at home than to move to a dorm or something at SFSU or nearby, and the commute isn’t too bad. It’s about an hour there and an hour back, and so far we’ve been online so it hasn’t been that bad."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2733,"When I read this question my first impression was ""why"" in a metaphysical sense, asking about purpose and design and destiny. I don't personally think any of those concepts are intrinsically powerful or directly meaningful to the universe, though I do think that they can be useful tools for a person's life. Destiny and fate may be understood to be set in stone, but I find it much more interesting to think of them as something to be made for yourself. Asking ""what is my destiny"" can be a question of what are your strengths and weaknesses and the direction you're moving in. Asking ""where will I be in 10 or 20 years"" based on your current trajectory can be a sobering and enlightening line of questioning. We often think of certain futures as inevitable or immaterial, but more than anything they're shaped by what we do about them and how we think about them. One thought that's helped me massively has been the idea that what is my present right now will soon enough be part of my past and my story. If we read events and know they are a part of a story we can trust that they are meaningful and will be different in the future. Similarly, if I think of how I might perceive my current self in the future, my current mistakes and weaknesses become much more tolerable, and I can see myself as a work in progress, as a part of a story. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2734,"Why am I here? This is a question that I've always asked myself. But let's not get too deep into this. As I continue on my college journey, I wonder if all of this is worth it; I need to continue on this? I've seen an array of cultures, traditions, and countries- It's beautiful. Usually, people don't have the luxury to see what I've seen, but when you see poverty, that's when it hits. Poverty is one of the things that I've always wanted to be eradicated, but I know it's a stretched dream that will never be attained. So I've always wondered if I can be the change that stops poverty. And the answer is no. So, why am I here?I'm here to laugh, learn, and change- with age."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2735,"I am here to complete a degree requirement and to essentially learn more about physics in the process.  I have taken physics before in my senior year of high school but that was in 2018 so it has been quite some time.  I will say that I have taken calculus 1 and that class has helped me in other classes, also I am aware that you can utilize calculus in physics which I find very cool.  I find the more classes I have taken, the more the reason to be in the classes I am in today."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2736,"I am here because I have a motivation to always better my circumstances. I lost the motivation to go to school and pursue the path that has driven my academic success over the years, so when I lost that motivation, I could no longer see my place in the world and I felt stuck in one place. I often feel left behind but I decided not to let my circumstances be the reason why I gave up on myself, so I began my journey back here. So far, I've been doing really well and that increases my determination to explore my options and who I aim to be in life. I still reflect on my past and have significant regrets but I often remind myself that there are some things that I can't change. However, what I can change is what will define me for many years to come and I'm motivated to keep moving forward academically and mindfully. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2737,"I am here to persuade my education and network with people so that others can gain expertise and knowledge, so when I graduate in a few years I will be out working and I will have a better opportunity of getting a good job. I am here because I have the motivation and willing to put my hard work in so I can graduate college. I can then get a job I'll enjoy that will also provide me with financial stability so I can buy my own house in the future. Once I have attained the skills I’ll have a better opportunity of getting a certain job I’m looking in to because when a company who is going over the job applications and seeing the resumes they see that they have someone who has experience in that specific space will probably have a higher probability than someone who has no experience."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2738,"I am looking to fulfill a pre-med prerequisite and also gain some critical thinking skills. This is my first physics class, so I am learning a lot of this for the first time and it can be challenging. I need to be able to tell myself it is ok to reach out with questions when I need it. If I don’t I end up stuck on something for a long time and end up struggling even more. I hope to also grow intellectually. When you are put in tough situations that force you out of your comfort zone, you end up growing as an individual. I think it is healthy for us as humans to constantly challenge ourselves and push our selves out of our comfort zone. That is what physics is doing for me. I am thinking about things that I have never though about and also looking at ordinary daily things with a new perspective. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2739,"Why am I here?, is a question that I've been getting asked a lot over the past few years. Although I think that this is a valid question, it scares me. When I was in high school, I thought college was going to be the place where I found out who I am and what I want to be. Now that I'm in college I get asked the question why am I here? Simply the answer is I don't know. Currently, I am having a hard time enjoying college and the classes I'm taking. I do things just because I have to and because that's what you meant to do. I am just following the pathway that is given to me and hoping that it will result in a degree or a job or anything. I wish I had a better answer and a better reason to be doing what I am doing but it just seems like my efforts are made for others to enjoy."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2740,I am in this class to first  fulfill a pre-requisite for my major and also to grasp some ideas that would aid me in future with regards to my major as a biology student. I hope this class will also help me in my daily activities in regards to my current job position. In my current job position which deals with bioengineering i am being required to use some physics analogy to interpret results. and i hope by taking this class i would be able to improve my knowledge and also have certain answer  to questions  pertaining to physics calculation.Another reason why  i am here in this class is that aside  from having an instructor to educate me I also feel i will be benefiting from having other students to share different ideas which is a plus for me in terms of learning and i think this class can better prepare me practically and theoretically to be able get more beneficial information generally.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2741,"Why am I here? To be honest, I am here because I have to. I think physics is a cool subject, but I am not sure if its for me. I picture physics to be very math based, and I am more of a conceptual person. I am a bio major, so it makes sense that I am into more conceptual topics than mathematical topics. But, I am hopeful that I am going to enjoy this class and get a lot out of it. I have never taken a physics class before, but I have taken many math classes and to be honest, I struggled in them. So, I am nervous for this class and to be here, but since it is one of major requirements, I am looking forward to making the most out of it. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2742,"""Why am I here?""-Well to start off I am here to get my degree to become a veterinarian or at least be able to work with animals in a zoo. My whole goal with furthering my education past high school is to work in the animal field mainly to become a veterinarian. I am here in this class to cover a requirement to get GE's covered. I guess you could say I know little to nothing I guess mainly the basics of physics but nothing major and I am glad to be able to learn new things. I grew up always liking animals and always wanted to work with them/help them in any way and as I got older my ideas of working with animals would change. At some point I wanted to work with marine animals. I guess now I would still like to work with marine animals but my main goal is to work with animals in general. Although I am only taking this course to cover for my GE's I am still open minded to learning the topics and would appreciate the new knowledge."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2743,"I'm in this class partially because I have to take in for my major, and because I like Physics. This class was on my roadmap, and when I saw I needed to take it I was worried. In the past, I've struggled with learning Physics because it's not my favorite science. I do like the concepts I've learned, but it's hard for me to wrap my head around them. I'm here to learn more about Physics and work hard to understand the topics because they are useful. I'm here to be open-minded to asking for help, and I plan on reaching out to my peers. I'm excited about this class and I hope it will help me meet people in my major, or just in general. Out of everything I'm here to just learn and who knows it could open up my mind to new things I could be interested in. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2744,"Reflective Journaling #1 – Why am I here?Jessica Martin02-02-2022PHYS 112 – 06 I am in this class in order to learn fundamental physics concepts that will be beneficial to my further academic career. I am a microbiology major and need this class to fulfil a requirement, but I know that the concepts, ideas and strategies that I will learn in this class will come into play at some point while I continue my education. Physics and biology are about understanding the world around us. As I continue through this course I hope to gain a deeper understanding of how things work and different forces that are at play in the world around me. This is something that will continue not just through my academic career, but physics also plays a role in our everyday lives. Things that we encounter everyday and do not actively think of being connected to physics often have a basic foundation in physics. These things includes clocks, bicycles, and seat belts to name a few.  "
