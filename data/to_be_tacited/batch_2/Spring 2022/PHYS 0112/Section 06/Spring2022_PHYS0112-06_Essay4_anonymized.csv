2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2734,"I have several resources that has helped me throughout this complicates semester.In high school my counselor threw me into a life coach program that helps low income kids of color and they help me find resources that I need like tutoring and financial aid. They also contact me every so often to find out if I'm doing well in school. I also have me professors that also help me because, who else knows about their curriculum better than the professors. I enjoy connecting with my professors because they always share their insights about how life is like in their field. They also give better tips and explanations than tutors (which is my personal preference). Another helpful resource I have is Google. Google has helped me through EVERYTHING and it's been a lifesaver when it comes to studying complicated topics in every class I have.   "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2740,There are several resources that have aided me right from the professors who has helped in impacting how much information and also contributing by recommending me to office hours and helping with more information to help me progressing different aspects .I also have support from  class interaction being shared to me by my  fellow classmates  who have acted as an extra avenue for information by working and collaborating with them in class. I also have gained enough resources through the internet when I am trying to work independently I have sought help through Google. YouTube e.t.c which has been an important resource both academically and also in general.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2738,"When I feel like I need extra help understanding material, my first go to is going to discord to ask fellow peers for help. Often times I get the answer I needed to either solve the issue I was having or help me grasp a certain concept a little better. When that does not help I go to my professor directly. I take advantage of the office hours provided or if I am unable to attend those office hours, Ill email the professor to try to schedule a better time that works for the both of us. What I still have yet to try is the tutoring offered here at SFSU. I feel that it may be helpful to get an opinion of an outside perspective. Sometimes looking at something from a new angle helps you understand it better. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2742,I feel its hard to name multiple sources that I have to support me. I do believe there are multiple that really can and do support me I just don't take advantage of them. My main sources of support would be the people I have around me. I feel at any moment if I ever need any help I could reach out to my parents. They are two people I know I can always fall back on. My other main sources of support with be my closest friends. Whenever I am going through something or need anything I can go to my friends and know they will give me the best possible advice and tell me things that would put my head straight and give me support. I know I can reach out to a couple professors for sure for support if I need anything. I do know that there is one advisor I can reach out to but I am not 100% comfortable with saying I can which is why I am saying im sure there are multiple support resources for me I just don't take advantage of all school ones.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2737,"The resources that I have to support me are my parents, professors, peers,  the school library, online resources the metro resources. Parents would be the ones supporting me financially and giving me other things I would need. Professors would be the ones offering office hours if I have any questions on particular stuff on the subject we are learning about.  Peers learn from each other collaborating with one another. The school library would be a place I can find resources for my assignments if needed and also a quite place to be able to focus on studying. Online resources like google scholar for articles and etc."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2733,"One of my strongest resources is my family, especially my mom. I’m lucky to be as close with her as I am, knowing that many people, especially my age, are not close with their parents, and I tell her almost everything. Though, our emotional languages are pretty different, as often when I want validation and support she’ll provide me with answers and reason, which can lead me to being more upset, so I try to keep that in mind whenever I bring up problems with her. If something is really heavy-duty, I have a therapist I used to see regularly whom I can contact and schedule a session with if I really need to, and I know that they can help make me feel better, though of course they can’t fix my problems. When I talked to them some months ago, they helped me think through the issues I was dealing with and provide me some clarity I don’t think anyone in my family or my friends could. I also know that if my therapist is unavailable, there are online resources, and I should try to get comfortable with them now for the next time I’m in a serious situation. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2735,"In regards to resources I have plenty of them including but not limited to my professor's office hours, My lab coordinator for emailing purposes, and youtube.  I have also been using my friend for help with physics and he is very good at teaching it to me so I really don't even need to go on campus for physics help granted he isn't busy.  I think lab however is very helpful because it gives me the element of practice with the concepts and hands-on experience.  Furthermore, Simply writing down what each concept means is pertinent for my own memory's sake.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2731,"One resource that I know can help support me in my classes and for mental health is metro. Coming from a first-generation family, metro has been a very big help helping me transition into a higher education system. I am able to sign up for tutoring if I need to, and they are always providing wellness check-ins if I am in need to de-stress or acquire a clear mind. I also know that the school offers other tutoring opportunities that I can look into if Metro doesn't have someone for a subject I need help with. Other resources are my families mental support. This is a resource that has gotten me to where I am today and will help guide me into my future endeavors. If I need other resources, the school provides various resources that I can look up on their website. I just know that wherever I am, or whatever resources I need I will be able to locate them on the school website or with those around me. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2732,"Resources I have to support me are my family, friends, and online resources. My family supports me emotionally and financially, they’re always there for me and are willing to listen to my problems. They’ll think of solutions to my problems and are my main support. My friends will help me out emotionally, giving me a shoulder to lean on and won’t judge whatever I have to say. They’re there for me if I’m too scared to approach my family and need a sense of anonymity, though they know me well. The internet has a lot of resources for me to look through, and usually helps the best in regards to academics and my studies. If there’s a question or topic I’m confused on in school, the internet is the first place I’ll look. If there’s a monetary or big problem involving school such as enrollment or finances, my family is who I’ll go to. If there’s a problem involving a class, some homework, or my life that I want someone to vent to, my friends are who I’ll go to. Also, students in my class are another resource i can use for support involving help with homework and studies, there are a few class group chats I’m in though I’ve never said anything in them so far and the others don’t talk much. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2745,My most obvious source of support is my mom she's always been there for me to confide in and receive advice and support from. I also have a well practiced and long term support system between my friends and I and they wholeheartedly have always been there for me. In terms of education through my 4 semesters of experience here all of my professors have been extremely welcoming and receptive when I have come to them for help and even when I haven't. I also know of a lot of resources sfsu offers in terms of support which I haven't put in much time into looking in to but knowing there are options has been comforting. Personally it's fairly difficult for me to reach out and ask for support because honestly it's not something I've done very often but I am trying to improve myself in this regard as well. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2743,"I have a lot of resources that can support me, especially in my academics. I have the internet which is an amazing resource because anything I want to learn is at my fingertips. I also have a library full of different books that I can take advantage of at any point. I also have friends as resources and teachers that are there whenever I need help. I also think we have a lot of good mental health and therapy resources that can be useful for anyone. Overall, on this campus, I think there are many resources that support me and my needs. Resources out of school I think I lack in because I'm out of state. I can't really reach out to those people from home or do those activities that help me when I'm down, but I'm thankful for all the support on campus. I'm glad to have options as well because there is not just one way to get help."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2741,"I have lots of resources to support me- my friends, family, coaches, professors, and so many places on campus that are available. If I ever need support, usually I will just go straight to my friends and ask for advice, or a shoulder to lean on. If I need to take it a step further, I will talk to my parents. If I still feel unheard or I need even more support, I will talk to my coaches. From there, they would recommend me to other people to get my situation taken care of. The only issue that I have is taking things a step further and going to my coaches. I trust my coaches and I know they are totally available for me if I do need anything, but for some reason it makes me so nervous to bring up personal subjects with them. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2744,"Reflective Journaling #4Jessica Martin04-20-2022PHYS 112-06 What resources do I have to support me? I think most of my resources that I have to support me are the people in my life. My parents definitely help to support me to the best of their ability. They help by listening to the problems that I face in my life and if they can help to suggest solutions. They also help by providing a distraction from some of the things that I do not want to think about. Another important resource that I have to support me is my coworkers at my job. They always help to make my day better. It helps for me to compartmentalize the problems that I face during my day to day life and put things into perspective. This is helpful because otherwise work would be repetitive and rather boring, but my friends there help to keep it interesting. I also sometimes like to talk to my coworkers about the material that we are learning which helps me to make sure that I know the material.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2736,"I'm not really one to reach out for support, but I've been trying to make more of an effort now more then ever. I've been most stressed about my timeline more than anything else, and I've attempted to gain clarity on a few of my concerns but it isn't met with much or equal interest.  When that happens, it makes me feel like my concerns are invalid or not important, which makes me begin to question myself. With that being said, I would like to find resources that support me in the way that I need to feel supported. In regards to the material for lecture and lab, I get most of my understanding from outside resources, like YouTube and more. I find that the way someone explains a concept will make or break whether or not I'll understand or grasp it in anyway. Going over problems in lecture have been beneficial as well, and solving it with the teacher is one way for me to feel supported. "
