2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2736,"My goal for this class is to develop an overall understanding of the course material. My main motivation behind completing assignments is to actually understand it before moving on to the next concept. In order to achieve those goals, I know it will take extra effort on my end and I have to be open to asking questions instead of trying to figure it out myself. The assistance from instructors are allowing me to achieve those personal goals because in order for me to feel open to asking questions, I have to feel welcomed to do so. Also, in my lecture class, there's a section of each week's forum where we can share resources, so for me, that it is another way for me to get help from my classmates. Although physics isn't my major, I do believe it is important to understand how it applies to real life applications, which could be beneficial to me in the future. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2738,"My goal is understand physics better. I do feel like lately I have been having a harder time trying to keep up and understand new material. So my goal for the next coming weeks is to attend tutoring and office hours, so that I can succeed in the rest of this class. I also want to study since next week will be my first lecture exam. I also want to be able to catch up in other classes as well. This lab class has so far been helping me understand the topics discussed in lecture. It is nice to put concepts into physical examples. I helps a lot when it comes to dissecting word problems and creating sketches. With this weeks lab in particular, I hope to get a better understanding of magnitude since that it was I am having the most trouble with lately. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2742,My goals are to get straight A's; always have to aim high although my goal is to pass this class so I can cover the requirements. My main goal is to become a veterinarian and I am working hard to get there. I am currently majoring in biology with the concentration of zoology so I will either stay and get my degree in zoology or transfer and go to a different school with a better veterinarian program. This class is mainly helping me achieve my goals because if I pass this class I will be able to move forward in getting my degree or moving closer to being able to transfer. Although taking this class I am definitely learning new things and it is helping me with my actual physics class so taking this class is also helping me personally because it is giving me more knowledge on this I didn't know before especially in physics. Because this class helps me understand better in my other regular physics class it is also helping me pass that class so therefore it is also helping me in passing that class to get a good grade.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2743,"My goal is to be able to understand everything I learn in Physics, but I know that can be very impractical. I also want to be able to draw free-body diagrams without the help of others because those are a struggle for me sometimes. I also want to be able to get an A in this class if possible, but I know I have to work hard to achieve this goal. This class should help me achieve these goals by having material that can help me practice and learn. This class also allows me to ask my peers for help when it is necessary which helps me grow in my learning. I know this class will benefit me in the future, I just have to work hard to understand all the topics and do the work correctly."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2745,One huge goal I hope to accomplish relatively soon is to reach a point where I am able to manage my time efficiently and I don't procrastinate too much. It feels like a short term goal but it's something I really struggle with. I've kinda reached a point where I'm not exactly sure what I want to spend my time doing and to avoid thinking about it I tend to just watch shows and read. This leads me to another goal of mine of wanting to find something I can enjoy and spend my time on wisely. I don't really have any long practiced hobbies and I'd love to find something that is productive and a skill I can hone. Education and Future career wise my main goal is to learn how to truly study and work as hard as I can to achieve my goal of being a forensic pathologist. This class helps me achieve that because I haven't taken a physics class in a really long time and this class is a course I need for med school. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2735,"My goals are essentially to pass this class with an A and nothing lower, also I would hope to learn as much as I can in regards to the fundamental concepts in physics.  Furthermore, I will have to take more chemistry classes other than the general chemistry series of classes because of my major and I believe physics will help with chemistry to a certain degree.  Science is all connected and I find the idea of learning physics is essential to learning how the world and other scientific processes are carried out everyday.  In regards to higher education after my bachelor's, I will be attending pharmacy school which will include difficult classes, some of which require the basic foundations of chemistry and physics.  So in a way i'd say that my overall goal is to become a master of basic science concepts which will in turn assist me in my pharmacy career."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2734,"My goals are essentially the basics- graduate and work on my dream job. I want to make enough money to survive on my own in this city; but at the same time I want to move into a small tight knit town ( I know benefits are slim there but the cost of living is so low). I also want to help my family overseas, because corruption and the cost of living is so high it's insane. This class is helping me because I know that I am going to use these concepts in everyday life. I also am needing this class in order to suffice my graduation requirements. So far I am really enjoying this class because it's making me think outside of the box and I'm mingling around with the people I've met in other classes, like chemistry and my biometry class. Physics is fun but it can be challenging. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2744,Reflective Journaling #2Jessica MartinPHYS 112-0602-23-2022What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?             My most immediate goals are that I want to finish my undergraduate education. I have spent a lot of time figuring out what I want to do with my life and what makes me happy. From this time of self-reflection I have found that I enjoy studying biology and wish to pursue that. I have always been someone who wants to learn more and understand more about the world around me. This is why I have chosen biology and so far in the biology classes that I have taken I have found the material very interesting. Another more long term goal that I have is to get into a graduate school where I can specialize in a field that will allow me to pursue a career that interests me. This class have help me to achieve this goal because physics plays a role in every aspect of our day to day lives. This class will provide important foundational knowledge that will help me as I continue my academic career and will be built upon in every subsequent physics class that I take. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2733,"My current goals are to graduate with a BS in Biology with a focus in Physiology and physics is one of my required classes. I’m not exactly sure why, but I suppose it probably has to do with data, the motion of the human body and analyzing physical systems. Further, this class is advancing my mathematical skills and problem-solving, helping me in any pursuit. I’m also glad to be in another lab class, which helps me manage a weak point, which is accomplishing what I need to accomplish within lab settings, as I can easily be overwhelmed and confused in group work settings. Hopefully by the end of this class I’ll have a stronger understanding of math, problem-solving, lab work and, of course, physics. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2737,"The sort of goal for me is to definitely understand the equation and then plug in the given information in a problem. Also if I do not kind of understand the problem or actually got it wrong, I really try not to essentially be afraid to generally ask questions about why or how he really got to that solution or what step did I go wrong at in a kind of major way. I believe this class basically is helping me achieve these goals because the labs mostly are helping me really understand similar problems. The labs in the class certainly enable us to experiment with some objects and visualize them better, which effectively enables me to basically achieve my goals since I will for all intents and purposes more clearly and specifically understand things, which is kind of fairly significant. I would try to write everything down and go review it over again if I still don't understand because I personally keep trying to remember everything but just forget the next day. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2741,"My academic goals are to go to med school, nursing school, physical therapy shcool, or PA school. I still haven’t decided, and I don’t think I will know for a while. This class is helping me achieve my goals, because it is something that I have to excel in in order to get to those schools. This class is also useful once I get to those schools, because knowing the physics behind life and many other subjects will be useful in my career. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2739,"My goals for this semester is to make sure that I turn in all my assignments for class. Currently I am having trouble making sure that I have all my assignments turned in on time but I think that because this is an in person class it’ll make me more productive in my work. I think that this class will help me with this because everything has a set time and due date that I have to follow. Although I think I need to find a way to manage my time, I feel as if this class will help me fall into that routine. I just have to make sure that I don’t fall behind, so that I am not forced to catch up. I’ve noticed before that when I fall behind it makes it harder for me to want to attend classes and finish up any of the work that I have missed. In the past when this would happen to me I would give up on the class and just do the bare minimum, I want this semester to be different and I don’t want to fall back into that bad habit. All in all I think that my goal for this semester is to make sure that I can manage my time. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2740,My goals are to be able to attain the highest education level so as to be able to choose a career that i had dreamt about which tends to gear towards the science faculty . Looking at the endgoal of this class learning the physical  properties of microbial pathogens is important to dictate their habitats. This class has aided me to learn some of the fundamental physical concepts related to what i will be dealing with at my place of work. Learning from this class has also better prepared me to know the appropriate terminology related to each each physical concepts and what reactions to face when I encounter them.prior to this class I didn't really see the need for physics in terms of my major which is microbiolgy but learning measurement and s.i units of  what each measurements unit has given me the understanding I need to be able to tackle this matter when the case arrives 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2731,"My goals as I know them right now is to acquire a chemistry degree. Why do I want to acquire a chemistry degree? Well, I have always loved chemistry, since I can remember. Getting a degree in something that I am passionate or enjoy has always been my goal. I had struggle a bit in determining this goal. As I grew up and became older,  I would change my desire occupation multiple times. In kindergarten I wanted to become I believe the president of the United States. Throughout elementary and middle school I wanted to become a teacher, I believe this was more because my best friend at the time wanted to be one. During high school, I wanted to be a nurse in the army. I entered the army for that reason, but unfortunately I was medically discharged, so I took that as a sign not to become a nurse and follow footsteps that are not mine. During my last two years of high school I wanted to become a pathologist, but I didn't think I had it to be so during the university application I applied with  biology, and pre-nursing altering with those two majors throughout the 7ish applications I submitted. The gap year I took really helped direct me towards San Fransisco State University. Taking courses for a major that I had little to no passion really demotivated and did not challenged me, so I decided to follow my dream and try to accomplish the goal of becoming a type of pathologist. In order to accomplish that goal, I will need to complete 2 physics courses, so this class will help me become a step closer to my goal. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2732,"My goals are to graduate with a bachelor's degree in biology, get good grades in my classes while doing so, go on to graduate school, become better at math, learn more critical thinking techniques, and become more understanding of physics. This class is helping me reach that goal because it’s part of my requirements that I need to meet in order to graduate with a degree in biology and I hope to learn as well as get good grades in this class though it’s hard and I have little experience with it. I’m also trying to become better at math and this class is math-focused so I am further reaching my goals because of this class. Science has always interested me, but it does get confusing, especially with physics. Taking this class will teach me more about the subject itself which will give me a different outlook in my everyday life after taking this class. This class also helps me with my other physics class (seminar) because that class goes by quickly and we don’t have as much time to go through everything. This class goes through the topics we discuss in our seminar class but more in-depth."
