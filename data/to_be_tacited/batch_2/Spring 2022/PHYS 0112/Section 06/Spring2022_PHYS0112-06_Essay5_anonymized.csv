2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2738,"My family has always valued perseverance and I believe that this has helped me in college because it has helped me push through certain mental blocks. Throughout the semester I become overwhelmed and begin to procrastinate, and the further I fall behind the more stress builds on me. Then I remember that it is important to push through and come out on top of you struggles, so I pick myself back up and work hard to get back on track. In those moments, if I didn’t have the value of perseverance that I do, it would’ve been easier for me to give up, instead of becoming stronger and finishing. My learning community has taught me support. I have tried to be supportive of other fellow students and have offered a hand when they need it. It is also nice to build those relationships with classmates because the can also help you out when you need it. The sense of community has helped me when I have fallen behind. I have either gotten help with HW questions or received notes from lecture days that I missed. These two values have been the most important to me and without either of them, I don’t know where I’d be today. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2732,"The values my family have given me that have helped me navigate through college are perseverance, ambition and determination to do well, strictness and no room for failure. College is hard, but with the value of perseverance, I’m able to continue and push myself to do my best. Ambition and determination also help me with my coursework, keeping myself on path. Having no room for failure means that I should never give up no matter if I feel like I’ve tried my best or if I can’t try anymore, and though it seems harsh, I feel like having that strict value is helpful to me because I wouldn’t do my best regardless. I’m an aloof person and would like to push things to a later time or to the deadline, but having the pressure on me from my family and community to do my best and succeed in college makes it so I don’t slack off or completely give up, and I have to appreciate that. The values my community give me in regards to college are positivity, honesty, and creativity. My community has given me a positive outlook with my life and my college experience, making me less stressed and afraid that something will turn out wrong and block me from graduating from college. Being honest with myself and in class makes way for me to look for resources and talk to other peers or teachers for help if I need it. Being creative is helpful in my assignments and allowing me to think outside of the box and not be so practical in my studies. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2736,"In this semester in particular, I've felt very anxious and more stressed than I've ever felt before. This caused me to realize how important it is for me to surround myself with people who can naturally ease my stress and provide me with a calm and comforting space. I value this in particular because I was once surrounded by people who elevated my anxiety levels, so much that I would feel increasingly stressed and I'd lash out as a result of it. However, once I ridded myself of that energy, I've been feeling much happier and lighter. While school still stresses me out a bit, the feeling isn't as crippling as it once was with all of the other negative factors. My twin sister is the community I value the most because she's been the most consistent support system that I've had while navigating through my college journey. While my education will extend past college, I know that my sister will always be around to help and support me. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2743,"I was raised to be very independent and to work hard. These values or traits have been ingrained in me for years, so I feel like they have benefitted me heavily because I am focused on being successful in life. I also try to be very productive and I always have to be doing something, or I feel like I wasted my day. There's definitely a negative side to this because I tend to overlook having fun in exchange for being over productive, but when it comes to school I'm always on top of everything for the most part. I also really like that I'm hardworking because I always want to get an A, and I'll do anything I can to get it. Working hard is a good trait to have because it makes you successful, especially in the things you're naturally good at. I thank my family for teaching me these values to have all the time. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2741,"I am a part of the student athlete community on campus here at SFSU. This semester has been particularly difficult for me as the responsibilities of a student athlete are taxing, my classes were very rigorous, and multiple things in my personal life have taken a negative turn. Through it all, my teammates and friends from other sports were there to pick me up when I was down. I am extremely grateful for their support, because if it weren't for them I could've fallen into a very dark place. They enveloped me in prayers, warm wishes, laughter, and lots of new memories and I am very lucky to have them in my life. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2733,"My family’s values have guided me to work hard and pursue something that o think will lead me to a good future. My parents come from blue-collar families in Ohio and have some Protestant values about work, resilience and honesty, favoring a somewhat more “East Coast” ethic over that of the west coast of navigating the easier options, disengaging from things that aren’t easy and trying to take advantage of shortcuts and loopholes. Because of this, I’ve often opted to take classes that seem more useful than easy, and I’ll accept a low grade in stride and blame it more on my own skills than the instructor or material. While I do believe this leads to  better results over the long-term and more personal strength, it means I can sometimes get behind of those around me who do take the easy options and cheat when possible. Still, I believe some of my personal problems could have been better-addressed by my parents if they had a different perspective. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2740,The values of my family have helped navigate me through college by giving me the extra belief and courage to always know that challenges will be encountered throughout my college years and its the ability of not slacking or giving up will eventually be my motto towards accomplishing my goal. And coming from an immigrant family there is a  pressure to make good of the opportunity given to me and the best application of such opportunity is by using my education to impact my community and also aspire to create same opportunity for other individuals who are also aspiring for greater heights.In my community being a graduate is a great achievement not just for me as an individual but also for my family and community and being able to represent my community based on my educational field is another way to give positive feedback and shade ore positive limelight to my community and aspire more people and future generations to embark on the same journey 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2744,"Reflective Journaling #5Jessica Martin05-11-2022PHYS 112 – 06              Through my college career, my family and friends have helped me by providing me with much needed support and helping me to figure out how to register for classes and how to do different things. I also find that they are helpful when things get tough like during finals. They provide me with a space to talk about what is going on in my life and how things are going. They also can be helpful in providing a distraction from whatever is bothering me. I have a hard time taking my mind off things that are bothering me so it is very helpful to have people that I can just hang out with and have a good time and not worry about school for a time. While I was in high school, my mom went back to school to get a business degree. And I would often go to her classes with her after school. I would either hang out in the library or go to the class itself and do homework while they talked about marketing strategies or accounting stuff.   "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2742,-My family didn't grow up religious so I don't feel like I have certain values from that although my family is very hardworking so I feel like because of that I carried that with me through college. Growing up we didn't always have the most money and my dad was always working and because of him I am forever grateful and he has showed me what it is like to fully give my all into something. Now completing my second year of college it was very tough for me especially doing this online because of covid. It definitely took a toll on my mental health but I never gave up. I always gave it my all even at times where I really felt like I was done with school I still gave what I could at the time. I continuously work hard to get my degree to make myself proud and the future I want for myself and work hard to make my parents proud because they have worked so hard so that I could further my education.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2734,"My immediate family and my family overseas have helped me the most during my road to college. I've seen what was needed in my community back home, and that was a good doctor. So I decided to pursue medicine and science, which came as disappointing news to my boss (who's wanted me to pursue business), other relatives, and some of my closest friends. But those who cared about me didn't mind what I was studying, and instead, they encouraged me to move forward and ignore all the negative comments. I'm the first generation woman in my family to go to a 4-year institution, and some of my relatives have praised me- and I'm grateful for that. I've never actually gotten much help with my decisions in college because I've been winging it most of the time, but I know what my end goal is, and I'm learning along the way. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2731,"I come from a Hispanic household that weren’t given the opportunity to fulfill their education. With that set in mind, my family has driven into us that education is the way to prosper in life. My parents and community all value education and knowledge so I have installed those values into my own mind and core. With the positive values being in my community, I believe I can strive towards the impossible. These values and sub-values have helped me seek a degree in a high level institution. Without these values I could have easily dropped out of high school or not have even attempted to acquire a degree. I could have worked at a grocery store for the rest of my life or any other entry level occupation as a matter of fact. My parents values that we need to “hecha le ganas al estudio” has kept me motivated to learn and acquire a degree I look forward to. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2737,"The values of my community encouraged me to continue to keep on learning and in doing so helped me navigate through college. As for the values of my family, first generation to go to college I would like meeting new people, networking with others and finding a good paying job I like after graduating. I also like doing business and have a dream of possibly starting or running my own business so might as well major in something I am passionate about."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2745,"Outside of my immediate family it was never an expectation for me to achieve the ability to go to college, my distant relatives (literally anyone outside of my parents and siblings) claim pride over my achievements when they had no influence and hadn't given me any support to actually succeed in higher education. In comparison my mom has always pushed college, it was her main goal for me and I'm proud to be achieving it, she pushes me to do better and as difficult as it has been her presence has motivated me. As annoying as it is for me to hear my uninvolved family members say they're so proud of me when they have no rights to be, I use their initial doubt of my abilities as motivation to succeed. I'm a first gen student so honestly other than my mom who had gotten some college credits, there's really no one who is capable of helping me navigate through college but my mom has shared her knowledge and experience in the world with me which has benefited me greatly in how I can learn to adapt to different types of teachers and professors. In conclusion, the value my mother has of simply achieving higher education has really helped me keep going and persevere through hardships. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2735,"I think the main benefactor to my success in college thus far has and always will be the confidence and trust of my family and friends.  My family has always been very supportive of my career path and will stop at nothing to help me achieve that goal even if it means stopping what they're doing.  My father always tells me to take my time with concepts that I do not quite understand and to really focus on understanding the material rather than memorizing it.  Even if I know I'm going to fail an exam, I at least know that I have family and friends who believe in me and that is personally all I'll ever need."
