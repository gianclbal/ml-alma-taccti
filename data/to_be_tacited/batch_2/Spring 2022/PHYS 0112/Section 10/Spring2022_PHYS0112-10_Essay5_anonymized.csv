2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2795,"I think my family has helped me navigate through college because they taught me persistence and resilience. I am a first-generation student so it has been hard adapting to the educational system, since even the way we chose classes can be difficult. I am also planning to go into medical school, so I never really had a person to guide me before. However, I was able to keep going despite any circumstances that made it hard in my classes, or in college overall. I was also taught that it is important to find community and collaborate with my community which really helped me network with other students in the same path as me. I was able to become a student leader in STEM settings which really allowed me to find new mentors and finally have people that told me what to do to reach my goal, and most importantly, have supported me when I had a hard time and felt confused about continuing in college."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2798,"I mostly got the help from my mom. She gave me energy to study and before i attend the college i always depressed and didn't know i was able to do and whatever i felt that way, my mom was always there for me and she encouraged me to just study hard and she support me a lot . I want to say my mom is really motivated me a lot . "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2788,The values of my family have made me want to strive in school and have really pushed me to be the goal driven person I am. I try my hardest to do well in school and overall life. I have a lot on my plate and I manage to go to school and work full time. My career is very important to me and I have learned since a child that you must go to school to become successful and that has really helped me to keep going because there are times where I just want to quit because of how overwhelming life can get. But my biggest advice would to take life day by day. Do what you need done today and focus on the the next day later. Because that’s the only way for me to be able to makemyself complete every assignment. All in just keep going and don’t give up.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2806,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""    When it comes to the values of my community and family, I find that both aspects have helped me navigate throughout my education. I am the first out of my family to go to a 4 year college and I find that it comes with a lot of support. My family has always allowed me to express the difficulties I come across through college and from there, they help me lower my stress and pursue my education. I put a lot of pressure on myself to succeed and that is from the values my community and family have instilled in me. Working hard, will lead to a successful future. Practice makes perfect. I have learned to overcome my stress by focusing on those two phrases and working to eliminate any doubt I have about myself pursuing a difficult career (becoming a veterinarian). In particular, my family has taught me to focus on my happiness, which I found through working with animals. I use this happiness as motivation to work hard and get through difficult courses that I come across during the years. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2787,"The values within my community and family that I have carried thusfar, consist of always knowing yourself worth, staying true to your passions, and venture out to explore the world but always keep your cultural roots close to your heart. These values have been just as advantageous in my personal as my professional life. Throughout my 4 semesters in college I have been able to successfully maneuver my courses and not only learn but grasp important information from my science classes. I can honestly say that I have enjoyed my Biology classes and felt that they have influenced my decision of pursing medicine more. I have also involved myself in student organizations that I identify in, which has given me a support system that is pre-dominately females in STEM. Being exposed to this has not only encouraged me to keep pushing for my career goals, but also given me strength to continue pursuing my dreams regardless of gender and background."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2799,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college by instilling that hard work determination, and honesty will get you very far. Everybody has a lot going on in their own life besides school and it was very refreshing for me that my professors thus far at SFSU were very understanding of my situation with my son. I gave birth to him about a month after fall semester 2020 began and all of my professors were kind enough to give me time to recover and bond with my son. They also understood I need a little extra time because of what I had going on then and because I have him with me 24/7. Especially now that he is 19 months old he grows more and more curious, not only that but he wants more of my attention so it is/was nice being able to take exams on my own time. It was also nice being able to remain completely online since his birth so I did not miss any moments with him. Not that I did not have the drive and determination before having him, but I feel it has increased substantially since he was born. So I hope one day he sees and is thankful for all his mama’s hard work and perseverance to stay in college and finish getting my degree."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2801,"The values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college are being hard working, strategic, and giving importance to everything even though it's small. I grew up in Asian household where being lazy is not a thing. You should be always up and ready to work and do things everyday. And being smart is a bonus but strategic is more important. Intelligence will help you with a lot of things but being strategic will help you be successful and have more skills. Also, appreciating what I have in life helps me to have more perspective in life and be successful. It also made me be more inspired in life and work hard more if I want to move forward more and be more successful. i look back in life and I can say that I am on the process of being successful (my standard of successfulness) and I thank my family values for it. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2803,"The values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college in many ways. In my family history, we don't have a lot of scholars. We do, but not as much. Come to think about it we do not have any in medical field and I am the only one. that is why I have a lot of pressure on me. The values that my parents have taught me are like, my grandparents came out from village to the city and brought my parents to the city to have better life, then my parents Brought me to the US for me to have a better life and I do more and then so will the next generation. this is not a value but this is something my parents tell me, it is like leveling up in a game but to have a better life. so I am here, in my 2nd year as a college student going to be in my 3rd year soon, puts me into a lot of pressure. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2792,I’m just having a hard time with this course I don’t wanna give up on this course but I just don’t know how to do the word can I need help with the word I will buy to get help from your professor with my coursework cause I really want to pass the class and I would appreciate if you could help me with that. I want to be successful in this class still so I maybe have to meet with you with I’m your office hours. So I will do whatever it takes to pass this class. So I will do everything in my power to pass this class in the successful discourse I just need a little help from you. Hopefully this will help me the rest of the semester in this class I appreciate all your help and read in my journal. That’s all I wanted to say about that and I really want to pass this class. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2807,"My family is my current anchor and without them I really don’t know what I would do. Ever since I could remember family was always there for me and because of that it’s the most valued thing in my life past, present, and future. I am indeed a family man if I do say myself. My family is still currently helping me reach my goals and guiding me through obstacles. I’m following the family legacy of being part of the medical field. College was a new experience and on top of that it was when covid was at it’s all time high. Attending SFSU while a pandemic was at our hands was scary and confusing because we were so used to the old days where everything was in person and face to face but now online is the new norm. My family helped me be grounded through all of it and for that I thank them."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,703,"As this semester comes to an end I have learned a lot about myself, life, my community, and so much more. I can say that this semester was really hard and that I’m over doing classes over zoom. All though it is convenient for me and it saves me lots of money, I feel like I’m not getting the same education as in person. I also feel like I’m not learning as much as I should be. This is all because of what was going on and all the other stuff I have in my personal life. With that being said I can’t wait to go back in person to hopefully finish up and earn my degree. I’m sure lots of people are feeling the same way but we will not give up. Connecting this to my community I feel that it is important to for me to graduate and show that I made it. I just don’t want to let everyone that believed in me down. So going back to campus and getting back into the retune of being a college student should help me get through this. Lastly, I have learned that everything happens for a reason and that I shouldn’t stress about not knowing what’s next. I hope that in the fall things fall into place and that what I’m going through right now gets solved. I’m also looking forward to new changes and better opportunities once I’m back in SF. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2804,"The values of my community and family helped me navigate through college by providing me with motivation and the drive to succeed. I am very close with my family, and they always make it clear that hard work is the only way to make it in this world and to not give up when times get tough. College has been a rough road, and my family has always been very supportive. The people around me provide me with all the motivation I need and give me guidance when I need it. I come from a family of immigrants, however, so being the first to go to college in America in my family has been tough. Regardless, I am motivated to do well in everything I do, and I would not be here if it was not for my community and the people around me. Doing well in school has always been a family value and I am reminded every single day, so it is only right for me to carry on our family's legacy and to make my family proud. Saying all this, I acknowledge how much pressure I am under and I have doubts often, but the people around me help me get through this."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,354,"My family's values are pretty important to me and have shaped me into the way I approach a successful life and do well in school. Their values of helping me get through college shows their love and support for me and my success. They showed me how to be discipline with my actions rather than look for motivation to get things done. Their values of pushing me to be my best at everything I do and to be a leader not a follower. Being a black woman, the black community helped me navigate through college, I knew I was not alone going through the college life. I knew I had people I can connect and relate to on more than just a physical level, but a mental and emotional level. It motivated me to really want to succeed and seeing all my fellow black peers succeed in their own paths is even better."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2796,"The values of my family helped me navigate through college by reminding me of who I am and what I am in college for. It is constantly reminding me to avoid things that wouldn't cause me any good such as going to parties, cutting classes and more. It made me take my studies seriously and sacrifice my youth instead of having problems later on in the long run. Everyday, it makes me dream bigger and aim for my goals not just for myself but for everyone around me. They motivated me to finish my education for my future family and so that I wouldn't have to go through what they went through. The values they have instilled in me also made me a better person in making friends in college and it also taught me how to get along with everyone. They are a huge part of my success & they are always in my mind whenever I make decisions."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2808,"When my grandfather passed away, his last words to me were ""never give up."" That was in 2006 and I was 18 years old. Since that moment, I used those words to help power me through very tumultuous times. From having to make the decision to leave college in Florida, enlisting in the military, the duration of my military career and now back full circle to finish what I started in 2006. I would say those three words have played a huge role in my development not only in college, but as a person. I consider resiliency to be one of my more admirable traits, and it has come in handy more than a few times. Nothing ever goes as planned, and the ability to diagnose the situation, pivot and weather the storm is a very immeasurable quality during those times. My grandfather might have gone away, but he left me with a gift that ensured my success and the lifestyle I desire for my wife and son. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2805,the values of my family are very important and played a huge role that helped me navigate through college by supporting me and always reminding me why I started and also pushing me to learn and explore. And the college is the best years of life it's not only about school its about the experiment and what you learn. That will guide the rest of your years when you finish your college journey. I feel like this is very important to remember since i would not be bored from school. Instead I would enjoy it to the fullest with the best experience of learning fun and new things in life. Even though I might not use it later in life i will always be happy that I learned something new to keep for myself and for anyone that will ask me. . My community aided me in navigating through collage by providing a welcoming and knowledgeable environment that allowed me to develop and learn more.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,1619,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college because they push me to my greatest. I say that because the values of my family have shaped the way that I think towards my education. They've shaped the way that I think due to the fact that they didn't attend college nor reach their educational goal in life and they have a ton of remorse because of that, which is why they have always been so hard on my siblings and I. They don't want us to commit the same mistakes that they committed, so they have such strong values towards my education which has helped me navigate through college. They always say that school and furthering our education will always get us where we want in life, they say that its worth all the time, effort and struggles because in the end we'll have a successful future. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2810,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?”  The values of my family is what mostly have gotten me to navigate through college as my best self. Working hard, dedication, and motivation are the most important values that I have been taught since I was little and that instilled in me by my family since I can remember. Those three values above are the three pillars to why I’m so successful throughout college because I always remember it when I feel like giving up or not being the best version of myself. What my community has taught me is that growing up in San Francisco I saw many disturbing things that has wanted me to become so much bigger than what those people were doing. Growing up in that environment has definitely pushed me to do so much better in school because I don’t want to become what I grew up seeing. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2811,"I believe that my family and community have helped me navigate through college a lot, they have been my biggest support system and they have been there for me through these three years. Also, my roommate who has been with me has been a huge blessing to me. She has been guiding me through these years on what to do and what not to and what classes to take to benefit my major. Also, becauseof her I have found ,yself being interested in minoring in WGS and gosh can I say it has been the best choice. Being able to have that support system of family na dloved ones have been the best, especially from my fiance being far from home and him and having to do with opposite schedules have been a bit difficult but I appreciate teh support i get frmo him and being ableto see him come visit every two weeks."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2790,"Values of my family have helped me make difficult decisions throughout college. For example, when registering for classes or questioning if I can handle many difficult things at once, I am usually told or remember that my family values hard word and trying your Brest. This makes me feel more comfortable with my decisions because I know that as long as I try my best and apply myself to courses, I should do well. Trying your best is very important because if you don't do so, you might feel regret or anxiety when your grades reflect that you did not try your best. More family values that have guided my through college is the mentality that education is a very important and special thing. It is normal to feel overwhelmed and nervous for assignments and exams but at the end of the day education is extremely important and should be spoken highly of because there are people in the world who do not have access to it and wish that they could be in your position."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,15,My family has helped me navigate through college in a huge way. I mean at the start of college during the application process they have been there to help me complete it figure out any questions that I need answer and pushing my to start adulting so I can figure things out myself as well. They have sent me or motivated me to get involved with extracurriculars or programs here offered on campus to benefit my learning and provide me with my professional experience that they know I can benefit from. During the semesters they have supported me and encouraging me to striving and continuing to be great even when times get hard and obstacles to over come. They also check on my mental health to ensure that I am doing ok and not breaking down because of the stress that college can give sometimes. I really appreciate all the support that they show and give me because without them I would have not made it this far though college.
