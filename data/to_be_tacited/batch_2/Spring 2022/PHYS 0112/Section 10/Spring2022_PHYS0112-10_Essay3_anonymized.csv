2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2797,"What do I do when life gets challenging?Whenever I sense my life begins to be challenging I immediately isolate myself. It's the way I cope when things begin to be rough in my life. Its a good and bad habit, it's good in the sense that I go inward and take a breather but it's also bad because I completely forget about the joy of life its like my whole world's turn to the negative. When life gets challenging I feel as if no one could understand me or the emotions I'm feeling. Which is completely untrue. We as humans go through similar emotions and periods in our lives. I've grown to learn to let their habit go after a couple of days and normally I try and talk to people because I find when I relate to people it helps me out a lot.I also like to schedule out my days and how I'll get back on track and what I would do to move forward and get out of the funk I get into when life becomes challenging"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2795,"When life gets challenging, I think of how I was able to overcome hard times in the past. I know there have been times when I wasn’t able to achieve my goals, but I was able to get through the obstacles I had to overcome. Usually, I also try to reach out to my family and friends that remind me of why I should move forward, and that helps me keep going and even try harder. I also try my best to do everything I can to improve myself and reflect more on what’s happening. Reflecting helps me because I understand my values and who I really want to become, which keeps me going forward. It is also good to take a step back and really analyze what’s bothering me and making it hard for me. However, I also try to distract myself for a little bit, and then go back to what I must do so it doesn’t feel too hard."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2803,"When life gets challenging, I try my best to tackle it down by myself first. I try to see what I can do, to get things done or get things started to end the challenging part or whatever is stressing. If it really gets out of my hands, first I try reaching out to classmates and professors if its a college thing and try to fix it with them, or even my friends and try to see if they can help me. With my personal life challenges, I ask my parents because they are the only ones who knows me the best for now. So, I try to figure it out with them but I don't share everything with them. there is a limit but I haven't lied or hid anything from them. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2799,"What I like to do when life gets challenging is to go back to basics in a sense. I try to think of all the positive things that have happened for me like having my son, my relationship, my extended family with my in laws, my sisters, both of my parents especially my father who is 75 years old! Then, I like so relax and regroup by spending time with them, especially with my son who reminds me of the joy of simpler times. He is truly the light of my life, the biggest blessing and surprise as well. Although being a mother can make certain aspects of my life more challenging, it also can make me think of new creative ways to solve my problems that I would not have thought about before having him. Also life is kind of like watching a baby or toddler learn new things such as walking, so if you do not succeed at first get up and try again until you do."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2790,"When life gets challenging I like to take a break and enjoy nature. I think outdoor nature is one of the most interesting and beautiful things that we have. There are many questions that I have about nature and how the systems of it work so I like to distract myself with that when like gets too stressful. I feel that we live in such a fast-paced world and it is very easy to feeling drowned with work and stress. Nature is one of the best ways to distract yourself from this because it can give people excitement and nostalgia to make them happier. For example, when I hear a mourning dove bird in the mornings, it reminds me of my childhood and summertime. This makes me really happy and is like a stress reliever for me because of how much nostalgia I feel. After I am able to spend some time outside, I feel ready to refocus myself and work on whatever was bothering me earlier. I also like to take down notes of how to address my problem rather than running away from it. I think this is important because it leads to self-improvement after a challenging situation."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,354,"Life definitely has its challenges and obstacles throughout my journey of life and I always have to adapt to these changes in order to move forward. When life gets challenging, I usually give myself some time to process my thoughts and feelings, taking a moment to collect myself. I'll ask for help from an authoritative figure, someone like my mom or dad or even guidance counselors and advisors, depending on the challenge at hand. I make sure to just take one step at a time and trust that I am going to get through and passed this obstacle. I trust that I have guidance around me and I am not alone. I try to ask as many questions as I can until it is fully clear to my understanding. I put my mental health first as well if I start to feel overwhelmed; I'll do something that brings me peace and joy like reading or painting until I have the proper mental strength in overcoming this challenge. Overall, I just take my time and approach the situation what step at a time and have full faith."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2788,"What I do when my life gets challenging is I take a moment to step back and reflect on the most important work. Then I will make a list in order from the due date and slowly knock down each one before the deadline. But what I also do after I've finished with the assignments from that day is find a good show to watch, grab some snacks and watch tv for an hour or two then I will go to sleep because for me sleeping is very important and I need my full nights of rest. What I will also do if i have time is just go out to distract myself a bit from reality because it's not good to stress over things that one day you look back on and think wow i should have not been so stressed. because what does want to work out will work out one way or another."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2808,"When my life gets challenging I like to do two things. The first thing I do is stop to appreciate everything that is going right, the accomplishments I have made and reflect on things that have made me feel successful or a sense of fulfillment. After that, I typically sit down and try to organize and prioritize to eliminate any chaos and create focus on problems at hand. That way I won't get overwhelmed and develop a gameplan to tackle things in a logical order. I have realized that if I don't include these two steps, I can easily place effort into things that won't gain traction, and then feel even more challenged because I lost time. I was in the military for a decade, and this also helped when faced with any operational risk management (ORM). Whenever a threat is perceived we have protocols to help develop a sense of focus and unity."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,1619,"When life gets challenging, I either don't do anything and just let the world keep spinning and tell myself “it is what it is”, or I do plenty of things out of stress, I guess it all depends on the situation. For example, this past year and a half it’s been pretty challenging for me to adapt to online school all thanks to the pandemic, this year has been the worst so far. What I mean by that is that it's just been super stressful and I’ve had a really hard time with my classes. The classes I am currently taking aren't even the ones I wanted to take to begin with. I have the classes I have today because I wasn’t vaccinated and they dropped the other classes that I wanted to take and so I just had to look for classes to fill in the spots of my other classes that were dropped and that was super challenging. It was super overwhelming and I started to freak out because I don’t want to be behind. Literally, all of my classes have been really challenging for me and I would be behind and that would stress me out. At some point during this semester, it got super challenging that I just gave up and just told myself that it doesn’t matter because I’m going to fail anyway, but then I have slowly realized that as long as I try my best then there’s not much I can do. I can literally just do my best and put in a lot of effort and that’s that. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2791,What do I do when life gets challenging?        Like most people at first when things start getting challenging I get frustrated and feel like giving up. However I know that when things get challenging I have my friends and family I can fall back on and they help me get through those hard times and show me how I can over come anything and its all part of life. I take a step back for example if its too much pressure on myself I take time for myself go out spend time outside take a breather and figure out how I can over come theses challenges. another thing is I spend time with my friend and family and get advise from them on what I should do. things that work for me when life is challenging and i'm stressed and feel like everything is going wrong I listen to music it calms me down or I draw. I've learned taking even just an hour or two for yourself can really help instead if trying to get everything done with no breaks. simply because you want things to be perfect and not hard.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,15,"When life gets challenging, I take a moment with myself to think and come up with a strategic plan of how to move forward. I also consider all the things I am thankful for in that moment to motivate me to keep pushing. I never try to embed the ""quit"" mindset because I don't want to give up on my self and the people supporting me as well. In life nothing is easy as I have learned from growing up and get older. I have stumbled across many obstacles, barriers, and tribulations but I keep going. I'll take it step by step, moment by moment until I overcome what is in front of me at that time. It does take a lot within me to make that happen but I know things will pay off in due time that what keeps me going as well. I can either give up or keep trying but no matter the case time still keeps going on which makes me not want to lose the position that I am in."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2796,"When life becomes challenging, I take a minute to step back and reflect on the things that I should be thankful for. Whenever we are struggling, we tend to focus on things that we cannot accomplish so I think it is important for us to be reminded of the things that we are taking for granted sometimes. We should appreciate what we have and what we have done so far because more often than not, there are people who are wishing to be on the same spot that you are at right now. We also fail to recall most of the time but this is where we wished to be at some point in our life when we were just starting to dream. Everyone needs to rest and have a little bit of time to pamper themselves and it is not a bad thing to pause everything for a quick moment when it is becoming overwhelming. This is what I do everytime and afterwards, it gives me more energy to cheer up and to carry on with my life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2798,"When my life get challenging, I try to find the solution and I try to fix the problems.

2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,703,"Often times life does get challenging for everyone. sometimes it happens more than what it should. The things that I do when my life gets challenging is to take a couple days off to reflex what I’m doing and how to change it. Most of the time when my life does get hard/ challenging is because of school, work, family, and other things too. School does get changeling because of the workload or either trying to balance a health life and school schedule. At this point of the semester, we know how the rest of the semester is going to be like. But it’ll still get harder if I don’t focus and that’s something that I am working on right now. I also work a full-time job and it does get hard trying to stay motivated one thing. My life either consist of working or doing schoolwork. So when that gets overwhelming I try to wait to the weekend so I can rest up and catch up on my homework. Other than that, I try to stay calm and live my life. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2809,"There have been many times in my life that felt challenging. A lot of times I can get overwhelmed and lose motivation. At times, I even feel like giving up, but these are just short moments of doubt and fear. With or without help from my boyfriend, my family, my pets, and other sources of happiness in my life, I manage to find that motivation once again. I think about my future, my career, and how I want the rest of my life to be. That alone is enough to get me back up on my feet. Oftentimes, my boyfriend reminds me of my worth and my capabilities. This always gives me so much hope and faith in myself. Another thing I like to do during challenging times is to let my emotions out, in a healthy and safe way – like crying or singing. This often helps me feel better, though in different ways."

Also I try to think of positive things in my life to make me happy. Also I tried to listen to music or do things to take my mind off of challenging activities. I want to have as much fun as possible and I watch a lot of motivational videos and a lot of Kobe Bryant videos because he’s great at dealing with challenges. Very important to attack the challenge at hand and not get defeated when you don’t achieve it the first time. I believe challenges won’t be challenges forever so once I get through the challenge is no longer a challenge for me in my life so that’s how I deal with challenges. I have Great companies in myself to deal with all the challenges in my life and that are in the future.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2787,"When life gets challenging for me depending on how severe the situation is and the likely consequences, I approach it differently. If I have to solve something on my own, at times it takes me longer to figure things out or I end up not being able to get through it because I don't have the guidance to push me in the right direction. When I have the support and resources to find answers or am experiencing challenges, I am able to solve problems in a timely manner and come up with solutions faster. I am a pretty independent person and always try to first figure it out on my own before I seek help, but once a situation escalates I will look for support elsewhere. There have been times when I just couldn't solve the issue and just gave up. These beliefs mainly apply to my academic life because in my personal life it's a whole new reality, and this is where young adults are expected to learn on their own and know how things work. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2806,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?""    When I find that I am dealing with issues that make my life challenging, I step back and think. I think about what exactly is causing me the stress I am experiencing and what I can do to stop it. If it is something regarding schoolwork, I give myself a 20 minute break to regroup and recognize my emotions and learn to deal with them in a positive way. Sometimes, I will take a meditation break, or talk to a family member or friend to help me get out of the state I am in. Most times, I just breathe. I turn off my phone and laptop, go to a quiet space in my house, and listen to my breathing. I do this to try to lower my heart rate to avoid having a panic attack regarding the issues I am dealing with, because it happens a lot. I found these techniques to be very helpful and I hope that others can learn to find ways to cope when life gets challenging. Therefore, it is important to know yourself and know what can calm you do when it feels like the world is closing in on you. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2801,"What I do when life is challenging is go out for a drive. I will drive and listen to music to forget all the problems I have and relax my mind. Then usually go to twin peaks at night and just enjoy the view for a bit. After I calm my mind and self, I will start thinking how to fix my problems. I will start planning how to make an action to make my life relaxing and not challenging anymore. I find solutions, and when there's a time that I can't, I talk to my family and friends to ask for some help. Talking to someone helps even though they don't give you advice but just be there to listen and understand where you are coming from and why you need them. I sometimes binge watch a show or play guitar to ease my mind so I can think straight after I encounter a challenging day in my life. These are the most things I do when life is challenging and too stressful. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2802,"The way I handle life when it gets challenging is something that is a work in progress for me. More often than not challenges make me overwhelmed at first. One thing that I am trying to work on is being more proactive about challenges that I may face along the way. I've learned to not be scared of asking questions. I used to be the person who would be afraid of asking questions. Now I like asking questions, because there is no point in struggling and going through challenges when I can ask questions to get more clarity. Asking questions has become fun for me since I know I'm going to learn more. I used to feel like a fool when asking questions, but now I feel excited to get my questions answered, gain knowledge, and interact with my classmates and professors. I've also learned to work harder rather than get defeated by the challenges. I try to find new ways to overcome the challenge by using different color pens for my notes, making flashcards, watching youtube videos on concepts that I'm having trouble understanding, and going to office hours with particular questions."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2804,"When life gets challenging I tend to look to others. Talking with friends and family helps calm me and reminds me why I am where I am. When my motivation falters, talking with others helps reinforce and strengthen my resolve when it comes to staying strong. I also like to write down my thoughts either on paper or on my phone, like why am I still doing this, why I am living the way I am living. It helps put into perspective how my life is going and what I can do to improve it. I have built a support system of people willing to help, and they always help me find a way to improve how I live. When I get free time, I use it to do the things I love doing, like playing games, eating food with loved ones, and playing guitar. Distracting myself from certain things does help with my motivation and drive, and when life gets tough, I do what I can to prepare myself and look forward to the next day."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2805,"When life gets challenging, first thing i try to do is go and take a break simply  not to think of any work or assignments or anything that makes me stress. After a couple of hours I try to look back on what went wrong and how I can change it. Eventually i end up tidying up my room, going for a walk and just simply try not to stress about anything as much as possible. If nothing works I try to talk to someone i feel safe opening up to for example my mom. She really helps guide me through everything and the thing I need right now is good advice. Another way is organizing everything all over again and try your best to be organized all the time. Sometimes i find myself escaping those challenges by reading books, it makes forget about the problem and it gives me time to calm down and thing right on how to solve the problem."
