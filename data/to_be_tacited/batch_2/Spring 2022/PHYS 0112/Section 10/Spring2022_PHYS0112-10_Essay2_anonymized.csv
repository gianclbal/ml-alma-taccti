2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2809,"My goal for this semester is to get straight As and continue to be on the Dean’s list. My goal for the year is to focus on my studies, receive excellent grades while continuing to do volunteer work, maybe find a job? I’m not sure yet. That might be something I need to figure out actually. I don’t know if I’m graduating this year, most likely not. I just have so many more classes to take. Why? Because I want to go to medical school. The prerequisite courses and required volunteering and shadowing is a lot for anyone, but if I stay focused and motivated, I’m determined to achieve what I want and that is to become a physician. This class is helping me achieve these goals by teaching me the fundamentals of natural science. By learning how the universe works, I will be able to deal with any encounter that may be thrown at me. As for the field of medicine, I see physics as a significant aspect in learning today’s new technological advances that make medicine what it is today."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2804,"My goals are to graduate college in a year and to go to professional school, but I am not sure of yet what specifically. This class is helping me graduate sooner, being a major requirement and a STEM class that will help me choose my field of work. I have a lot of classes left to take over the next year, and physics is another step along the way. Even though prerequisites are seen as useless by most, I feel like physics will be productive and will help me, specifically with my understanding of life and the world around me. Playing sports and lifting weights are also things I participate in where physics can help me, as things like leverages and optimal positionings are all very important. A lot of the math used will also be useful, as I know that math will be a part of my life forever. Physics is also engaging and mentally stimulating, something I love with classes."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,1815,"Had this question been asked a year ago or even months back my answer would be different. But as of right now my goal is just to pass this class and get my bachelor's degree and pass this class so I don’t have to retake it again. I do have other goals but I need to complete one in order for the others to come into play. If and when I do finally obtain my bachelor's degree my goal is to either attend physician's assistant school or maybe even medical school if I decide to do that. My goals for these next two coming weeks are to catch up on some school work that I've missed and some that I didn’t even know I was supposed to be doing. My goal is also to catch up on some sleep, but unfortunately one of the two will have to be sacrificed. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2801,"My goals for this week is to study as I have 2 exams coming up, finish my homework as soon as I can (a day early if possible), and organize my notes for all my classes. This week is so stressful for me because at my work we are also busy because of the Chinese New Year this weekend. I want to finish all my errands, school work, and tasks (home and work). This class is helping me achieve my goals because it is teaching me to have better time management as we have class every friday and I am being disciplined by that (not being lazy or just being on the phone on friday mornings). Also, the activities, groupworks, and homeworks help me to communicate with peers better and not to have fear of asking questions about something I don’t know or understand. It is just not teaching me life lessons (being disciplined and time management) but also about understanding how the world works. For this lab, we are going to learn about adding vectors, forces, and magnitude. It is going to be fun learning how simply walking, pulling, and skiing has physics. I am looking forward to this lab this week."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,703,"I have many goals in life not just in education. For started, yes, I do want to earn my college degree and this class will help by meeting the requirements for my education. As for this class, I want to understand physics not just because its a class I have ti take but I really want to learn what this is about. The first few weeks were okay but know I need to step it up to learn and put more effort in. After graduating San Francisco State I would like to get my masters for either nursing or physicians assistant. my dream has always been ti work in the health care setting and this the path that I am in right now. Besides that I would love to accomplish many other things to live a happy and healthy life. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2796,"One of my goals include being able to get into the medical field. If the opportunity permits, I would like to pursue being a doctor. I am also interested in becoming an anesthesiologist. I think this class is helpful to me in achieving my goals because I believe the topics it carries are key essentials in our everyday lives. It might look complex from another point of view but once we get into the lessons step by step then it will make much more sense and it will be more easier for me to understand and comprehend. I think the labs are also helpful because the stimulation it gives provides more clarity on the topic. There are times when the word problems are hard to convert into equations but these type of activity makes it clearer for us on what to work on just like in real life if we look into a broader way."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,1619,"I have many goals in life if I’m being quite honest, but I can say that one of my top goals out of the handful that I have would have to be getting my dream job and get accepted to the medical school that I want to get into. I really do hope that I become what I’ve been dreaming of for several years already. Getting into medical school would be a huge step into what I want to be in life and what career I’ve been pursuing. I really do hope that I become a pediatric oncologist. The only way that this class is “helping” me achieve this goal is only because I have to take it, it’s literally just a miniature step. It’s not that I want to take this class because physics fascinates me, it's quite the opposite. This is what I have to take for my major in order to keep moving forward."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2802,"My academic goals are to earn my bachelor's degree in Kinesiology Exercise and Movement, and to apply to the Doctor of Physical Therapy Program. In order to obtain my bachelor's degree, it is a requirement to take this class. Passing this class will help me be one step closer to graduating with my bachelor's degree and being able to apply to the DPT program. However, this class is more than just a prerequisite to me. Understanding the concepts like velocity, vectors, acceleration, and velocity will help me understand movement from a physics perspective. Outside of academics, this class helps me with my biggest passion which is dancing. Thinking about the concepts of acceleration, velocity, and force when I am waving and popping help me explore my movement through a physics lense that opens more creativity. When I am freestyling, I can play around with the different force levels when I'm popping, and playing with the different velocities of a wave while also exploring acceleration through dance."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2807,My current goals for this class will always be the same and that would be to absorb as much knowledge as possible so that I can be a better scientist and also be prepared for life’s challenges that awaits for me. I know that I’m still young and all but I feel that this goal will provide me enough confidence to be able to tackle everything I will face later on. This class is helping me achieve these goals by giving me information that I still have yet to know. I haven’t taken physics in high school so this is new to me and I know that it’ll better myself. My current thoughts I would say is that will the overwhelming assignments be necessary because I feel like I’m getting stressed out too many times when I work on lab/lecture. It’s an overboard event each time. I know that it’s online and it usually takes a while because it’s physics but I really need things to be a bit more ease/lenient.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2800,"My goals are to have an A in my classes and graduate with honors. This class is helping to achieve the career I want in the future. Not just helping but it is one of the important classes that I should be taking. My goals are changing or modified depending on what I’m experiencing presently. Maybe add more goals or remove something either it is already accomplished or I am not able to fulfill it. However, I am trying my best to fulfill every goal that I have, maybe not that quick since it takes time and effort. I would say that goals are a way to keep things forward and to look back at what I should be doing with my life and why I am determined and persistent. Moreover, this class is not just to help me to get a career in life but it is also to learn and to understand how physics are related in life or nature."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2793,"My goals right now as they relate to school are mainly to keep up with my schoolwork, pass my classes, and overall to get through college. In terms of keeping up with schoolwork, this class doesn't help all too much in that regard. I have a lot of homework, mainly because the classes I chose to take this semester assign so much homework, more than I was expecting. I am however, glad that this class forces homework to be due on the same day the lab is. This reduces the amount of time I can procrastinate for those assignments because I obviously have to turn them in on the same day. I myself have to work toward passing my classes, but this class is helping me get through college because It's one of the classes I need to take as a part of my major. If I didn't take this class, I would probably have taken the alternate form that incorporates calculus."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2808,"My goal is to receive my BS in Electrical Engineering so I can have a higher salary ceiling when I re-enter the work force. Through my previous job in the Navy, I realized I actually had talent in and enjoyed physics and engineering. This course helps reiterate a lot of the basics I will use later on, or that I will have to reference further on in both my education and my career. It can also help solve a lot of problems in your everyday life if you're a very hands on individual. I typically like to pick up projects (or at least think about projects because I day dream) so it will also assist in answering some real world instances, as well. And that will help me look like a better dad, which is my favorite goal I want to achieve. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2791,What are my goals ? How is this class helping me achieve theses goals?       My Goals ? Thinking of this class would be wanting to simply pass this course and try to learn anything I can and to not be too stressed during this course. My goals are to try and turn in everything in time and make a schedule for myself to get my assignments done. However my goals for other things in life are to graduate and go into my future job and get a good house and simply good future job and get into vet school. This class can help me achieve theses goals because they way the scheduling is will help me stay on top of things.The blogs really help me as well it can get me to start doing blogs on my own and write what I do everyday and that will help me get my things done.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2787,"My goals for this semester are to be able to understand the material and know how to work through it. This class will help me through this by providing visuals, examples, etc. to give an idea of how to work through certain problems. Given that Physics is a hard class with difficult information that will be covered I want to be able to do well and also grasp the concepts easily. I am a visual learner so I feel that if professors work through problems then that will help me a lot more. Considering this class also applies calculus and other math topics into class work, a refresher would be nice, or if equations and formulas are introduced then breaking them down would help. Also, it would be appreciated if the class could go in a steady flow, not too fast, so the more tedious information could be grasped into my brain. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2792,So for this class has been a little difficult for me especially when we go into our breakout rooms because there isn’t a lot of dialogue from my peers on it and I’m having some trouble with the word and I also emailed you about the situation I had about my labs because I wasn’t able to do it them because my auntie passed and you never responded and I felt some type of way about that. Because it made me feel like you didn’t care about what I had going on. But the semester is far from over so I’m just gonna continue to keep going for it with this class and hopefully you give me a chance to finish my labs because I still haven’t got a response from you on whether or not I can turn in my last couple labs so I will be very grateful if you let me turn in my labs please and thank you. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2790,"My goals are to do well in school and eventually apply to a physician assistant school. These schools are known to be rather competitive so balancing school and extracurricular activities can be challenging. I enjoy courses like these because there are many real life concepts involved in physics that I would not even think of. This class is helping me understand more realistic concepts and understanding that many things are interconnected. My goals for this class specifically are to score well on quizzes and assignments and earn a good grade while preparing for my next physics course. I like to think of all my courses as important stepping stones to my final goal so I like to enjoy the journey that I am on. I can't wait for more concepts and physics related ideas that I can apply to my life even more. So far, the best thing about this class is learning a topic and then realizing that I have been applying this physics topics my whole life without knowing."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2806,"A goal that can be achieved in this class is to understand how I can use velocity in everyday life. The average velocity is defined as displacement divided by time interval, being the speed in a particular direction. This idea is used in a lot of different ways, especially when it comes to things like driving a car, running around the block, etc. For example, with a car traveling at a distance of 70m to the North, in 5.0 seconds, we can use the average velocity formula that this class has taught me to solve. The formula is delta distance/delta time, therefore plugging in (70m) for delta distance and (5s) for delta time, we would get to our answer of 14 m/s North. This concept can be used in other ways besides driving a car. The phrases can be switched to demonstrate a person walking, a plane flying, etc. This class has helped me achieve the goal of understanding velocity throughout all the examples that Professor Hossain includes in her lectures, that can be applied to daily life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2810,"My goals for my life is to graduate undergraduate and then go to medical school hopefully at Stanford, my dream school. After that I want to go into residency and then finish that and in the end be the heart surgeon I've always dreamed of being. This class is helping me with that dream and goals because it is a part of what I need to finish undergrad and it is mandatory so that's how it is helping me with with my goals. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2803,"I have a long lists of goals. Growing up as the only child I have a lot of responsibility on me. My main goal is to complete college with Bachelors Degree in Science and also complete my masters in Physician Assistant. My other goal is to make money and be able to buy a house for myself and my parents. I also want to be able to make my parents happy in future and let them retire as soon as they can and as soon as I can afford to make a living for myself and my family. If I pass this class, this will help me have a higher gpa or maintain my gpa and I will move forward with a better grade. talking specifically, I am not sure if this class will help me in real life to achieve my goals other than passing it with good grades and being a good student. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2805,"There are always new goals that i set everyday when coming to class but my top goals for this class is keeping up with my work, making sure I understand what i'm doing in class, engaging with my group so that we help and support each other so that we learn and also share our thoughts with each other lastly of course my top goal is to get an A+ in this class this, it is  ultimate goal for the semester and i'm sure i can do it i i put in the effort. This class helps me achieve my goals when we go over the slides in the beginning of class, since its simple and very easy to understand and the way the sides are set just makes everything better to understand, and also going into breakout rooms to discuss the assignment helps a lot. Another way i can achieve my goals is when i ask my professor the question in my mind just makes it easier to understand when you missed something or do not get it at all."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2799,"My goals are to finish college with a Bachelor's Degree of Science in Physiology and or Nursing. Then, to pass the NCLEX exam so I may become a Registered Nurse and I would like to work in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit or Pediatrics. I would also like to further my education to at least a Masters Degree possibly in Nursing or Nursing Education. Besides finishing my education and entering my chosen career, I would like to save enough money to buy a home for me and my son. I believe a home is not only essential for my family to live in, but for it to grow as well. This class could help me achieve my goals by showing me the physics behind motions we make with our bodies in the healthcare setting and the physics behind how we are able to hear and interpret sound. A majority of people do not realize how physics plays into our everyday life from how we are able to walk, run, jump to how a mother and son are able hear one another while they are talking."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2795,"My main goal is to pursue an MD/PHD because I love science and biology. This class is helping me achieve my goals because physics is a major subject for understanding complex medical topics. Physics will allow me to use medical practices and technologies, such as X-rays, medical imaging procedures such as Doppler ultrasound, echocardiography, MRI and the operation of ventilator machines. It is also helping me prepare for essential steps towards medical school, like the MCAT and the rigorous courses. If I don't understand physics topics I am most likely to have a hard time later on. Finally, my major career goal in the future as an MD/PHD is to become an Intensive Care Unit Doctor, so while I find this class hard, I am learning to maintain a balanced, organized and stable pace to complete all my responsibilities on time and successfully. This class is helping me grow academically and as an individual to reach a better version of myself. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,15,"My goals are to become either a Sports Medicine Physician or a Sports Orthopedic Surgeon for a professional Sports team. This class is helping me achieve these goals by preparing me for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). The MCAT is a test that all students pursing to enter medical school must take, it gives the medical schools and admission office an understanding check to determine whether you can handle the rigorous courses that come with medical school. A part of the process before taking the MCAT is completing the medical school pre-requisites courses including General Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Organic Chemistry as well as Biochemistry. Notice that General Physics is a subject that is required for medical school and a subject on the test that I will take. Therefore, this class is helping me develop the understanding of these concepts that I will be tested on soon so I can achieve my goals."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2789,"My Goals in life are not defined yet, I do have short term goals. My main goal is to graduate with a good GPA so I can later apply to graduate school. My plan involves going into research soon and learning physics is a valuable skill to learn. Also, with all the assignments that this class involves, I am forced to organize myself better and anticipate the unexpected. Sometimes, in this class, the assignments are not available at the beginning of the week. That helps me become more flexible with my scheduling and more efficient when working on my homework. If I only dedicate time at the beginning of the week to do my assignments, then I wouldn’t be able to adapt for unexpected assignments. Life will be like that, life will throw me curve balls and I will have to adapt quickly to the change. Also, vectors will come handy in my life because I will become better at navigating. I depend too much on GPS and I have no skills for navigating without it."
