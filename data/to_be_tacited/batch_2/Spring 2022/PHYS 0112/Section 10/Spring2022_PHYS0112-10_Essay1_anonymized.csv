Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2210,"Why am I here, this is the prompt at hand. This can be referenced to many things. I would say I am here to learn and broaden the knowledge in my brain. Why am I in school, I am here to be able to make a career for myself. I what to strive against my adversities and make a proud path for not only me, but for my family as well.  I would like to learn as much as I can, to be knowledgeable. Why am I here, In this class? I am here in this class for many reasons. The main reason is that it is a requirement for my major. I do enjoy this type of physics lab because it is hands on and immersive. I do like that we can be in groups and are able to get to know new people. I also like that we have the same groups so that way it doesn’t make too many new collaborations awkward. I am here for the purpose to better my future."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2787,"I am here because I chose to be. I like to believe I have a say in my life choices and that others don't pressure me into anything. I hope to make the best possible decisions for myself, keeping my best interest at heart. I also want to succeed in the goals I have set for myself career-wise. I want to make myself proud and be all the things I wish to be. Being in this class, I feel one step closer towards my path. Even if I do encounter challenges and struggles, I always persevere and push through. Throughout my college experience I have consistently put myself at high standards to have high outcomes. And til this day I haven't let myself down and I intend to keep striving for the best. This doesn't mean that I don't ask for help when confused or have questions. I always seek help when necessary. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2788,"The main reason I am in physics class is because it is one of the courses I have to take in order to graduate. But to make light of it, I think this class is important to understand the basics of physics since it does affect our daily lives. Even though I don't think I will use it in any other classes, it is still pretty good to be knowledgeable on this topic.And it's not like it's really causing anyone any harm knowing this information, if anything it would just help better understand the world and ourselves. Which is very important to be aware of your surroundings. So far this class has already shown me some interesting things. Like how when on a plain the wind will cause you to go diagonally towards your destination because of the wind currant. Which I think is really cool and next time I go on a plane I am going to pay attention to where we are pointed to. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2784,It is week two of classes at this new school. I am starting to get the hang of it but we were told that in person classes will resume. I am not looking forward to it as the virus is still a huge fear for this country but it seems that other motives carry decisions about opening this up in this country rather than health. I am still waiting to enroll into this lab to get full credit for this class and hope to hear something soon.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2789,"I am here because I want to learn and get a degree in higher education. I am a chemistry major because I think molecules are fun and challenging to study. I am a transfer student, and many of my credits didn't transfer. I was depressed after finding this out and took two gap years. After a long time of reflecting, I realized that retail jobs are not for me, and they would never satisfy my natural curiosity. I see chemistry as the physics of molecules. I think they don't obey physics laws like objects at our scale do; likewise, planets follow slightly different physical phenomena because their magnitude is significantly more prominent than humans. I think physics at a human scale is very challenging. That's why I am here to absorb all the knowledge I can humbly acquire. I might be getting ahead of myself. But my expectation for this class is to grow wiser. I am willing to put in the work to accomplish this goal."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,682,"People spend their whole lives finding their purpose in life. Some look and don't even know what they're looking for, some just want to be happy. But whether what you're looking for is hope or love we spend our whole lives searching for both. For me I don't know why i'm here on Earth I'm not sure if i ever will. But I know in one word that my life is abnormal right now and that's the way I like it. But people are forgetting who took them here in the first place.God. Now these days people mostly forget him because some tragedy hit them but the thing is that's life. When you lose someone that you love you think why is this happening to me how could god do such a thing. The reason why is simply it was there time to go. People don't live forever and if immortality is the life you want then you seriously take god and life for granted. God gave us one life, one self, one family to hate or love. You choose. We should be able to appreciate what he's done for us. Plenty o us take everything for granted i know i do everyday. We just need to remember why God is here. We need to wake up and open our eyes and see what we are supposed to see."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2790,"I am here because I would love to learn more about physics and it is apart of my degree requirement. My biggest career goal is to become a physician assistant and it is a journey that I am very happy to be on. While I do tend to get stressed over these large dreams of mine, I think it is important to take it day by day and enjoy all the classes that are required for me to become one. I genuinely do enjoy physics because it is apart of space and our universe. I have always loved space but never felt that I was capable of understanding complex things about it. I think this course will give me more insight to things like gravity, weight, ect. I get very excited when I hear about how some people devout their lives to physics and astronomy in order to learn about our universe since so much of it is undiscovered. Overall, I am very excited to be here and tankful for the educational opportunities that I have. Every class I take has value to me because I know some people do not have access to education and I am beyond lucky to be in the position where I can take fascinating classes like physics and fulfill academic requirements for me to pursue my career. I am more than happy to be here and very excited for all the things I will learn in lab and lecture."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2791,"Why am I here? Meaning in school , I would say to get the education my parents couldn't and not only that but to make my dream job a reality. Ever since I was little I have loved animals and I wish to work with animals in the future. I am majoring in zoology, animal science and I am hoping after university I will go into a vet school and try to become a vet. Why am I here thinking about that question as in life, I would tell myself I am here to ty to make a difference , try get the education that my parents couldn't and try to make the proud. I am here to help people when they need me my family and friends and anyone who needs help. I am here to help animals when I grow up whether I become a vet or not, or I become anything that has to do with animals. I am here to help my parents in the future when they can no longer work as a thank you for taking care of me and always being there for me. That is why I am here I would say."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2792,Why am I here? I am here because I want to be one of the people in my family to graduate from a university. I’m also here because I want to learn more about physics and how they apply to my everyday life because when you learn things you want to know that the things you are learning can help you with the rest of your life. I believe that this class will help me do that because I believe the Professor I have has the ability to get the best out of her students and also she wants to see all her students do good work and pass the class. I want to be successful in this class so I will do the necessary things in order to be successful in this class. I I know this class will be easy but I am ready for the challenge to further my education and that’s why I believe why I am here.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2793,"This is a very open ended question that I'm not so sure about, so I'm just going to answer it in terms of why am I here at college and why am I here in this class. As for why I'm in this class, it's a requirement for my major, biochemistry. After this I'm going to have to take the next physics level after this one as well. I don't really enjoy physics, but I have to do it for the credit. As for why I'm in college, I'm not really sure. I actually wasn't planning on attending a 4-year college until the last minute in high school when one of our projects in English class was to answer UC prompts. Suddenly my plans shifted from attending community college to applying to and attending a 4-year. I would say I'm here for the experience of college, though the college experience we're all currently having isn't really the one I was expecting because of covid."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2794,"""Why am I here"" this is a question that people ask themselves about all the time. But I don't think anyone knows why they are truly here. We may be here just to have a fun time, or we may be here to save others. The question is very ambiguous and people can interpret it in many different ways. I think we are here to enjoy life. You should live it however you feel right. If you enjoy doing something that other people don't, go ahead do what you like. You shouldn't let other people's ideas influence your life. I enjoy playing games so that's what I spend most of my time doing. Of course, doing nothing but what you enjoy isn't good for you. YOu need to balance what you do to a moderate amount. People don't need a purpose to be born. Just do whatever you enjoy and live life to the fullest"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2795,"I am here in this class because I want to become an Intensive Care Unit Doctor, and I would like to learn physics to understand future courses. I also want to be able to succeed academically to make my family proud and be a role model for my siblings. Learning about science and physics has been my passion for a long time, which is the reason why I have chosen to pursue a career in medicine. Since a young age I have become fascinated by the way the world works around me and how we can test and get certain values to explain why everything happens around us. My goal is also to become a good mentor, so I am here to learn about physics and become a good leader and guidance for future peers in the future. As a Latina woman in STEM, I am also here to represent as a Salvadoran student and succeed in achieving my goals. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,15,"I am here because of my determination to further my education and become successful. I am majoring in kinesiology obtaining both my Bachelor's and Master's degree. With my degree I am looking to pursue a career in medicine. In specific, I want to become a Sports Medicine Physician for a professional team. That career is a process and does require some steps to achieve that. It starts with earning a bachelors degree around the field of science and then applying to medical school. There are certain amount of requirements to be accepted into Medical school. One of them being the pre-medical pre requisites that all students must complete. Apart of the pre-medical pre requisites is completing the general physics course with lab component and the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). Being present taking this class will help my understanding of the concept physics so I can use this information later to prepare and study for my MCAT down the line."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2796,"I think my purpose of being in this class is to be more mindful of how things and life works. Everyday, we tend to overlook the nature of life and take for granted the things that we are able to experience now. I also believe that this class is essential to my path in achieving my career which is to become a doctor. I am also very thankful to my parents for helping me in little ways that I need especially when I am left with no time to do things that matters to me. They are the ones who provide me food, shelter and confidence in every challenge that I face. There are days wherein I am breaking down due to the amount of tasks that I need to accomplish but they never fail to make me feel better. I think they are the huge reason of why I am trying and working hard to finish college since it is one of their wish for me. I am a first generation college student and I want to make them proud of me no matter how hard the journey will be. I'm sure there will be more struggles that I will face but as long as I keep my head straight to my goal and be more determined everyday, then I am already right on track."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2797,Reflective JournalingWhy am I here?I believe I'm here for a reason.I genuinely believe we all have a purpose to live and experience life.We decide our fate and purpose ourselves through growing and developing into our unique shelves.For me in particular i believe i'm here to guide and heal.I've always had a passion for entertaining and expressing my emotions through things.While doing so i believe that my passion and excitement for things heals people.Im a huge listeners so i use experiences and encounters i have had with people to aid my “purpose”.I don't necessarily believe that i'm here to be a doctor or a engineer i believe it's more deeper than that.life is a sequence of up and downs and each of there cycles helps us figure out why were here.This is a major indication as to why i know personally i am not here to just live in the matrix survive off a 9-5 and then simply die.I know that my impact on this world will be great and will guide others in there human experience.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2798,"I am here to study physics and learn a lot of physics concepts. And also, I want to get a clear explanation from the instructor. I have never learned physics before but I hope that I can understand the concept in this class. I also want to learn more about how physics connects to the real world. Especially how this class gives me benefits for future use. I really want to know more about how physics connects to the world.  I also want to know how many kinds of math we have to use in physics . I want to learn physics clearly and it is an interesting subject to learn. In physics , there are a lot of interesting laws and topics and many people say that physics is not that difficult. So, I want to learn a lot more in this class. Also i hope that it will not be that difficult for me. I hope that i can understand clearly what we learned in the class.    "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2799,"Why am I here could be asked for many situations in life , however as for physics and for myself it is to get a better understanding on physics and the mechanics behind it really do play a role in everyday life whether we know it or not. People always tend to think of physics as being this complex thing that helps to complicated things like a plane flying through the air, while yes physics can have complexities to it, it is actually a part of our everyday lives with simple things as well such as walking to the refrigerator or driving a car. So, it will be interesting and eye opening to see just how much physics is around us everyday. Also yo learn how it works on the basic level, as well as the more in depth level of the more complex aspects of things and life. Having this understanding will allow me to have a better knowledge on how things work and why they work or why planes are able to stay in the sky for example."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2800,"I always try to answer that question whenever I’m lost or get overwhelmed by the schoolwork. There are times where I give up and my body is exhausted because of the structure of online classes, then switching to in-person and balancing studies and work. However, I go back to the reasons or my purpose why I am studying and what my goals are. I didn’t take physics class seriously back in high school and now that I’m in college I’m trying to learn as much as I could and possibly apply it in real life and contribute to my career in the future. Learning lessons for a short amount of time is very hectic and exhausting but along the way, with the support of professors and advisors this makes the semester at ease.  I would say that I’m here to get a deeper understanding of how physics is very important in our lives and we can see this in real life unconsciously.."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2801,"This question has a lot of answers in my head right now. I am in this class as this is one of the required classes for my major which is Biology concentration in Physiology. I am here because I also want to learn about physics. I am not really good at physics but when I set my mind on learning something, I give time and effort to learn and gain knowledge about it. I am still here and didn’t drop the class because I am looking forward to learning physics this semester and my peers are really nice. I’m looking forward to working with them this semester. I am also here because I want to graduate and in order to do that I need to take this class even though I am not strong in this field. I will work hard and give my best not just to pass but learn and apply physics in life"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,703,The reason I am here is for many reasons. For starters I love to study and this class is meant to be a requirement for my biology degree. so far I am liking this class and the work environment is going good for me. I really appreciate that everything is very organized and its up to me to keep up with the work load. At times it does get difficult to catch up with all the work because I also work a full time job so it harder on my end. The next reason I am here is because I want to earn my degree and work at a job I love so that one day I can take care of my parents. Like I said I am working a full time job and that is not what I want to do for the rest of my life. I stay motivated by reminding myself of that and working hard for my dreams. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2802,"I am taking this course, because it is a prerequisite for obtaining my degree in Kinesiology. The material that I learn in this lab class will not only help me in my Kinesiology career, but it will also help me comprehend the world around me and how it operates from a physics approach. I can take the knowledge I am learning on this topic and apply it to real life situations. This will allow me to gain a deeper understanding about how things I do in the real-world operate from a scientific perspective. Being in this lab also provides me with a better understanding of the material that I learned in the physics lecture portion of this lab course. During lecture I was a little confused on the position and velocity material. After working on the lab, it helped me understand the topics more. Since I am working towards a Kinesiology degree, learning about position and velocity will help me when I am working in my field with movement and exercises. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2803,"My main reason to be here is because of my degree requirement. My other reasons are because I want to learn new things. Especially Physics is not my thing but I will try my best to focus and get a good grade. something that really caught my eyes for this class is that it could be applied in real life. not only gravity because whenever physics is brought up people talk about gravity but there is a lot more into it than just that and people should be talking about more things not just gravity. I am here to learn new things and get more knowledge beyond my ability. I am here to learn calculations. I am here to learn how motion, acceleration, forces, newtons law etc. hopefully I will be able to keep all the things I learn in my mind as I get older as well. I am also here to meet new people even though it is online, sadly... "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2804,"I am here because of many things. I knew that I would go to college to expand my knowledge, and I loved taking science classes growing up. I initially wanted to do nursing but then I switched out to biology. I have also transferred from another university, as I thought it was not a good fit. My family has been supportive for the most part, just pushing me to strive for better and not to settle. I live an hour away from San Francisco State, and I have always loved the city since I have lived there for a few years, and I have friends in the area so I knew my choice of school was clear. I have done pretty well in school so far, as I have reworked how I have studied as the years went on and I have been successful. Making friends is something I do not find hard, and I love doing it as it makes school a lot more enjoyable and has actually helped me academically. Study groups, problem-solving, and collaboration are things I have learned and experienced in college, helping me get to where I am today."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,1619,"Why am I here? That’s a pretty broad question, but I’ll simply narrow it down by changing it to why am I here taking this class. I’m here taking this class because I have to for my major. This class is a prerequisite for my current major and in order for me to keep moving forward with my major then I have to take certain classes, even some that I absolutely have no interest in, for example, this class. I have never liked physics. The first year and last year I took physics was my freshman year in high school, I absolutely hated it. The topics that were taught just never caught my attention, I always thought it was tedious and a waste of time if I'm being quite honest because I genuinely don’t think that I’ll ever use physics in the years to come. But at the end of the day, we all have to do what we gotta do, which is why I’m here."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2805,"""Why  am  I  here?"" This question will be extremely easy for me to answer because it is short and basic. I'm here to take PHYS 112 because it's one among the many things I'll need to accomplish and achieve my long-term goal of graduating and enrolling in dentistry school. I'll never forget why I'm taking this class in the  first place. Which is the additional knowledge I'll get. And the materials I'll be studying, which I hope will be usel as I continue on my trip. And, because I've heard that physics is present in all aspects of our lives, I'm curious to discover whether this is true. And, as I've heard, the solutions to the majority of the exciting events that are taking place in our world are physics. So, as long as I keep attending this class and learning as much as I can, I'm glad to learn other things and to be open to learning and comprehending the material presented in this class."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2806,"My Purpose   At a young age, I was not interested in school and felt it was tedious throughout middle and high school. However, when I reached college, that is when I started to become interested in my classes. College level classes introduced me to the sciences like biology and chemistry, which I enjoyed greatly as I learned more about them. In particular, biology was my favorite subject and even led me to major in it. This interest grew over time as I began to think about my future profession.   I always had a love for animals, and during high school, I worked with animals at the SPCA. This led me to think about going into the veterinary field and studying to be a veterinary doctor. My experiences at the shelter confirmed that veterinary is my path and is what I will be working towards in college. Figuring out what my future meant helped me recognize my purpose. It brings me joy to think about my future career involving treating and curing animals. It allowed me to feel that I, as a human, can make a difference in the world. Present day, that is still my main goal."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2807,"I ask myself that question a lot. I always seemed so confused with my life. Why am I here? What was the reasoning for my living? Back then, when I didn't understand, I would've asked myself why you would want to waste space or oxygen on a person like me? As I grew older, time changed, and It didn't go the way I planned. At an early age, I had to grow up faster than others, and I never got to understand who I truly am. Yes, I may be mature, but I didn’t get that sort of exploration and excitement others had the chance to live through. My father passed away when I was 14, which sparked my curiosity even more about why I was living or why I was here because I really couldn't catch a break. Even more, time went by, and some parts I wanted to say were good, but I think it was because I ignored the details. I began to learn more about myself these past semesters, and I found things that intrigued me, for example, science. It allowed me to understand more about the flaws of us humans and why each individual was so beautiful. It allowed me to learn more about the incident of my father, which made me happy because It motivated me and made me want to strive to become a savior to others so that someday they wouldn't have to face what I faced. The person I am right now is the reason of why I'm here."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2808,"An age old question, ""Why am I here?"" has plagued philosophers for millennia. Countless complex answers have formed from this, as well as innumerable over-simplified descriptions of complicated thoughts. I'm probably not able to add anything new to this discussion, but I can provide an opinion to answer this question to the best of my ability for the way it was posed. Overall, I think we are here because the Earth is a very hospitable place. Whether that be by design or an interesting coincidence, Earth is the only planet we know that can foster life. Some think people are like a disease Earth has caught and we are running our home into the ground. An equal amount think our planet was gifted to us from a more omniscient power as our ""spaceship"" that carries us through time. And to keep this somewhat concise, I will provide my own answer by saying I am here to solve some of these questions and provide solutions to problems that may arise while we all enjoy this interesting world around us. As aspiring engineers, scientists, physicists and other technically and theoretically sound individuals, we are tasked with protecting our future so we can gift it to the generations that follow. Regardless of your view on how we got here, it is our responsibility to hold ourselves accountable to keep this amazing accident/ingenious creation just as comfortable as how we found it... all while trying to unlock so many curiosities it presents to us. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2809,"I am here because I want to learn. I want to study and educate myself. There is so much about the world for me to explore. Physics is only the beginning. Beyond Physics, my goal is to take the MCAT and apply to medical school. I want to study human life and the human body. I want to be able to help people in need from all backgrounds -- children, young adults, adults, and seniors. I want to represent the underrepresented. I want to change the healthcare system for the better. One day, I hope to save someone's life. All I have wanted my entire life is to help people. As a physician, I have many options to choose from, but most importantly, I get to help improve someone's life. I get to make them feel like they belong here just like I do, and that is all that truly matters!"
