2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2795,"I have a lot of resources in my community to support me. I have been able to get mentors through my professors and I am also part of clubs and organizations that have allowed me to get help from classmates and network. I am also part of the Metro program at SFSU which supported me in choosing my classes when I was navigating college for the first time. When I have struggled, I also reached out to the Health Promotion and Wellness Center that often has events that help you continue if you are stressed during exams, and midterms that can be quite overwhelming. Finally, I always have support from my family, they always help me as much as they can and are there for me so that I can continue being persistent. They are also the reason why I continue with my education to fully make them proud of what I achieve and my future career goals."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,1619,"The only answer I can come up with are my friends, my boyfriend, and my parents. While I don't really seek for support or ask anyone for help, whenever I do I either go to my boyfriend, my parents or my friends. They're pretty much the only resources I have that support me as an individual, not only as a student. I will say that my boyfriend is the only person that supports me the most. He really does push me when I get stressed out about school or whatever the case may be. He also puts my mind at ease if I'm feeling overwhelmed. He's honestly the only one I can rely on at all times. I will say that he is my support system and whenever I need some type of motivation to do something, then I always know I can go to him right away without any hesitation. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2787,"As a student that comes from a low-income background I have had more limited resources with not a lot guidance towards the goals I want to achieve for myself. Entering college has greatly expanded my resources in part by knowing who to reach out too for certain issues or questions. Whether that be financial, academic, or personal. Although, I am currently struggling with financial hardships because of the amount of expenses from school and the bills I have to pay at home. So I do have to support myself by working a part-time job. As far as academic help, SFSU excels in that area. Whenever I have trouble with homework, need to study or understand a subject better I go to tutoring or my professors' office hours. If I need any changes or help maneuvering my class schedules and major requirements, I have my advisors and mentors to alleviate the burden and stress. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2808,"I would say that I have more than enough resources to support me. A great family/friend network, another network of people I served in the military with, the Veteran’s Affairs network is always there to assist me, all paired with the different resources offered to me as a veteran at San Francisco State University. I’m very fortunate to have all of this support to help me stay healthy and succeed. In return, I always offer up myself as support and as a resource whenever I see someone in need. I believe all of this builds an incredibly strong community and we rely heavily on this within the military because of the environments we serve in and because we have to move our families around consistently. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2803,"I have a lot of resources depending on what I am doing. if I am writing an essay, I got google scholar for evidence, I can ask around, I can fix my grammar with the help of website called grammerly. I can also reach out to my professors or advisors to support me on anything and see if they can help me out. I also have classmates that could help me out and see if they can help me. I could ask my family members. these are all few examples of resources that could help me in whatever field. I just have to see who and what can help me at what the solutions I need for what problems I got. If I am struggling in any of my classes, I could also reach out for tutoring. I think those are excellent option when it comes to growing our grades and maintaining our grades High as possible. "

Most of the topic in the lab are connecting with the lecture and I have to work on every single topic and participated when we doing as a group in meeting and it really helped me to understand. Starting from the first class of lab , i all have noted all of the information and worked on with my group for each lab exploration and post knowledges. But i want to know more the experiments in the apps. Sometime i feel like i need to focus on those things. I need to focus on the the simulation part. But everything is doing fine in this class. In this lab my group members and professor are very supportive and i really enjoy it. I feel more comfortable of doing with my group. I just need to focus on the simulation part especially but i really hope i will get it better understanding. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,354,"I am grateful to have access to multiple resources that support me whether that be at school, online, or even at home. I have the school's whole support from every professor I've had to every peer and classmate I have encountered to help me with my success at the course. Financial helpers and course advisors have done helped me on my road of schooling, too. My resources at home which are my family, friends, and loved ones who have shown me their constant support in achieving this big success. They have been there with me every step of the way and showed me that I am not alone on this challenging path. Although it is not physical guidance where they are helping me with my homework and such, it is more of a mental and emotional support they provide for me to stay head strong and continue to push and strive for success. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2807,I have a lot of resources that will help me strive to obtain better knowledge in all my classes including this one. I know that my professors are doing their best to help me succeed and will always be there for me when I'm stuck. Another option I have if they're busy would be tutoring many people think oh you're not smart if you go to tutoring all I say to that if you don't fail then you won't learn and also it's never hurts to get some help from others that understand the concepts we don't. The most important resource would be reviewing all the notes and trying to break down the information that's being taught because sometimes we speed up and we tend to forget to remember the important things about the words that are being said. I'm really like the Lab many things to learn about and very fascinating things that are being taught. Some are difficult and some are very easy to take in. It differs from subject to subject.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2788,"When I try to think of what resources do I have to support myself I would say the main one is the internet or just technology in general. For example google, you can search anything on there and the answer will pop up, and I’m not talking about just for school but for overall life questions/concerns. I would say school wise, YouTube has really been coming through for this class. The people I watch are really good at explaining the material and giving good and easy to understand examples. And their are so many different videos and teachers so their is someone for everyone. Another thing that has really stay on top of my work is my planner. It helps me stay very organized and it makes me want to do homework and check off my boxes. And of course our teachers can be a big resource when it comes to homework or quizzes but sometimes I feel that it’s better to get help from someone other than your teacher because not everyone has the same learning style and some styles of teaching are not the best learning experience."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2810,"""What resources do I have to support me?”   The resources I have to support me is all over in different areas. First and foremost I have my family who is my support system. They always stand by me through the good and the bad and they give me everything possible to set me up for success and to be the best version of myself whether that is for my future or for the present right now. Next is my friends, they are a great support system for me because they are always there for me no matter what and vice versa. Whenever we need anything we are always there for each other no matter the circumstances. Lastly, is my church youth group they are the most amazing people especially my youth group leaders who give their absolute all to help guide us through our faith and use to that to help us through life. "

I also know I have my family to support me like my siblings my brothers girlfriend has well she has supported me so much. however when it comes to school the resources I have to support me would be I would say any professors I currently have or even ones I had already. as well as advisors around campus would always support any student and do there best to help them. I also have my friends and more so my cousin who is my best friend who will support me. I have some close friends who I know would always be there for me and to support me in anything and I am so thankful for that.

2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2796,"I think I am blessed to have a bunch of resources that are easily accessible to me in doing my school work such as doing an online research by looking up different topics in a search engine or watching tutorial videos from Youtube. I could also subscribe to online programs that focus on my learning such as Khan Academy, Aleks, Expert TA and more. I am also lucky enough to be provided with a library wherein I could borrow as much books as I wanted whether it is for more sole entertainment or school. My family has also been very supportive of me in every way that they can whether emotionally, mentally or financially. I also believe that one of the biggest contributors to my learning would be the school and its professors that try to do their best to provide education & knowledge to students like me who could be clueless in the class."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2790,Some resources I have to support me are professors and peers. My professors provide me with really good resources to help me succeed and do well. This includes offering office hours so students can ask questions about their homework and past mistakes. This is very helpful because people can come at different times and it allows for small group work and sometimes 1 on 1 help from your professor. This is helpful because your mistakes in work can become more obvious so you are able to leave the office hour with much more knowledge. My peers help by making suggestions about what they do to succeed. Some know really great YouTube channels that specialize in helping students with difficult problems and other students have great suggestions on how you should try to understand a question differently. These resources are both excellent because both encourage success and effort from students which results in advancements in knowledge and school work.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2801,"On this moment, I think that I have a lot of resources from my university and the government in San Francisco. There are a lot of resources like menthoring, tutoring, scholarships, fundings, and even for food. The government gives a lot of free stuff for youth. Such as medical care and as well as education necessities. These resources actually helped me be successful and move on with my life. They have helped me financially to achieve good education and daily lives. For instance there's a calfresh that provides a debit card for eligible low-income households. CalFresh benefits can be used to buy food at all major grocery stores, many neighborhood stores and participating farmers markets. apply in person through Human Services Agency regional offices or online at www.calfresh.ca.gov/ ."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2805,"There are many resources out there that support my understanding of what im doing my understanding but mainly the Resources I have that support me throughout this semester would be the slides provided at the beginning of each class, i find it really helpful and straightforward. Another thing i find help support my knowledge are the lab exploration we do every class with the simulation activities. I feel like its a way to help make you understand in a fun and enjoyable way. Another resources would be office hours, going to office hours and talking to your professor about anything you don’t understand can be very very helpful. Resources I use out of ilearn would be Khan Academy. It can be really helpful sometimes. Sometimes I find myself going back to the lecture portion and watching videos posted previously. The examples that are done during the videos supports my understanding of the chapter."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2800,"Having resources is very important as a college student. I'm very blessed that I have been accepted to a  scholarship that supports me in paying my tuition in college and providing internships or workshops like what I need to know in interviews or how to use LinkedIn. Also, the university has an organization that provides and supports students. For instance having a major advisor or advisors in other organizations (EOP, CoSE). Being part of this organization helps me as a freshman and up until now and I don’t know where I would go without them since they have been really supportive in my journey here at state. As of now, I’m trying to expand and look for other resources. It is very challenging but utilizing the resources that the school offers there are several opportunities that I can take. Resources are always there, it is just up to the student to make an effort and apply for those opportunities."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,703,"Often times life does get challenging for everyone. sometimes it happens more than what it should. The things that I do when my life gets challenging is to take a couple days off to reflex what I’m doing and how to change it. Most of the time when my life does get hard/ challenging is because of school, work, family, and other things too. School does get changeling because of the workload or either trying to balance a health life and school schedule. At this point of the semester, we know how the rest of the semester is going to be like. But it’ll still get harder if I don’t focus and that’s something that I am working on right now. I also work a full-time job and it does get hard trying to stay motivated one thing. My life either consist of working or doing schoolwork. So when that gets overwhelming I try to wait to the weekend so I can rest up and catch up on my homework. Other than that, I try to stay calm and live my life. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,15,"The resources that I have to support me is my family, my advisor, my mentors, and peers in the programs that I am apart of. My family is my number 1 support system when it comes to education and life in general. They are there encouraging me every step of the way along the process and there for help when I need them which is really appreciated. My advisors that I have here at SFSU provide me with a good amount of resources that is beneficial to help me succeed. For example, they send me job links that they'll know will help me or workshop events that they know I can utilize. My mentor that I am working closely with through my scholars program is there when have questions about my courses or how I should go about things. He is also been supportive providing me with extra opportunities with involvement in research that can go along way as I am trying to purse  a career in medicine. The peers that I have meet on campus in my EOP, METRO, and Project connect internship have been making things a lot easier as they have welcomed me in and showed me around campus to every that is available to me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2811,"Elizabeth Pinedo Physics 011210-S22R			""What resources do I have to support me?""Within these years of being at San Francisco State University there have been many opportunities for many resources given to me. There is many programs that are offered through campus to support me and my education, not only on campus but off campus as well. For example the STEM program offered on campus helps not only me but all the students on campus get help on their homework and help them understand the material or the problem not being understood. There are also many more but I believe this is the main one that we all appreciate support from. Another program that helps us in our education is the SCI classes. I think that is a good class to take to be able to have extra support during finals week."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2806,"Daria Belkin04/15/22PHYS 112: Reflective Journal #4""What resources do I have to support me?""	When it comes to the resources I have around me, I view it through the people around me. My resources are mostly people, such as my family, who help me by giving me a roof over my head, basic necessities, and most of all, support. I feel constantly supported by my parents, as they want me to succeed in a good profession. They also aid me in my tuition and without them, I would be struggling. Another resource I have are my peers. Especially during online classes, I find myself in need to help and I can always count on my peers to help me out. In particular, the app “discord” allows me to easily connect with my peers and ask questions that get answered quickly, as the server has a lot of people from different classes as well. Overall, I am thankful for the people in my life that help me in difficult times. I want to work on finding resources inside of SFSU such as tutoring or joining clubs in order to help me continue succeeding. "
