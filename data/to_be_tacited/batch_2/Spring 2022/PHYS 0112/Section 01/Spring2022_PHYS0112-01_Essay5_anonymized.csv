2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2657,"My family doesn't directly help me navigate through college because my parents never went to college and my older brother isn't around often enough to help me out but my parents did teach me very young the importance of punctuality. I don't like being late so I usually make sure all of the things I have to do follow my schedule so that I get everything done. I try to be really strict when it comes to how much time I spend on things and when get things done. my parents also value school a lot, so I was raised to treat school as a priority and everything after. although sometimes my schedules for things and what I do on a daily basis deteriorate my mental health a significant amount I just think of the pay off and being able to relax later on. my older brother goes to SF State too so I think that just by watching him be able to do it I think that I will also. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2662,"There are many values that my family has instilled in me since the time I was young. There are also many values that I have learned through the experiences I have gone through as a person; both of these values have helped me navigate through college in many ways. My family has always taught me to be caring, empathetic, kind, and helpful. Through these values I have been able to make many new friends both in my classes and within my new apartment that have truly helped me adapt to university life. Being a transfer student, it’s easy to feel like you came into things a bit late, and because of this sometimes putting yourself out there can be daunting. However I have benefitted from all of these friendships and relationships and I am glad they are part of my life. Through my own trial and error, I have found that it takes resilience, perseverance, balance, time management, and critical thinking in order to get me where I want to go in my chosen field of study and eventually work. These values always remind me that nothing comes easy, and this serves as my biggest source of motivation though college. I find everything to be a bit easier when I remind myself of these things!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2659,"The values of my community and primarily my family helped me not necessarily navigate through college, but it did motivate me. I am the first born in my immediate family and the first to go to college. My family immigrated from China barely finishing grade school and they always say they left their family behind to give me a better life. I want to provide that for them by goin to school and by having a successful job in the future. However, They are pretty open to the “western” way of life  and they never pushed anything on me much like many Chinese-americn stereotypes where parents choose their child’s career path. I am able to pave my own career path in the future. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2656,"The values of my community or my family helped navigate college by giving the support I needed to do things I needed to do. They guided me on what to do, how I can get to my goals, and even motivate me. When ever I needed help, they were always there for me. They needed to know what’s wrong and or the problem, to help me. If they couldn’t help me, they would someone else who would which was a relief. I even helped some friends on what to do and where to go. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2646,Without the support and underlying values from my friends and family I would not be able to be as successful in college as I am. I call my parents weekly and let them know how my week was. Their support and advice mean the world to me and I treasure it. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2651,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" The values from my family have not only helped me through college but it helps me in my everyday life. By saying that, in College, I demonstrate those values. For instance, I show respect to everyone regardless if they agree with my points of views or not. Also, I treat everyone as I would like to be treated because that shows how much I care about my family and that without their values I can be the person that I am. I always try to give my one hundred percent when it comes to respecting people because I believe that it is the way to teach people that everyone is equal. So, they can pass the messages to others too. I am so fortunate to have learned those values from my family and be able to show everyone that gets in contact with me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2661,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""This is a very broad question that I think really gets me to think. I think that my family and I have similar values but also very different values. My family and I value different things. I am a person who really values my education and knowledge and want to obtain as much as I possibly can for both of those. My family also sees value in both of those. Where we see differently is definitely our value that we see in our community. I see absolutely tremendous value in our community and want the absolute best for my community and I would personally dedicate my life to trying to help and serve the community in any way I can. I think this has really affected how I have been and how I am currently navigating through college. It has been the deciding factor on what I want to do in life and the kind of person that I want to be. This is why I have chosen to go into the healthcare field because it is simply my goal to just help people. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2660,it has helped me navigate through college because my mom wants me to finish college and I don't want to let her down. This basically motivates me to continue with my studies because I know the hard work and effort she has done for me so my gift to her is getting my diploma. Even though there isn't help I could ask her if I wanted it for homework. Since i am a SF native i have gone to school in the city and i think they have prepared me well enough to navigate myself to have a successful education at this university. It may get hard sometimes but i have to stick through it so i can get what i am here for and that's a degree. The more i push myself then i will get what i have worked hard to get and i am to deep into my education that i wont end up with a degree. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2652,"The values of my family and community have really pushed me in both good and bad ways throughout college.  My community is very competitive when it comes to school, so this has pushed me to give a 100% effort in everything I do. This both has pros and cons.  Pros: I push myself and try hard on everything.  Cons:  I often compare myself to others in my community and don't feel like enough.  My family's values are very similar to my community's values, but less intense.  One thing that I know is that my family will stick by my side no matter what and will always be there for me.  This as helped navigate college.  When I have thought things with school were going awful (this happened often during COVID), my family was always there for me supporting me.  Moving to San Francisco was a big step for me, especially after COVID, and my family has helped me every step of the way which I am so thankful for.  Without these values, college would be impossible. "
