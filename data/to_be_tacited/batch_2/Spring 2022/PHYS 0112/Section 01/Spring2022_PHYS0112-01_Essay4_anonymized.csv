2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2651,"""What resources do I have to support me?""  I would like to say that SFSU offers many resource such as medical and academic resources but like most schools most of those resources are not advertised as much which it makes difficult to students to use them On the other hand, when student find out about those resources and plan to use it; those resource don’t have the proper availability to support that needs of the student; consequently, the students ended up going back to step one. I believed that schools need to focus more in that area so their students can get the help they deserve."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2656,"The resources that support me are my family, friends, classmates, professors, tutors, counselors, and other people in my life. With this support, I can either do what I need to do or just get closer in what I need to achieve. Sometimes that support is not there for me all the time and I need to find another way or just not even get help. I need to be independent most importantly, I can’t rely too much on other people because I won’t figure out my own problems. We need that support to get to that desired goal, but it’s important to figure out our own path."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2655,the resources I have for support are my friends and my family. I think that they help me when I feel overwhelmed and need some advice. I find comfort in talking to the people who know me the most. i like to talk to my sister and get advice from her about things that I'm going through and I like to help her with things that she is going through. I think that I go to my parents when I need to be motivated. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2661,"I think I have a lot of resources to support me. These resources are here to support me through my every day life and troubles including my personal issues and my academic issues. The resources that’s I feel I have to support me are my family, friends, and fraternity. I feel as thought my family is there to me and support me through my everyday needs. When I need emotional support my family is always there as best as they can do support me eveb when they need to drop their own needs to support me in my endeavors. My friends are also always there for me. I would say my friends are more there to support me during my academic difficulties. When I need help during assignments or studying I can always count on my friends to help me through it or support me emotionally while I help myself through it. My fraternity is there to support me and provide me with professional, academic, and career support to help me achieve my goals and endeavors throughout my undergraduate and eventually my graduate school career. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2657,"Resources that I have to support me are things that are offered here at the school sub as tutoring sessions, class office hours, and having the library and other quiet places to study on campus. my older brother also goes to SF State so he'll often help me with things I don't understand or he just explains how certain things are and even where my classes are. I think that other than the obvious resources provided to support me I don't have very much there to really help me out. my parents never went to college so they don't know how much of it works and almost all my friends go to community colleges so our circumstances are different. The professors also do help a lot and are rather understanding, I thought going into college that I was going to be on my own but after getting here and being here for almost a full year now I van say that a lot of the times teachers are always open to helping you out and I really appreciate just because sometimes I really can't come to class or sometimes I just had so much to do that I just completely forgot about an assignment. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2646,"There are a diverse amount of resources available to me on campus to help me throughout the semester. My biggest resource is my friends that I have. We are able to support each other and give each other valuable advise. On the other hand, if I am feeling like my problems are becoming too big, I can always make a counseling/CAPS appointment and speak with a therapist. In addition, my parents are a great resource for me as I can call them anytime and they offer amazing advice. Support from peers is crucial to me during the semester as it can become extremely stressful and overwhelming. As human beings, we crave intimate connection with one another and life becomes much harder if we lack that connection. I have seen friends go off to college, especially during and post-pandemic, that have had an especially tough time developing lasting, meaningful friendships. So, I feel very fortunate to have these supporting friendships that allow me to succeed in school. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2647,"I have had resources from different perspective that have supported me throughout the journey of my life. First of all, emotional support from my family has been my primary resource to go well in my life. Second of all, work I have has been my financial resource for which I am very grateful. My friends who give me ideas of different perspective of my life have been a great support. They make this roller coaster ride of life a fun one. And comes my college. College has provided me with superb professor. Some of the professor that I have came through have made few decisions of my life very clear. They suggest, support me not just for the sake of their job but with whole heartedly. So, some professor are like a gem. Other than these resources, facilities that the university provides are plus points to achieve whatever I am planning to. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2652,"I have a lot of resources to support me no matter what obstacle I am faced with.  Most of the time I lean on my friends and family when I need support.  My friends and family really ground me when ever I am going through something hard.  When it comes to school, I can lean on my friends and family OR I can see what resources SFSU has, which is a lot.  If I am ever struggling in a class I can easily go to office hours to chat with my professor.  If that isn't enough, which most of the time it is, I can also see what other student services are offered to me like tutoring.  At my old university- I am a Spring transfer student at SFSU- I utilized this option all the time.  When I was struggling in STEM classes I would often go to online tutoring sessions or I would even watch some Khan academy videos on youtube.  Overall, when I need support, I have many resources and people that I can reach out to."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2648,"""What resources do I have to support me?""Academically, my only support systems are my parents. I do wish to find a counselor to guide me through college but every counselor i have encountered has signed me up fro the wrong classes. Other than visiting the counseling center, im not too sure of SFSU's other resources i can go to for help. This being said, it is also hard for me to recieve help since I cannot be on campus most of the time because I live and work in Stockton, CA. On an honest note, I have progressively been losing motivation for school. Im not sure on whether it is the fact that i have to commute four hours a day, I lost focus of the bigger picture or if my drive for school is depleting. My parents support me financially to be able to go to school and encourage me to go to school but i believe i lack support when it comes to the actual material in classes. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2659,"Now that I step back and think about it, I do have a lot of support in my life. A resource I can use is my family. I grew up in a pretty traditional Chinese household where the adults do expect me to get good grades and follow a good career path. However, as my cousins and I grew older the adults of the family sort of adapted to the ""western"" life, more so my parents. My parents don't care what I do in the future as a career choice as long as I'm happy, which is a big weight off my shoulder because of the stress of trying to make my parents proud would weigh on me. Another resource I have is my friends, I have a pretty tight knit friend group, where we all became friends in high school about five years ago. They support me in ways I didn't even know. They uplift me and make me feel like I am doing the right thing."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2660,I have my professor that will support me because I know if would ask him a question he will try his best to help me understand it. I also have the internet to help me with any formulas that I can be missing or a simple youtube search would help me with a situation I may have. I think there are all the resources that I have to support myself.
