2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2654,My goal is to complete this semester with better grades than last semester. It has already been hard with work. I end up missing assignments since I work late shifts and as much as I have been trying to get ahead of things I have not been able to so far. Im not sure how to balance school and work better but I really want to be successful at both since I need them both. I think I have been doing okay in this class but I could be better at using the in class time to complete the labs rather than doing them outside! I also want to build a strong physics foundation so that I can be successful in this class and the next physics class I will be talking next semester! I also want to make sure that Im on track for med school and completing my pre med prerequisites.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2664,"My goals consist of many different things. I definitely want to graduate with a degree from San Francisco State University. This class is one of the many stepping stones I need to go up inorder for me to achieve that. Graduating, doing well in school is, I’d say my main goal in mind, but I also have many different goals. I want to be as great of a musician as I can possibly be. That requires a lot of discipline and practice. Staying consistent. This class accompanied by physics lectures are my first classes Monday through Wednesday. Now that we are back in person, I will have to be commuting to school almost every weekday. I will have to maintain a consistent schedule and time management to be able to attend classes. Also I really enjoy physics it was one of if not the most fun classes I took in high school."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1380,"My main goal is to be able to graduate and get my degree. I want to be able to find a stable job and find one that I will enjoy. I hope to be able to support my family and myself. A goal that I have for this class is to try to finish my work and be able to understand the materials. I know physics isn't going to be an easy subject for me, so I want to do my best to try to review the things I've learned. By pacing myself and taking the time to absorb the materials. Another goal that I have is to try and not get distracted from completing my work or studying for my classes. I think having class in person would make me feel less distracted than having online class. I’m able to focus and pay attention in person, ask for help, and try to finish the assignments."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1656,My goals for this semester is to really understand how physics is used in the real world. I want to learn and figure out. from class how topics of motion and gravity apply into my daily life. Being able to recognize what causes tension on other objects in the real world would be great to finally  understand. I also want to take what I've learned from class and use that to really help me understand my homework as well as to see mentally how these physics problems come to life through diagrams and understanding the key concepts better. I also want to show up for office hours to get help on problems and topics I don't understand to the fullest extent. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2647,"It's been many years since I have taken any physics classes, so this class has been helping me information that I have not been able achieve. My goal is to work as a lab technician and this class can be learn many mathematical terms that I will not gain from other classes."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2652,"My goals this semester in my Physics class are pretty simple.  Obviously, I would like to get a good grade in this class and pass.  I am supposed to take the next level of Physics next semester, so I also want to build a good foundation in the subject.  This is my first time in a Physics course, so I am a little nervous.  Most importantly though, I would like to be confident in my academic abilities.  Throughout my schooling career I have had a hard time with confidence, especially with classes that involve some sort of math.  I always seem to second guess myself and my abilities.  So, this semester I would like to move past this.  In order to achieve my goals I really just need to believe in myself.  If I don’t understand something, instead of being ashamed to ask for help, I should embrace it.  It is okay to make mistakes, which is something that I need to be okay with."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2663,"My goal for this class is to mainly get the GE's for this course. I'm majoring in Kinesiology and some physics is needed for the field which is why I need to take this class. I do want to become a physical therapist in the future which does involve some sort of physics such as using the gravity of different types of techniques with resistance to help my patients out.  Honestly, so far physics is pretty fun. I'm enjoying learning about the basic concepts and getting the basics of how everything in physics works such as the lesson on position, velocity, and acceleration. Although I'm not majoring in physics I am enjoying my time in this physics class so far."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2660,My goals are for me to pass this class while also being able to learn how physics is around me in my everyday life. I think a way I am able to achieve these goals now since we are back in person I won't be able to get distracted easily. And since we are going to be working with groupmates it makes the lab work a little easier because two brains are better than one. The best way for me to achieve these goals is to pay attention and ask for help when I need some clarification. Another way is using examples that we can relate to so we can see how physics working with us or against us.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2659,"My goals for this class is to learn what I was unable to in high school. I want to preface this by saying I am a third year biology student and I'm not sure why my major requires me to take not only physics 1, but physics 2 as well, so here I am. This class is helping me achieve my goals because I need this class for my degree and I just want to be able to learn enough, so I don't struggle in physics 2. So far I am learning more than I did in high school and of course high school courses is just to cover the basics and not go in to deep. It is getting a little more difficult to understand because for one, my high school physics class was three years ago and they didn't go in too deep with the material. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2656,"My goals for me are to get my bachelors degree in the next 3-4 years and to learn everything from every class that will help me in the future. This physics class is helping me achieve these goals by planning my agenda out and trying to learn. I’m also trying to find that physics connection to my environment science major. If I work hard, participate, turn in every assignment, and homework, my goals will achieve and happen. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2653,"My goals are to graduate from SFSU with a degree in Environmental Science and to go on to work in marine conservation and restoration. I have so many goals in my field and I am so excited to get to work with all this degree has given me. While right now the most tangible goal that this course is helping me to fulfill is the degree requirement, I am know there are foundation concepts I am being introduced to here which may help me in the future in ways I don't know. I do know however that there a unending ways that many concepts in physics relate directly to my interests and thus is just one of many parts of fulfilling my goals in my field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2651,What are my goals?My goal is to graduate on Spring 2023 and obtain my BS degree in Biology concentration in Zoology.How is this class helping me achieve these goals?This class will help me to get more knowledge on how the day to day works relating to physic and the environment which it is very important for my degree.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2646,"My major goal currently is to complete my bachelor's degree in Earth Sciences. While I am a junior, and am already close to the finish line, physics is an essential class to my field. Earth scientists and geologists alike utilize physics on a daily basis. So, learning about physics will help me better understand the world around me and how it communicates. I also find physics incredibly interesting. Physics is essential to not only physics-based geological work, but also cosmology and mineralogy. The connections between physics and the natural world are bountiful and endless. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2658,My goal is to get a good grade in this class. I want to graduate within the next couple years so I need to do well in this class in order to do that. To achieve that goal I need to go to each class and make sure I am turning in work on time.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2661,My current goals include continuing with my degree in physiology which I will finish come next spring. And then I would like to move on to graduate school to pursue a background in tech before I go to medical school. I would like to pursue some sort of career in the healthcare field while also being able to satisfy my technological interests. I am hoping along the way I will be able to find some specific topic that peaks my interest that I may want to pursue further. With this class I am hoping to be introduced to many different topics that I may be able to apply to my field in biology and potentially in my career as a physician. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2655,My goal is to change my major and transfer closer to hime to continue working towards being a wildlife biologist. this class will help me reach that goal by helping me get more credits and raise my gpa so that I can have the best gpa possible for a better chance at transferring. I think that this class will also help in breading my knowledge because this is my first physics class and all of this information that we are learning in class are familiar concepts but give more detail. I was nervous about this class at first but so far it's going well.
