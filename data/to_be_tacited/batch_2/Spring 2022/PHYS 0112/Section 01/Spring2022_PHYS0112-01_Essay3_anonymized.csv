2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2659,"This semester really did kick my but as I am taking on 7 classes. I also did have a lot of personal issues that I am going through as well. So when I get stressed out I try my best to ground myself. I do that by getting myself organized with a planner and not letting unnecessary stress get in the way. For example, I do my homework in advance, so I give myself le-way on some assignments, since I have the time I might as well get it done, so I don't have to stress about it in the future when it is due. I also like to meditate and use guided meditation on Youtube. I find it really help with keeping myself calm and grounded. I also surround myself with people I love and like to enjoy my time with, like friends and family. On my free time, I do like to play video games with my friends to sort of distract myself when life does get challenging. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2661,"When life gets challenging I tend to avoid my issues and distract myself with as many things possible. Things that are easy such as watching tv, playing games, or taking naps. At least that is what I used to do a lot. Nowadays I try to tackle my problems that make life difficult head on. I found that putting my problems to the side and avoiding them does not get rid of them, instead it just creates more problems and the original problem just comes back to bite me. So when life gets challenging I try to take a minute to take a couple deep breathes and face my problems myself or seeking help from those around me that would like to support me. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2652,"Last week I had a perfect example to answer the question, ""What do I do when life gets challenging"".  I live in Nob Hill, so my commute to school can be anywhere from 25-45 minutes depending on traffic.  Last week on Monday while driving to school, my car broke down.  After going into the shop and getting it fixed, I proceeded to drive to school on Tuesday.  My car broke again, this time my transmission went out.  My car is totaled.  Because of this, I had a pretty stressful week having to deal with it.  But, instead of feeling bad about my situation and having a crappy mood because of it, I just went with the flow.  Under pressure I've realized that most of the time I go with the flow and try to figure my way around the challenges that I am faced with.  I try to push away the anxiety and stress because at the end of the day it will only make it worst.  During COVID my anxiety and stress got 10 times worst, so learning how to push it away has been a challenge.  Especially this past week when I went through a big change it was hard to go with the flow and not let anxiety and stress take over.  I had to deal with it by myself without my parents, which was a first for me.  But, it did show me that I can get over challenges and it most of the time isn't the end of the world.  This is the new mentality that I am going to follow: ""It isn't the end of the world""."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1656,"When life gets challenging for myself, I usually turn to someone I know to talk about the issue. It can be my dad, mom or brother who will give me pretty solid advice on how to handle the situation. After that, I would take a break from life to reflect how much work I put in just to be where I am today and what I had to endure to be where I am. Then I'll do my best to find a solution to the challenge and try not to give up no matter how tedious the task at hand can be or how physically and mentally challenging it can be for me to do. What truly defines character in a person is how you manage to continue on the days that you don't feel like doing anything. Even if it's something you love and you just want to stay home in bed all day long. There will be days where you will feel defeated no matter how hard you try and how much effort you apply to the situation. It's a matter of being able to bounce back and get right back up on that saddle. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2662,"Journal #3: What do you do when life gets challenging?Usually when I get stressed, I have a lot of coping mechanisms that I turn to in order to help myself calm down and think about the situation logically. I find that when I’m stressed, it’s hard for me to organize my thoughts; in order to cope with this, I get my journal and I start to write down everything I have to do or everything that’s stressing me out. Usually I feel way less overwhelmed since I can see everything I have to do. Another good coping mechanism that I do more often when I’m stressed is either do yoga or meditate. For me, these two activities yield the same result: a calmer mind and body. I try to focus on my breath and clear my mind of any and all thoughts. Afterwards, I can usually tackle tough situations with a lot more ease."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2647,"Life is very unpredictable, you never know what is on your way coming and we wish to have answers to them but sometimes it is very hard to deal with situations especially when you are a student. At this moment of life, you have many things going on your life about career, job, personal life, studies and it takes a courage to balance everything out. At this moment of my life, we are almost at the end of the semester where you get piles up with all pressures going in class. We need to focus on grades, upcoming classes, assignments, finals and so. During these challenging time, I try to focus on things that are important at a moment. I take a break once in a while. Spring break was a great time for me to take a break now I believe I have regained that energy required for final weeks coming up. I go on a walk, hiking once a week for that fresh air and energy. I take out that time for a break even if my schedules are very hectic and chaotic."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2646,"When life gets challenging the first thing that I do is take my mental health into consideration. My first step is to take inventory of my emotions and thoughts and see what those tell me about my response to the current situation. In general, I also like to practice self care when life gets challenging around me. I need to make sure that I am in a good headspace, or else I will not be able to adequately handle the stressful situation. Spending time with my friends is also extremely beneficial to me. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2660,When life gets challenging I usually like to distract myself for a little and then come back to it and try to figure out the best way I can handle my problems. I learned that making a list of things I need to do and prioritize the ones I need to do first and then focus on the rest. This has helped me overcome some of the challenges in my life but also reflect on maybe what could've done better and then I learn and hopefully put that into the future. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2655,"What I do when life gets challenging	When life gets a little hard I try really hard to make sure I have people around me that make me happy or I get in touch with my friends and see what they're up to and how they've been. When I do that we usually have time to catch up and I can let them know how I'm feeling and get their perspective on it and we listen to each other's issues. I also try to be outside as much as I can. Getting fresh air really helps me think and makes me feel a little better. I also listen to music that fits my mood and that usually helps me eventually calm down if I'm upset. I like to talk to people and do things that remind me of home, like going In n’ out, going to the beach, calling friends/family and staying as positive as I can when I'm going through it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2664,Life does get challenging sometimes. I have a few things I do that help relieve some stress and motivate me. One of and the biggest is music. Music helps me calm down and focus. I play music as well. Mostly guitar and bass. These aspects of music help me relax and breathe for just a moment and gain focus again. It is easy to lose yourself if your life is just mainly focused on one thing. Work and school are stressful. Another method I use is to look at family photos. I do it all for my family who has been of great support to me. I do it mostly for them. They are the main reason I keep waking up each morning and continue on the. They help discipline me.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2657,"when life gets hard sometimes I just like to stop take a break breath and get some perspective. Honestly being in school has shown me that you could literally feel like your drowning and you can't do anything about the situations your in and with classes, work, and a social life its all pretty hard to maintain but if you just step back its not that big of a deal. Sometimes it helps me to figure out what it is i'm feeling as a reaction to whatever it is around me making life hard, because from narrowing down what you're feeling you can start finding solutions to help figure out your situations. If I really have to i'll reach out to a friend and ask if they would let me rant to them about things that are upsetting me that maybe sometimes I have no control of. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1329,"When life gets tough, and I’m in a place where I physically feel stuck or unable to express myself without being misunderstood, I tend to go on a drive until the frustration subsides, but with gas prices the way they are these days the drives have gotten shorter and usually end at a trailhead where I walk or jog until I have to pay more attention to my foot placement and breathing pattern vs the thoughts running through my mind. I stretch and practice yoga if I’m in a quiet controlled environment. I’m also a dog walker so I’ll pick up extra dog walks which is a bonus for extra cash and that settles me down some, but it’s more about being in the awesome company of a non-judgmental critter that changes my perspective in that moment about how things could be worse. It reminds me that like the dog, I too have a family that loves me unconditionally and that maybe I should just not overthink things. The thought train is much longer in reality but that’s the gist of it. I’m not one to reach out to people when I’m feeling stressed, because I think everyone has their own battles they’re going through and it feels like adding extra burdens. Maybe TMI, but I’m not worried about being judged here. A couple weeks ago I started looking into therapy for anti-anxiety  meds, though I don’t even take ibuprofen for headaches so I’m still trying to wrap my head around taking medications in general, but I really hope it helps some. When things gets bad in my head, it’s not great. But so far my methods have kept me sane-ish. Nowhere to go but up from here. Hopefully. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2656,"When my life gets challenging, I will need to to take a break from everything and rethink how am I gonna solve my problems. When things get challenging, I might have to ask someone for help/advice so I can figure out what to do. I would also figure out what’s trying to stress me out so I can solve/relief it and find out how can I overcome those challenges. Next I would try to set goals for myself so I can make a path to success. I would also try to learn other ways why things are challenging. Last is questioning myself, what am I not understanding? and How can I understand it better?"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1380,"When life gets challenging, I try to do an activity like stretching, maybe watch something that’s funny, try to take a nap, talk or hang out with my friends, or do something that distracts me. Although I’m not really the type of person to talk about how I feel. There are times when things get stressful and I would usually cry because tears would just come out. When that does happen, I try to calm myself down and distract myself. I would try to calm myself if things are too challenging or stressful for me. These things will change as time goes by, and it can be a learning experience as well. Hopefully I will try not to make the same mistakes but learn from it and understand what the problem was that started it. Know that these things will happen in life and it probably will happen in the future. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2651,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?""  I believed that when life gets challenging my option is just to be patience and take things one at a time because it helps you to see clear any challenge that you can encounter in life. Also, have an organized plan for anything can help you feel less worried about any outcomes that life can give. Have someone who you can reach for any advised can be very helpful because you can see the problem in a different perspective or point of view."
