Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1380,"I have a few reasons that I can think of for why I am here. The one first reason why I’m here is because of my major. To be honest, physics was one of those classes I wanted to avoid because it was a bit hard for me when I took it in high school. When I first saw that I had to take physics, I was surprised. I think I understood why this class is needed. With the classes I’m taking, I hope to be able to learn and understand them. Being able to use what I learn and understanding how the world works. The second reason is to be able to graduate and find a good paying job that I will enjoy. I want to be able to help my family in the future and give back to them. Making my family proud and myself. Living in San Francisco is expensive or anywhere else, so finding a stable job is important."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2646,"I am here because Physics Lab is a corequisite for the Physics Lecture. I am taking Physics Lecture because it helps develop critical thinking skills that are necessary to my major. I am majoring in Earth Sciences and Physics is a major aspect of Earth Science and helps us describe how matter interacts. While Physics is a requirement for my major, I am excited to learn more about the way in which matter interacts."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2647,"It is very hard to think about the fact that why am I here? Talking about being in California, I was in Minnesota when I came as an international student. I spend a year there and had an experience of both summer and winter. Whenever I think about Minnesota, all I can think of is Snow and I have never been a big fan of minnesota. So, I came to california for my winter vacation, and I fell in love with California. Everything about California is beautiful. I like going outdoors and I don't think there is any other place than California for outdoor. I chose SFSU because I like the vibe about the university and easy for commute. I am in this physics lab because it is one of my prerequisites for my major."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2648,"Why am I here?I am here because my future depends on it. All the hard work done now will pay off later when I graduate, make my parents proud but most importantly, myself. I hope to have a future in dermatology and this class brings me one step closer to my goal. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2649,"I am here in order to learn more about the universe and the world of science. My major is microbiology and I am interested in pursuin a career in research to make a difference in the way the world sees microbes, and the way they affect ourselves, as well as our animal friends. There are many reasons why I am here; I am the partner to an RN at San Francisco General, son to immigrant parents, and brother to 4 boys. Not to mention the many species of animals I keep that depend on me for survival. Though physics is not my major, I am still very interested in the principles, as it is valuable to my main studies, on top of the fact that is one of the most interesting aspects of science as I am very much a fan of astronomy as well."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2650,"I am here in this lab in order to ostensibly gain a hands on understanding of physics principles. This is in order to have a higher level of conceptual clarity for the physics lecture class as well as the field of physics as a whole. Although I am not a physics major, I do still study science, and having a good understanding of physics even on a more basic level will help me to contextualize my studies in other subjects."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2651,"I honestly worry because my background in math is not good. Also, people always say how hard is physics classes. I will try to put a lot of effort of my part to be able to learn the material. Regardless all that, I am here to learn and if by learning I need to make mistakes well it has to be like. I know that by the end I will understand more about physics."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2652,"Well, short story, I am here because this class is a requirement for my major.  Long story, I want to enter the medical field someday.  My major is a Biology major with a concentration in Physiology.  How did I get here? Well, it was a long journey to get here.  I originally went to USF for the Fall 2019- Spring 2020 school year.  Because of COVID, I had to drop out and go home.  So, from Spring 2020- Fall 2021 I attended school online at the local JC in my hometown.  During this time, I contemplated if I actually wanted to go into the medical field or if my family wanted me too.  During the Summer of 2021, I picked up an internship at an Oral Surgery and this is when I realized that I do want to be in the medical field- helping people everyday. So, I applied to SFSU because I loved the city of San Francisco so much, I had to move back.  So, I am so excited to be here!  I am really excited to finally attend an in person class since I haven’t done that since Spring 2020."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2653,"Why am I here? I love the idea of reflecting on something so instantaneous. So many ways to answer this question but my first instinct was to reflect on my path to this specific lab class during my last semester at SFSU. I began at SFSU as an Anthropology major with a decidedly excited disposition about learning from the past as a means of informing the present and even as a means of projecting into future. Overtime, while my curiosity on the topic stayed true, my commitment to this as a frame of study weakened and I sought a new path, Geography. This field, and change of major satisfied my passion for understanding both the physical and social sciences. But why am I here, through my studies in geography, I realized my passion for the natural sciences was always shrouded in a lack of confidence to take on the hard sciences and upper level maths (physics, chemistry, calculus). But I have built confidence in myself overtime and have succeeded in these topics more than I could have imagined. I am here as a means of getting my BS in Environmental Science and I couldn't be happier to succeed in this course and graduate with a science degree."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1329,"I'm still trying to figure this out. I've had a rough go at trying to stay enrolled in school and I'm at the point where I'm questioning if higher education is within my realm of possibilities. I wanted to do this because I'm the first in my family to pursue higher education, and I have goals that go beyond what I'm capable of with my current resource pool. It's been a struggle. I'm here because I want to give myself opportunities for growth, learning, and life. At this point I'm not sure if I want my degree just to say I did it though, because I've never had to fight for something so hard before. I almost didn't log on to class this morning because I'm not sure if I'll be able to stay enrolled. I'm honestly feeling not optimistic about this semester but I'm going to continue to show up. This isn't normal me. But I LOVE learning, I LOVE education, I LOVE sharing my knowledge. This is totally not where I thought this was going to go, a little bit of a downer but honest I suppose. I want to be here because I personally feel like I need to be."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2654,"As I start another semester at SFSU, I always wonder why I’m here and if I’m on the right track. It has been hard to prioritize school and my job at the same time, but the reason I’m here is to pursue a future in medicine. And as I move into another semester at SFSU, I want to build a strong foundation on subjects like physics so I can build a successful background for med school in the future. Last semester I felt overwhelmed with work and school and my main goal is to be both financially independent and be a student, so it has been hard grappling with both, and I’m still finding my balance, but I hope this semester is a better experience. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2655,Reflective journalI’m here to get an education and work towards new goals in life. I think that it's important to have something to work towards and something to give you happiness. I want to be a wildlife biologist and work closely with animals. I think that it is something that is really interesting and will also make me happy and one of my ultimate goals is to have a job that I do for the rest of my life and it does not feel like work because I love doing it.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2656,"I am here because, I want to get my bachelors degree, after more than a decade of education. I need to take a physics class lecture and lab in order to get that degree. I am here to explore and learn Jew things about the world. Even though I’m independent with my work, I am here to make friends and learn from different people and their experiences. Mainly I am here to use that knowledge that I learned on real life situations. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2657,"My first semester I honestly had no clue why I was at SF State it felt like I was shoved from high school immediately into college without real thought as to what I actually wanted to do. As I continued my time here I tried to find reasons for motivation to keep going, I needed an actual goal that I could see myself really trying for. By sampling bits of everything I kind of figured out exactly what it is I want to do and now I feel excited for my future and understand everything I need to do to get there."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2658,"I am here because it is part of my major requirements. I need to get this class done in order to move forward with my classes. I am here in college in order to set up a life for myself that supports me and allows me to live the way I want to. I am excited to be in this class but also nervous because it is outside of my major and is a difficult topic for me. Although, I am also excited to expand my science knowledge."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2659,"""Why am I here?"" is a very broad question and can be interpreted in many different ways. It can go as deep as ""why am I here?"" as in on this earth or ""why am I here?"" as in in this class. I will be interpreting it as why am I here in this class learning. Well, the answer is simple, I need this class. I need it in order to get my biology degree, why you may ask. I need the degree to get into my dream profession, which is to be a physicians assistant. I'm not too sure why a biology degree requires not only physics 1 but as well as physics 2. So here I am in physics 1 just trying my best to learn a subject I am not familiar or comfortable with. It will be a difficult task as this is my worse science subject. I have trouble grasping some concepts, which is okay. I'm sure there are other people on the same boat as I am. But i'm here to just ride the wave and see where this class takes me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2660,"I am not here in the lab just case I have to take it but I chose to take the lab in person because I am all about meeting new people. A lot of people consider me a social butterfly which makes it easier for me to meet new people and learn something about them. I am also here because I want to learn more and explore my curiosity and learn more about physics. Before I have only have had one type of physics my freshman year of high school and as i remember it, it was not a bad class because we had this one lab where we built a bridge out of popsicle sticks to hold heavy weight. Science is really the only subject where you can do a hands-on experiment and see the results for yourself. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2661,I am here because I have been through a lot of ups and downs trying to figure out where I want to be and what I want to do in life. I have been in my lowest points feeling lost and pressured to choose a major that will point me in a career path for the rest of my life. This pressure led me down a very dark and scary road that eventually led to me realizing that its not very important how fast I graduate or how fast I choose a major and career path. I reached a point of content and finally realized my interest in biology and medicine. I realized that even if I change my career goals in the future then it is always doable and not the end of the world. This is why I am here in phys 112. I am here graduating just a bit late but ready to learn and take on my major and its prerequisites. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2662,"I believe our purpose in life is to connect with others. In biology, we learn about different kinds of animals and the way they live. Some are reclusive and solitary, but like many different animals, humans require social interaction. That’s how I think of it scientifically. But, on a deeper level, I think that we need social interaction for a lot of reasons other than primal instinct. We as a population can choose which friends we surround ourselves with, where we move & place ourselves, who we want to share our lives with. Connection with others is not only necessary for things like jobs, navigation in society, getting from point A to point B, etcetera. It’s necessary in the ways we form our perception of the world and ourselves, our schemas, how we create happiness, learn of our origin, form values, live our lives, and pass our stories on to others. As trivial as it may sound, I believe connecting with others; more specifically who you choose to connect with can mean the difference between what we perceive as a “good” life and a “bad” one, subjectively so."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2663,The reason that I am here at SF State is that I wanted to save money on college while also going to a school that is good for my major Kinesiology. I researched that SF State has an amazing Kinesiology program so I knew that SF State was one of my main options. Although I am an SF resident I don't really mind going to college close by which allows me to be close with family and I don't need to pay for housing. Being an SF resident also saves me a lot of money for college which means I don't have to take out as many loans that I have to pay back but also I would feel bad if my mom and dad had to pay for my schooling. The reason I am in this lab class is that I needed to take physics for future Kinesiology classes in the future. This lab just came with physics 111. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1656,"I am here in this class because it is required for me to be able to graduate with a degree in biology. Also Ive already taken this course once and now I have to retake it for my second time. I didn't give my best effort but I don't plan on shying away from this course. I will try my best to succeed this year and really understand thee concepts that are being taught and i hope my learning can be reflected this year throughout the semester. Im looking forward to really understanding the topics of physics in this course so when I do take the next physics class to this one, ill be well prepared for what is going to come. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2664,"Why am I here. My family is from a small country in Central America called El Salvador. Fleeing a civil war in hopes to find a better life they ended up in Oakland, CA. I was born and have been raised here my whole life. Some of my most inspiring moments are when my grandfather who is a veteran talks about the war. The effort he had to come to a distinct place for a better life for him and his family. I'm here for not only my future but also their efforts. I want to make them and myself proud so I try to put in the most effort I can in the things I do. I attend San Francisco State University in hopes to have a future career in Computer Science. I plan to keep going in my studies and finish college. I want a better life for me and my family. I do it more for them than for me."
