2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2749,"When life gets challenging, I try to take a break from whatever it is that is overwhelming me. I might even try to get my mind off of the challenge by going out with friends or treating myself. I don’t think my life is that challenging right now. I feel very happy. I feel though that it is hard to get myself to focus on assignments because of all the distractions I have. So I make sure to close all my apps that I use the most. I even turn off my music when doing homework now. I get so caught up listening to the music that I forget I have homework to do. I hate when I have to watch a video for an assignment because I can’t listen to my music. The relationships with people in my life have improved but I feel like I need to focus more on my schoolwork. Focusing on schoolwork has been challenging. But I’m working on becoming a better student!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2753,"When life gets challenging, I try to find the best course to complete the tasks I need to complete. For me, in order to do that, I essentially need to reset myself. I try to ground myself in the areas I have full control in such as cleaning, meditating, reading, sleeping, and eating/drinking properly. After I have completed that, and I feel ready to face what I believe is challenging, I try to face it head on and start working on it immediately. If there are multiple things I just do, I try to organize the tasks through importance and prioritize the tasks that must be completed first. While continuing to practice my healthy habits, and giving myself outlets such as meditation, reading, and exercise, the challenges start becoming less challenging, and I feel more confident in being able to face the rest of the tasks at hand, and future tasks as well. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2755,"When life gets challenging, I try to rely on my outlets as a way to unwind. I feel like outlets are an important tool to utilize as a healthy way to relieve stress and prevent the build-up of energy that leads to burn out. My outlets involve a mixture of physical activity as well as volunteer work. At challenging points in the semester, I employ these outlets as a way to blow off steam and bring perspective to my situation as well as improving my mental wellbeing. My physical outlets include rock climbing and lyra. I try to regularly do these activities because they are not only enjoyable, but they are great methods of exercise. My volunteer work includes anything with animals, usually with different animal shelters or wildlife rehabilitations. I genuinely believe that you cannot remain in an unpleasant mood as long as you are caring for an animal. I have never met an individual who can frown while petting a furry friend."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2752,"When life gets challenging whether it be in the form of a hard time from loved ones, strangers, or mother nature, I tend to opt for the path of least resistance. For example last night i worked late from 7:45-9:15 and got home around 10:30. I am fortunate enough to have grandparents that save dinner lukewarm for me when I return. Unfortunate I was very annoyed that my grandfather had the audacity to tell me to eat faster and ""stop looking at screen, I am waiting"" because apparently I cannot clean up and put everything away the way they prefer it to. Rather than show me, they still want to ""call the shots around here"". What is even more of a seemingly waste of fucking effort is when I take the time and effort to keep my room clean by recycling bottles and soda cans, hours later much to my dismay I find everything single can, bottle, cardboard box (used for compost) on display at the kitchen counter. Now realistically I understand he is just doing his best the way he knows how to ""save the earth"" with what pathetic effort he can muster, but it has been made clear that this sucks. All other family members detest it. To solve this, I simply prefer to eat my dinner alone away from the compost sight and stench that desecrates the kitchen and dining area. So fucking uncivilized and the worst part is that you simply can not blame him because of his old age, he is infallible. ""Oh, he is too old to change"", etc. so I have been told. All I can do is run away or keep the problem at arms length. I am afraid that these problems I face really bring out the apathy in me or rather the ""dark side"" of me because when his time comes, good riddance"" I just have enough respect and am not so desperate to not outright berate and unleash the combined anger although I truly came close when he caused my grandmother to cry by yelling at her when she forgot to turn the kitchen faucet all the way closed and it was only dripping a few drops a second for no more than 15 minutes."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2750,When life gets challenging I take a step back and look at myself from an outside perspective. More often than not I overwhelm myself by hyperfizting on the smallest of details. Although details matter they should not dictate every single movement. This need for ubsecure details leads to a continuous cycle that circulates around my engrossment with myself. By shifting perspectives I am able to realize that not everything matters. I must enjoy my life outside of school and make the most of life. Soon after the change of perspective I indulge in small activities that have nothing to do with the amount of my productivity. Being able to separate myself from what is stressful is key.This can be in the form of watching my favorite reality tv shows to doing touristy things around the city. The key detail is that I make time for myself and remember that everything is not that serious.  
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2747,"When life gets challenging for me, I have so many different things I do to distract me or help me calm down from stressful things going on in my life. Sometimes, I will use cleaning as a distraction from stressful or overwhelming things that are happening to me. Other times, I will use cooking/baking to help me relieve stress at overwhelming points in my life as well. However, most of the time, I am lucky enough to hang out with my friends and family to help my own mental health. For example, going out with my friends or boyfriend help me to not think about certain things I have been trying to avoid. Although it would be nice to address the challenge, I enjoy taking time for myself and not stressing too much about things that are out of my control. Another thing I forgot to add in is that I really enjoy using the gym and lifting weights to help me when things in life become challenging. It is therapeutic and allows me to destress easily. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2758,"I don’t have one specific way in which I react when confronted with a problem. Sometimes I try to solve that problem, sometimes I sleep it off and better evaluate it the next day, other times I completely ignore it until it becomes a bigger problem. However, I found that talking with people or journaling about my problems helps. It helps to physically say and release the emotions I am feeling, to speak my thoughts instead of just keeping them bottled in my head. When I discuss my problems out loud, the problem sounds much more different than when I would think about it in my head. It also helps when the other person gives me advice. Journaling is more helpful to me when I am already over the challenge. It helps solidify in written words my final thoughts. Solidify the lesson that needed to be learned, rather than mentally note it. For example, this week I was facing some financial problems that I had ignored until I couldn’t anymore. When confronted with this problem I instinctively told a friend about it and he made me realize the seriousness of the problem and put it in a perspective I had not seen before. I’ve gotten some help with the problem but I wouldn't say the problem is solved."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2754,"I think that I try to focus on why my life is so challenging at the moment. I look at it and think of ways to solve the problem. Although, sometimes I look at the problem and ignore it until it is no longer a problem for me. I cannot do this for school. My largest challenge right now is making it to class. I'm struggling because I'm physically and mentally exhausted. Theirs only 3-4 weeks of school left and I want to finish school with good grades. I'm worried about physics because I don't know what my grade is in the class. It gives me a lot of anxiety to not know. I want to focus on doing the best I can. I try to approach a challenge in an optimistic way. I look at everything that I can do and I try to solve it. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2746,"At the beginning of the semester, my internship took up a lot of my time. I was struggling between my part-time job, internship, and being a full-time student all at once. It began hard to manage my time properly as I had to pick and choose what I wanted to focus on out all of all of the tasks that I needed to complete. I learned during this time the importance of having free-time or just a few breaks within the day as I was constantly ruching to do the next thing. I had a choice to continue my part time job through a different company once the job was over, but I decided it would be best if I took a break to allow time for myself, so I wouldn't be so stressed out. I definitely had to find a balance between being productive and being stressed at a very unhealthy level. I now know my limit of what is too much to handle all at once. Now as I am only focusing on being a student and working at my internship, I am able to get everything done at a reasonable time, while also allowing time for me to spend time with my friends."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2757,What to do when life gets challenging? First thing I do is take a step back and try to come up with a plan to take on whatever challenge presents itself. Life in my pov is 95% life and 5% decisions we make. Humans tend to overreact to a lot of things and make their problems more complex. In my opinion taking a step back reflecting on the challenge and coming up with a plan will be more effective. Even though you fail you'll be closer to overcoming than if you hadn't tried.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2756,"When life gets challenging, I usually ask for help. Whether it's from a classmate, a teacher, or a counselor. I may also just look it up on the internet for solutions or to have more info on certain things. If it's not school-related and it's about life then I like to go on runs or walks to clear my mind. I'll listen to music or watch something to take my mind off of things. When I get a fresh perspective, I attempt something again or just look at something in a different way."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2751,"Life is just overall challenging in general, so I feel like every choice is sort of just me finding ways to cope with what is going on around me. When things become too challenging, I tend to try and find ways to distract myself or take a break. I hang out with friends or my partner. I think just being surrounded by people that make me feel safe and loved definitely helps when life is challenging. Sometimes I also will just go on hikes or try and get outdoors or around plants. I have been utilizing our school's greenhouse a lot lately because handling/working with plants has become a sort of therapy for me when times are tough. definitely feel relaxed and ready to tackle difficult tasks once I am finished. I think keeping myself busy and happy is how I deal with challenges; I basically just distract myself from pain as much as possible. Maybe doesn't sound too healthy in theory but it helps. "
