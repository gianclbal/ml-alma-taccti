2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2754,"My family has taught me to be patient and hard-working. I have always had support for what I've wanted to do. This semester has taught me that my professors will try to support and accommodate me. I struggled during March and everyone was able to give me extensions. It was tough to catch up from missing two weeks of work. I was stressed at the time because my grandma was so sick. I just found out that she has had a fever for two days and it's tough on my family. I'm stressed about my biology final. My final project from my Asian American Women's class is also due tomorrow. I'm stressed out about my grade in physics because my professor hasn't graded any of my tests. I have struggled with my sleep, time management, family issues, and my social life. I have struggled to balance everything. In the summer, I'm going to focus on time management and how to stay on top of everything. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2751,"Gosh I don't even know how to answer this question honestly. I guess like my family's support has kept me motivated to get through each semester. My family really values knowledge and growth and I think through them constantly pushing me I have been able to sort of get out of my comfort zone and try new things in the city. I definitely think my passion for nature and life has really helped me figure out what I want to do in college and what I may want to do in the future. My dad has a real big connection to the city and the lifestyle here which I think is what has kept me here, but I think now I am starting to listen to my mom's value in following your heart and your truth and I think I may try and transfer schools to a place that is more suitable for my major. Also, my boyfriend is transferring too and I want to be with him so I am hoping that in following my heart, both things will work out for me. Life is short and I know my family really values my happiness which has really gotten me through college. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2753,"My family has inspired me throughout my college career through their own journey and experiences. Seeing my family succeed in the ways that they have through perseverance and determination has definitely pushed me to do the same in my life. I believe that the confidence they’ve given me growing up, and pushing me constantly has allowed me to get to where I am so far. Whenever I wanted to give up or stop doing something, my family would keep pushing me and tell me to keep going. Their constant support in everything I do makes me continue my day and finish strong. Through their own lives that they live, they inspire me to live my life to my full extent. I’m grateful to have them all as role models, caregivers, and family. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2747,"The values of my community as well as my family have helped me greatly through my few years of college I have experienced. I was extremely nervous to start college so soon after graduating high school because I felt like a part of me was still stuck in high school. I “graduated” high school as a part of the class of 2020 so I never got to really experience such great memories to the end of my high school career. My family and friends have definitely helped support me through this by verbally and emotionally telling me what I can do to keep going, and it has been amazing having a support system!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2746,"My family has always supported me with my plans after high school. They always said that they would encourage me with whatever my decision would be, and I wanted to attend college. An important value from family is the responsibility factor with school. I have always felt a sense of responsibility when it comes to attending my courses as well as completing assignments for each class. An additional value has been kindness towards others. I have many people this term, and it is always important to be friendly and approachable. I am trying to get more in touch with my extroverted side and being talkative and friendly from the start has allowed me meet some great people. Volunteering in my community was also important to me. I have been working as an intern for the Environmental Resource Center since the beginning of the fall term. It has been nice to be involved with other community members who were also interested in environmental topics. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2755,"Initially, navigating through college was challenging because no one in my family had gone before. I went to a poor public school with few resources so I was unaware of how/when to apply for scholarships and how to locate what scholarships I may be eligible for. I had not started thinking about what I wanted to do for college until the middle of my senior year because the thought was not fostered, and I had never considered when I should think about it. The values of my high school and family were not looking out for my best interest. Once I got to my community college, the values shifted, and my success was more valued. The community at my college, including the financial aid office, mentors, and advising counselors, helped me understand what expectations to have and how to navigate my way properly and successfully towards my degree. I am proud to say now that I have received a few scholarships including the recent BioHensill scholarship at this school."
