2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2755,"My main short-term goal is to graduate with my BS in Zoology in the next couple semesters. I would also like for my internship with the Oakland Zoo to work out this summer as well as my research with my lab group at SFSU to go smoothly. More long-term, my goal is to get a job with the Oakland Zoo working on research, conservation, and animal care, as well as continuing to work part-time in my current field in occupational therapy. This class will help me achieve these goals by filling a degree requirement for my graduation. This class also teaches me the way physics impacts my daily life. The mechanics of physics as it applies to daily living is something I never considered before and something I think a little bit more about currently while is this class. I am hoping I can apply the knowledge I acquire here to practical use outside of this class."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2754,"My goals are to be successful. I try to be the best that I can be. I am able to do everything that I want to do. My goals would have to be becoming a dermatologist. It is something that I have been interested in a while. I feel like this class is able to help me achieve my goals because it makes me a step closer to graduating. I want to be able to go to medical school. This class will prepare me for the Mcat. This is my first-time taking physics and it can be confusing to remember everything. I will be reviewing everything that I have learned so far in order to better prepare for my test on March 2nd. Physics is very complicated and then simple at times. I will need to review magnitude, normal force, net force, friction, tension, weight, and free body diagrams. Passing this class is a step in me achieving my goals. My goal is to become successful. I want to do right by my family. I want to become the best version of myself. My goal is to be successful enough so my parents will not struggle in life anymore."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2746,"My goal for this class, is to get a basic understanding of basic physics concepts. This is my first physics class I have taken, so it has been a little intimidating in this beginning.  I want to be able to use the knowledge I have learned in my lecture class, and apply it in in labs that we will perform in this class. Even though learning the concepts is more important than the grade, I still do want to maintain a high GPA. I want to be able to gain a grade in this class which represents my ability to learn the concepts and apply them in real life situations. I also would like to meet some new people in this class, because I tend to do better in my classes when I have peers to collaborate with. Finally, I want to be able to become a little less intimidated by physics. With these being all very new concepts, I am a little uneasy about the class, but I believe with time, I'll be able to become a little more comfortable with the material. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2757,"My goals in this class is to understand the world of physics better. So far I'm struggling in the main physics section, but when I come to lab I get a more hands on feel on what I'm doing in lecture. This class not only changes my thinking it reinforces what I'm learning in lecture. My understanding seems to be increasing after each week. Hopefully I leave today's class with even more understanding on forces."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2752,"My goals remain mostly the same in terms of working towards a biochemistry degree and landing in some sort of lab science career. This class is helping me achieve that goal by setting aside dedicated time to practice and explore physics.  I will admit that with the release of the Elden Ring video game and my need to find a girlfriend as well as just friends in general, it makes staying focused on task rather difficult.  Admittedly my chemistry class is giving me the most trouble and because it is so early in the morning, I have difficulty staying awake. It is also because it is online and because I am at home, it is all too easy to become distracted by going on my phone or playing YouTube or a game in the background or on my second monitor. The physics lecture is similar but even though I am in person in the class room I still have difficulty staying focused."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2750,For this class I want to be able to understand physics at a comprentable level. Meaning that I can apply physics in and outside the class.For example I understand the forces and principles behind a soccer ball being kicked in the air. To achieve my goal I must dedicate myself to physics by studying often and seeking out help when needed. Another goal of mine when in this class is to sharpen my comprehension skills. Within physics there are problems that will give information without being completely direct. From this people must use information they do know to create the bigger picture in the end. From my time in physics I understand that  strengthening my comprehension will help my understanding of physics tremendously. To improve my skills I must consistently use repetition to my advantage. If I continuously work and solve problems I can start to identify information much quicker and create a system that works best for my learning style. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2751,"I think my goals are to be comfortable with calling myself a scientist. I want to be proud of my major and get my degree. I know that having a degree from a university is not everything but it is still one of my goals in life. I want to be able to say that I have one in Biology and that I worked my butt off to get it, doing all these science classes and labs back to back. This class teaches me concepts and how to analyze situations and ask the right questions. In physics we learn how to set up situations and draw pictures. We address what we know and then try to fill in the spaces for what we don’t know and I believe that is an important skill I will need go carry into all of my courses. Science is all about asking these questions and filling in the gaps with facts, tests, and mathematics. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2749,"My goals in this class are to understand the material so I can apply it to my homework, the upcoming exam and in my own life. When in lecture, I don’t really understand what is going on. I’m just taking notes along with the class. Lecture class is bigger and it's harder to ask questions. It’s kinda scary too. This class is helping me achieve my goals by applying the content with my peers. I am able to learn better when I am able to do the work myself. Kinda like hands-on. I can’t learn if someone is just showing me how to do something. I also enjoy working with the peers I am with. We help each other solve problems and encourage each other to learn. I feel that this is a healthy working situation because we are respectful towards each other which makes this space great for learning. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2756,"My goal is to take this class and get a good grade, I needed a lab class for my GE requirements. I took physics several years ago and never took the lab class. Trying to remember all the concepts has been a struggle as I can't do my best to help my class mates. I have to go over the instruction notes to make sure I'm on the right track and try my hardest to help the people around me. I do enjoy the lab activities because I can visualize all the concepts I have previously learned."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2748,"My goals for this class are to learn how to understand physics with experiments and to see how it all comes together in the real world. We apply what we learn in class and we do practical exercises but also debate with our peers to gain a deeper understanding of the material. I imagine I will be using a lot of these concepts for my future career as it is in physical therapy. Depending on the area I end up in maybe more or less. But I do find it fascinating. I already have concepts that we are using in my anatomical kinesiology that our professor says we will learn in physics and gives us a brief broad explanation of what we are dealing with. I am learning a lot by working with the experiments and understanding the concepts well. This class does a good job to go over the material we learn from in lectures and applying it to real-life scenarios. I like how I am becoming more aware of my surroundings and everyday life events. I know that I haven't even scraped the top layer of this discipline, but it is quite intriguing. I will be taking a whole year of physics for my future grad school stuff, so if I learn the basics it makes everything easier. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2753,"My goals for this class and goals in general are to follow precise direction and be as accurate as I can in my analysis and action. I think that this class will help me achieve these goals directly through the direction and analysis I will be completing throughout the lab. Whether it is following direction given in the packet, or analyzing the work done in class, this class should help me practice these skills in order to apply them into my daily life or even to other classes. The basis of these labs gives me confidence that they will be great tools for me to practice following precise directions, especially if it is necessary to follow such direction for the lab. At the end of today, I hope to be more accurate in my analysis, and take some of this accuracy with me as I handle the rest of my tasks during the day. "
