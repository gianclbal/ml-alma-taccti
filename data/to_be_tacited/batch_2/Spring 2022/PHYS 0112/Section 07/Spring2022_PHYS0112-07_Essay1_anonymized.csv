Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2746,"“Why am I here”The main reason for why I am in this class is due to the requirements for my major. I am majoring in Environmental Science and one of the lower division requirements is to take physics. I wasn’t very excited when I first heard about this, but I am now both excited and nervous. I have never taken a physics class, so this is very new to me. The only physics I have encountered was during my science class in middle school. It has been a long time since then, so I am hoping to improve my knowledge of physics. If you were to ask more about why I am here at San Francisco state as a whole, that was due to hard work that I put into through high school. I am a first generation college student, so it was a big deal when I decided that I wanted to go to college."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2747,"I believe that everyone who is brought into this world was put here for a reason, and I strongly believe that everything happens for a reason. I think that I am here to make a change in the world and to make a change in everyone’s life that I come across. The world is huge and I feel like there are endless activities to complete, so it is hard to believe that I myself could just make a change in the world. I like to think of everyone as a puzzle piece, and we all play a huge role in this giant life puzzle. Improving communities whether that be by cleaning up streets or fixing up public parks takes at least a dozen or more people, and that just shows how much we rely on those around us when help is needed. Now thinking of “why am I here” on a simpler level, I am in this physics course to expand my knowledge on well, physics. I am here because I signed up for this course in hopes to complete a prerequisite I needed to fill, and I am excited to see what this course has to offer. I have taken only one physics class and that was my freshmen year of highschool, so I hope to make a change in this class and help my peers out as we go through this journey together!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2748,"I am here because I am on a journey, I really am focused on achieving my career goals of becoming a physical therapist, or an athletic trainer. But I am in this class because it is a requisite for graduating in Kinesiology which is my second step (my first being graduating from a Community college with an ADT in Kinesiology). Physics has a lot to do with my major so I am happy and willing to learn the material. I also find it really fascinating although sometimes it is hard for me to understand the material. In a way, I feel like physics is going to be a big part of my major but I don't want to dedicate my future to it because I am more interested in Biology, anatomy and physiology. This is only the second week and I already feel a little overwhelmed, but I am going to make sure I stay on it and try to understand it as best as possible. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2749,"I am here because I am studying Microbiology to become a Medical Technologist or a Clinical Lab Scientist. I am in this class to learn physics and it's in my requirements. I am not a physics student, so I’m just here to fulfill the requirement. I am excited to learn and do well in this class even though I am a bit overwhelmed. The last time I took physics was my freshman year of highschool, and I remember struggling with the subject. I got C’s in all of my previous science classes here at SFSU, and I am ready to change that. My goal is to have at least a B at the end of this semester in this class and in my Bio class. I hope to also stray away from all things that distract me and encourage me to procrastinate. I would like to do better for myself and my future. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2750,I chose to enroll in physics because it is a requirement for a major. Although a requirement for my major physics has always peaked my interested. However I never fully dipped my toe into it because of the constant horror stories and bad experienced I faced throughout my academic career. But universe gave me a not to subtle push to take physic and now I am here. I will not lie and say   that I am not nervous for this class but you got do what you got to to. So I am here to fulfill a requirement for my Maori bu also learn more about the science that intimidated and fascinated me for years.  
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2751,"I have little to no idea why I am here. I guess the “right” answer is to learn, because I am here to learn. Why am I in physics? Well because it is a requirement for my major if we are being honest. I don’t really understand or necessarily enjoy physics as a topic. I really just want to be able to take the upper division courses in biology so I can actually learn what interests me. I think I am here to obtain knowledge and help something. I’ve always wanted to make some sort of change or impact. I am here so that I can hopefully learn about plants and how we affect them or can help slow our impacts to the earth. Personally, I don’t really see my “field” being available for very long considering how bad global warming is and how far down the line we seem to be, so where I am and what I am doing could be utterly meaningless. I still think gaining the knowledge I set out to learn and finishing school is why I am here and is the first step in my growth as an individual and understandin gof our world. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2752,"""Why am I here"". I feel as though the reason I am here is because I am motivated to meet new people especially after forcing myself to stay home for the majority of the school and off school times, save tennis with family and to buy food.  Of course there is obviously my career path and how it feels like if I were not studying for something or being productive, my grandparents and parents being the asian parents they are would potentially kick me out since I am now 21.  It is understandable, why should a parent who invested hundreds of thousands of dollars let a fully grown adult freeload food and play videogames all day long? It is this fear that drives and motivates me to always balance doing something productive with my time be it studying, working, or helping my grandparents out which I am currently living with. In this case and as of this moment why I am present and early to every zoom meeting to the best of my ability."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2753,"I am here in order to learn, grow, and prosper. I am hoping to come to this class to apply what I have learned in the lecture and understand the topics in a more visual way. This lab will help me conceptualize the topics and hopefully apply them to real life situations in order for me to truly understand the course overall. The goal will be for me to try and learn all that is taught to me, while being able to display it in the labs and any forms of test or quizzes. Understanding the way the world works physically, through the laws of nature, is essentially why I'm here. I don't know much about physics to begin with, and I think this class will open up my mind in a broader sense. Even though I am not a physics major exactly, I know that these laws will help my biology major overall, and create a connected network of nature that will definitely aid my understanding in Biology. Aside from the fact that it is a major requirement, I am truly excited to learn. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2754,"I am here because this class is required; however, that is not the only reason. This is my first-time taking physics and I feel excited and nervous at the same time. I am going to the best that I can. I feel like I have to because of all the hardships my family has gone through. I want to be able to graduate and have a successful career for my parents. My parents had almost nothing when they came to the US and now, I have to be the one to fulfill their dreams along with my own. I feel privileged to be able to have an education in the US. I am striving to end all my family’s hardships. I want to be able to put an end to the generational trauma that my family suffers from. I am here to create a better future for the people I care about.    "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2755,"I am not entirely sure what this question is asking, so I am going to answer it in two different ways. If “here” is referring to some existential principle, then my life purpose at this point in my existence is to find happiness and peace while surviving the rules that society and government throw at me. My happiness can be linked to being outdoors with nature and with animals, so I am hoping to find a career that can utilize both of those factors.   If “here” is referring to this physics class, then that is a more simple answer. I am completing this class as a major course requirement and this one fit my schedule best. I wish I had more of a passion and excitement for this class, but truthfully I am very nervous. I traditionally do very well in science classes, but I have never taken a physics class before, and so far on this week two I am not feeling terribly confident. I wish I could tell you “I am here because I love physics!”, but really I am here because I am told to be and I am hoping that I pass! That doesn’t mean I won’t work hard though!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2756,"The reason I am here is that I need a lab class, and have always had a curiosity about science more specifically physics. Physics is one of the more hands-on sciences and I have always preferred being hands-on than just reading something in a textbook. I am currently taking a majority of art and design classes, so having something completely different to think about helps break from the routine. Physics and science are more concrete than art in my opinion because art has different interpretations, and science is more fact and theory-based. Having a mix of classes can help change my way of thinking by taking different subjects and ways of thought to make something different."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2757,"I am here because of my requirements to graduate. I must take Chemistry and Physics in order to graduate. Why am I in this class is simple it was the best fit for my schedule. Overall I am really excited to meet everyone in person, and learn the wonders of physics. I really don't have much to say so I am going to end it here."
