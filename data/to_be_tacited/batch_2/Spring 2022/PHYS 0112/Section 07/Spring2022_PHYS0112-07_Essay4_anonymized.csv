2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2755,"While studying at San Francisco State, I have key resources to support me. The campus offers a wide variety of support such as financial assistance, mental health resources, physical health resources, and a student service center to help guide students towards whatever resources they might need. The campus also has a career service center that helps support resume building as well as job and internship placements. I also have a major and academic advisor that helps assist me in choosing my classes for each semester and help project my future while at this school. Outside of campus, I have social support from my friends and can use them as resources if need be. Finally, I have the support of my previous degree and licensure board to help me obtain and maintain a stable job while in school in order to support me financially during this time. These resources together help me to be successful while at this university."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2757,The Resources I have to support me well it depends on what I'm going up against. If it's school I know that I can talk and approach my professors so that they can guide me in a good direction. YouTube videos and a couple Google searches also have supported me in the past. Now in the real world its a little trickier it all depends for me I know I have my family and job for Resources. Overall I think I have a fairly good amount of resources to approach if I'm ever in need of them.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2751,"I guess sometimes I don't feel like I have too much support. I tend to put most of the pressure on myself to get things done. I would say that my family and my boyfriend are big resources that I use daily for emotional support when trying to get through my days or schoolwork. As far as actual resources of support I guess I have the internet which has been a huge development in transitioning with partial online learning. I use tools like notability to take detailed notes and record lectures. I also often use Chegg as a resource to study when I am confused on questions. I also have a job that is a huge resource for me financially. I need the money I get from my work, and I also get food which is a huge assistance as a pretty broke college student. I think my family at work is super supportive. I feel like I have a pretty solid basis of things and people that support me in life and school. There are also so many campus resources. The student health center has been a lot of help in supporting me while I figure out my insurance up in San Francisco. There are so many things to utilize. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2746,"Here at SF State, I feel that I have a lot of resources if needed. The health center has helped me in the past with injuries, and was very helpful as most of the fees were included in tuition. It is a big help knowing that I am able to reach medical assistance if needed without the worry of added expenses. I am also aware that there is a great tutoring program here if I ever need help with any of my classes. I haven't used this yet, but I know I can if needed. I am also a part of metro, so I know that I can always reach out to my advisors if I ever need help with classes, or just anything in general. The main resources I currently use are through my friends and family. I have met a lot of people here on campus, and I know I would have a large network of people to support me in general. My family is always a great resource as they have helped me since the beginning. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2747,"When it comes to resources available at this university, we are given a lot of resources. They offer a student health services, available for anyone who is in need of any medical support, and I myself have been able to go there and get support. There are also gator groceries, a program made here at SFSU that allows students to get a box of groceries weekly for free. I have only used that resource once, but I appreciate the support and I am glad I was able to share that information with other students around campus. Although they do offer resources, it is very hard to get academic support at this school. I have tried countless times to reach out to advisors for advice regarding my courseload, and they don’t try very hard to support, so I do wish they could improve that. Overall, the support we are given does help and I am very grateful."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2752,I have my personal gaming computer which I worked several semesters at a tennis club back in Santa Rosa to earn. I also have my father's 2011 Toyota highlander hybrid to get around town and I also have recently gotten accustomed to using the municipal transports being the N-car/train and buses. I also have my grandparent's home to stay in and a larger room to stay in all to myself except on weekends when my father visits.  I also have a racquet stringer machine that I use to string my own tennis racquets. Fortunately I also have enough room to store sealed snacks so I do not have to go upstairs and interact with my grandparent's gross fridge.  Also fortunately my work at the Lisa Goldman tennis center in golden gate park allows me to use their open courts free of charge for when I need to exercise.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2748,"Here at school, we have many resources that are available to us that I haven't looked into yet. But I have spoken to my teachers and they are very kind and understanding so I believe that is one resource we have that directly interacts with our school work. But other resources the university offers that can be helpful to me are counselors and our academic advisors. And it is just a question of reaching out and making connections. But at home, I have so much support from my family which I don't think I would have ever gotten to this point without. So I am very grateful to my family because they are so understanding and just want me to be happy. They always offer themselves up to help or even simply talk about our everyday life. It is not have much to do with school but I definitely have a great support system in and out of school. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2754,"Some of the resources that I have to support me are my friends and family.  I moved to San Francisco in February. I didn't know anyone and I was very lonely. I ended up joining a sorority. I've made many amazing friends because of this. They are always there for me when I need them. My family has supported me throughout my move here and they have been helping me become a better person. I also have the support of all my professors. My grandma was sick a little while ago and everyone was able to accommodate my family emergency. I was able to still come back and be on track so I would not fail my classes. It was a huge relief to have that kind of support from my professors. Some other resources I have are our counselors and EOP. If I'm confused about anything, I can ask and get an answer within the same day."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2750,"In my life I have many people who support him especially during my most difficult times. They create an atmosphere in which I am able to make mistakes and grow from them. My family, friends, and partner only want the best for me. This is expressed in many different ways. Such as going on silly trips to hate watching corny movies. In the end they pick me up when I do not have the strength to carry myself at times. Another support resource I have for myself is knowing my boundaries and limits. Oftentimes I want to push myself to be and do the best. Although good is small  doses I can hyperfocus and go to the extreme. To combat this I check in with myself and assess the situation. I make sure I am not compromising myself in order to inch a little more forward to reach my goal. From all of my resources I am able to have a healthy and balanced environment that aids in my intellectual and personal growth. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2753,"The resources that I have to support me are most definitely accessible to me in the way that I live. Whether it is is school, soccer, or my personal life, I have always had resources to support me whenever I find the need for additional help. Specifically for school, there are tutoring resources that can help me learn the material in a thorough manner. These resources are accessible to all students at SFSU and are great resources to support students. Regarding soccer, I have a counselor, a trainer, and a coach to help me navigate whatever difficulties I have or will have on and off the field. These resources definitely support me and allow me to succeed in the best way I possible can. Regarding my personal life, the counseling services at SFSU are great ways to express myself and find emotional outlets regarding topics I find the need to talk about. Although I have my counselor, the services provided by the school are definitely other valid options. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2749,"The resources I have to support me are my professors, tutoring on campus, the internet, and my classmates who know the content well enough to help me. I have not been using many of these resources because I am scared to ask for help. I also don’t think I need help but I need to get on it! I have let work pile up and I have not gotten around to doing any of it! The end of the year is coming quickly so I should find the energy and time to grind out my work. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2756,"The resources I have to support me are my friends and family for moral and emotional support. My family has made sacrifices with time and money to help me get to where I am today, and without them, I wouldn't be here. They are also reliable which is something not everyone is lucky to have. My friends also help me academically, and morally. They support me in ways that my family can't and without them, I also wouldn't be where I am today. Besides those people professors have helped me with moral support and academically supporting in me. Without them, I would probably just have failed my classes or would have been discouraged to continue school."
