2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2773,My goals are to graduate with my bachelors degree in biology and work fulltime for a year and apply for optometry school. Lately I have been questioning what my goals are as of right now I'm living day by day I'm not sure what I want to do with my life. I feel pretty overwhelmed with everything right now but my main focus is to graduate college. From there will see what happens. This class is helping me achieve these goals in the way that if I don't take this class I can't graduate and it helps me understand a bit more what we learn in lectures. To be honest I'm not sure I'll ever need physics for optometry school but at the same time you never know. My focus right now is to find motivation to continue school because everyday that passes I feel like dropping out.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2782,"My goal is simple to graduate college and to get a better understanding of physics. It also helps that I'm required to take this class in order to graduate but gaining knowledge never hurt anyone either. Well, simple Without this course I would not have the ability to further my education so by taking this class it is another step towards acquiring my bachelor's degree. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2768,"My career goal would be to major in Biology (Physiology) and continue my education to work in the medical field. I have always been interested in working within the medical field. I’ve been working at a Nursing and Rehabilitation Center for the past three years as a Recreation Therapist. I love getting to know all the patients/residents at my facility grow and work hard with all the tasks I had for them. After transferring facilities to San Francisco I had to leave behind my work family, which is what we call each other, family. Working with so many patients and the interdisciplinary team they all motivated me to continue my career goal. With the events of 2020 it has made me work even harder to reach my career goal/educational goal by studying Biology and working in the healthcare service. Working as a Recreation Therapist was very challenging and dangerous as my coworkers and I were working with COVID patients. Being alongside nurses and watching them fight to take care of our patients encouraged me to reach even further with my educational goal. Completing this class will help me learn more about physics and bring me closer to my goal. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2779,"My goal is to graduate from a four-year university with a bachelor's degree in biology and a concentration in physiology. In order to do that and further pursue a career in medicine or something in relation to it, I need to fulfill the requirements of the university as well as the department. Though I have never taken a formal physics class nor do I think physics is a particular strong suit of mine, I am glad to be taking this course as it is giving me a broader understanding of what science can be outside of biology. Physics is a requirement and this class is helping me fulfill that requirement, but it is also a way for me to be a more well-rounded scholar which is a lifelong goal of mine.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2764,"My goals is to just live a stable life, while living for God. I don’t necessarily want to be rich or nothing, but just stable/comfortable. I know the Lord will provide. And that His plans for me are good.This class helps me in terms of discipline. Helps me discipline my time better. And being disciplined will help one go far in life. It’s a good and useful trait to have and/or to have. In fact, God Himself helps me discipline myself, and everything that’s in my life better. And since this class has its work due at the end of lab, I have to discipline myself better into using my time wisely as well as utilize the resources given if I need help. Teaching me that time is money definitely. And that time is something that you can’t take back. So don’t waste any of your time, only getting older. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2776,"My main goal right now to is graduate on time and get into the CLS program to be a CLS. This class is one of the required classes for my major so by taking it, it helps ticks off another check box on the list of classes I need to take to earn my Biology degree. I don't think physics has much if any relation to the career I want to get into but I still find the material interesting."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2778,My goals are to get an Earth Science BA degree and I hope to use this class to further extend my knowledge of how the world works arounds and I hope that these labs and practice problems help me achieve this goal and use these examples in everyday life activities. I would like to use Physics examples to broad my knowledge of other topics that I am learning about and see how they connect with each other. I also want to see how these labs connect with the lecture portion of the lab. I also want to get a broad understanding of Physics and al the topics/math involved in this subject. I also just want to get an understanding of how everything is in motion and all the ways things work in the world. This class and the lectures also help me with being productive and gives me plenty of assignments to focus on.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2775,"My goals are to be able to graduate from SFSU with my degree in Kinesiology to be able to pursue my career choice, which is a physical therapist. This class is one of the classes that I need to be able to graduate with my major and holds important information that I will need to know in order to pursue my career path. This class helps reinforce the information I learn in the lecture portion of the class and will help me continue through school and be able to graduate successfully and become and eventually physical therapist. Topics in physics that we have been covering like vectors, motion, etc. are very important to Kinesiology class. In fact, I am actually taking an anatomical kinesiology class at the same time I am taking this course and I am already seeing the information I have learned about in this class come up in some points of the lectures in my anatomical kinesiology class. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2772,"My goals are to graduate from college with a bachelor's degree in biology, where I can apply with this degree to competitive graduate school programs such as biomedical engineering or a physician assistant. After graduating I really want to have a balanced routine where I would focus on my studies but at the same time maintain a healthy social life. Apart from this class being one of the requirements for my major, I think that this class is teaching me important virtues, such as being punctual with deadlines and getting work done as a team. Also, I think that this class is also helping me succeed in the lecture portion of this class as it helps me understand the concepts discussed in the lecture. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2765,"My goals are to graduate with my Bsci in MCB, along with a minor and a certificate in computer science. My goal is to get a decent'y high paying job with those degrees and to be able to get my masters while working in bioinformatics. Then to save money, buy a home in the Bay Area or San Diego and start a family. I want to contribute to the sciences by getting papers published in journals. This class helps me achieve my goals because it is a requirement for me to graduate. It will further my knowledge in physical sciences and help me learn if I am interested in possibly pursuing something physics related in bioinformatics. Bioinformatics is known to draw ideas from physics as well. I know that physics is a part of our every day life even if we don't realize it. I'm hoping this lab will make me more aware of the real-life physics going on around me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2783,I guess my goals are just to be able to do what I want. Financially my family hasn’t been the most stable so getting through college and getting to a point where I am stable enough to help me do all the things I want to do and then also help the rest of my family especially my younger brother is my goal. It’s really short and pretty boring. That's the base of my goals though. This class helps me get there simply by being a part of what I’m majoring in and studying.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2763,"My ultimate goal in life is to be a physical therapist. I also have many individual goals for myself. Currently I do competitive weightlifting and have just recently hit a 735lb deadlift and now I am pushing 8. On my squat I have hit 540 and looking for 6. Learning movement and having a passion for movement outside of just school learning has made the in school learning much easier. This class in specific is giving me the basic fundamental understanding of how objects move when different forces are acted upon them, as well as how to calculate movement. These types of foundational understandings are what will help guide me to achieving my goals becoming a physical therapist. Having a strong foundational knowledge of physics is a pre req for most of the meat in my degree plan. This class is a stepping stone to get me to the next stone, and the next and so on. This class has been very good about giving me enough examples to build a foundational understandings of the topics discussed."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2269,"My goals bounce from one thing to another on a daily basis. I would say as of lately though they been pretty consistent. I love the business side of things specifically entrepreneurship.Having/creating my own business is my dream goal that I hope to soon accomplish. I enjoy the idea of being my own boss and having others report to me. This class aside for the education/learning aspect of it of course is helping me work/communicate within teams, ask questions and work with topics/ideas that I may not be to sure about.   "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2761,"My goal primarily is to finish college. Being on my 5th year college has been an experience to say the least. I do believe though that all of the courses I have taken up until this point has expanded my horizon so while I want to finish as soon as possible I have to acknowledge all of the experience I've had and how it has furthered my understanding of the world. As for specific goals for after college, it is still unclear. Having changed my major halfway through my senior year I am more or less at a crossroad in my life so I still have a lot of thinking to do with trying to figure out what I want to do in life. I am pretty much using my major requirements to dip my toes in a variety of fields and see which one stands out the most. So far all of them has been interesting but animal physiology has been an interesting field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2784,My goals are to become a wildlife rehabilitation but more directly and in this moment I am hoping to do well in my courses so I can graduate knowing I did it right. This class has some similitude with my other courses so it helps to be doing similar things right now and being able to refresh in my classes with one another.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2785,"My goals in terms of career wise is to become an optometrist. I wish to get my BS and finish my undergrad, and from there go to optometry school in order to get my doctorate. This class is helping me achieve these goals because it is a prerequisite not only to finishing my undergrad, but for getting to grad school. The content that I’m learning is a foundation for my practice in the future. In addition, physics is a subject that I always found quite interesting, but at hindsight seems quite difficult. This class challenges me to reach out of my comfortability in STEM courses.  Physics is also a core subject that is a part of the OAT exam, which is a required exam in order to get into optometry school. My goal is to also have range of subjects under my belt while I’m attending SFSU, and this class is supplementing that by giving me new subject matter to explore."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2759,"What are my goals if specific about this class, I want to be able to complete all my assignments without delay. I work full time, so I'm always tired, and its frustrating when you miss an assignment and have to catch up. My goal for this class is to complete assignments on time and to understand the concepts of physics truly. This class heps achieve my goals by the professor being lenient with late work and giving the opportunity to make up for it on time. This class also helps with understanding the concepts. I do feel as if these simulations take extremely long, but its interesting to do. But main goals for this class is to pass and that all starts with managing time correctly and pushing through work and school even if I'm tired, I need to be able to continue and power my mind to be successful in this class and any other class"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2774,"My goals is to graduate and get into a pa program. I need this class in order to get my degree. My goal overall is to be happy. I do not like labeling particular things because i don't think one particular thing will guarantee happiness. I think trying to do everything on time and organize my work will help with being happy and graduating. I should have graduated by now , but I a few classes have held me back and its hard because I do not think I am dumb and incapable. I just think life can get pretty hard and trying to pursue a education while juggling work is hard. Overall, if I pass physics I will be happy. So I hope to stay on top of things this semester in order to achieve that."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2766,"My goals for this course is to get a better general understanding of physics. However, the reason I am taking this course is because it is part of my major units for Biochemistry. I chose that major because I want to go into the medical field. I plan to be a general nurse practitioner or traveling nurse practitioner. This is also why I am attending SFSU. I also joined San Francisco State because I wanted to experience the city life. Although I do not think I will use physics specifically for the job, I do use basic physics in my everyday life. Meaning taking this course is already change the way I view the world and how things work in everyday life. Anyway this class is helping me achieve these goals by heading me in the direction of completing my degree on the way to my occupation. I hope to continue to practice good study habits in order to get a good grade and a better understanding of physics.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2771,"my goals are getting into pharmacy and I am very passionate about pursuing my career further in pharmacy. I also have goals of getting my degree and progressing my knowledge/education. This class is helping me achieve my goals by being a pre requisite that I need in order to complete my degree further. It is also helping me within my physics course that I have to complete, and with the labs I am learning plenty as we continue to make progress through the semester. besides my future career I hope on getting, this class is contributing greatly as a benefit. I also did not realize how interested I was in physics before I took this course, in high school, it was much different and less enjoyable. I find myself enjoying it much more now than I did before. So overall, my goals are knowledge, education, and pursuing a career in pharmacy."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2777,"My current goals are to complete my current set of classes to continue down my path and get my degree. Along this path would be physics, as although I am a bio major, it plays a significant role in many other ways. Physics is all around us, and I would even be able to apply it to cellular movement; it's just that I would be working on a much smaller scale than usual.  With this class, I feel that it has been a great benefit as it does help me think more outside the box and hone my skills in my lecture class, and simply completing this course, in general, will only help me more with the topic, which will, in turn, support me in my major."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2760,"My goals are to get a better understanding of physics so it can potentially help me in the future with the medical career that I wish to pursue. I also have a goal of earning a good grade in this course because I find physics to be a very difficult topic. This class will help me achieve my goal as being background knowledge and reinforcement whenever I’m faced with a physics problem in the future. The manner in which this course is set up has so far made things easy to understand and follow. I know that as the semester progresses it will get more difficult, but I hope that the lectures and lab will reinforce the lesson for that week. The lab portion so far has been good review for the lessons and makes me more confident that I know the material. I truly wish to achieve my goal of earning a good grade at the end of this semester. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,564,my goals are going to be a researcher in  a lab so this class will help with that. It will be a biology based lab but that is okay because any lab is good for experience.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2780,"What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals. Up until recently, I had no goals. I was going to school simply because I know having a degree can get you paid more. I genuinely did not believe that I could get paid to do the things I loved. But my buddy had brought me along to a Park Ranger internship and I found what I wanted to do. I want to become a park Ranger. Who would have thought getting a job as a park ranger would be so competitive? Which brings me to this instant. I am here trying to achieve my Bachelors Degree in Environmental Science and Geography. After completing my undergraduate years, I dream of moving to Alberta, Canada to study Forestry. This class can help me tremendously if this is to be my future. Physics is linked to many daily activities and I had never really understood the gravity (pun intended) of physics. I am sure that this physics class will be useful in times to come."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2786,"My goals this week are primarily just trying to adjust having to go to school in person and balance that with the extra time consuming aspects such as an hour long commute and the stress of driving and being more physically present. I also just want to be able to complete work in an efficient time frame and such where I won't feel like I am drowning myself. I guess I can also say that in person labs for other classes such as biology or chemistry are ones I have to learn from. This class, even though it is online, still feels like I am able to learn as though I was in person. In terms of longterm goals I just want to be a better learner and be able to express myself with students and/or coworkers. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2781,My goals is to major in physiology and to become a doctor. This class is helping me achieve my goals because it is helping me earn my degree. This class is a class I need to take to get my major in physiology. This class is also helping me achieve my goals because it’s helping me learn how to do group work and work with others. As a doctor you will need to learn how to work with others and communicate with them. This class is going to help me use these skills and teachings and apply it to m ly everyday life.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2769,"My goals for this class is of course to do well, and try to learn the material as well as possible when I am in the class. As it turns out I actually do learn quite a bit from doing the labatorys which is really surprising for me so out of all my lab classes I pay particular attention to this class. This class is helping achieve my goals by actually showing some visual references and seeing how we can manipulate objects with the what we are learning to show me how its used. But as we get more into equations that's where I get lost easily and hopefully the labs will continue to be of use to me. Physics is not as scary as I imagined it to be initially but the material is getting harder. I have run out of things to say for now but my day has not been to great, already did poorly on a Chem exam so my mental energy is not all that high. "
