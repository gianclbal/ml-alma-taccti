Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2759,Why am I here?Why am I here? Not sure if it's specific to this class but physics is a requirement for my major. I’ve taken physics before but wasn’t able to join a lab. But I am here to obtain knowledge so currently this lab is sort of a reminder of the studies I did before but don't quite remember. Why am I here at San Francisco State for an opportunity to make someone of myself and being first generation college student I want to make my family proud and complete their desires and dreams. By eventually completing their desires I wish to find my path in life and find my actual interest in what I want to do. Currently at school but unable to find my interest but I'm here at San Francisco state to complete my findings and hopefully find myself before graduating. But I am here at San Francisco State University to acquire knowledge and to enjoy the college experience.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2760,"When I comes to being here in this class and overall course, I believe I’m here to get a foundation for my knowledge about the sciences. Although I might not use much of physics in my future career, it doesn’t hurt to receive a good understanding of it. Physics plays a part in our everyday activities and might one day be resourceful. Ultimately, I’m here at SFSU to gain a higher education and become one of the first people to graduate from college in my family. Why am I here, as in this earth, I feel that I’m here to help those in need. I believe I’m meant to give back to people who are less fortunate and just make a small genuine change in the world. I want to receive a medical education to then assist people in remote areas of the world and learn about their cultures. Overall, I want to gain some knowledge from every part of the world. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,1753,"I am here to learn, and I am also here to fortify my knowledge as a scientist. I find that the relationship between math and science are interrelated. This class will help me expand my knowledge. I am so excited to be in the position to learn more about a subject that relates to my field, and cannot wait to use the tools that are given in this class. I have not really had a clear understanding of physics in practice, but I really enjoy learning about conceptual physics. This class will help me apply the logic ad rules of physics to relevant subjects that will re-appear in the future. As an aspiring marine biologist, I am very excited to become the most competent, knowledgable version of myself as possible. This is the beginning of that process, as I must have a clear understanding of certain topics. I am here because I belong, and because I have persevered on this path for a long time. I am so excited for the future!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2761,I am in school because I have made it my goal to be here and to finish with a higher level education than my parents did when they fled Vietnam. They fled here so that me and my brother can have a better education. I am a Biology major but Physics also happens to be a course that many of us will have to take as a GE requirement or Major but nonetheless I find physics to be a fun field to be a part of even though I am not majoring in physics. Physics is a topic that is applicable to us on a daily basis so taking this class to learn about it gives us a better understanding and allows us to have that background knowledge to help in our problem solving skills for the future wherever it takes us. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2762,I am here because i need to take these classes in order to be able to graduate in a subject that i am hoping is adequate enough to land me a job which can pay me enough to survive in this economy. Crucial because we can see how the cost of living is so high that a college education seems to be the only feasible solution to escaping poverty. And also to learn about science because it could possibly help with the job I have lined up after graduating. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2763,"Why am I here? I am here in this specific physics class because this is a class, I need to advance into the core units of my degree plan. Those core units will require a basic understanding of certain physic concepts such as movement, momentum, acceleration ect. Getting a basic understanding of these topics will help me in those classes as well as apply the things I learn here into my eventual profession of being a physical therapist. Understanding how the human body moves and to certain degrees of motion especially through different environments with different variables will be very important in the world of physical therapy. Also, as someone who does a lot of driving daily, I use physics every single day. I already think of things with a physicist mindset and think about these ideas with my weightlifting clients when discussing movement with directional vertical load. I work with a lot of strength athletes (as I am a strength athlete myself) and understanding movement against force is very helpful in becoming a better weightlifter as well. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2764,"In answering ""Why am I here?"" I know for sure that I am here to live and glorify the Lord. I know I also am here because God divinely wants me to be here still. I also know that I am here because I want to be in the medical field. I also want to help people. I have a lot of mental health problems, and I know for sure that I want to make a change in the stigma around mental health. And how truly hard it actually is for us. Which also comes into play since I initially wanted to be a neurosurgeon, I think it would be cool to see myself ""fix"" someone else's brain, because I know I'll never have the chance to fix mine in this life. But Praise God because He makes all things new. Therefore, I'm just hustling while I'm waiting, because the Best is Yet to Come. Who is Jesus Christ."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2269,"Why am i here? The interesting part of this question is just a couple days ago a coworker asked a similar question phrased as the following "" what is your purpose?' ""Do you know your purpose in life because once you know that you are bound for success"". So as I reflect today after deep thought since then I say to myself, as of right now I am unsure but I do know it will all one day not only make sense but come to light. College as a whole made me realize it's okay to not have all the answers and not be afraid of the uncertain and just live. Everything will make sense when it's time to make sense but for right now live in the moment and appreciate the gift of life because its so short and so precious and if you only focus on the why's you'll never know why.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2765,"Why am I here? Often I have pondered this very question. I have always been aware of my presence on this planet since the time I was young. I remember being in class in 6th grade, staring out the window and realizing that every decision I make has an impact on my future. Some are small, and have very little impact like whether I chose to stand up to sharpen my pencil in the corner of room. And some were large, like the men I allowed to have my time. I feel like every decision we make from the moment we wake up has a domino effect on our impact on this planet. For now, I'm hoping my decision to be a student at SF State has a domino effect leading to me getting closer to my career goals. SF State has an amazing program called PINC and I feel like no other school can offer me the opportunities SF State will."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2766,"To begin with the question, “why am I here?” I have taken this particular lab because it is second part to the physics lecture. These classes are a requirement for Biochemistry major. This is my major because I am on the pathway for the health field. I plan to be a general nurse practitioner or traveling nurse practitioner. This is also why I am attending SFSU. I also joined San Francisco State because I wanted to experience the city life. I come from a small town in the Central Coast, and I wanted to experience a city with a more diverse community. Although COVID has impacted that experience, I am glad I have chosen to go to SFSU. I am interested to get a better understanding of physics. Although I do not see myself using it for my future job, it will be overall impactful of my view of the world. It will be interesting to see what I gain from taking this course. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2767,In all honesty I decided to take this class as it was advised by my counselor as a necessity. Before I didn't really take into consideration or use the counselors as a resource but I felt like due to online schooling I needed to ensure and get extra guidance for my schooling. Normally I don't think I would have chosen physics as it seems like a really hard subject especially on the college level. I do however find it somewhat interesting since it directly deals with the fundamentals of our lives and surroundings. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2768,"It is difficult to say ""why am I here"" depending on who is saying it. Others may continue to ask themselves throughout their whole life time as to why are they here. Other people could give you a quick answer and state their purpose as to why they are here. Do people really know why they are here? I believe that my purpose would be to help people in need whether that be physically, mentally, or really anything that would be of assistance to people. That is why I am continuing my educational career here at SFSU as a biology major. After my receiving my bachelors in Biology I would apply for a nursing masters. With all this education I plan to work in the healthcare system as I currently do at a Nursing and Rehabilitation center. I love working with the patients and that’s why I believe my purpose is to help people. Working with patients has taught me valuable lessons that I will forever cherish for the rest of my life and never forget each patient I have worked with as they have made an impact in my life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2769,"Eric WongPhysics 112Professor Allison Swart3 February 2022Reflective Journaling	Since this is supposed to be an abstract journal prompt I think I will talk about how I feel about physics as a whole. As to why I am here it's purely to fulfill requirements. To me physics does not bring wonder to me, it brings pure dread and terror. The essence of nightmares and the crushing realization that I am incapable of learning how things move. More really it's just that I have heard many negative things about physics classes from my other friends and how I have to take two physics courses to get my degree. If physics was as hard and hellish as what people say it is how am I going to make it through physics two? I am really just pushing myself through these classes since its a requirement, who knows maybe one day I will come to appreciate learning this but as of right now I have just finished two years of college, four years of high school, and I just want to get started with life. No offense to all of those who worked many years of school I applaud that."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,564,Well i think im here to make a difference in the world. I am a biology major and my goal is to make it to a research position in the CDC. Researching diseases or even cures to such diseases. I want to be able to help people with my research and to do that and achieve my goal I am here in school getting my degree and masters or PHD. I also just want to have fun with my job and life.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2770,"I am here because I have a goal of having a career that I can enjoy and live a good life from. I decided that majoring in biology offers many different career paths. All the career paths biology offers pique my interest and I think I would enjoy almost any of them. I am still undecided on which specific career path I want to follow. I know that I have always loved science. I love researching and experimenting and really understanding why things work the way they do. Most of the scientific career fields also offer good pay so it is a perfect combination of making enough money to support my family and enjoying the work I will be doing. I don’t have a particular interest in physics. I can understand it, but it takes a lot of effort and brain power. I am only taking this physics class because I need it for my major. I am trying to understand and grasp the concepts because I know I may need to use some of them again, but overall I do not enjoy doing physics."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2771,"I am here because I want to fulfill my education and prosper with various intellectuals around me. Being a first gen student has really motivated me to do better and try to become as successful as I can, I am here to work hard and not play around. This will set my future and pave the way to my career that I hope to have one day. I am in this class because it is one of my pre reqs I need for grad school. Hopefully, I actually get in but yeah basically I am here to get my degree like everyone else and to be happy one day with what I am doing in life! Regardless of if I don't get the career I want, I just want to have an education that those around me did not have the opportunity for and to be successful one day in life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2772,"I am here because I want to learn, as I believe knowledge is power. I have particularly chosen to be part of this course as it is one of the requirements for my bio major, as well as I think physics is essential to understand the other two sciences that I am taking right now which are chemistry and biology. I think this class is great opportunity to build upon my knowledge in the other two sciences that I am familiar with which are biology and chemistry, as at the end of these three sciences are connected and build upon each other. Furthermore, I think physics is important to prepare me for the career that I want to pursue which is in the medical field. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2773,Why am I here? That's a question I ask myself everyday and to answer that I honestly don't even know. I am going to college because I need to get a job that pays well so I can help my family out but also for me to have a better future. Once I started college my motivation to continue a higher education has been declining to the point where now I just overthink whether I should just dropout and try to find a job that doesn't require much education and pays pretty decent. The main reason why I always question myself why I am here is because financially I am getting no help and my parents are helping pay out of pocket and I just question if all the money going into this education will be worth it and honestly I don't think so. As of right now I will push myself to graduate so I can make my parents proud my goal is to go to optometry school but seeing the costs for attending has made me feel unmotivated. As for why I'm taking this class in specific is for the only reason that its a requirement for my major.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2774,"My purpose is constantly changing. I suffer from depression since a young age, which did not make entire sense because I did not know I was depressed as a child. I just knew I felt unexplained sadness constantly. I recently moved here from Pasadena, California. I am not from California; I am from Florida. Its expensive here and I have struggled living here a few times and why should I even try. I could easily live somewhere cheaper. Every time I go back home to Florida, I see old friends who are always doing the same. They have no passion about anything and continue to do the same things. I work a little harder because I enjoy the energy of the people in this state. More people with passion and goals. It pushes me to want to enjoy things much more. I meet new people and do new things and that’s maybe my purpose. I don’t entirely know. I just know there’s so many fun things to do and beautiful things to see. I love going to places that make every problem seem so small and takes me out of it all.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2775,"I am here right now to complete what I need to do in order to succeed and learn in order to better myself. I am here to receive an education and I am sacrificing a lot to do so, therefore I come into class with the intent to work hard and learn so that I can work towards my future and pursue what I want to do. I honestly am not the biggest fan of physics, and it is not something directly related to what I want to do, but it is something I need to graduate. Regardless of whether I like it or not, I have to take this course and other courses anyways. So, even though I am taking a class I am not interested in, I still attend it with the intention to pass it and learn from it because I am doing so much to receive an education and I don’t want to waste this opportunity."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2776,I'm here taking this physics class as it is a required class for my microbiology major. I'm pursuing a second bachelor's degree because I am interested in changing careers into doing something in the healthcare field. I chose SFSU because I already live in San Francisco and also they were one of the few schools that offered a program for a second bachelor degree students. I am not really that interested in physics but I did take it in high school and did pretty well and was able to grasp most of the concepts quit easily. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2777,"""Why am I here?""      There have been many times I have asked myself that question. What is my purpose? Throughout my life, there have been interests that have arisen. Still, sometimes it feels like I’m following the path I have taken more so for other people than myself. College is always something that family has stressed significant and would lead to success, and I know they are correct. Still, I feel like I do it for them some days, but as time has gone on and I live on my own away from them, I realized that I think I am doing this for myself; To find my path and live my own life. I do genuinely like some of the topics I am attending at the very least to reap the benefits of coming to college, at least for now. Life is quite a journey in general, and it is just getting started, and so much can change from now until then so who knows what will happen next? "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2778,"I am in this class because I am curious about physics and how the world works and would like to gain some knowledge and insight on how the world works around us and practice some math skills with real world problems. I hope to get a better understanding of physics by doing experiments with knowledge from the lectures and techniques I have learned to use during lecture course and be able to apply them in lab and master these topics. Hopefully this course will help me in my goal, and I have a good time trying to understand these labs and the topics they cover. I am also interested in the way the world works as a whole and this class is also a requirement for my Earth science BA major. I also want to see if I can notice how physics connects with the rest of the sciences and gain some knowledge I didn’t previously know."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2779,"Why am I here?Honestly, the goal of college and living on campus and having this whole experience is to better my education and give me the tools to make it to med school and be a doctor and all of that good stuff. However, I came here because I needed to live a little more than I was in my small city that was predominantly Asian. I knew that the world was not like the one I had known from the beginning stage of my life and was curious to see what other places looked like. I came here to be a college kid, to still have good grades but seize opportunities to live fully in regard to social experiences. I had never lived on my own before and though I always had my sisters I never had actual roommates nor have I had to make new friends since I was in elementary school. That was probably the most daunting thing, meeting new people and not knowing a single thing about them or how our relationships would turn out. That being said, I have found a couple of good people on campus and honestly, I love that my circle is small. People come and go but the ones that have remained constant I have been able to open up to and foster better relationships with.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2780,"Greetings to whomever may read this, My name is Alan Bautista, but I most often go by AJ. It is too easy to say that I am only here because it was required while taking Physics lecture. I am here because I chose to devote myself to the outdoors and become a park ranger. To do this, I am here at San Francisco State University majoring in Environmental Science and Geography. After a treacherous two years,  I am three years into my education. Almost there! I am excited for what this semester has to offer because I am taking some interesting classes (including this one!). Though, I am a little skeptical as physics has always been one of those classes I try and dodge. I will do my best to excel in the class. My goal after graduating with my bachelor’s Degree in Environmental Science and Geography, I dream of going to school in Canada and get a master’s in forestry. I was raised to love the outdoors and that has never stopped. Some of my hobbies include camping/backpacking, fishing, rock climbing, snowboarding, etc. Being raised in these activities, I was also taught respect for the outdoors. I would love to be one day be able to do the same for others. And I am excited that this class is one step closer to that.AJ"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2781,"Why am I here? That is a question that I think we all ask ourselves and should shed light on it.  I am here because I have a dream to become a doctor(OB/GYN) to help people that look like me feel nurtured and cared for. I am here because I want to gain knowledge to feed my brain to help me in the medical field. I want to become an OB/GYN to help many women who look like me. The way that black people get treated in the healthcare system should not be acceptable. With more African American women in the field, our death rates and racial interactions would be decreased. They will feel more comfortable and feel more cared for with seeing similar faces. I am also here to make my family proud of being the first doctor in the family and not only make them happy I am here to make myself happy. "
