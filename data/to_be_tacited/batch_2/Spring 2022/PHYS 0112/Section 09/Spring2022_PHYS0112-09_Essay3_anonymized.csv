2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2784,Normally I have a bit of a breakdown and then once all that emotion is out of my system I can move on about my day. I try to focus on what I need to work on and complete it in steps so I can check it off and feel most accomplished.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2778,"When life gets challenging, I sit back for a minute and think about the situation or situations at hand and think about all the possible ways I can tackle the problems. I try to do a process of elimination to try and come up with the best way to solve a problem and hope that it was the right choice in doing the situation. I know it isn’t necessarily a good thing to do, but I sometimes wonder if there was a way to avoid the situation or after the problem if there was anything I could have done differently. I also try to calm down as best as possible which is harder to do then it looks sometimes and tell myself everything will be fine, and I will get through it.  If possible, I also try to take mental breaks and rest my mind before thinking about the next steps. It’s good to stop and think about things and take life one step at a time as everything wasn’t meant to be done instantly."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2763,"When life gets challenging I normally go to the gym. The gym is the place where I feel I have the most control physically and mentally even if my workouts are not going the best that day. I feel very strong there and I believe that the feeling of being physically strong then translates to having mental strength. I am able to reset my thinking and my mind to think more clear about the challenge I am facing. If I can not do that, normally I take my dogs outside. I live through my dogs and love to do training off leash or just go to the park. Being able to invest my energy into something else makes me feel better which would allow me to reset to continue working on what is challenging me."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2760,"When life gets challenging, I usually try to escape from reality a bit. I have many forms in which I can escape, one being drawing or painting to clear my head. I try to just forget about my problem for a moment and simply focus on what colors I’d like to use. I also like to go out and hang out with friends and share some good laughs to get that feeling of happiness. I occasionally like to take a drive around the valley where I live and see all the hills and the vast mountain range at sunset. Or I drive to the beach and just sit out in the open for hours and just listening to the waves crash and think about how a portion of the ocean has not been discovered yet. I think about all the countries beyond the west coast horizon and image of the things I’d like to see while in those countries.  In other words, I’d like to create my own fantasy world and just live in moment for a while."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2775,"When life gets challenging, I just try to stay motivated. I keep in mind the people and things I love and push through thinking off them. I just try to remember goals of what I want to do, what I want to be, being successful, getting what I want, etc. and those thoughts help me get through challenging times whether it has to do with school or anything in my personal life. One thing that also really helps me deal with challenging times is taking solace in things I love. For me, it is sports and video games, for others it can be music or reading, regardless, hobbies helps keep us positive and sane. I know that, for example, when I get finished with a tough day at school or I just came back from a tough day at work, I would just relax and unwind doing something I love like watching basketball or playing games. One other great thing to do is to talk to others about your struggles. Getting advice from your parents, friends, or whoever else can be very helpful."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2766,"It has taken me awhile to figure out what to do when I feel stressed. I tried the traditional methods like meditation, but that would only make me more stressed because I had a hard time letting the thoughts of what I need to do go. Recently I discovered that doing things such as getting or doing my nails, drinking a hot beverage, hiking, or spending time with friends helps me immensely when I am stressed. I realized that it is okay to take brain breaks because it results in better focus and less anxiety. Also talking on the phone to family members or friends helps too if I don’t have the time to do the things mentioned above. I also love spending time outdoors, practice focused breathing, and spending time with animals. Maybe even reading, exercising, or using my brain creatively. Unfortunately, I find myself stressed often so I do try to incorporate at least two to three of these things per week. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2780,"As a college student, life can get pretty challenging and the way we cope with the challenges of life differ from one another. I am a firm believer of doing the things you love and the things that make you happy to cope with life challenges. For me, I try to spend my day outdoors however possible. Whether it is a hike, fishing, or climbing; anything outdoors brings me joy in challenging times. And by no means am I proud, but I often deal with the challenges of life after smoking (but i am trying to quit!). But I feel I am most at ease after smoking and combining this with being outdoors is always the remedy for a challenging day of life. :))I have also been meditating more to ease my mind within crazy times. Though, I am not great at the art of meditation just yet, I am getting there."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2776,"I allow myself time to mope and cry for a short while and then I get started on working out a plan to solve the issue. If it's not something I can immediately solve or overcome, then I'll just do whatever I can and they push whatever I cannot control to the back of my mind and never think about it again until it comes up or if I come across the solution. I find it is pointless to dwell on things you can't control so I'll just move on with my life. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2782,"When life is too difficult If I'm perfectly honest I just kind of keep working and get busy I drown myself in work so that I don't have time to think about my problems. Is it healthy not really but it works and helps me to get through my work but it often leads to me burning out quicker than I should and I drown myself in even more work and it is basically a neverending cycle but I've definitely been worse off. However, I do try to force myself to go out especially to raves but raves are kind if expensive so I cant go as often as I would like."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2774,"I didnt mean to not do this i drive directly from physics class to my house and i meant to do this after class but i truly forgot. Life has been challanging again for me recently im going through a breakup with someone i got along with very well. It was a healthy relationship but they didnt want to commit when they saw things getting serious even though they encouraged it to be serious for awhile then changed their mind. It hurts and it hurts because i cant blame it being toxic or incombalitles between us. So the past month has been rough for me, Im in a new city and i barely know anyone.I mostly spent my birthday alone.  I have been trying my best. Scheduling therapy appointments, putting in effort in my apperance, forcing myself to join things and interact, and forcing myself to go to places even though im alone. Which im ok being alone and i love solitude to a certain extent. So basically when life gets challanging i try my best and thats all i can do. Life gets so unfair, i have dealt with so many unfair circumstances and im so tired. People say im tough and strong but im so tired of being strong all the time and dealing with things. But again i try my best and thats all i can do even when its hard."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2269,"For the longest I would shut down..until I realized life doesn't stop for nobody and the clock will only continue clicking. Sometimes you cant afford to lay back and be sad so I turned over a new leaf in 2022 and took a more productive approach. Such as writing, going to the park or just driving around. One on one conversations with myself have been helping tremendously. We are really all we got in this world so sometimes the best feeling is being in alliance with yourself.As long as you can get up and be happy with yourself the L's you take in life will be used as fuel rather than a roadblock.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2779,"When life gets challenging, I really begin to close in on myself. Though this is good for getting assignments done and not missing any deadlines, I find that when I close myself off from the people in my life, my mental health is severely affected. I am a very social person and rely on the people around me to remind me that I'm not all by myself. During the challenging times of exams or tough schedules, I remind myself to work first and play later, that way the play will be much sweeter as I won't have any lingering tasks that make me worry. Aside from just going straight through, I like to work out or talk a walk, something that I can still do by myself but not within the scope of the tasks I am currently working through. On top of all this, I find that I work best when my body is rested, so I tend to sleep earlier so that I can reset my mind for the day ahead of me.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2765,"When life gets challenging I shut people out. I allow myself to feel the stress, frustration, hurt or whatever other feelings are contributing to life getting challenging. To be very honest, I'll shut down too. I'll keep myself in bed and don't have the will to get out. I understand that there are resources to take advantage of. However, I feel like shutting down for 1-3 days is enough for me to then move past the worst part and carry on. I rely on my therapist, my psychiatrist, my cat and my family. Most of my challenges have been my mental health. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2770,"When life gets challenging there are a few different things I like to do. I usually try to take a step back from the main thing causing stress and just go do something else. Some things I like to do are take my kids to the park, play video games, or watch TV. This gives me some time to just keep my mind off things and decompress for a little bit. This usually helps because when I come back to my responsibilities, I have a fresh mindset. It helps me calm down and relax so I don’t feel so overwhelmed. I used to think that when I was getting overwhelmed, I had to work on getting everything done and organized before more got piled on. Overtime I learned that it’s better for me to take a step back and reorganize my thoughts. This allows me to come back and focus on one task at a time without getting so overwhelmed."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2764,"It sure why mine never actually posted but this is what I said:What I do when life gets challenging is I tend to pray. I also work out. And drink coffee. I pray to God to comfort my heart and mind and to help make me remember his trustworthy promises. And I also work out to help keep a balance in terms of all the healthy components of my life. But it also helps me just de-stress in general. Lastly, there is coffee. I love drinks over food. Coffee lately has been my go to stress reliever. Caffeine does wonders for any and all college students."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2769,What do I do when life gets challenging? Not going to lie I tend to find the easiest way out. The problem is that with online learning it makes it very easy to just look up the information you require for your classes which is where most of my challenges come from. But I think if I had enough motivation I could get through the classes with hard work and effort. I do also know that when things to get difficult I know what to prioritize and know what to work on. I can focus myself on one task at a time to not overwhelm myself or stress myself out too much. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2781,"“What do I do when life gets challenging?” Life is no yellow brick road that we easily stroll on. We will come across things that can make the road difficult. Life can become challenging and when it does I like to just stop, take a break and pray. My mom has always taught me to pray and put God first. When life gets challenging I also like to just take a break from what is stressing me out and hang out with my friends. When I am out with my friends it seems that all my worries just go away. Something that I also am trying to make a habit of is meditating each morning. Meditation is to help you get into a deep state of relaxation and help eliminate the stress and all of the thoughts in your mind. When I meditate I notice that my day goes a lot smoother."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2783,When life gets challenging of course I try to work through whatever it is but when I feel overwhelmed I make myself take a step back and just try to relax and figure out how I want to handle what the issue or issues are while doing something that I find relaxing like reading or gaming. I think while doing these activities I can clear my head a little bit and formulate what I want to do with whatever is challenging.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2785,"I consider myself a self soother, so when life gets challenging I usually find ways to calm down, reflect, or make me happy. Reflecting can go both ways, however, because sometimes my thoughts can be louder when I’m alone and this can send me down a spiral. In this case, I seek my support system or my friends to get insight and find inspiration through them. I think it’s helpful to get outside of my own head and verbalize it to someone who I can confide in. In other ways, when life gets challenging I try to journal my thoughts and see it on paper, or plan ahead in order to save myself from stress. Usually what I do is overwork myself to distract myself from my problems, however, I’m in the process of trying to break this habit because I want to practice making room for my emotions. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,564,When life gets challenging i get to my computer and play a few games with my friends and i get to talk to them about it. After i do that i feel better and either watch a movie or chill with my family. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2768,"When life gets challenging, as it usually does and comes to no surprise, I like to go outdoors and talk a walk. I prefer walking in nature, when walking around I begin to clear my head and think about other subjects that aren’t that stressful or challenging. After I’ve cleared my head from what made life a bit challenging, I begin to sort out my thoughts and begin to organize. First, I order every task that needs to get done as soon as possible, such as homework that is due. Next, I start working on seeing what I’ve accomplished so far. Finally, I begin to work on my tasks. This technique helps me figure out what I need to do when life gets challenging. Sometimes when I have time I start to play volleyball just to get rid of the stress and not think about the challenges. Personally, when I exercise, have fun, or play a sport it tends to make me forget about the challenges I will face, almost like a little break."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2773,When life gets challenging I become very quiet and depressed but then I decide to not give up and continue to push myself because life is hard and you just have get pass all the obstacles that are thrown at you. I usually take a break and do activities that will help refresh such as going out for a walk at the park or going running with my brother or even just taking a very long nap. Lately life's been difficult and school is not helping with improving my mood but hopefully during spring break I'll be able to catch some fresh air. Although I'm tired of life I tend to always end up pushing myself and not let any barriers stop me from accomplishing my goals. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2772,"when life gets challenging, I would give myself a break and focus on myself. I think that each and every one of us faces some challenges on a daily basis but the difference is how we choose to deal with them. When life gets challenging, stressful, exhausting, etc. I think this is an alarm or a wake-up call to be easy on yourself and to remove stuff that makes you stressed. At this point, I think its the best to change your routine, start doing activities, exercising, or meditating. "
