2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2760,"The first resource that that supports me would have to be my family. They’re the people I can rely on the most and know they will have my back whenever I’m down. Another resource that supports me would be SFSU, they offer many programs that have helped me support myself when living in San Francisco. Drawing and painting are a resource I believe supports me emotionally. When frustrated or lost, I usually turn to something creative to get my energy back up and calm down. A tremendous resource that has helped me again this college education has been the Santa Barbara Foundation, who has awarded me with scholarships to ease the total cost of college. Also, the teaches I’ve kept in touch with since high school have been a resource in the aspect of giving me advice and letting me know about opportunities that will benefit me in the future. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2769,I always do have YouTube to support me. I am a very big visual learner and having a video platform where many people can just do the problems and I can see it I can usually figure out how to do the problems myself. Sometimes when things are just explained to me it gets so having that is useful. Another resource that I use is of course friends and classmates who I can always ask for help and I can compare answers to which can help me reaffirm that I am doing the correct thing. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2770,"I have many resources to support me. My biggest resource is my support system which is my family. They are always there for me and reminding me when I forget things and always tell me I’m doing a great job. They also keep the house clean and keep everything taken care of so I can do well in pursuing my education. Educationally I also have the library, books, and the internet, which all provide great resources for finding information. I also have professors who offer advice and support every day. They are an excellent resource for anything I may have questions for in the class as well as providing additional resources I may not have been aware of before."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2783,"I think I have a decent amount of resources to support me, academically the biggest things are probably office hours, group chats/discord servers, professor emails, and recorded lectures are really helpful for things like clarification and what not on assignments or examples I might have missed. I don’t really use office hours that often but when I have it's always been worth the time, group chats and discord servers have been helpful especially for homework, and having professor emails is always just helpful for anything as long as they respond, recorded lectures are always helpful especially before an exam when I’m trying to review older material."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2781,Throughout my college experience I always had resources to help me. College is not easy so Ive been talking to my EOP counselor to help me pick my classes and just check in with throughout the semester. Also EOP also has tutoring services that they provide during my freshman year and sophomore year I would always go to these tutoring services but when covid hit I stopped. EOP has always been a service at SFSU that has helped me throughout my semesters. Resources I have also used is office hours. Office hours are very impressive to me because its helps me get to know my professors and get to het that one on one learning that I need. Having resources is very important to help you there are many resources  that SFSU has that we are not aware of and should be aware of them. These resources are here to help us.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2771,"The resources that I have in order to support me are my mom, dad, and siblings.  I believe that these people have always been the outlet I use to lean back on when needing anything, such as emotional support, physical, or even mental. More so family because obviously they do not have a choice as I am related to them but regardless they go through so much to support me financially and sometimes emotionally. I believe that any type of support is valid especially when people have a rough time helping in their own ways that they don’t know how. Any type of support should be a luxury to anyone because it is definitely rare to find, it is also difficult to find people to trust with being in your life as they will build relationships that hopefully last a lifetime. Anyway, to sum it all up, my main support outlets are in my family and am truly grateful for them."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2269,"Personally my resource is my mom, I am not a big fan of talking/communicating in regards to my physical well being or a big on asking for help so her(my mom)giving me the upmost support in ways she probably doesn't even know .Continuing to provide that tough love yet motivation/push I need throughout specific areas in life. Definitely my life couch and a great resource to have ."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2763,The biggest resources that I have to my disposal is my friends and family support system. Without them as an outlet to vent to about my frustrations I would struggle a lot more than I currently do. But I also rely on my classmates and my professors for assistance when I am struggling with topics or when looking for advice when it comes to issues involving the university. I also tend to reach out to the VA department very frequently as a resource that assists in getting me what I need to be successful.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2765,"I have a quite a bit of resources available to me. I am part of the Peer Mentor program so I do have a mentor who is also a student as SFSU. I know SFSU also has tutoring available, as well as a counselor's office to help students with mental health issues. I also know you can get the option to get your prescriptions sent to be picked up from campus as well. Aside from that I know I can schedule a meeting with any advisor from my school of college. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2761,"There are a lot of resources at my disposal here at SF State. The first are my classmates. Often the first thing I resort to when I encounter something I don't quite understand. The second are my Instructors whether it be in labs or in the lecture classrooms, instructors are probably the best resources that I have since they literally are the ones teaching. The next resources I have are the books typically assigned by the instructors, certainly a very under utilized resource usually because they have a price tag and students can be a bit reserved to own a textbook. The other resource are tutor programs on campus. Probably the least used resource because they can come off as a bit hard to approach and sometimes tutor programs can have some prerequisites that students aren't aware of."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,564,i have a few resources like the online hw and some friends that could help me learn and help me study. I often get side tracked or confused so friends can help me. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2778,Resources I have available to support me are the local school links and websites. I have the library for the school as well as my own local library. I can go back to and re watch the physics lecture videos as well as having the notes from them. I also have access to past practice problems and quizzes that I did and can review those. I can also email and ask my professors for help if needed and can use the class textbook if I needed further explanation. I also have several study websites that help explain topics in different ways other than the official class rules.  Another resources I have is my classmates as asking one of them for help could give me some insight an a topic I previously didn't have. I can also go back and re watch the lab notes slides as well as go to them at any time. I also can use my lab notes and review the labs that have been done to get an better understanding of an topic. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2782,"I mean I do have an iep so whatever resources that affords me however I don't use it which is kind if an issue considering I have a learning disability. Um I don't know there is going to office hours, I could get a tutor I know I have a lot of options available to me but I'm stubborn and refuse help."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2777,"There are many resources that i may use both within my lab and in lecture as one of the most helpful ones that comes to mind would be the knoledge and use of office hours, because in those you can directly ask for help regarding a topic that causes you trouble. Additionally i do believe that one can look for tutoring on specific subjects as that can also prove very beneficial in helping to understand a topic. These would be the main two resources that come to mind when regarding the question."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2784,"I can get support from people to help you achieve my  goals and overcome challenges.This assistance is available from the following sources:FriendsFamilycoworkers at workPartnerForums and online communitiesClubs\sAssociations\sOrganizationsI am more confident and capable of overcoming the challenges that stand in my way. If I didn't have this resource system, on the other hand, I might not know what to do when faced with difficulties."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2775,"There are many resources that I have access to in order to help and support me. The internet holds a lot of resources in the forms of videos, readings, lectures, etc. that can help reinforce the information we learn about in class. These sources can be really helpful and are easily accessible as one can get them through the internet. At school, there are a lot of programs that give support to us as students regarding anything whether it is food, transportation, academics, counseling, etc. These resources are also very helpful as they are accessible through school. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2779,"“What resources do I have to support myself?”In all honesty, I don’t know of many resources on campus that can truly help me. However, within my building, there is a study room that I have utilized every day throughout both semesters. It is quiet and extremely close to my apartment so I don't waste time having to set up a space for me to work such as the library or anything like that. Furthermore, I find that I can truly focus while also completing other tasks as though I am a student first but also a young adult with responsibilities. That being said I find that access to campus is a resource that I did not have with me last year and is something I value greatly. I can take a walk, find an empty classroom to work in, or just wander through buildings that I haven’t been in before to destress. I found it to be a great way for me to calm my anxiety while also learning more about the school in general. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2772,"The resources I have to support me to be successful in this class include the slides that are presented in the mini-lecture. I think they really help to solidify some concepts. Also, they help me out while solving the lab exploration and post-lab knowledge check. Another resource is the GTA, TA where you can ask them questions to clarify any confusion I find them really approachable and always ready to help. Lastly, the book is great resource to understand any topic in more depth and detail, and also it offers many practice problems.Aside from resources that can support me in my studies, I believe that SF state has many resources that can support my basic needs. This can include the financial aid that can cover the full tuition. Many other resources as well that can support you financially are available."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2773,For tutoring not much is offered that I know of especially for physics class I tried to get a tutor at EOP but they didn't have any physics tutors. Outside of academic support SF state offers like wellness workshops and like a clinic if you need to see a nurse for something things like that. For this class specifically we have lecture videos that are kind of guides for the assignments that are assigned I must admit sometimes those lectures are not enough resource for me at least so I tend to go to YouTube and search for practice problems or like others explanations for the topics were learning just to see a different perspective and see if I understand better. I have friends and family that support me outside of school but at times it's not very helpful neither.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2768,"A resource that I have to support me is the value of my community and family have helped me navigate through college. Being the first and the oldest sibling in my family to go to college in the United States is very new to our family. Moving to America from Peru was a lot for our family, as I was only two years old when I moved and my siblings were born here in the United States. My family was able to help me go from high school to community college and now at San Francisco State University. Along with my communities support, people were able to help me find a career that I am interested in. In high school I was lucky enough to be part of an internship, with other students, where we worked in the healthcare industry. Interning at local hospitals and veterinary hospitals I was able to decide what I wanted to be in the future and what to major in for college. I value all of the help I’ve gotten from my community and family."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2776,"I feel like my biggest source that helps me is the internet. I can pretty much find all the answers to the questions I have with a little bit of digging through the internet. If it isn't something I could find on the internet or a question I feel like is very detailed and obscured, I would most likely seek out my professor or someone else who is very knowledgeable on the field. I am very fortunate to know a lot of people in different fields who I can ask of their opinions and tap into their expertise should I come across a question I can't the find the answer to on the internet. I would also think my classmates and friends are also important resources to help me out when I need it. Other than there, there are a lot of productivity apps that help me organize my life in other ways such as notion as an online planner, google calendar to help with reminders and deadlines. "
