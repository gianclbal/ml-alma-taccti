2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2783,"I think the value from my family that helped me the most during college are along the lines of just giving it whatever you’ve got, even if the work isn’t spectacular, at least put in the effort. My mom has essentially told my brothers and I this since pretty much as long as I can remember but basically even if I’m feeling out of it that instead of giving up just get something down, partial credit is better than no credit. It might sound kind of weird but with quarantine due to covid-19 my motivation has been tanking, this idea(?) helped me trudge through."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2773,My family have always mentioned to me the importance of getting my education and being able to use it to work in something that I will enjoy and at the same time pay well. To be honest at this point in college I honestly feel like there are many other ways to be successful and make good money. College is cool but I feel like it's too much money spent on and many people just end in a lot of debt. Anyways being a minority not a lot of us go to college for the main reason of not being to afford it and other obstacles that are put when applying to any college. My parents have always told me and my brother to at least get a bachelors degree and a job that pays well so at this point I just want to graduate.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2775,The values of my family have really helped me get through college. College can be very daunting to a lot of people and it certainly was for me as well. My family values taught me to be patient and take things day by day. College can be very overwhelming and it can feel like a lot of things are pressuring you and you can end up being a mess. I was taught to take things day by day and focus on what was going on in front of me. This allowed me to break down everything that college entails and make it more manageable. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2760,"Some values that were imposed on me have come from my Mexican culture. The other values that I hold true to following are ones I learned along the way while growing up. The values I poses have helped me navigate through college when it comes to taking control of my responsibilities. They have helped me gain respect from many and gain many new friends. My values have taught me to be a hard-working person who perseveres to achieve their goals. I have become more organized in every aspect, which has helped me in college. I believe the one of the main values that has helped me navigate through college has been to give everyone an opportunity and hearing someone out. This value has been used when it comes to educational or social situations because everyone deserves a chance. My community has taught to not forget to live life because time is a value thing that fly’s by use. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2777,"The value that I place on my family regarding college is significant. Without them, I wouldn't be here. My godfather and mother are explicitly the ones who have helped me carve a pathway through college. They helped me stay motivated as far as going through classes went, not to mention that they helped fund me through it. I want to make them proud, so I will do my best to succeed and attempt to battle my academic weaknesses, such as procrastination and a lack of motivation. I feel that those are relatively common weaknesses that most students will deal with, so I don't feel alone here. Aside from them, the ones who helped me get through college mentally would be my friends and partner. They help me stay motivated and keep me from being overwhelmed by classes and other good stuff, as your family can only do so much when you are far away from home. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2770,"The values of my community and my family have not helped me navigate through college. There are no parts of my community that I am involved in or have received support from. My family is supportive of me going to college; however, they do not have the same values I do, nor do they see the world the same way I do. I have had many friends and coworkers who have helped me navigate through college. They helped me by showing me how to apply for school and financial aid. They also helped me by being there for me when things get rough. They have shared their own experiences in college and provided insight to the good and the bad. They have provided me a listening ear or advice when needed, which can be more helpful than anything else. Sometimes the biggest support in navigating college is just simply being able to vent and decompress. College can be overwhelming and although the support may have not come from my community or family, I have had the support I have needed to navigate college successfully."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2768,"The value of my community and family have helped me navigate through college. Being the first and the oldest sibling in my family to go to college in the United States is very new to our family. Moving to America from Peru was a lot for our family, as I was only two years old when I moved and my siblings were born here in the United States. My family was able to help me go from high school to community college and now at San Francisco State University. Along with my communities support, people were able to help me find a career that I am interested in. In high school I was lucky enough to be part of an internship, with other students, where we worked in the healthcare industry. Interning at local hospitals and veterinary hospitals I was able to decide what I wanted to be in the future and what to major in for college. I value all of the help I’ve gotten from my community and family."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2763,"The values in my community and family have helped me become more independent in college. learning to do things for myself has made me a stronger and more determined person than I was prior. I saw how hard my family worked to keep their jobs and provide food and that hard work has been instilled in me since I was young to work for anything I desired. Being in college has pushed me very hard and has made me want to quit many times, but without that passion to keep pushing forward I do not know where I would be. I was also taught by my family to have passion and to do things right the first time. Having to do things more than once waste time and energy."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2769,"I am not really sure my family of course wants me to do my best in college but at the same time places enormous amounts of pressure on me that sometimes I feel overwhelmed. I feel as of now I am kind of just drifting through college, going through the motions of college and not really knowing what I am doing. Yeah this is pretty short but thats the gist of it. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2779,"My family has always stressed the notion of ""work first play later, and the play will be so much better"". This has always gotten harder and harder as I have progressed through my schooling career as my social circles have grown and become more diverse. Especially in college now that I truly dictate the structure of my life, I must remind myself of this idea that was instilled inside my mind that if I complete the tasks I have to do throughout the day I can relax without much worry towards the end of the day. However, this idea has become somewhat of a hindrance throughout my long-term time in college. I sometimes feel too burnt out to continue working and want to be with friends or go somewhere fun. Yet I always end up worrying about the work at home. However I do belive my balance in life has improved due to this idea and I will take this concept with me for years to come. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2780,The environment in which one grows up can directly affect how they live the rest of their lives. My upbringing has played a key role in my school ethics and I have been doing my very best to get this far. An aspect of my upbringing that has stuck with me all throughout my college experience is keeping a physical to do list on my person at all times. I am a very forgetful person and if I didn’t do this I would struggle far more. My mother is a very holistic person and has always told me to stretch my body to balance my chakras so yoga is an outlet of mine as well as rock climbing. Finding time to do the things I like to do is very important to sustain my mental and physical health. Keeping a healthy diet is also a very important value of mine that I believe helps me be more successful.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2765,"My family values have helped me navigate through college in a few ways. My family is very firm in believing education is a tool we all need under our belts, so even though I have had many struggles over the past few years that have dragged on my undergrad experience I have not allowed myself to even consider giving up. My family also values self-compassion and that has helped me through college because I try hard to be kind to myself and not beat myself up about a low grade. Responsibility is another family value that has reflected in my college journey. I have had to carry the responsibility of working and taking classes. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2782,Its kind of the only reason im still in college my mother wants me to have a college education and esp[ecially the fact that she never had the opportunity to go to college is what keeps me motivated. I want my mom to be able to be proud of me.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2269,My values of my community/family helped me navigate through college primarily through motivation as well being that comfort for me.Specifically my mom she does a great job of helping me navigate through adult hood by giving tips and advice as I conquer life and my success to the best of my ability. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2761,"Honestly, I was planning on dropping out. My third year of college kicked in and I was struggling in my classes. Fast forward to my fourth year and I failed even more classes. By that point I wanted to just give out but hearing about all of my friends finishing or going to finish their time in college motivated my to stop for a moment and to see what I really wanted to do and pursue it instead of going after something that maybe wasn't for me. Then came the day I told my parents that I wanted to change my major, lots of grumbling and my mom was pretty angry about it. After a long talk they relented and I decided to change my major and dived headlong into and now in my fifth year and planning on finishing in my sixth. Honestly its been draining but for the most part the support of my friends and my family has kept me going."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2774,My family has helped me through everything with their unwavering support and giving me money even when they dont have much to give because they want the best for me. This makes me want to do better so i dont disappoint them and so i can eventually give back and take care of them one day. I have been school for awhile and my biggest thing is that i have not given up. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2772,"The family value of being patient has helped me get through all of the classes in college. When I took challenging courses in college , I felt constantly stressed , and at times felt that I'm unable to continue in that course. Having a family where I would talk to in these stressful times , helped me calm down and clear any thoughts of failure or giving up. Since I was very little my family has guided me to be persistent and patient no matter how hard life gets. I think it's a true blessing to be accompanied by people that believe in you and always push you towards success. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2776,"My parents are immigrants so they placed a lot of importance on education. Growing up, I was taught to study hard and get good grades in order to get into a good college and then get a good job when I graduate. Their definition of a good job is one that is prestigious and also earns a lot of money such as a doctor, lawyer, engineer, etc. Over time though, they did loosen up on which career they would like me to have to one that is stable, earns a livable wage, and has benefits. So the main value that has really stuck with me is to work hard and never give up. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2778,The values of my family helped me navigate through college by teaching me things that helped me get an understanding of basic thinking and a concept of daily things in life. These values also taught me to respect people as well as be proud of myself and who am. It has also taught me to study hard and work smart to be able to accomplish most any assignment out there. I have also been taught to show to most every class as getting some better insight on the topics at hand only happens when meeting live(whether on zoom or in person). Values of community have taught me to respect one another and to work together to achieve academic goals as well as finding other things in common. I have also been taught to look out for other people and make sure they are ok as well as making sure I have time for myself even in a heavy workload situation so I don't get too stressed out.
