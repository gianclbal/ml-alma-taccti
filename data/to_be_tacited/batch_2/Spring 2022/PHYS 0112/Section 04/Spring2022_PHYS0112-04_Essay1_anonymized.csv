Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2707,"I am taking classes here at SFSU in order to fulfill my pre-medical requirements. So far, the physics course that I am taking has been some review from other math classes I’ve taken and the physics I took in high school. However, I do enjoy the review and I don’t find it to be too tedious. It’s also just incredibly interesting to describe how the world around us works by using visual models. The other class I’m taking though is General Chemistry II and the math required for that course is decently tedious and it feels like a lot of review of other chemistry classes I’ve taken. So, I have been wondering a lot recently why I am taking that course if it feels like a lot of review. Why do I have to take it if I already know the information. And the obvious answer is that most of the schools I’m looking to apply to require it as a course for admittance, but I think the less obvious answer is that it’s good practice. It’s good practice to take a time-consuming while working a full-time job. It’s good practice to get better at online courses since it seems like that’s the future. It’s good practice to answer questions that require a lot of focus and detail and attention. And it’s good practice to learn how to have fun doing something you might not always feel like doing."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2708,"I think I am here to enjoy life. I don't really see the need to have stress all the time.  If you are not enjoying your life you won't have the organic drive to become better in other areas.  I would like to contribute to science one day or maybe even technology.  I have a lot of focus after I go to the gym, eat food or even take a walk.  This is the perfect way to explain ""all work and no play makes jack a dull boy!"".  I also have been under the scrutiny of living for other peoples approval and I recently realized how demeaning it was to my life.  I love living my life for me and I also love how it makes me appreciate others.  I was not in the best place a few years ago, but everything is starting to look better."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2709,"I believe I am here to fulfill my career goal of becoming a marine biologist and hope to maintain a Ph D in the future. Not only that but as a first generation college student I am here to show others that no matter the circumstance you are in anything is possible all you have to do is put your mind and dedication to it. I am also here to prove to those who have doubted me in my decision to study in San Francisco and thought I would drop out due to not being able to afford my education or living expenses. Most importantly I am here to have fun and enjoy my college days that I have ahead of me. I am also here to learn new things and gain knowledge from all of my courses. Lastly, I am here to begin a new life and leave the old life behind. I am proud of how far I have come and all the experiences I have been through. Other than that I am also here to learn about physics because this is my first physics course."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2710,"To be completely honest, I have never thought about this question because I am not a reflective person. I’m more of a go-with-the-flow kind of person. However, in this time I have had to write this reflection, I have come to realize one a few things. One, the purpose is scary and the feeling of not knowing why you are here and where you will be in your lifetime causes many people, like me to be anxious and worry. However in saying that, it can be said that I am here in this class and in college to further my education and learn more about the things I am passionate about. Also, this time in college is also helping me figure out what I actually enjoy. For example, I came into this school hyper-focused on taking only classes that will aid me in my future career, but as time has gone on I have realized I have other interests such as Asian American History and nutrition. These interests would not have been discovered if I were not here picking and choosing classes that I find interesting. Also, I am learning more and more about myself through experiencing new things and learning to be more and more independent."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2711,"Why am I here? I am here because I wanted to be in SF for my college years and future years. I always wanted to be in San Francisco and study here because of the many experiences that I can do and be in. Furthermore, I am happy that I can be in a city where I can express my feelings and understandings. To be broader, why am I in this world. I believe that I am in this world because of many things but the most important one would be that we all have a purpose and that I have a well-being. Furthermore, I feel like I am in this world to be the best version of myself. I feel like I am in this world to make a difference and make a stand in this crazy world we live in. I feel like I am in a world full of possibilities and that I am able to be here to be me.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2712,"I am here at San Francisco State because I want to pursue a career in physical therapy. My family is a big motivator as to why I am here, attending school.  My family has been my main support system since I was younger and their support will continue to be my biggest motivation to study for my career. After learning about occupational therapy from my older brother, I expanded my interest by taking a human anatomy and physiology class in high school and later found myself immersed into the subject. I have always been drawn to the science field when I was younger, but it was never easy finding a specific focus in the subject. Thinking more existentially, I am here because I want to be the best version of myself in every way possible. I want to continue to improve my skills and mindset everyday. Becoming more organized in my lifestyle and academics are my main goals for myself."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2713,"Why am I here? Funny enough I find myself asking this question a lot. Why am I in college, why this college, why am I taking Physics or even this lab specifically. I've never been one to believe in fate or destiny, just complete chance. All the decisions I've made in my life have led to this point and there is no reason for me to feel any regret. Nor should I ever think to. There is no going, there is no trying again. This is where I am, and why I am here is because of what I decided in past. I am content with where I am, I am excited for this class and the others I am taking. I am here because this is what interested me, as well as it is a required class, but mainly because it interested me. That is my reasoning for most of my decisions, which choice would be more interesting, enjoyable, or fun. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2714,I am here because I am pursuing a Kinesiology degree and this is one of the classes I need to take to get there. I relatively enjoy classes like these because they are very in-depth and hands-on. Being a student at SFSU so far has been a blast and I look forward to my next two years here. I have not explored a lot of the campus but I do go to the gym and I love it. I am only working part-time but I also enjoy where I work. I work at Sightglass Coffee on 7th street and make coffee. Getting used to living on my own has been a journey but after a month  I finally feel like I live here. When I first moved it felt surreal but now that I am in the swing of things it feels normal. My favorite thing so far about living here is being able to go to the beach because I live so close to it.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2715,"I am here today because I had to drag myself out of bed in order to not be late. Trying to make it on time to a 9:30 am class is difficult when your bed is very comfy. I dread the thought trying to commute to school early in the morning when classes end being online. The reason that I am here in this class is because I need the class in order to fulfill the prerequisites for my Biology major. I am here to learn about the basic knowledge of physics and pass the class so I can graduate and hopefully get a job in a lab somewhere that can help with my goal of becoming a nurse in the end. On a more existential level, I think that I am to form meaningful relationships and to do things that I enjoy in life, as that is what I personally believe is the purpose of life. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2716,"In discussing the question “why am I here?”, I first feel compelled to point out the lack of context which might inform the framework from which meaning is being derived. Outside of the concept of deity, I am unaware that meaning or purpose exists. I have been instructed that truth is an idea that science avoids in order to make room for the challenge of previous discoveries. It is important for a scientist to be able to doubt. Inside a scientific framework, I am here simply because here is where I am. However, I have also been instructed that society needs more than science to thrive; it also needs belief. I believe that I am here to be a husband, father, friend, and neighbor. I believe that I am here to be beautiful; to overcome my baser instincts and by doing so attain glory. I believe that I am here to love."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2717,"Honestly, the main reason I am here is that this course is required for my concentration within Biology. So far, I have enjoyed the structuring of Biology courses a lot more than Chemistry (we'll see with physics!). But I recognize that people likely didn't arbitrarily assign classes for this major, at least I hope not, so I recognize that there is likely information to gain out of me taking this class, I'm just currently unsure what that is. So far, I definitely have enjoyed physics structuring more, especially with labs being in classwork, whereas my gen chem 2 asks us to do the lab work outside of class, which feels slightly counterintuitive. Really I'm hoping that with this major, I can use to go into DNA Analysis, so this course seems to be a must-have for my major. It's been a while since I've taken a physics class though, so im slightly unsure what to expect, I'm just hoping to learn a bit and get some of my lower-divs done :)"
