2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2713,"When life gets challenging, I'd like to claim that I keep my head up and push forward but that isn't really what I do. While the majority of the time I get it done, I do feel overwhelmed and stressed and a whole slurry of emotions that deep down makes me feel weak. Weak in the sense that I don't have the fortitude of people I know like my parents or friends, people I look up to and aspire to be. However, I do finish the job. Regardless of how I feel I get it done, no matter how melancholy or depressed, I feel inside. Since I can lay on my bed and sulk after I finish what I need to finish. I don't give up on things, because life is always going to be challenging, the only way to make those challenges easier is to do them. Get the practice in, and learn how to deal with these problems as they come up. Deadlines, payments, relationships, and everything in between. Life will always put you through the wringer, but I'll do everything I can to come out the other side. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2717,"I think one of the biggest things I do when life gets challenging is I rely on my partner and roommates to be a listening ear so that I can get things off of my chest. I tend to be the kind of person that needs to talk things out to really move past it or needs time to internally think something through before I take a major stance on something. I don't particularly hold grudges and I handle stress relatively well, so I typically just need to walk through a plan, and then I function fine. These people allow me to take a step back and recognize what I may be making a bigger deal than it is, they allow me to get a second perspective into how large of a problem is. Especially my partner is very good about throwing out alternate ideas. Overall, my ability to handle stress means I can typically navigate these situations, but my friends around me help a lot when I can't handle it on my own."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2711,"When life gets challenging I think of the many things that I am grateful for including the things that I have and the things, people, places and basically anything that gives me joy and I am just always thankful for everything that I have and for the people that I know and love. I also just try and calm myself down and reassure myself that everything is going to be alright. I know that things happen for a reason and that we have to move on. I also try and just as I said think about the happy things in my life and what I can do and what I can accomplish in such a timely manner. I think that life has treated me very fariliy and that I am able to make use of those times in a orderly fashion by nto stressing out too much. I think that stress puts on so much emotins and anger towards whatever a person is doing and that we all should be thankful and appreciative of what we all have. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2715,What I like to do when life gets challenging is to just try and tackle the challenge at hand and get the work done or whatever needs to be done in order to get it all over with and alleviate the stress. just dwelling on the work that I'll have to do eventually anyways stresses me out more so I think that just forcing myself to get all the work done with is how I deal with life and its challenges. That way I can relax and have fun afterwards doing what I want without having any thoughts of deadlines or work that needs to eventually be completed.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2708,"when it gets tough and I am feeling down I like to go workout.  Nothing gets me back on my feet and ready to work then lifting heavy.  Not only does the gym help me physically but it makes me a lot happier.  I even preform better at my job and in school after I workout.  Despite using most of my energy, I am able to sit down and focus.  My mind is not racing as much as it normally does.  I know it is a really ""meathead"" answer but it is a great way to start the day and kick some butt!  You can even surprise yourself when you lift.  You can push yourself to do weight and repetitions that you may not even think were possible to yourself.  That means a lot to me since I do not have a lot of positivity in my life.  Positive reinforcement or affirmation go along way.  When you do not have a lot of support in your life it makes things a lot better."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2716,"When life gets challenging, and I feel like giving up, I usually do. I’ve had a few traumatic experiences, ranging from minor to major. Each time I experience something like this, I have retreated into myself, and engaged in destructive habits such as binge smoking, binge eating, and binge drinking. I always come to a point where I decide that, “enough is enough”, and I end the “bender”. Then, I feel bad about what I’ve done to my body and start eating healthy and exercising. I get the excess weight off, and generally live well until the next trauma. This pattern of behavior started in my late teen years, but the last time I felt inclined to go on a bender, I didn’t do it. I think this is because I’m married now, and I realize that if I hurt myself I hurt my partner."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2710,"When times get rough, I usually try to talk it out with a friend. I do this because it allows me to get whatever is causing me to stress off my mind and destress. Also, I tend to talk it out with my friends because they sometimes give me advice or encourage me to continue pushing through whatever is challenging. However, if I cannot talk it out with a friend, I usually try to sleep off whatever is stressing me out or leave it be and try again later. I do this so that I can have time to think and reevaluate my approach to whatever is causing me to feel stressed or what is challenging me. Also, I tend to sleep things off because I do not get enough sleep, and I think that if I ignore it, it'll go away.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2707,"When life gets challenging, I usually start by sitting on tiktok for anywhere up to an hour of time. If I'm feeling okay enough, I'll walk outside to get some fresh air and/or exercise. I usually call my mom at some point too. And at some point in all of this, I put things into perspective, and yes the things I'm stressing about matter, but I am the one that gives them importance, and I can choose to see the bigger picture that they fit into, but only play a small role within. I usually then try to accomplish small things so that I feel like I'm achieving little victories that will give me progress. At some point in all of this I start to feel better. Another thing that helps is seeing how other people are doing, because often I'm not alone in the struggle, or else, they are doing well and can be supportive. Overall, for me, it helps to tune out my problems a bit, find some distractions so that I feel a bit refreshed, and once I'm ready, I will be willing to tackle my problems bit by bit, and I find that it's not all so bad."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2709,What I tend to do when life gets challenging is take a break and focus on things that make me happy. One of the examples would be either painting in a quite area. Or I could watch a movie that has humor and a happy ending to brighten my day. Another thing I do is my fish hobby where I clean my tank and trim as well as fix the plants to my liking. I would also try to go out with my friends and have a good time. The last thing that I do that is not the best would be buying expensive things like a crazy amount of clothes that I do not need or an electric. In the end it is always good to take a break and stop worrying for a second to relax and come back stronger or with a better plan to succeed in what ever I was struggling with. Every time life gets hard I tend to view it as a lesson for the future I do my best not to bring  myself down because there will always be another way.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2712,"When life gets challenging, my solution can go to two ways: I take a rest day or contact friends or family. Normally, things start to become difficult when I get overwhelmed with schoolwork or my week becomes packed. An overwhelming week can lead to burnout and affect my daily schedule and work. Taking a rest day means that I do not do work for that day and enjoy eating my favorite snacks while doing my favorite activities. I prefer taking rest days as a way to have a mental reset and avoid having more burnout. Contacting friends or family is another way to make way to help with a challenging week because it is a good way to remind myself that I am not alone. Being in college by myself is fun but there are times when I get homesick and feel lonely. Talking to someone from my hometown makes me feel better."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2714,"Whenever life gets challenging I feel like I definitely feel the pressure that it creates and maybe the anxiety but I try to find things to do that can help make it so it is not as bad. Picking up new hobbies, going outside, going to the beach, and just having the positive mindset that it will get better is the only way I feel like to reel in my personal compass of what I should do rather than spiraling out of control. Sometimes I do just go to sleep and hope I will not feel the pressure but it always comes back so doing things to keep your mental health up is always a good thing to do. I know that talking to people can also help or even just express your feelings instead of letting them simmer and get super hunormous. Going to the gym is another thing that helps me keep my anxiety down I recently started skating again and I think that has helped me not feel overwhelmed."
