My significant other especially I can depend on because she is always here for me and has never left me stranded. The school resources are pretty okay but I mostly depend on my friends/family to help me through whatever I need. My roommates are also very helpful do that is nice to know. I think overall having a good back bone is beneficial for anyone who is in school and working.

Overall I am very thankful for the support that I have and hope that everyone has support that they need."

When we have questions we're able to bounce ideas off of each other, especially in classes where the class doesn't learn well from the teacher in a unit, or some of us have to miss class. I also have a friend who went to a tutor on campus, which I am really considering next semester for some of my harder classes, and honestly probably should have taken this semester.

I am aware I have several sources around me and I will always make sure to use them."

I also have my peers who I can commiserate with when times get tough. Whether it be finals week, writing essays, or just a rough time in the year my fellow students can assist me in my learning. I have not been relying on these resources very heavily, and that may be something I need to work on in the future. I've never been good at asking for help or seeking it out.

I can't really think of anything in particular that is a resource that helps me with the material in this class though. I suppose the main resource I lean on in this class is YouTube. Whenever I am a bit confused about a concept, I will watch as many videos on Youtube as I need to in order to get a solid grasp for the material. Otherwise, when times are hard, I find that I will call my parents to vent and they will remind me that it will all be okay and they will help me figure out which action items I can take in order to improve upon my current situation. I also lean on my friends to keep my spirits high and remind me that life is about having a good laugh now and then and that it will all work out in the end."
