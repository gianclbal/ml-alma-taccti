2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2717,"One of my main goals this semester is to really try and complete my work ahead of time. Not waiting until the due date, but rather doing it when I have the time to complete it. A lot of the stress I feel comes from when my things pile up, and while to a certain extent, this is unavoidable, I can help lessen how often this happens by making sure I'm doing my work at the provided opportunities I have, rather than waiting until I have to get it done. This class has been making sure to hold me accountable with this, as while I can wait until the following week to submit it, I've been relatively good about completing the work the day of so I don't lose track of it. This semester I ended up taking on a lot more than I had been previously, even though I lowered my units to 12 (previously I had been doing 15-16 per semester), I am working a lot and doing a handful of extracurriculars, making it really important that I nail this skill this semester."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2716,"I want to find something that I can study passionately. My hope is that I can find an area of science within my major (Geology) that fascinates me. I also hope that I don’t fall too helplessly in love, so that I can get an industry job, rather than becoming a research scientist. This class will expose me to the basics of how our physical world operates. Geology is interdisciplinary and definitely studies the physical world. So, this class may help me discover an area of science in which I’d like to become an expert."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2715,"My goals currently are to try and pass all my classes with decent grades while still having fun this semester and not spending all my time on studying. One possible way I can do that is to try and manage a balance of work and fun so that way I am not prioritizing one over the other, no matter how much I want to slack of and play video games. Making sure that I am keeping up with all the schoolwork and understanding the concepts is an important part of maintaining my grades and my knowledge so that I can pass the exams that are given. There are some difficult concepts that I am taking this semester such as this physics class, as  I am notoriously bad at math. This class is helping me achieve my goal by explaining the concepts and giving me practice to solve these problems, as well as not piling on a lot of extra work to do other than the work given within the class period. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2708,"My goals are to graduate by the end of this year.  This class helps me get into one of the last few classes that I can take for my degree.  This class is also helping me by preparing me for the second iteration of this course.  I am sure when I take physics with calculus two, I will have to recall some of the information or formulas and use it as applied sciences.  I also think it is cool to work in a lab and learn how to work with others.  It can show you how others thing and more importantly, how to function with a team who may have conflicting thoughts.  How you reach the end goal is a great way to challenge each other to try to complete the task  I am assuming that most of us in this class will have to try and work together with peers in our fields given that we are STEM.  Hopefully everybody in my career path is just as pleasant to work with as my lab partners!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2712,"My goals for my overall life is to become a physical therapist and become stable in the modern world. I have noticed that as the years start to progress, it starts to become more competitive in several jobs. So I hope to make it through that competitiveness and make it big in my career. This class is helping me achieve my goals by finishing a part of my degree. Anything that helps me complete a part of my degree allows me to get one step closer to my dream job. By taking this class, I am also exploring other occupations that are in the stem field. Although my dream job is to become a physical therapist, I would like to have backup options for my career. This class is also helping me with general physics and in a way this class helps review concepts seen in my physics lecture. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2707,"What are my goals? I feel like we spend so much time answering and attending to the answers of a far different question--what are my tasks? what do I need to do?--that I often forget about this question and the answer to it. My goal is to enter the medical field--whether it be as a doctor, nurse, physical therapist--I don't know quite yet. So I suppose part of my goal in this class is it complete it in order to further my pursuit within the medical field. However, I don't feel as though that is my entire goal in this class--as in I don't feel as though I am here just to get a class completed on my transcript. I feel like I am here to enjoy the material. I am here to appreciate the beauty of introductory-level physics. I am here to be here. To take it all in everyday with my classmates and to learn with them. I am here to gain skills that will help me learn and be a better person beyond the classroom. I am here for the process and (as cliché as it sounds) I am here for the journey rather than for the outcome (of having taken this class)."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2713,"It took me quite a while to figure out what I may or may not have had an interest in, and once I did find something I jumped right in and did everything I could to explore it further. Now I am in college, studying that interest and learning more and more about myself and the things around me. Recently I've been wondering if it is actually what I'd like to do. In taking this physics lab and subsequent lecture, I'm remembering how much I enjoy the ideas and concepts of physics, the puzzle-like structure that keeps me interested and intrigued. However, I still don't know what I truly want to do with my life, and I'm hoping to continue in this class will help me see whether or not physics is my desired future. Or if it is something I'll keep in my mind as an enjoyable interest I'll look into as a hobby. Overall, this class is helping me achieve my goal of graduating college, as it is a requirement to take a physics lab, but I decided to take physics. So far, it is as enjoyable and exciting as I expected. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2710,"My ultimate goal is to become either a registered nurse or an occupational therapist. This class is essential for me to reach my purposes because it can help me understand the physics around injuries, like in a car accident, which is necessary. After all, it will help me gauge the severity of an injury and develop a plan to treat a patient's injuries. However, as an occupational therapist, physics is essential because it allows me to understand the basics of human movement. This is important to know because I will then be able to develop a plan or course of action to help those with disabilities have a better range of motion and movement. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2709,One of my goals is to keep expanding my knowledge on every class or course I take. Not only that but I would also like to have a greater understanding in physics as a whole. Another goal of mine is to submit my work ahead of time instead of doing it last minute. I also do hope to get good grades on my upcoming exams. If I am to be honest I do not know how this class is helping me achieve the goals that I have mentioned above. But I am learning new things this semester and it is a good thing.Although I do need to catch up on my notes for various of classes.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2711,"My goals for this class is to pass this class and also achieve a higher understanding of physics through lab and through doing the actual assignments so I can be a better learner and also fulfill the requirements for my major. I think that I would be better able to learn from my mistakes but also learn from within and how I can be a better person as a result of those mistakes. I think that I can also be a better functioning human being when I am trying to learn by hands and in person. Additionally, I think that outside of the classroom, my goals are to become a Software Engineer and such competing this class and also completing other great courses to reach my goal of getting my degree and going further with it is very crucial in trying to make sure that I can be proficient in my studies and what I want to do in my career and in my life. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2714,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""My goals are to be successful in all my classes as a full-time student and work part-time. Ilearn is a different website than my previous college so adjusting to it has been a little edgy. I think this class is helping me, especially with the physics lecture to understand what is going on a little better. I wish that the lab and lecture lined up more but that I am learning around it. I think that it is getting somewhat easier but I am still missing an assignment or a few and it is annoying. I will pick up the slack and try to not miss anything but since I have 2 classes with lectures and lab it is a little tough."
