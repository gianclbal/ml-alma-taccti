2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2711,"I think that the values of my community have impacted me in a very special way. As such, it has helped me to pursue my dreams and what I want to do in my life and in my career. I think that my family as a community has really helped me in a way that they were able to not only give me tips and help when navigating my life, they also helped me to steer into the right direction when I needed the help and the more streamlined ways of being the best version of myself and help me with my paths and goals. I think that there is also a part of my community – my culture which has influenced me to do great things in life. I wholeheartedly think that my community has helped me with so many goals and passions of mine that we are all able to be connected as a whole and as a bunch to help ourselves whenever we need help. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2707,"This is a very tricky question. I suppose one value that my mom has very much imparted on me is to not take anything too seriously--that we are all ants on a large world, so any little hiccup will pass. Also, my running coach is famous among our running community for his quote, ""don't let the highs get too high or the lows get too low"" which at first I responded with, ""okay, buzzkill."" But over time, I have really come to appreciate his commitment to being content, and that he has helped us adopt that mindset as well. I will also say, that my parents are very hardworking people, so their own dedication to being productive and diligent members of society has inspired and motivated me to do the same in my academic pursuits. As in, there are no two people who try their hardest than my parents, and so I feel a responsibility to try hard as well in order to emulate them."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2712,"The values of my family have guided me throughout my life. There are going to be times where I won’t have my family there to help me with everything. In order to gain independence, I need to learn how to make choices by myself and I can use advice and values from my family to help guide that."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2717,"My parents have always been people who are really supportive and there for me when I need them to be. We fought a good amount, just like with most other kids, but they knew when I needed them to bite the bullet and support me in what I wanted to do, its something I've always really appreciated about them. I haven't been the most consistently driven student, I went through a lot of patches in high school and college where I gave up on most of my classes. I think a lot of parents may not support me going into a more difficult STEM major with this habit, but my parents have always really been supportive of doing what you think you will succeed in, regardless of what it is. There was a chunk of time when I had a solid alternate path for me to take that didn't have to do with my degree and was unconventional, but my parents without hesitation supported me with this path if I did decide to take it. Them supporting me in whatever I felt best suited me has made me a lot happier with the degree and where I am in college now."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2709,The values of my community had helped me navigate through college by constantly letting me know that they have my back in any situation. For example if I ever need advice in relation to academics there are advisors I can contact not only that but the campus community also does these small activities to help students destress on midterm weeks and final weeks which I am thankful for. I also like how the housing community also do there best to motivate students and destress them from exams. Lastly I like how my community takes final exams seriously by emailing the students and reminding them of quiet and study hours. Now for my family I will also know that I have there support and that they have faith in me to do my best in college. I am extremely thankful for my community and family. The little things matter in any situation especially during testing.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2713,"While never explicitly pushing me, my family has always been a strong advocate for college. They always told me to prepare and get set up for my eventual moving out and expansion for college. I also feel my community in my dorm and the people I heavily interact with are all useful in helping me navigate college. Whether it be moral support, help with homework or classes, or just distracting me when things got complicated. I may be a bit biased since I live in a dorm but the people around me are in a very similar place and I am thankful I get to know them. I was told a lot growing up that school is very important, so those values are pretty ingrained into my head. Set in my way of thinking I've always put a lot of my focus on education and the pursuit of education. Whether that be learning or working to afford that education. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2716,"At the moment, I’m navigating a difficult situation, and I’d like to discuss how my family’s values have helped me and continue to help me navigate this situation. My professor is great; he’s a top-notch lecturer. However, they haven't done any grading this semester. It is the final week of class, and I have no idea where I stand. I’ve taken two exams, written one paper, given one in-person presentation, and received zero feedback. My family values encourage forgiveness and kindness in the face of mistreatment. I have maintained a polite and professional attitude towards my professor so far. Today, when I go to class to take my final exam, I will remain kind and forgiving, remembering my personal need for forgiveness and desire for kind treatment."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2714,"overall I feel like the values of ,y family helped me navigate through college so far in that I have their support and that persevering through tough times has a greater outcome than not trying at all. The motto has always been “better die trying than never try at all” I think I hold this true to me because I definitely will do that and I think I am grateful for this because it has kept ,e stable and motivated to keep on going. Another thing that has helped me was making friends and having friends that are also in college and struggling together makes me feel not so alone and that I will be able to overcome this."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2715,"The values of my community have helped me navigate through college trying my hardest to try and get the best grades that I can. My family and people in my community value grades and doing well in school very highly so it's important that I am able to pass my classes with decent grades. As well it has influenced the career that I want to go into. The stereotype is too go into STEM majors like medical or engineering, and that is what I have done by being a biology major. I am happy with the choices I have made due to these influences and very happy that I was interested in science to pursue my major. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2710,"My friends and family have kept me grounded while I am in college. There have been many times when I have felt overwhelmed when looking at assignments that are due. However, after talking on the phone or texting my family and friends about my struggles, I have always felt better. In addition, they have also motivated and encouraged me to study and do well because they know what my goals are and that I can reach my goals. For example, I can say that this semester has been one of the most challenging semesters I have had so far due to the amount of classwork I have done and because I am at a higher level of burnout and stress. Because of this, I have been pretty dependent on my friends and family to help calm me down and help me stay motivated, and finish off strong. Talking to them on a semi-often basis has helped relieve my stress as well as kept me determined to make the best out of the last weeks we have in the semester. "
