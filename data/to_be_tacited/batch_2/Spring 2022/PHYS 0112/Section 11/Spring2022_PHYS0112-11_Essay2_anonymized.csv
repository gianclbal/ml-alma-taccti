2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2825,"My goal is to understand vectors and how it is used when graphing and how it would be used in daily life as well. This class is helping me achieve it by sketching vectors and drawing it in different examples. I used the stimulation activity to answer the following questions in the lab about the direction of vectors for practice. This class also helped me understand that vectors are very important when it comes to finding out the directional aspects of physical quantities, like for example, net force or acceleration and predicting many consequences while studying to bodies in physics. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2822,"Well, well, my goal is to achieve my biochem degree and find a job in the biotech field. The reason being is that I love doing all the biotech subjects in high school. Most people dislike it because you had to do repetitive things such as making many different solutions and pipetting them in certain amounts to soon later put it into a test tube. There’s also the fact that everything needs to be done right or you need to redo everything. But taking this class helps me achieve my goal because it’s one of the classes that I need to move on to the next level of physics and it’s a requirement for my major. I mean lately, I do use the thing that we learn from physics for my games. Like, thank you for the lessons of force because that stuff is useful in a game of pool ( 8 ball ).  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2831,"My goal is to learn physics in depth! I'm in school to study biochemistry and that is what interests me most, but I also love learning about science in general. Any study of mechanics or reality is interesting to me and I hope to actually get a good grasp on physics and what this course encompasses. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2812,"I feel a bit stressed today. I am not sure if I am just in a mood where I am more anxious and that is causing my stress or if I am actually stressing over things that matter. I do think that I overanalyze a lot and I can dwell on the future and the unknown. I heard that the key to happiness is being present and being in the moment. I believe that this is 100% true. I think I just need to remember to be more present in the next few days and not start imagining horrible scenarios and freaking out over things that haven't even happened. I guess I should take solace in the fact that it is not just me experiencing these issues, but everyone has their own problems and we all must learn to deal accordingly. I do hope that everything will be okay. My intuition is that it will be fine and I am overreacting however I am stressing so much that it is drowning out my intuition and making me more anxious. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2832,"My current goal is to do well and pass this class. To accomplish this goal, I must do the given work that my professor assigns to us every week. The number of tasks due for both physics 111-05 and 112-11 every week is the same. The PowerPoint slide, along with the lecture videos for the week’s topic, the icebreaker due Monday night, the community resources link due Wednesday night, and the weekly blog entry, along with the practice problem due Friday night. Then we have the first lab assignment, which usually consists of more than 5 pages, and the second lab assignment, which usually consists of 2 pages, all due Friday night. Lastly, we have to do the Expert TA homework, which usually consists of more than 5 problems, and the quiz, both due Sunday night. I can safely say I will pass this class if I can manage to submit everything on time."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2821,"My goals this year are to better myself through nutrition, exercise, academics, and socializing. I am also on the track team here at San Francisco State University and my goal this semester is to improve my track times and to try and enjoy training and having fun with my team. Every day I try to spend some part of it learning about something new or doing something for myself that will benefit my physical and mental health. This year I want to consume less sugar, weight lift more, and get better grades than I did last semester. Since Physics 112 is related to my academics, I will devote time and effort to this class hopefully so that I can get the grade that I strive for and learn something new about the world that I can use in my everyday life. I do not know that much about physics, but I think of that as a good thing as there is plenty of room to learn about physics which I am super excited about."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2824,"One of my goals is to graduate from college. This class is helping me to achieve these goals because I know that I am one step closer to being able to do that. I am not majoring in physics, but my biology major does require that I take general physics classes in order to understand the physical world a bit more. Although it feels as though I may not use what I will learn in this class, I know that I will learn other lessons from it, such as problem-solving and learning how to work with others. When I took calculus in high school, I remember my teacher telling me that he enjoys his job because he knows that he is helping students get one step closer to their goals, whether or not they are math-related. That really resonated with me because I think about how some classes feel a little worthless in the long run. However, I know that the classes that I am taking, even if they are not directly related to the major I am taking or my future career, will take me one step closer to graduating."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,1753,"Some of my personal and professional goals have been coming into fruition lately! I am so excited for the upcoming year. Otherwise, my goals are to have a better understanding in both physics and science. I am currently studying to be a marine biologist and I find that these classes are integral to my success in this field. I was able to take this class this semester prior but was faced with different challenges in my personal life. Now that I do not have those same responsibilities, I am able to completely devote my attention and time to concepts in school such as this one. This class will help me have a deeper understanding of topics that I was not able to grasp initially. I find that with these types of classes it becomes more enjoyable once I have a better understanding, but it is harder for me when things are a bit confusing. I will have to explore my challenges a bit more and do my best to work through my previous mistakes. This semester will be my chance to do so."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2830,"I want to be an emergency physician at UCSF hospital, which also happens to be my dream medical school. I just love their facilities and the location of the hospital is absolutely gorgeous. Right now I'm doing a lot of extracurriculars to achieve my goal, right now I am doing a lot of nonclinical volunteer hours at SF Marin Food bank. I, along with a team of volunteers, package and distribute groceries for those in need. I found this volunteer work very rewarding, not because it will help me get volunteer hours, but because I am able to give back and help my newfound community. I plan on continuing my volunteer journey for the rest of my life. In the summer I am also taking EMT courses so I can receive some clinical hours, although I am restricted to basic life support, which is probably best, I am looking forward to being able to experience what being an EMT has to offer. If everything goes well and I pass the class, I will be certified and working EMT by Fall 2022. In terms of this class, physics is one of the many topics of the MCAT. I plan on taking it after I graduate just so I can get as many volunteer hours, EMT working hours, and research hours in as I can. I feel as if this course is actively preparing me for the near future of this section of the MCAT, which is in big part to my professor's ability to express the topics well enough for me to comprehend the information. I also find it interesting how physics plays a daily role in our lives, so I feel as if my understanding of physics will help me in the long run in regard to my understanding of the natural world. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2823,"Reflective Journaling #2My biggest goal for as long as I could remember is to go into the medical field. Throughout the years the exact specialty has changed variously. From psychiatry to cardiology to trauma doctor to neurology, I have spent most of my life exploring health professions. My main goal right now is to finish college as best as I can so I can go to medical school. Hopefully, while there I can solidify a specific specialty and practice it. In order to achieve this, a big prerequisite is talking at least two semesters of physics classes with labs. Medical schools want to ensure that you are equipped with all of the necessary STEM classes. There are many attributes of general biology, chemistry, and physics that are brought back up throughout the health profession. Depending on which specialty you go into, certain courses are brought up a lot. Although I am interested in learning more about physics, this course will help me fulfill my prerequisite to achieve my goal of going into the medical field. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2833,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""My goals are to learn effectively while in class, I understand using outside resources are important for a more well rounded learning experience so you can absorb all the material but I’d like to do it with time efficiency in mind especially when it’s not my strong suit, I’d like to pass this class to move on with my biochemistry degree and I’m hoping that the concepts I learn here will aid me in my studies later on in future classes. I’m not sure how physics plays a role in chemistry exactly but I’m hoping to figure that out as we move along in the course. I hope I can also apply some of this information to real life scenarios. I like when it has more purpose than just for school so I’m looking forward to that."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,706,"My goals are to graduate in the year 2023 from San Francisco State University with a bachelor in science degree for microbiology, then try to get my PhD, so I can pursue my dream career of working in a lab and conducting research. In order to achieve my first goal of graduating in 2023 with a bachelor in science degree for microbiology, I have to meet all my graduation requirements. This means that I have to take PHYS 111/112 and pass, so that I can take the next required physics class for my major, which is PHYS 121/122. I plan to study hard and learn tons of physics topics and content, so I can pass and be more prepared for PHYS 121/122. Since my dream career is to work in a lab and conduct research, this physics lab class is the next best thing, even if it is just online. I feel that this lab class has helped me practice and improve my communication skills, as well as allow me to meet other students who are in the same major as me. I almost forgot to enroll in this class because it has a separate enrollment number than the lecture class. Luckily, my major advisor reminded me, so I am very grateful."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2814,My goals for this class is to get an A and takeaway the basics of physics to be prepared for Physics 2. I am currently going to school at SFSU to get my degree in Biochemistry. My plan after is to get into a great acupuncture program where I will pursue natural Chinese medicine. Long term I know that I want to create something of my own and create an environment where I can make people feel better and happy. I know the potential I can have if I go to school and learn more about this field of natural and herbal medicine. My goal is to find my purpose so that I will have a platform and chance to spread this knowledge. I've always wanted to go into healthcare and be a source of healing and support. There is an opportunity to become a doctor in Chinese medicine. This has something that I've become interested in as it fits into a career that I see myself having. This class is helping me reach my goals by fulfilling the requirements of my degree. Getting a grasp and understanding of physics will help me master all kinds of science courses that this university offers. I also feel that this class will further help increase my knowledge. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2827,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""  One of my main goals in life is to find happiness within myself and what I choose to do with life. I feel like people often forget about that and are lost in life because they never really found true happiness. I wasn’t to be able to have a stable life where I can support my family in any way possible whether it be financially or emotionally. Even though physics isn’t my best subject I want to be able to do my best in this class. Taking this course will help me move on with my degree and graduate. Hopefully in the following few years I will have a career that I am happy and content with. Obviously having a well paying job is everyone wants but I honestly just want to have a career that I would be happy to do for the rest of my life. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2819,"I've said in the previous journal that I'm not really sure what my direction in life really is. I guess the short term is to just graduate college with good grades. I think this class is helping me achieve these goals because it helps me understand concepts better. At the same time, I feel like it can't help as much because each lab is 3 hours and most of the concepts so far have been easy for me to understand without help. It's a little fun, but extremely time-consuming and isolating. At the very least, this class allows me time to do the work, and there's no other additional work. It's busywork, which is good sometimes if I want to relax. But other than class, I don't think this class has any more dimension to it. While physics, in general, is interesting, I haven't seen it in a light that makes me connect with the subject with my heart, which is expected. These journals are nice too because I heard that journaling is actually really good for mental health, and every time I try to do it consistently, I stop. So it's nice that there are these assignments."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2834,"My goals are to understand what I am really passionate about. So far during my college experience, I have changed my major from nursing to environmental science. Since then, I have become much more passionate about school and what I am studying. This class is furthering my scientific career which is always helpful. I think it is always helpful to learn as much about a subject as possible in order to major in it and start a career in it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2820,"My goals for this class is to understand the concepts and the formulas for tests, quizzes, and the following course Physics 2 after this semester. I want to really achieve that goal so I can pass both of the classes. But, I really want to understand the concepts so I can apply it to my higher division courses that will have some relations with physics.This class is helping me achieve that goal by giving me the basics to learn and apply to simple solutions. Although the solutions may be challenging at times, I understand it is the easiest in its forms right now compared to the class after this. I also have taken calculus already and these math formulas are much easier than I know It will be in the future. Also, the professor does a good job at being available for whatever help or questions we need. She creates a welcoming environment that helps me feel comfortable to reach out during zoom, in the chat box, and emailing."
