2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2833,"When life gets challenging I feel the urge to give up, I don't think living life should be difficult, I think that life is super short and living with pain, or struggle when it's not necessary is time we waste because others believe it's the only way to succeed by killing yourself to be the most productive you that you can be when in reality we need more rest than what is permitted and the fact that we see rest as something to be earned and not something that's easily obtainable speaks a lot about how we value each other's well-being."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2824,"When life gets challenging, I don’t do any one specific thing to help me feel better. I think that I always change it up based on what I need at that moment and depending on what challenges I am facing. When it comes to more personal challenges, especially emotional ones, I find it important to just feel my feelings at that moment. I have read online that it is important to take some time to just reflect and feel any emotions that you may have been repressing, so that you don’t bottle it all up and explode at the worst times. I’ve found this to be really helpful because dismissing any “negative” feelings will just make you feel worse over time. When it comes to school work, I try to focus on what I can and can’t control. For example, I recently had a large homework assignment due the night before a midterm exam. The problem with this was that part of the assignment was based on material we had not learned yet until the day it was due. I focused my attention towards the problems that I knew I could do and hoped that I would have enough time that night to finish the other problems. As for the exam, I knew that I should have started studying earlier than usual, so I did. It worked out in my favor because I was able to study for my midterm and the deadline for the assignment was pushed back."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2822,"Just thinking about life is hard enough. Since you never we really never know what will happen in this life of ours. A day could be either good or bad, but considering how we people are just starting with college it’s been stressful. So here’s something that I do when I’m having a bad day. ( Trust me this is just a list of things that I do to relieve stress ) One of those is to just sleep. Sleep is just the best feeling out there, no matter what’s going on you can just sleep your worries away. Then later you can have a fresh mindset. Then another thing that I do to destress is just to do one of my hobbies. Hobbies are a great thing to do no matter what it is. For example, I like to bake, So I can just bake away my worries. Then finally another thing to do when life gets tough is to listen to music and breathe. To me, music is the one thing that helps make me cry when I get so frustrated in life or it can be such a big mood booster."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2825,"There will undoubtedly be times in our lives when we must face obstacles, but the real difficulty will be how we grow and learn from them. As naive youngsters, we foolishly assumed that life would be straightforward and painless. Oh, we were sorely mistaken, we can only want for life to be so simple. My personal life has been full of exhausting ups and downs. I felt like I was on a never-ending roller coaster of challenges. As we grow from children to adults, we will confront plenty of new challenges that will only contribute to growth and importance. I'd give anything to go back to the days when I believed learning division was difficult. Life was never designed to be easy, it was meant to be a quest-filled trip that we must complete regardless of the obstacles that stand in our way. Like a roller coaster, everyone's life has its ups and downs. We can't stop the roller coaster, it's part of human life cycle. We are taught throughout our lives that even our failures are better to our wins. If we don't learn from it and go through these obstacles we aren't living life we are just in one spot. So life will always be challenging but it will always make you stronger and learn new things every time. When things do get challenging let's say I'm not doing so well in a course I will try to find help and try to work my way up instead of giving up. It is hard and draining but life will always throw you with challenges."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2820,"When life gets challenging what I do is usually get anxious and stressed out. I have come to the realization that it is a normal part of being human though and that everyone, not only me, can feel this way too. What I usually do to ease the tension or stress is take a nap. When I take a nap it makes me feel better because it allows me to not think about anything but myself for a little bit. Then, when I wake up I can focus on the tasks I have at hand. I usually perform better because I have that sluggish attitude that doesn't let me get stressed easily. It allows me to do things one thing at a time because I don't have the mental capacity to think of so many different things at once. But, I try not to take too many naps because that also makes me get enough things done for the day."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2834,"When life gets challenging I try to tske a step back and do something that makes me happy. That could include listening to music, talking to friends, or watching TV. For me, it is helpful to recognize that I am feeling overwhelmed in order to redirect my attention to something else and take a break. Its really easy to wallow in that feeling and get even more overwhelmed. So focusing on the things that make me happy for awhile helps me remember that not all of life consists of the hard parts. I really enjoy watching tv shows or movies and reading books becasue I am able to transport myself into a different lifetime and escape for awhile. This usually helps motivate me to get back to work. Another thing that helps motivate me is cleaning. I don't know why, but it valms me down and makes me feel like I have control of something. This also goes for taking showers. They really help to destress me and bring me back to the real world."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2835,"I like to be outside. Being around people that have a positive outlook on life. Positive energy. Being with dogs. When the sun is shining and it’s warm outside. The warm weather makes me feel less stressed and helps me to feel positive. I also like reading and learning new things, sometimes watching funny videos. I try to set aside time to be alone and decompress. I feel more energized after I get to spend some time alone, even though I like being around people. I’ve heard there’s a term for that – an extroverted introvert or something like that. I enjoy trying new foods and new café’s. There is a really good breakfast burrito café that I like to go to when I have free time. I love whole foods too, going grocery shopping is always fun."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2819,"When life gets challenging, I first need a break. I need to push it off until the next day. I don't think this is necessarily bad because if I'm having a bad time, everything I do will not be quality work. So I take a break, and if life is challenging because I am overwhelmed with work, then I plan what I need to do. I write what needs to get done and when. Then I do it. If life is challenging because of my emotions, a good sleep is usually enough. I might also do some stretches or mindfulness activities. I think I really just need breaks. Breaks can help me reset. Maybe take a walk. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2827,"When life gets challenging, I usually reach out to whoever I feel closest to and the most comfortable with. I feel like it’s always a good thing to talk about your feelings and cry it out. Personally, I think it’s more difficult when you hold in a lot of things, but I understand that some people don’t have people to talk to. Sometimes I feel like that too. I’m a very emotional person so I always cry about everything, but it makes me feel so much better afterwards!! I used to hate crying but now I embrace my emotions more and I feel like that really helps when life gets challenging. Other than that, I do like to have some time alone and reflect on things or just distract myself with tv shows, movies, painting and working out (anything that won’t make me feel lonely). It really does depend on the situation but those are the main things that helps me a lot."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2815,"When life gets challenging I do get very anxious and overwhelmed. I tend to not want to do anything and ignore responsibilities as things pile up and get more difficult. But a trick that I’ve done since I was younger is to imagine myself after my stressful tasks are done. For example imagining myself after finals week feeling good about the grades I have received. After doing so I tell myself, “Well I need to do x, y, and z in order to get there”. It's kind of like motivating myself to take one step at a time so I can reach my end goal. I’ll collect myself, get organized, and start chipping away at the obstacles ahead of me. Envisioning my goal also makes the challenging time go by much faster in my opinion. I also make sure to dedicate some spare time to myself so that way I don’t feel burnt out before accomplishing my goal."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2830,"I approach every single challenge the same way, I always give it my all until it's overcome. What I've learned throughout my life is that there is never a challenge that I can't overcome and there is never a challenge that's going to be easy. I taught myself how to never give up in the face of adversity, although, it may get frustrating or even stressful at times, I'll never give up. This can be applied to anything, really, whether that's getting better in a class, completing an assignment, completing a workout, or even getting through the day can be tough sometimes. I would say that life itself is a challenge, so I approach life as a never-ending grind to reach a certain point in life or to achieve a goal that seemed impossible, to begin with. What it really comes down to, for me, is how much work I am willing to put into a challenge. I learned to hold myself accountable for challenges that I don't want to overcome, but I always will go headfirst into the challenge and complete it to the best of my abilities. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2814,"When life gets challenging I immediately try to take a step back and reevaluate my routine. I tend to catch these moments as fast as I can because it'll be worse if I bottle in my feelings and eventually get too overwhelmed. I enjoy going outside on walks or to the beach. I also enjoy going out to eat for dinner and hanging out with my friends. It was important for me to understand my idea of fun because when life gets challenging I know how to let loose and relieve all the tension. I'm really lucky to have a supportive family that help me through everything in life. When life gets challenging, I tend to lean on them a lot for emotional support. Another thing I do is I make a list of my priorities and goals. I make a extensive list of all the things that need to be done or anything worth writing down. It helps me visualize what my schedule looks like and gives me more control on my plans. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2821,"When life gets challenging I usually have two different responses. Sometimes I shut down and get a little depressed and quit on myself, but usually, I am open to challenges and barriers because I think that is how we grow and it feels really good to accomplish something that was not an easy accomplishment. I like to be busy so I try and always to be doing something productive and meaningful. I usually have a difficult time with the physics labs, but the breakout room is really beneficial because I have great classmates that help me out when I am struggling. We pick each other up when we need it and I am super thankful for that. With my support circle, I usually have a good response to a challenge and am able to overcome it. When I need help with something I will usually try and seek it out depending on how comfortable I am with others, but I feel comfortable talking to my professors and classmates if I need extra help."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,1753,"When life gets challenging, I do my best to recenter my focus. This means that I must prioritize certain things, especially when my focus begins to change. I find that not being able to ""see the forest from the trees"" is what makes it hard to visualize the ending of difficult times. I tend to do this a lot, because I am so caught into the challenges, that I can forget that something good will come out of it. I also seek out help from my support system, because they can reassure me in areas where I cannot do myself. I also find comfort in having someone empathize with me and listening to what I am going through. It helps because they can also offer insight and understanding where maybe I had overlooked. Journaling and meditating help as well, and can offer some answers to questions that can only be answered with introspection."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2823,"Reflective Journaling #3Overall, I feel that my coping mechanisms when life gets challenging have gotten better the older. Back in high school, I had a habit of procrastinating my work just by stressing about doing it. I did not know how to manage things when life started to get challenging, so I would start to spiral. Now I have learned to organize through my stress. I find it comforting because it makes me feel like my life is more put together and manage my stress.  I put my emotions into more productive things that will help clear my mind. For example, the last two weeks have been extremely challenging. I had many assignments, midterms, and essays due on top of a health issue that sent me to the hospital. It would have been very easy to spiral back into my old coping mechanisms. But I had to prioritize the things that mattered most. Life has many challenges that may test your limits, but at the same time, that is what makes it interesting. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2832,"When things become challenging in life, I like to give myself a pep talk. It's to comfort myself that things will improve as time goes on. However, rather than relying on faith or luck, I must work hard to create a successful life. This way, I'll have the foresight to know where I'm standing and whether or not I've yet reached the lifestyle I desire. If not, I shall know how much more I need to accomplish my goal. After all, if I relied solely on my optimism, I would be fooling myself and blindly waiting for my hope to bloom into reality. It is hard to escape difficult periods in one's life. It always comes unexpectedly or is the result of our actions. Therefore, the wisest decision you can make is to use it as a learning opportunity. These life experiences will strengthen your mental health, patience, and self-assurance."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2812,"I don't know exactly what is most challenging in my life. Perhaps school? Cliche as it is, school demands a lot of my attention and hard work. It's not easy and I feel like the road to knowledge and doing well is somewhat endless. It is hard to not get discouraged as well when you don't do well on a quiz or assignment. There is also the task of balancing out life and school and keeping track of everything. It seems like it's harder now than ever to keep track of everything and perhaps this is a consequence of online as there are multiple due dates for different days and different assignments. I wonder if everyone feels this way or maybe it is just me. I think that I can manage this stress and these changes but sometimes when you are in your twenties it feels like everything changes every 5 minutes and the people you think will be in your life forever aren't and everything you thought to be true about life and even yourself, isn't. Maybe that is dramatic but so is life sometimes. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,706,"Currently, many of the challenges in my life are academic related. There are times when I get overwhelmed and extremely stressed out with classes and homework assignments. I am a microbiology major, so I take STEM classes, which often take up much of my time. If I do not understand a topic or concept, I usually ask my peers or professors for help. For other challenges in my life that are not academic related, I take a break from everything and try to clear my head. During these breaks, I do things that relax me, such as listening to music, reading, exercising, breathing exercises, eating snacks, watching an episode of my favorite drama show, or sleeping. I also talk to my close friends and family members. I share my thoughts and ask them for advice, which they provide, along with their support. Lastly, when life gets too much and I am freaking out with no solutions at all, I just sit down and do absolutely nothing. Sometimes, just doing nothing is the best solution."
