2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2812,I feel very fortunate to have a lot of resources available to me. I have a great support system with my family and friends. My parents are always there for me for great advice and help. My friends can teach me a lot in life and help me in school. I feel lucky as well to have a support system for me with my school which provides education and psychological help. I also think we live in a really amazing time where the internet can provide everyone with some great resources and help. It is really nice to know that there are so many resources out there for help. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2833,"In terms of valuable resources, I have my peers for support. They are in the same situation as me so discussing issues will be more relatable to a certain degree opposed from professors who are also a sufficient resource. Asking for clarity might not always give us what we need, as many don't have time to allocate undivided attention to student concerns, in that case there's always the internet for help and better understanding."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,706,"The first resource that I have to support me are my family and friends. Whenever I am worried about something or need help, my family and friends are there to offer me advice and assistance. The second resource that I have to support me, would be San Francisco State University, particularly my college professors because they are always making sure me and my classmates are aware of the tutoring, advising, counseling, and health services that the college offers to students for free. My college professors are also very assertive in announcing their office hours, which are extremely helpful for me when I do not understand a topic or concept, and I need more clarification. A third resource that I have to support me, is the library and the library databases. The library and the library databases are especially helpful when I need to research and search for articles and text for an essay or a class project. I find a ton of information this way. Lastly, the Palega Park & Recreation Center near my house is a great resource too. I love going there to exercise and relax by playing tennis or basketball on their free courts."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,1753,"I find that there are plenty of academic resources available on campus to aid in my education. I have consulted them many times, and they helped me progress in areas in which I had trouble with. Without the academic support given to me in this regard, I think I would’ve had a much harder time understanding some of the core concepts not only in this class, but in others as well. In addition to employing my own study skills, the academic support that is offered just reinforced my understanding of many concepts that I once struggled with. I consider my peers to also be another resource, since there is so much to learn from them. I admire their knowledge in subject areas that I am less familiar with, and they can teach me so much about them. I think this is one of the most valuable resources because we are all in this same space together, trying to understand concepts so that we can advance further in our academic careers. Aside from working with other peers, I have online resources which are always readily available to access. With these 3 sources of academic support, I am able to work through certain themes and subjects that I might’ve found challenging."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2824,"I think that I have many different resources to support me in different aspects. When it comes to my specific classes, I know that I can reach out to my instructors for help, whether I am not understanding an assignment or I just need more time to finish something. When it comes to my major, I know that I can schedule an appointment with my major advisor and talk about my plans for the future and they can help me get to where I want to be. When it comes to my personal life, I often reach out to my family and friends for support. They are always understanding of my situation, and the people that I reach out to the most often because of their versatility. It is always comforting to just have someone to vent out to, even if they do not have a solution to my problems. I know that I have support from any angle."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2830,"I think that the most valuable source of support that I have is my family, no matter what I'm going through or if I am bouncing back and forth between going to med school or not. They always make sure that whatever I choose to do with my life that they'll support and love me no matter what. I feel like that is so important to me because I don't feel scared or discouraged with my life choices when it comes to my future goals. I know that one day I am going to be a successful doctor and that is in big part to the support that my family has given me. I wasn't always the best student, but my parents still believed in my ability to succeed as an individual in this ever-changing world. To this day I am now averaging a 4.0 GPA and have never been more proud of myself and grateful for the support that I've received from my family. My brother in particular has helped me so much on my road to medical school, he's guided me in the classes I need to take and the opportunities that I should be partaking in. Because of him, I've been open to all the opportunities that I can get my hands on, I've become an SCI facilitator, I volunteer at food banks, I'm going to become an EMT next semester and I credit my brother for guiding me in this direction."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2821,"I think that San Francisco State University does a great job of providing students with whatever is necessary to be happy and healthy. If you need help with food, there are Gator Groceries that give students a full box of food at least once a week which can be extremely helpful for a lot of students. There are psychological services, tutoring centers, peers, and professors that are here for students. Personally, for me, I can always talk to my friends and I know that they are there for me when I need them and vice versa. I run cross country and track and field here at the University, and as a student-athlete, I feel like I am cared for and the school allows me to be happy and healthy while playing sports and pursuing a college degree. There is a gym that I utilize to work out to try and maintain a healthy lifestyle as well as go to the library to do homework and study. I feel very thankful that SFSU cares about our well-being and provides us with enough resources to do well at school."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2836,"I have two parents who have always been there to give me unconditional love, supporting me financially, and mentally if I need them. I learned that money does not define a person’s character, or value. Kindness, compassion and integrity do. The energy you offer to people in life, is the energy life will offer you. I have to live my life in this manner because it’s the right thing to do. I have strong leadership qualities and interpersonal skills, and the ability to use discretion, maintain confidentiality to provide support and adapt to any environment. I am creative, and it makes me more eager to learn and expand whatever it takes to succeed. My purpose is to become a Physical Therapist. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2815,I’d say the biggest resource of support I have is the amazing technology at my disposal. I can take my laptop anywhere and work on assignments that I need to get done from any location. I am also able to create an agenda in order to keep myself on track with school work as well as other personal obligations. And even when I don’t have my laptop with me and can access everything the same way I would through my phone. I also like to have a planner where I can make a physical copy of my schedule and look at future deadlines. A second resource I have is peers and professors that I am able to talk to whenever I'd like when I need some help. Support from my family is also a big help to motivate me in the long run to finish school and get my degree. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2822,"Well, of course, having all the school resources is one of the many resources that I have but that is a given. My real resource is my family because they have been here supporting me and my studies. They have given me everything that I ask for when I need it for school. Plus my family is something that will always be there for me. They just want me to be able to support myself when I get older and without them, I feel like my life right now wouldn’t be what it is now. Then I guess another resource that I have is the internet/ google. Cause whenever I want to know something or how to spell a certain word I go straight to google. So I wouldn’t sound so dumb in front of other people. Finally, another resource that I have is the library. I didn't know that library cards could expire."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2835,"School has been steadily becoming a little more overwhelming. Work has been busier, which is a good thing I guess. I'm looking forward to summer break for sure. I also feel like the semester has flown by. I'm a little worried about my grade in this class, but I've been doing my best with my hectic life right now.  I am so appreciative of my friends and family who have encouraged me along this journey. It's crazy that the pandemic was almost 2 years ago. I wonder if I would have even return to school if the pandemic didn't happen. I'm definitely learning a lot this semester and I like that there is no final exam for this class. I hope I have been doing well with my assignments. I wonder when the resubmitted assignments will be graded. I hope they get regraded quickly so I can have a better grade in this class. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2827,"When I think what resources I have I mainly think about my family’s support. Family has always been an important factor in my life, and I feel very fortunate to have a family who supports me. My parents are very supportive with what I decide to do in my future, and they have always provided me with financial support. In my life I’ve never experienced what it felt to lack any resources because they tried their best to hide that from us, even though growing we struggled with financial needs. Also, when I think about resources that support me, I think about access to internet and education. In a lot of countries, a lot of kids and adults don’t have these recourses, so I feel more appreciative with what I have and what I have access to. One thing that I feel like I don’t have much support is emotional and mental support. I don’t have many people in my life that I feel comfortable talking with. Emotional support has never really been and important issue in my family and most of the times it gets dismissed. I feel like that is something that I need to work on and find resources that will help me. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2823,"Reflective Journaling #4I feel that at San Francisco State there are many resources offered to me. Even though it is considered a “commuter school”, I think that they do a good job at providing resources to those living on campus or who spend a lot of time here. In between classes, there are a lot of ways to spend your time. I think the library has many resources that are not utilized as much as they should, such as the One Search. It makes it easy to find scholarly articles on specific subjects. I really enjoy the resource of the gym and how accessible it is. It is a very modern facility with many things to do. The one thing I wish changes about these resources is how they are presented. It is very hard to find a discover resources that already exist and are very helpful. I feel like every week I am discovering something that could have been useful. San Francisco State has many viable resources but needs to work on ways to bring them to light."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2819,"I have a lot of resources to support me. For academic support, I can ask my peers, my professors, TASC, and the internet. For mental health support, there are some places from the campus that I don't remember the name of, there's also Kaiser. For emotional support, there are my friends. For financial support, there are loans if I really need them, some programs that give out food and housing support, scholarships, maybe even friends if I really need to ask for money. The most important thing is that I ask for these types of support if I need them. There are a lot of resources but asking the help is how I am actually able to obtain these resources. Most times, I don't like asking for help at all, especially from people I don't like. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2814,"College can be very demanding especially with the path that I’m hoping to take. It’s difficult to have a healthy balance between school and personal life because sometimes school work can overflow into my personal life. But because of that it’s very important for me to have many people to support me as well as great resources to go to when I’m in moments of need. I wished there were more counselors at San Francisco state university that helped with personal and guidance issues because for upper class men or even anybody that’s not a freshman, it’s hard to have guidance from a counselor. Granted this is a big university so it’s difficult to handle so many students. The support primarily comes from my amazing family and friends. I am very grateful to have such amazing parents to help me financially and emotionally. My mom is always there to help me no matter what and guide me whenever I have moments of doubt. I enjoy being able to talk to my sisters, parents, boyfriend and classmates! I’ve found a great study group where they are able to support me with school work and with any hardships I’ll be having. I also have great mentors and people around me that’s helped me with advice on how to go the pre-med route. Meeting doctors, advisors, and professors to go to when I have questions or any helpful advice is something that’s very beneficial in my life. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2813,"the resources I have to support me is my group member as well as my tutor, I try and use YouTube videos and doing practice problems on my own to help myself grasp the topic more easier especially when I know I am a visual learner and I have ADHD so I make sure to try and find all the resources I can when I know a certain topic is going to be difficult for me to understand. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2832,"One of the sources I can use to support myself is by emailing Professor Hossain to give her a heads-up to meet up during office hours. We have three options from which to choose. The first option for Prof. Hossain's office hours is Monday. The hours of operation are from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. The second option for Prof. Hossain's office hours is also Monday. The hours of operation are from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. The third option for Prof. Hossain's office hours is Wednesday. The hours of operation are from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Her email is arefa16@sfsu.edu. Another source I can use to support myself is by signing up for a tutoring meeting. The Tutoring and Academic Support Center (TASC) allows students to drop in via Zoom or in person at the library, room 220. The dates for the online Zoom meeting are available from January 24, 2022, to May 20, 2022. Their hours of operation on Monday through Thursday are from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Their hours of operation on Friday are from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. The dates for the in-person drop-in are available from February 14, 2022, to May 20, 2022. Their hours of operation on Monday through Thursday are from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Their hours of operation on Friday are from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2816,"I have a multitude of resources supporting me, such as my classmates, the lecture links, and even the lecture videos. When I am traveling I am constantly trying to relate my blogs and what I am learning to my day to day life. Especially thinking back to the beginning of the class when we were asked about where we notice physics. Well it is all around us and it is easy to find resources that help aid my learning. Khan academy, and other online resources have been very helpful. I also found that it is beneficial to me to talk it out with my boyfriend even though he does not understand it, finding a way to explain it to him in simpler terms makes me understand the concepts more. It is not always easy but I think the resource link and the lecture videos really help too! I can go back to the videos or my notes and find the specific things that I need to learn and master. I do struggle but only because I have so much going on, I think that having classmates and YouTube have helped explain specifics. "
