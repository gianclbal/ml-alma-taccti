Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2812,"Why am I here? I am not entirely sure. I think it often depends on how large or small the question is being framed. On a larger, big sense, I am not sure. I think that perhaps there is no larger purpose to mankind. This is all just a huge coincidence that we are living on earth and even living at all. I do not believe that we have a superior purpose or calling above anything in the universe. our existence seems large and profound to us but our existence is as possible and as valuable as an ant. The only difference is that we somehow have evolved to have a consciousness that allows us to ask such questions. But does consciousness change our value or inherently promise purpose? Why should it? Why should consciousness be equated to value? There are plenty of things in this world that are more valuable to the ecosystem and life on earth that don’t have consciousness. Therefore life on earth and our purpose are probably meaningless but nevertheless, I would still really like to get a good grade in this physics class. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2813,"Why am I here, I am here to pass this class to be able to get into my physiology class, and get my degree in physiology and began my journey in nursing. I am here because I have to be here, I have to take physics, physics is part of my prereqs to get into my other class. Sometimes I wonder will I even use physics in the career I’m going into? Is physics really needed for physiology or is it just make students spend more time on certain topics and students money to kind of hold up their life and discourage students towards certain careers because of the classes they make you take when reality most jobs have involved and use technology and depend on technology more than anything? So my question now is why is physics really needed if some of our career may not even use physics? "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,706,"I am a biology major with a concentration in microbiology. I hope to get a PhD after I get my bachelors degree from San Francisco State University. My dream career is to work for a biotech company or work in a lab and conduct research. This makes graduating and getting my bachelors degree my top priority. My goals motivate me to try to complete all my graduation requirements, so that I can graduate on time and move on to the next part of my academic goals. I am here because my major requires me to take PHYS 111, which means I am also required to take the lab class, PHYS 112 that comes with the PHYS 111 lecture class. By taking PHYS 111/112, I will be able to take the next required physics classes for my major, which is PHYS 121/122 because PHYS 111/112 is a pre-requisite for PHYS 121/122. Lastly, I am also here to learn physics and hopefully pass the class with an ""A"" grade too."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2814,"I am here at San Francisco State University to achieve my dreams of graduating with a bachelor in sciences. I am a biochemistry major with a dream of becoming a doctor. Overtime, I have gained confidence in myself as to why I belong in the science community but also why I belong in many situations in my life. I don't ever want to doubt myself especially when I know I have the power to be strong. It's easy to feel a sense of not belonging in a situation or unworthy but I believe that with a confident mindset you're able to reflect on your strengths. I also believe that my purpose here is to spread positive energy and to try to inspire others in any way. I enjoy being able to socialize with my friends and being the best version of myself. Being a college student with a lot of workload, it's important to find that balance between studying and having time to relax and have fun. I think part of that balance is to reassure myself as to why I'm here, not just within my major but in life in general. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2815,"""why am I here?""The reason I have joined this lab section is because it is a requirement for my degree along with a requirement for the physics 111 lecture portion. I'm really hoping to pass this lab section along with the lecture portion so that I can get my credits and enroll in classes that are more related to my major. I'm not saying that physics won't contribute to my career because I'm sure it will, I'm just excited to begin classes that will simulate what I want to do for the rest of my life. This semester will definitely be a challenging one since I'm currently enrolled in four classes, two of them being physics and calculus. But if it's what I have to do to get my degree, so be it. I'm a bit more relaxed after you reassured us that if we pay attention and turn in our work we will most likely receive a good grade. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2816,"Why am I here? I am here to make a difference. As bold and broad as that statement is I know that is the reason for my purpose. I feel that becoming a doctor is my way to be a difference in so many peoples lives. I am only here now, living, breathing, writing because a doctor made a difference in my life and in the process brought me back to it. I am here to learn and to grow so I can become an amazing doctor to the best of my ability. In the process I have to take certain courses so I can make a difference. Additionally, I want to make a difference in my family, my future family, and my loved ones. Being a father is the most important career I will have, in learning this I can hopefully help my child understand the world I bring them into. Also in becoming a doctor I can finically support my own lifestyle ,but also set my child and partner up so they can live in a world without financial burden. Like my parents did for me, I want to pass it forward to the next generation. I also know that I will be in a position where I can represent so many different people as a Black Bisexual man in leadership and position of power. It's good to see people that look like you or identify as you in these positions. So to refute my initial statement, I am here to make a difference. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2817,"Why am I here? I am taking this physics class because it is a requirement that I need to fulfill in order to major in Biology. Although I am just taking this class a requirement, I am excited to learn new things. I used to be undecided on my major but had taken a few chemistry and biology classes that made me interested in biology. I originally applied to SFSU as a sociology major but as I took a few classes I realized that it was not what I wanted to major in. I am here to fulfill a dream and one day live more economically comfortably. I am not too sure yet in what direction I would like to take with a biology major. I always wanted to go into the dental field, and I have felt like it’s getting too late to take that path but maybe I still will.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,1745,"One brief and shallow answer regarding why am I here in this Physics class is because this class is a requirement that I need to fulfill to complete and earn my Bachelor’s degree in Biology. To answer the question on a much deeper level, the topics taught in this Physics class can help enhance my understanding of all the scientific phenomenon that occurs in the natural world, physical occurrences that happen in our everyday lives, and real-life applications as well. Physics is all around us, it affects all matter (living and non-living), and it heavily influences how life functions. Another reason why I am here is to gain a better understanding of the topics taught in the Physics lectures and to practice the concepts until I gain more confidence in solving problems. An additional reason that comes to mind why I am here is to develop and improve my skills in the scientific method and to develop my own identity as a scientist."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2818,"The question that always tends to circle around my head is: why am I here? What is my life’s purpose or what makes me so important where I am fortunate enough to stay on this planet? While I lay back and allow these questions to circle around my head, the memories of the ones I love flashes through my head. And I start to believe that I am here to love everyone around me, to make it feel less lonely for the ones who are in my daily life. Everyday I make sure everyone is okay and if not then my shoulder is there for them to lean on. I try not to overthink this question too much and make myself feel like I haven’t made much an impact on this world because that leads me to my depression and many suicidal thoughts. Instead I think about little things that may have had an effect on others. For example, who would have adopted my cat if I wasn’t here or who would my aunt turn to babysit her children if I wasn’t here. Small thoughts like these have brought me here and allowed me to live freely without feeling like a burden."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2819,"This question is hard for me to answer. I'm not really sure why I'm here. I'm in this class to learn physics and complete my GE requirements, so I can graduate and get a job, etc. But I'm not even sure what job I want. I'm planning to be a teacher, but is that what I really want? Am I able to be a teacher my whole life without feeling tired and frustrated? How do I build motivation in myself to find some kind of life purpose? Will I ever be happy? At peace with myself? I feel like I'm wasting time while also not wasting time. Is it better to continue on this past for a stable life even though I might hate it, or do nothing and waste away time for an opportunity to find myself? I feel like I am just here for everyone else, not myself. Other people are the ones that find fault with me but are they right in that I should do something?"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2820,"I believe I am here in this class to help me further my academic career and my professional one as well. I want to finish my degree, and this course is part of my pathway that will allow me to take upper division courses in the future. Being a scientist beforehand reminds me that I am in the right place of being here- taking another Stem course.Why am I here on this Earth? I think that I am here on this Earth to explore myself and help others explore themselves one day. I hope to heal people in the future. Although physics may not directly help me heal people, it will allow me to understand the concepts of human and earthly natures that surrounds us everyday. For example, it will help me understand how someone's commute can add to the amount of stress a person can handle. Or, it will help me be more empathetic when I learn about how gravity affects pregnant mothers- with the added weight from her baby. Physics and science are all connected and I believe I belong here to learn and grow my mind."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2821,"I am in this class because I am a Kinesiology major and this is a pre-requisite for some of my Kinesiology classes. In terms of why am I here in life I do not know yet, but I do believe that we all have a purpose. I'm a strong believer in fate and that our actions will determine our fate. We control our destiny, it is not based on others. I think that learning is the best way to grow as an individual. I'm excited to take this class so that I can learn about a subject that I am not too familiar with and participate in some fun and engaging labs. Every day I try and learn something new and take on the challenge of bettering myself every day. At the moment, I practice a little bit of Russian every day and hope to be fluent one day and I also am reading a book about finances and the benefits of an index fund related to the Stock Market. I am here to bring fulfillment to other people's lives as well as my own and am looking forward to making some friends in this class as well as learning more about physics."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,682,"I am here because I want a bright future. At a certain point in our life we have wondered or even questioned what our purpose in life is. In my personal opinion I feel like I am here because I have a purpose to help others. By helping others I mean in the medical field. I am really interested in the human body and just knowing more about the womens and children care. I am here because I have had the support of my family to persue a career in the medical field. My family and I know it is not an easy path but we still believe it will be worth it at the end. I have to admit that there has been so many challeneges these past years in scholl but I constantly remind myself that I am not just doing this for myself but for my family as well. My family has been my motivation especially my mom who has always given me the best advice and always looks out for me. I am here because i want to show my parents all their hard work was worth it and to show my siblings that they can do it better than I did. Last but not least, remind myself that I am worth alot and that nothing is impossible."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2822,"“Why am I here?” I’ll be honest I never really thought that I’ll be here with a goal in mind. I thought my life was always just going to be the same as always. Of just waking up, eating, school, homework, sleep, and repeating. That's what I did for most of my life. Of course, there are times that I had to help out with my family. ( Yeah. I’m the oldest in my family ). I just had done that cycle over and over again. I thought everything would be the same and that there wasn’t really anything to wake up to in the morning. Until now, I kinda have something that I am looking forward to, and that thing is being in a lab again. I love being in biotech and I love being curious ( even though there are times I get in trouble because of it ). Being in biotech was the most fun that I had and I wanted it to be my major in college, but sadly they didn’t have that as an option. So as I was choosing a major I said the word “biochemistry”. I was like, “Hey, I was good at biology and chemistry, why not take that course.” So here I am, taking a course that is a doorway to get into biotech and I get to be a lab again. I am here to graduate and start my career in the science world. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2823,"Reflective Journaling #1I feel like I can not talk about “Why am I here?” without talking about being a first-generation American. I always feel the need to make sure my parents' sacrifice coming here was worth it. This is why I work so hard in school and am very career-oriented. Growing up, I saw how hard they worked to make sure I could achieve anything I wanted. On the other end, I feel obligated to show them what I can do and make them proud. I have seen the difference in mentality between American children and children of immigrants. We have seen what it's like to work hard for what you have and come from nothing. Both my parents came here not knowing English and not having the typical support system, just a dream. In comparison, I have nothing stopping me from achieving what I want. So when I see the reflective statement “why am I here?”, I think that I am here as a product of two immigrant parents to continue their American dream."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2824,"I am here to gain a better understanding of physics. However, in a broader sense, I am taking this class to make progress in my career goal. I am a Biology major with a concentration in microbiology. Physics happens to be one of the classes that I need to take in order to get my degree. I am planning to go into the CLS program after I graduate and become a clinical lab tech. I am hoping to get a career in a clinical lab because I want to help people and I felt that the best way to do that was to go into the medical field. I was originally a Pre-Nursing major, but I realized that I would not be able to handle the emotional stress of becoming a nurse, so I decided to not pursue it anymore. However, I still found medicine and health sciences really interesting, so I switched my major to Biology and decided that I want to work in a lab. I am also hoping that with this career, I am able to find a steady job and provide for my family because they have sacrificed a lot so I can have the opportunity to go to school in America."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2825,"I am here to learn why physics is needed in daily life. In order to understand the universe we need physics.  For example at the tip of ballpoint pen is a ball that rolls as you push down to write on a piece of paper. There is ink inside the pen that comes on top of the ball. Gravity pulls the ink down towards the paper and the ball rolls in the ink as we write, taking a controlled amount from inside the pen to the paper surface as it turns. All thanks to newton and his laws. All these questions we are curious with arise and physics helps us with that. I am here to learn about why certain things happen in certain events using physics."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2826,"I am here to better understand and practice the material in Physics 112 and to meet the requirements needed to graduate with a degree in biology with a concentration in physiology. I am a pretty shy and reserved person so I know that in order to be successful in this course I will need to speak up and communicate when I need help understanding certain concepts in the course. This year in Physics 112, I want to push myself to be a student that is more interactive and contributes positively to the class environment. I know that working with other students and having an open line of communication with the professor will help me truly grasp the concepts of physics and will help me to hold myself accountable in asking for help when I need it. I am also interested in expanding my knowledge in different types of motions like linear motion, circular motion, simple harmonic motion, Newton's laws of motion and how we use these laws to understand motion, and other physical concepts like work, energy, and power. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2827,"Why am I here? At times I don’t know. I’m here because I need to be and because I was taught that this is what I’m supposed to be doing. I’m in this course because it is a prerequisite for my major not because I want to, from what I remember physics is so complicated and I didn’t like it. I just hope that this class would make it better and I can actually learn and enjoy what I am doing. I’m just here because this is where I think I’m supposed to be but I’m not entirely sure. Sometimes I feel like I’m going in the wrong pathway of life with what I’m doing but at this point I’m just letting time to its job and see where it takes me. At this point I’m pretty drained and emotionally exhausted to even change what I want to do, so hopefully everything turns out just fine. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2828,"I'm here to fulfill my physics requisite. I did the lecture and lab over the summer, but I had to redo the lab again this semester hopefully I get it right this time. At first thought the question brought me to a series of other questions such as why am I here, at this school a this earth but since this isn't a philosophical question I decided to just answer straight up. Im going to be honest physics isn't my strong suit so hopefully Im able to understand it better this time. I hope we can vibe together, and you'll answer the questions I have. Im also at sf state to get a degree in zoology, hopefully I can get a degree in herpetology too! but for now zoology and I are best friends, as well as a minor in chemistry to add a cherry to the sundae I find myself in. Anyways that's all I got. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2829,"Being here is cold, I hate how my chest is burning and racing. Dry sweats on my face and my feet are too cold. It hurts but once the numbness sets in, I know it will stop hurting. Someone can expect suffering to come in the future but no one gets used to suffering. Living like I could die any day makes me happy. This involves small things such as keeping my room clean to more long term goals in case I'll be around for longer. I hate giving other people problems and will take extreme measures to avoid this. I certainly wish to avoid doing so if one day I were to get cancer and die in 2 days from it. Unlikely to happen, it is still a beneficial way of viewing this world. Every day became more enjoyable with a new thing to look forward to. I am here because I love my home, country, and myself."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2830,"I feel like the more and more I grow the answer to this question always changes. If you were to ask me this question last year, I feel as if I would define myself solely based on my role as a student where I'm expected and meant to live up to standards that I've set for myself. Currently, I believe that I am here because I am meant to be here. I'm a Physiology major who plans on further taking my educational journey into med school. This is by no means an easy lifestyle, at times I do question what's my purpose and why am I here? However, the more I grow as an educated adult, the more I've come to terms with my societal belonging. I believe that I am here for a reason, whether that's to pursue a job in the medical field or become a scientist. I know that every moment leading to the present defines me as an individual and affirms my beliefs that I should be right where I'm at in my life's journey. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,1753,"I am here to learn, and I am also here to fortify my knowledge as a scientist. I find that the relationship between math and science are interrelated. This class will help me expand my knowledge. I am so excited to be in the position to learn more about a subject that relates to my field, and cannot wait to use the tools that are given in this class. I have not really had a clear understanding of physics in practice, but I really enjoy learning about conceptual physics. This class will help me apply the logic ad rules of physics to relevant subjects that will re-appear in the future. As an aspiring marine biologist, I am very excited to become the most competent, knowledgable version of myself as possible. This is the beginning of that process, as I must have a clear understanding of certain topics. I am here because I belong, and because I have persevered on this path for a long time. I am so excited for the future!"
