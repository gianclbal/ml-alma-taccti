2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,1753,"Throughout my time in college, I have learned that it is very hard to excel when you don't have emotional support systems in place for when times get rough. Luckily, I had my sister to provide moral support for me when I was facing tough assignments, pressure from school and pressure at home. This was the exact person that I needed it from, because it is a privilege to have. My family is composed of people who have gone to college, so they apply the pressure on me to excel in any way possible. It motivates me to work harder when I think of the type of things they were able to achieve, and how happy they are in their living situations. I think it's important to have these types of reflections in the people who surround you, because it gives you something to look forward to. Without them, I think it would be a lot different in terms of imaging myself and motivating myself to pursue greater heights."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2837,"My family has helped me a lot through my process in school, they have supported me with every decision I have made. In the past couple of months, I have made a lot of decisions in the last couple of months/ weeks. I have decided to join a Medical Assistant program which is not as difficult as I thought but it does take up a lot of time and now that school is ending and finals are upon us I do have to take a break and make sure I focus on school. I wouldn't be the person I am today without my parents, they raised me to be smart, responsible, and independent, I have them to thank for a lot in my life. As well as my partner we have been together for almost 7 years now and he's been very supportive and loving, he definitely helps me out when I am stressed and remind me how to ground myself. I love my family and I am very grateful for them. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2835,"Wow, I can't believe this semester has come to an end. I am so excited to be done with classes. This semester has been so stressful. Especially since some classes have returned to being in person, the commute to campus is so long for me. Also, I hate having to pay to park my car every time I go to campus. I know people have suggested specific roads to park on for free parking but it's always been full when I get to campus. I am grateful though that there is no traffic on my way to and from campus. I guess I'm just not used to driving long distances so frequently. I'm looking forward to being done with all my other classes as well. I think most people are ready for summer vacation now. I'm excited for the warm days and hope to go to the beach as much as I can."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2812,"My family has always valued education. Throughout my whole life, there has been a very strong emphasis on learning and the importance of working hard. I don't know if I could ever imagine anything different in my life or upbringing. For college, I think that this helped me because I was used to working hard and putting in the effort to do well in school. I am always striving to do the best I can do and to do well not just for the sake of doing well in school and getting good grades but for the pursuit of knowledge. This of course has come with its own problems and limitations as this can become very stressful when you are always trying to learn as much as you can and do well in school. It is important to find a balance in life between work and your personal life. Truthfully my family never really taught me about that and finding this balance has become my own struggle in college. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2824,"I would like to challenge this prompt and say that the values of my family and community actually have not helped me navigate through college much. I am the first in my family to go to college in the United States, so I have not gotten much help from my own family and had to do everything myself. In addition, there is a lot of pressure from my family, both immediate and distant, to go into the medical field and graduate in four years. I cannot blame them for believing that college is only four years because they have not gone to college in the United States. However, it becomes increasingly difficult whenever an aunt or uncle sees me for the first time in a while and immediately asks how many years I have left in college or why I am not studying to become a nurse. My family is not used to unconventional paths people take through college."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2823,"Reflective #5The values of my family have greatly helped me navigate through college. Although everything I do in college is for my family, my biggest inspiration is my grandparents. My grandfather was a doctor in Iran. He was head of the hospital and had worked his entire life to perfect every specialty. Unfortunately, during the revolution, many hospitals got bombed, including his. Even though he tried to get back to that point once he moved to the United States, due to the language barrier and discrimination toward Iranians, he wasn’t. When he passed when I was younger, it was extremely hard on my grandmother and she tried to find connections to him in any way. When I had decided I wanted to go into the medical field, she felt a connection to him and knew it was going to happen. Since then she has done anything to support me on this path. She constantly reminds me of my grandfather and how he will help me through my journey. Every time things get hard in college, I remember how hard things were for him and I call my grandmother for motivation. It helps push me forward.     "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2819,"I think I was raised to help people so I always try to help my peers when I can. Sometimes, this means forgetting about my own responsibilities. In a way, sometimes I feel like I am able to take these sacrifices, but my peers can't. I think my professors have also taught me a lot about self-advocacy, which I didn't feel like I had much. I always felt like I was a bother. I think because I want to be a teacher, I think about being a teacher a lot. And teachers have to be open and understanding. As a teacher, I would want my students to ask me for help. And they wouldn't bother me at all. If anything, sometimes I'll forget they exist and move on with my day. So since I know that I'm not being a bother to them, it should be okay for me to ask things that I wouldn't have. It's helped me apply for scholarships and jobs, and also to take charge of my own mental health."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2832,"My parents helped me navigate through college by offering me a place at home. I feel extremely relieved to know that I can comfortably settle down in my room after each of my stressful classes. Furthermore, I was able to save a lot of money because I didn't have to rent a home near San Francisco State University or apply for housing on campus. This helped me dismiss my fear of getting a bad roommate. From middle school until high school, I always heard similar stories of how mentally draining and stressful it was to deal with their roommates. Whether it was stealing food, money, or personal belongings to unannouncedly bring people over, or an unreasonably high volume of music or TV shows. Everything was said and phrased in such a terribly negative light that it scared me off. Therefore, I'm grateful to my parents for still loving me and allowing me to stay at home and comfortably focus on my studies. Especially given how stressful college can be, their assistance is invaluable. As well as reducing my level of mental health issues."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2836,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" Family is very important because they are supposed to be the ones you go to and rely on. Conversing with my Mother, by noticing her actions and always giving me the benefit of the doubt and supporting me. Observing my Fathers actions as well because he acts genuine with people. They both taught me to always be a giving person and unselfish, becoming the best person I can be.  It makes me feel good to help others no matter what it is because I knew I made a difference in someone’s life. Also, I have learned that if you want to be heard, you need to be able to listen and show respectAs a result, it’s become a part of who I am. Now, I strongly believe that my purpose in life is to always help others. It has helped me navigate through college building strong relationships with the people I have came across in my journey to becoming a P.T. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2816,"The values of my family have really helped me navigate the pressures and stresses of college. Our two family sayings are ""one person does not stop the show"" and ""does it reflect your best effort?"". The first saying implements that when you are doing the things that your need to do for school, work, or even your passions, do not let the ongoings of others detour you from maintaining your own values. It is always challenging to be surrounded by people that are exhausted or want to give up because you begin to feel the same way. So if you focus on yourself and what you have to do then there is no need to let that get you down. The other question is to ensure that even if you got a bad grade or didn't get the result that you wanted, that at the end you put in your best work and effort and you should be proud of that. Especially when I don't do well on a homework assignment I have to remind myself that I am still learning and that I spent four or five hours working on my calculus assignment when I could have given up. It also reminds me to reflect and adjust. Even though it was my best effort maybe it was the right effort afforded to the wrong problem so instead adjust, pivot, and make the effort mean something in the end."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2815,"Well family has always been my motivation, especially my father. He wasn’t able to graduate from college and has always stressed the importance of having a diploma. I’ve made a promise to my dad to get my degree which is a promise I plan on keeping! So far so good! When times get tough I just think about how important the opportunity I have and how I should make the best out of it. Not everyone gets the chance at receiving a college diploma. I also have younger sisters and I want to set a good example for them so that also is something that motivates me to be on top of my work. Family is very important to me like most people. I push myself to strive for better things and try my best so that I can make my family proud. Although I may be far from them, they are always what motivates me. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2822,"My values are mostly thanks to being the oldest out of seven kids. So being the oldest has helped me guide through college so far. Because being the oldest means that I stay home most of the time and that I don’t get to go out a lot unless my parents take us out. But I do go out only on rare occasions and if I think I can really go. (due to my busy schedule ). Thanks to my family though they keep me up to date on schoolwork. They always told me that I can do things unless I have a stable life. This leads me to believe once I finish college and have a job and home of my own. I can do anything I want. For that, I believe that my hard work/ suffering will pay off with all the free time I have after college. I might be false hope that I might not have a social life still but I believe that I think I can make it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2813,"how have the values of my family helped me navigate through college Is reminding me to Never give up on myself no matter what and just because I fall doesn't mean I can't get back up and try again. My family has always been very supportive when it comes to my education having a really strong supportive team who is always cheering you on no matter what gives you that determination and motivation to remind yourself your ""why"" when you feel like giving up on yourself."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2830,"At a young age, my parents always made me work for what I got. Looking back, I'm glad they instilled this lesson into me, it probably wasn't great at that time, but I believe that the value of neverending hard work has carried on with me throughout my college experience. Whenever I encounter adversity, for example, I'm always going to complete it to my best ability. This value can carry onto my future goals, as well. I want to be an emergency physician and that takes a ton of work. I see every single day as a challenge and if it wasn't for the values that my parents instilled in me, I would have given up a long time ago, especially when classes got challenging. My dad usually tells me, ""I'm not going to get anywhere in life if I don't put in the work if you expect everything to be handed to you then what is there to achieve?"" My dad is pretty wise, but there's so much meaning in those words, which I carry throughout my life. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2827,Growing up my parents have always told us how important having an education is and how we need education to have a successful future. For me education wasn’t a choice and I never thought it could be a choice. I always thought that everyone had to go to college and high school because that’s how my parents taught me. My parents didn’t go to college or even graduated high school so I think that the reason why they wanted me and my brother to have a successful education because they couldn’t. I feel like it’s my responsibility to give that to them because they scarified a lot of things in their lives. Having that mindset has helped me navigate college because I cannot afford to not graduate or do bad. My parents have help me become better and I want to prove that I am. I want to make myself proud and my parents proud by graduating college and having a successful career that my parents couldn’t have. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,2834,"The values of my community were very college-focused. The high school I went to was fairly competitive. So it was not normal if you did not attend college immediately after high school graduation. In terms of my family, I am the oldest daughter, so I had to be the expectation for my college success. It wasn't really ever an option to not go to college or to not do well in it. So, there has always been a lot of pressure for me to succeed. This has been helpful in the sense that it has motivated me to do well in all of my classes. However, it has also been hard becasue it discourages me from asking for help when I need it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,11,706,"The values of my family of origin have greatly helped me navigate through college, in that it kept me motivated to do well in school, as well as develop new relationships and connect with other people, particularly my classmates and professors. The main values in my family are to always work hard, be respectful, be honest, listen attentively to others, get a good education, and family. Throughout my entire life, and until now, my parents have always told me and my younger sister to work hard at whatever we are doing, especially when it comes to our education. They taught us to get good grades and earn a college degree, so that we could get a good career in the future. This is why each semester, I take as many classes as I can because I want to graduate on time. I have also been taught to always respect, listen, and be an honest person. These traits are especially helpful to me because I meet tons of new people in college, so maintaining good relationships and communicating effectively with others is very important for a successful college life. Lastly, family is extremely important to me too. My family always supports me, gives me advice when I have a problem, and listens to me when I need to vent or when I am freaking out about something."
