2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,1465,"In regards to resources being available to me, My main resource that so far has been helping me the best in going directly to my professor in office hours. I've tried going to tutors but in some cases (not this class, but for others) some tutors are a bit clueless as to what my professor is asking which points to me that if they are confused, I the student currently learning would be confused as well. I was made aware of the one unit classes that are made to help those in hard classes but unfortunately I am unable to add since I am on academic probation and am only allowed a certain set of units (all which are booked from other classes I need to graduate). With other tutoring resources I have to say I am unfortunately a person who struggles to ask for help especially if the topic has been explained over many times. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2680,"I have people I can vent to which includes my cousins, parents and friends. I also can go to my cousin and friends from class in case I am struggling with my homework or classwork assignments. I feel like my lab instructors this semester are also resources I have because I get along with them. I really enjoy being able to talk to my classmates about school issues or personal issues. Being on campus made that a lot easier because I was struggling to make friends last semester. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2666,"When I really think about it, I have several resources to support me. The first thing that comes to mind is my parents- who have supported me on my goals and throughout my entire academic career. I also have very supportive friends who share similar goals and are even in the same field. When I'm feeling discouraged, I know I can always talk with my friends who are experiences similar difficulties. I also know there are various resources at school to help me with my academic needs. There is tutoring, office hours, and several quiet places to sit down and get school work done. I'm sure there are even more resources to support me at school that I don't even know about. Overall, I would say I feel very supported by everyone in my life. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2668,Resources that I have available vary depending on what I need and how I will reach out for them. A resource that may not seem like one but it is to me is family and friends I think reaching out to them for guidance or a different perspective is really important. Advising here on campus is another resource that I should start to use as they can help with my classes. Professors are also another resource that can help seeking some sort of guidance from them. Even someone who is older in my specific major is a lot of help as well. Theres clubs that I can attend to help specific majors or people in general. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2671,"i know that the campus provides many resources not only for my study but also for my health. i have not used the health resources since i don't feel comfortable sharing my thoughts and feelings but i do suppose some support will be benificial. for all of my classes so far, the instructors always provide office hour, tutoring sessions and many online resources to help with understanding the course. in my personal life, i have support from friends and family. those are the people i feel comfortable reaching out to when feeling down or when i need advice on different aspects of my life. i also utilize online resources to help curate a plan to solve whatever issue i am facing, whether it is related to school, life, health, or finances. i really appreciate how easy it is for us to find information on the internet now."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2686,"When I think of resources that I have access to I think a lot about what the school offers, especially in the  library and the accessibility to other students who are willing to help those struggling in subjects like physics. I feel like the library is an excellent place to also have quiet study time which I personally value a lot as someone who lives with multiple people. The environment that our school provides us to study effectively and be successful students is so amazing. I personally love going to the library to study and complete my assignments. Not only that but in physics specifically we have to do a community resource link weekly for each topic. I also know that my instructors offer several options for office hours whether it be online or over Zoom. It is super convenient knowing that if I am struggling with a specific topic that I could simply email my instructor or professor and ask for help. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2676,"Trinity Calija 4/19/2022PHYS 112  Reflective Journaling #4 “What resources do I have to support me?” There are many different resources available to help support me. I have my notes, which I take during each class. I also have access to the internet to help me get a better understanding of some subjects that I may not have much knowledge about. I also have access to books/textbooks to help me practice some solutions and also get a better understanding on different topics/subjects in that we are learning in physics. There are also my peers and teacher who I can go to for help if I am struggling with certain things and need their help with explaining how to solve a problem or what I can do to fix it. Also, I also have my classes and labs which further help me with understanding the topic we are learning about and get learning more about the topic in a physical matter (from the labs). "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2685,"I think the resources that I have to support me are my fellow classmates/group mates, the internet whenever I am stuck on something and no one is around, my professor, and my notes from lecture class. Having people to talk to about class work is always the most helpful for me personally because it’s a live interaction where all of our brains are thinking of the same thing. But usually when no one is around and I’m at home doing work, I lean towards the internet to try and help me understand whatever it is I am stuck on. Another resource is my professor because he is basically the person who knows everything about physics. And lastly, notes are a really good resource for me to have because I can always look back into them because they are always with me. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2689,"I think watching youtube videos, asking my groupmates, and asking during office hours are good ways to help me learn better. Youtube videos can explain complicated concepts in an easy way, by asking the groupmates can help each other, asking professor during the office hour can clarify the concepts. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2679,"I feel as though research has guided me through many struggles with my academic life. I can admit that when it comes to most classes I am not the brightest of the bunch so that means that I have to do a little more work in order to catch up with the rest of my class. And with that it does cause some stress and anxiety on me for I know I have to be able to keep up with my class. So being able to have a device which allows me to look up any known questions that I may have provides me with a sense of comfort. Research is what makes me sane. In knowing that what I am doing is correct or I am on the right track. Without it I would be as clueless as a child in a college chemistry class. Research not only allows me to grow educationally but emotionally. It gives me the reason and assurance that I can make it through the daunting college classes and on my way to the career/ life that I aspire to have. Even though it may just be a click of a button, typing on some keyboards, or flipping a page. It’s the reassurance and clarity that supports me to reach my goals. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2670,"I have so many resources to help me. My parents being number one. They have supported me my entire life and always push me to be the best version of myself that I can be. They support me financially in college (paying rent) thus allowing me to focus all my time and energy into school. In addition, the school itself offers resources such as wifi, the library and professors with a lot of knowledge. In terms of emotional support, I tend to like to be alone and i my own thoughts so I do not rely on many for support that way. However, those with whom I do trust my emotional support with are close friends and family. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2681,"The resources that I have to support is my family and friends. Mostly my family especially my mom my brother and my bestfriend. Especially when I am stressed. Other than family and friends I would say my job in a way bc it helps me with financially and being able to pay bills that I need to pay such as rent, groceries and basic essentials. If I need any emotional support, our school has therapist that help. And I think I am a resource when I need my own support to push through when i feel like giving up. If I need any other resources I feel like sfsu has a lot to provide when it comes to supporting their students. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2672,"I have many resources that support me. I have family, tutoring, and teachers office hours. My problem is that sometimes I don't know how to utilize these resources. I am a person that has a hard time accepting help when it comes to my education. I am like this because I have always figured stuff out on my own, and at first it was fun. But as I started to get into higher education, I realized that somethings or some assignments I do need help on and that's okay. That is why I am utilizing the resources that I have, a lot more. I go to teachers office hours, ask my peers, and even utilize the tutoring center for METRO. Using these resources for my education has showed me how vital and important it is to take advantage of the resources that are given to you. Altogether, a great support system is having resources like family or teachers and their office hours, when it comes to your education. So it's important that you take advantage of the resources that you have and use it to help you. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2665,"""What resources do I have to support me?""Faculty and staff on campus seem really supportive. Our lecturer seems to really care about her students and wants to support them in any way she can to understand the material and get through the class. You yourself, the lab instructor, has been very helpful in explaining concepts and making the lab an enjoyable experience. Students have been very nice as well. Camaraderie is important when learning as you help each other understand the material and have people to relate to or lean on when having any trouble.Online resources have also been very helpful in understanding material and finding different ways to understand the topic being taught.I haven't looked into campus support for mental health but I'm sure they're there. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2683,What resources I have to support me is this lab for one because it helps reinforce what I’m learning in the lecture portion of the class. This lab really helps me understand the material physically because I’m a visual learner. Another resource are YouTube videos regarding physics and what we are learning in our lecture portion of the class. I watch a Crash Course on Physics mainly if I need extra help in one area of the lesson that I didn’t fully understand. Plus it really helps on the homework too since sometimes I will get stuck and I’m not in class to work along with the professor to know what formula to use where and stuff along those lines. I do have some friends who know and understand physics really well so sometimes they in a way tutor me so when I ask for help on certain aspects of physics they can help answer my questions. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2684,"I have a lot of resources academically. Just from my computer alone I have basically unlimited resources for me to learn from. There are videos, articles, photos, etc. that I use all the time. For physics, for example, I find myself referring to Khan Academy a lot because they provide good examples and lessons on topics I struggle with. For chemistry I mostly use ""Crash Course"" and ""The Organic Chemistry Tutor"" on Youtube. Both for the same reason I use Kahn Academy for physics. Outside of a computer I have my professors whom I visit during office hours and peers who help me to work through problems and guide me to an answer. Non-academically I have my friends from home, my therapist, books, and my journal (I go back to it in order to work through some stuff). All of which help me with what I struggle with outside of school. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2688,When it comes to resources that support me the first thing that comes to mind is my family. My parents help pay for both my tuition and housing while I’m here in San Francisco. They are supportive of what I am doing and want me to continue my path and try to aid me as much as they can. Here at school we have access to all sorts of resources both for our physical and mental health. The gym that we have has everything that I could want from a good weight room to basketball courts which I spend most of my time at. These things help me with my stress and help me get in the right headspace when I don’t feel like doing anything. I live with my brother here and he is probably the resource I use the most when it comes to questions about the city or school and how he balances all the work he has to do.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2669,My friends are a resource that help support my learning. I am very fortunate to have friends who are also biology majors so when study together we are able to learn from one another. Being able to learn from my peers helps to give a different perspective to the material. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2675,"There's really a lot of resources that I have that can support me. For learning concepts in class, I have the internet, my classmates, and my professors to help me with things that I don't understand. For emotional support, I have my friends, my family, and various other activities and hobbies to help me through difficult times. For financial support, I have my parents. I think support and support systems are important to have because they offer help for when you really need it. For example, If I'm going though a difficult time that is financially and emotionally draining, I could always look for someone to help me out if possible. Also, it's a good idea to make more support systems when possible so that you can have further options in the future. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2687,"What resources do I have to support myself?Resources can be really hard to see sometimes. It's often that we don't see someone or something even as a possible resource. But ones that i use in my everyday life include working with my peers, going to office hours, and reaching out to the teacher. Just yesterday I had to email my chem teacher asking for help and although it can be daunting I always receive a nice and helpful email in reply. Asking for help is never a bad thing. Our campus has many tutors and supports the library. I also reach out to online resources like youtube and online tutors. Personally i always call my mom for the support she gives me great advice even though I don't always take it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2673,"The resources I have to support me are my friends, family, and girlfriend. I know I can always count on any of them when I need more support in my life or encouragement. I also have support with school through adviors and professors, but sometimes it takes them a while to respond back.  And beyond family, friends, and advisors I also have psychological support from therapists and medical personnel. There is also a ton of other resources available through school that have really helped me in my past. A resource that people might not think about is music. Listening to my artist's favorite songs has also given me support. Overall, I have a really good support system from a lot of people in my life and they have all helped and encouraged me to keep going and never stop. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2674,For resources I have to support me I usually think of my parents. Or family in general works too. If I ever need help i can always go to them and ask. I also have lots of friends I can go to when I need help with particular issues. If I have a basic problem I can also just go use the internet for support. I’ve always been more of a do it on my own type of person growing up so I sort of forget I can go and ask for support when I need it. I generally now go to my family and friends first because it is what’s easiest and I find to have the best results. If i ever do need more support outside of those options I can always go to the school or a doctor/some other professional for the issue. Or for school I have asked my academic advisor for support on things such as picking my class schedule or where to go for certain things on campus 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,1403,"I find myself using more tangable resources rather than others like services or friends and family. If I need help on something I usually use the internet rather than asking a friend or family member. Thats not to say that I never ask them for stuff its just the kind of questions I have don't exactly corilate to their expertise. Thats usually why I use the internet. However I am aware that I have many resources from the school that I can utilize, such as the library and tutors for outside help with classes in addition to office hours. More ""broad"" recourses ones not specific to a single class or even subject are things like academic advisors, the gym, im not very knowledgeable on this but I think there are some healthcare (physical and psychological) recourses. Overall I don't find that I am missing or in need of any recourses at the moment and feel quite contempt with my current situation overall."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2682,"On campus, we have resources and amenities for students to access throughout the year. For me, places the Student Health Center and the Wellness Center are the most important resource for physical health. Services like the DPRC and Psychological Counseling are most important overall for mental and emotional help. I don't use any of these resources often, but before the end of the semester I hope to get in contact with the DPRC again and Psychological Counseling as well as using the Wellness Center and Tutoring Center.I also have my friends as support systems, but I really avoid going to other people for my issues. For the most part I try to get by on my own, but I could definitely benefit from school resources. For our courses, I wish we have a resource that could set us up in study groups to hold each other accountable for completing assignments"
