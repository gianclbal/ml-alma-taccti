Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2665,"I'm actually taking this class because it's a prerequisite for Tufts University, a dental school that I interviewed at. I was informed that they didn't take any college credits at all and since I took this at Skyline College during a summer, here I am now. It's funny because before I heard the news, I was talking to a friend about how I missed taking classes after a year of my last one. I was shocked and a little annoyed that I missed that fine detail about the school but also excited that I get to relearn physics and be in a learning environment again."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,1403,"I read ""Why am I here?"" and the first thing that comes into my mind is why am I here, in this class. My easy and simple response to that is I am here because I need the class to graduate. To think about it with a little more depth I am here because I want to get a degree that will provide me with income, satisfaction, stability, happiness and I'm sure the list could go on and on. To reflect on why am I here in a more philosophical sense... that is a little more ambiguous. I don't know if I know if there is a reason on why I am here or if there is a reason at all. What I do know is that I am here and that I want to make the best of it for myself and others and if I can make a difference in anything that would be something special."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2666,"I am here at San Francisco State to earn my bachelors in biology! This class is a requirement for my degree. After I earn my degree, I plan to apply to Physician Assistant programs. I have always wanted to pursue a career in medicine so I am so excited to be taking these steps towards my goals. To be honest, if this class was not a requirement I probably would not be taking it because I heard it is difficult and I feel like my brain almost does not work in this way (haha). But with that said, I am still looking forward to this semester and hope it is a successful one for me!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2667,"I am here because this section of physics is a requirement to get my degree and is also one of the only sections of physics that I do have to take. I personally do not really enjoy learning about physics because it seems really complicated to me and requires alot of formulas and numbers to find the solutions/answers. Though I do not enjoy physics, I am open to learning about it since some of the things that are taught can be useful when it comes to building something. But, overall I'm excited to see if my opinion about physics can be changed this semester through both the lecture and lab."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2668,"Im currently in this class in order to graduate from San Francisco State and eventually get a job in a field where I can be outside and feel like i'm not working at all. I don't only think that, I want to experience what college is like and everything it has to bring and explore the city of San Francisco more. I am here on my own accord and actions that I chose. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2669,I am here hopefully to make a difference. For as long as I could remember I've wanted to make a difference in the world. I have always been very passionate about the environment and have felt a deep love towards plants. While working towards my degree in botany I have discovered that I want to work towards conservation and evolution. I want to help preserve the wildlife that we already have on the planet and understand how changing environmental factors will effect these organisms. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2670,I'm not sure how exactly I got here. I don't really remember when I wanted to become a doctor but here I am. I've always liked wondering how things in the world work and a lot of the time that means watching something happen over and over until I can grasp an idea of what's happening. Physics has always been a class that daunted me and I didn't really take it in high school/ However I've always had an interest in it and I want to learn about the world around me a little more. I think that I'm at SF state to teach me lessons of living life before I go out to the big world. Being close to my parents has allowed me to gain a taste of independence while being close to home in case anything happens. I'm also very grateful for them because I know that they have given a lot up for me and there's really nothing that I'd want to do than to show them that their work hasn't gone to waste. That's why I want to do the best that I can do and maximize the most I can in order to use my worth to the maximum potential.  
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2671,"I am in this class to gain basic knowledge in physics and to get the according units/credits towards my degree. I am here to fulfill the requirements i need to get my bachelors of arts in general biology while also applying to nursing school because that's my ultimate goal. these are my educational and career reasons for being here. other than those reasons, I am also here to talk to other potential biology major students and to hear more about their career path. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2672,"I am here for two reasons. The first is because its a needed class for my major. Being that I am a Kinesiology major, I was trying to take this class last semester but I was waitlisted for the lecture and couldn't find a lecture class that didn't overlap with my other classes. So, I ended up dropping physics and just waited to take it this semester. The second reason why I am here, is to get even more familiar with Newton's three laws of motion and hopefully see the connections between these laws and my chosen career path of physical therapy. I really want to work with pro athletes and I feel as though if I understand these laws of motion, how athletes move, and the relationship between the two. I will have beneficial knowledge and be very good at my future job."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2673,"""Why am I here""I am here, a student at SFSU because I want to learn and grow. I am here in San Francisco because I feel a connection to the city and to the people. I am here to have fun, connect, ask questions, and do so much more. I am here to support my partner with the exciting things she wants to do in life. We are here because we love each other and love the city probably more. We are here because we have similar aspirations in life and know San Francisco and the Bay Area can provide the things we seek. I am here to love, become more knowledgeable, and become the person I want to be. I am in physics lab 112 to learn about physics! And so I can further my education and eventually become the scientist I want to be. I am here to do a lot of things, and I am so excited for everything and everyone that life throughs at me. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2674,"I am here at San Francisco State because I was informed that it was a good college for my major, which is biochemistry. I also really like the city of San Francisco. I prefer colder weather over hot weather most of the year, except for summer time. Specifically I am here in this class because it is on of my G requirements I think. I just know that it is also a pathway requirement as well for my major. I believe it showed up on the planner in my student center that I should enroll in this class for this semester. I am not all too sure how it works out. I just figured since I haven't done a physics class this year, and my academic advisor said I could either do this class or I believe the 120 something one too. I am glad this class has an in person lab however, because it is my only in person class this semester. Assuming we go back to in person by February, which hopefully we do. I guess since I also enjoy doing science labs, that can be another reason why I am here. Although I am pretty sure every Science class I have now has a joint lab and/or seminar section with the lecture. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2675,"I'm here because I'm intending to go into the world of science. I enjoy learning more about science in general, and physics is a prerequisite to some of the classes that I think are pretty interesting sounding. Physics is something that will be useful in general, even if I decide to go into another field of study that isn't cell biology. I feel like understanding the forces and motion of things around me could help with DIY home projects when I'm like 30 and stuff. Other than that, I'm here because I have made choices in the past to be where I am now. I'm doing well in school and following what I choose to follow. I'm here because I wanted to go to SFSU to study things, meet new people, and open up future opportunities."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2676,"Trinity CalijaPHYS 1122/1/2022  Reflective Journaling #1  I am here to learn more, get further into my education and get more into the field of science. My major is Environmental Science and taking this class will help me see the Earth in a different light which I know will help me further on in the future. I want to get better understandings of the world and how everything works. Although I haven’t had many classes in this subject, physics has been one of my favorite topics to learn about when I was in high school and I enjoyed it a lot back then. I remember learning about motion, light and color, force and a lot of other different subjects which were fun to learn about and try in labs. I am here because I am excited to learn more and get a better understanding of physics and the topics I haven’t got to go over when I took my first physics class. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,1465,"I am here because I believe I was meant to become a veterinarian and on that path, I need to first graduate with my B.S. I've always had a passion for working with animals but at times I do feel some doubts about my ability to pursue that passion due to how hard the classes have been for my major. That thought process started making me have more doubts about my dream because if I couldn’t pass these undergraduate classes, how would I pass veterinary medicine courses? I first started college as a pre-nursing major due to my mother telling me to try it because of the money being good as a nurse. As I started taking some classes I still did not think that nursing would be for me so I switched to zoology which has still been a struggle but all I think about is my end goal. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2677,"I am here to understand and pass physics so I can be able to finish my degree. I want to at least have basic knowledge of physics and how the world revolves around it. Like heat, or how cold affects their own surroundings or other things that are not affected at all. I hope to fully grasp and understand the concepts of this class and hopefully, it will not be difficult as it does need any hard math."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2678,"I'm here to complete the required coursework that contributes to my major which is Biology (Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation). I also think physics is an interesting subject, though I'm a little worried about my lecture class, just gonna try my best and do what I can. I'm at SFSU because they're one of the only schools that offer this type of focused degree and I love the city, school, and weather. I chose this major because if I was going to have one particular subject consume my life it would be this. I also love the arts though so maybe after I get my degree and a steady job I'll start studying that."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2679,"To be quite honest the reason why I am here is to fill my major requirements. When I realized that I had to take this course I was both excited and nervous. I have taken a high school physics class before and fortunately for me, my teacher was amazing. Which gave me high hopes for this class. But then as I started to talk to my other friends about taking this course their comments of college science courses are a nightmare. Which then gave me this emotion-based fear that perhaps this class won't live up to my own experience. And to add the news that things were to now be set online just made me assume the worse and believe that perhaps this semester wasn't going to be the best. Which I disliked having that mentality. I moved so far away from home to finally experience things for myself and make my own decisions. My parents always sheltered me in hopes to protect me but there is a distinctive line between protecting and controlling. When I chose to leave home it was the best decision that I could make for now as I am here I am living the life I had been hoping for. For being able to go out, make my own friends, make my own schedules, even finally be able to apply for a job. I had this new sense of independence that gave me this feeling of euphoria. But then I did have to bring myself back down to make sure I also focused on my school work. Yet I have always enjoyed school, especially last semester when I got to meet a bunch of new people. So in a sense, I am here to become more of myself and see what I am capable of. Yeah, I have to be here for my class requirements but it ends up being more than that. For here I get to be my own person. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2680,"I am here because I want to learn as much as I can about physics. This is my first physics class ever and I don't think I am required to take another so I want to absorb as much information as I can. I know this is a stepping stone for my degree so I am looking forward to learning as much as I can. I have always felt drawn to this class because it seemed so interesting, but I was never required to take it until now. I feel like this class is going to open my eyes intellectually because it requires me to think outside the box. I like figuring out how stuff works and what it would require. I also think I am here because I am finally ready to take a class such as physics, although it seems very different from my other science courses. This class seems more applicable to the real world so I can’t wait to start applying it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2681,"Hello, my name is Ruby, I am a second-year at San Francisco and I am majoring in biology with a concentration in Marine Biology. The reason why I am taking this specific course is that I need it to fulfill my biology degree requirements. What I want to do with my degree is to become a shark biologist and also do research in the deeper parts of the sea that we don’t know about quite yet. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2682,"Just yesterday, I was reminded of the answer I have for this question! Besides the coincidence of having consciousness at this time in existence, I think my purpose for our society is to help people. In the last 5 years, I've been in 2 significant situations where I've potentially saved someone's life and countless times of helping family, friends, and strangers in small good deeds, like finding lost items. I've loved science my whole life, so I decided I want to go into the field of biotech research for space advancement. I think that would be the ultimate way to help people for the rest of human history. So now I'm working on my degree and writing I'm the first lab assignment for the first physics class in my college career. In my own personal life, I hope to exist just to do what I want, making art and enjoying time with friends! I try my best to balance both, but I usually only have time for makeup looks and assignments for my art classes."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2683,"I’m here because I'm a biology major and one of the requirements for biology is to take physics. Last semester I took pre-calculus, the requirement for this class, and I assumed I would take calculus the next semester (this semester). However after doing a tiny amount of research i found that I already took elementary statistics which fulfilled that requirement meaning I didn't have to take calculus. I then kind of freaked out since I thought I took pre-calc as a mistake and I wouldn't need it until i found out that class was a prerequisite for physics which I knew I needed to take. I actually avoided taking both statistics and physics in high school and instead took intro to college math and anatomy. It makes me laugh that i have now taken both stats and physics in college, who would have thought? Not me! "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2684,"Why am I here? I could give you the answer that everybody wants to hear. I am here, in my childhood bedroom, attending college online to strengthen my mind. So that I can get a job and be an active member of society. A society where people grow and learn constantly in order to better themselves. And also to have a job where they make money and with that money they survive the best that they can sometimes by whatever means necessary. Or I could say the option that I constantly think of that nobody wants to hear. Where I am nothing but a bunch of particles and atoms with this complex that I am smarter than other animals around me. Where in the reality of it all I am not that large in comparison to the universe. Because in comparison to the universe I am just an ant on this huge rock that is floating through space. Or did you want to hear about why I am in this class? Because that is simply because it is required for my degree but I am excited to learn about physics because I've never taken this class. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2685,"I believe that I am here in this class because of the future that I want to have. My goal in life right now is to get a degree in four years and taking this course along with the lecture will help get me that. I believe that taking a math class that isn't calculus is a stepping stool for me and my academic career. I have never taken physics before and although I am a bit scared, I believe that taking this class will take my academic career further in life. "
