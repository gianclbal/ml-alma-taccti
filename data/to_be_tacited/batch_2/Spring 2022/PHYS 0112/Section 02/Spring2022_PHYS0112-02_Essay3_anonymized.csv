2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2673,"When life gets challenging I usually break down and cry. After a long sob I try to gather myself and calm down and talk to myself that I will get through it. This class has been very challenging to me and has caused me a lot of stress. I do not even know if I will pass the lecture section of this class and the thought of that makes me want to cry. I am very sensitive so when I get overwhelmed by school or life crying is my outlet. Sometimes I will talk to a friend or my girlfriend about what I am going through but I hate to burden them with things when I know they also have a lot going on as well. I also try to destress by watching my favorite tv show or movie, drinking tea/coffee, and cuddling with my girlfriend. I am slowly feeling overwhelmed so I will have to do one of these outlets soon to release the tension from school and life. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2685,I feel like I start to get stressed when my life is becoming challenging and then I take a minute to reflect and calm myself down. I also would say that I would watch or listen to something that makes me happy like watching a show or listening to my favorite music. This sort of resets my brain and kind of forgets about all the stress and negative thoughts. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2681,"When life gets challenging I either push through or take a break. I usually nap or binge-watch shows. It usually gets challenging when school is almost over because I would rather have school finish than put in my full effort as I would at the beginning of the semester, especially since I am for SoCal so I would be going home to my family and friends. I take it one step at a time since not taking it slow can result in burning out, which I rather push through since it is almost summertime and having a huge break from school and finally being able to relax. Also doing some self-care when life gets challenging is a good way to relieve stress. Such as getting a facial or your nails done or going shopping or sometimes baking. I usually tend to nap or push through while listening to music."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2666,"When life gets challenging, I seek support from my family and friends. This helps me to get different perspectives on how to cope or how to look at the situation in a more positive light. I remind myself that challenges are a part of life and they are always a learning experience. I usually always take away a bit of knowledge or perspective that I didn't have before. Sometimes, I also seek relief from being in nature or writing my thoughts down on paper. Usually, I call my mom to see what she thinks. I am very lucky to have a strong support system in place in my life. I try to offer the same support to those I care most about as well."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2672,"When life gets tough or challenging I feel like I adjust to the circumstances that I have been given. Sometimes I even like to hide from the world and just take time for myself. I reach to for help from certain members in my family. Especially to those that can relate to the situation that I am in. More specifically I reach out to my parents cause life has hit them hard a few times and they have handle it pretty well. My grandparents are good people to reach out to when life gets hard as well because they always say what needs to be said and just know what to say. Altogether, when life gets challenging I regroup with the help of those within my family and take time to myself so that I won't break down. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2669,"When life gets challenging I try to take a step back and focus on the things that I am thankful for. I keep a gratitude journal that I write in and reflect on when I start stress spiraling. This usually comes after a lot of crying and talking things out with my sister, however. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2668,When life gets challenging what I usually do is sit and think of whats wrong. I try to think about how I can fix the problems or try to distract myself. If the problems are out of my control then I will simply let them fix themselves and try not to worry about them. Although I say this I usually end up worrying about the issues and not getting sleep over them. Not worrying as much is something that I need to work on a lot. I used to worry about a lot in high school and it definitely did not help the problem at all but if anything made it feel worse than what it actually was. I think through that I began to learn to get distracted with friends which was not a healthy way to deal with the issue nor did it help the issue. Now i mostly try to deal with the issue head on when it comes to me. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2687,"I'm not gonna lie when life gets challenging it can be a struggle for me to feel accomplished or proud of myself. I get worried about what my peers, parents, siblings, and friends will think of me. During some parts of the semester, this is more noticeable to me times like after a break, during midterms, and finals. When this happens I try to force myself and not what others need of me. In a way it's kinda a form of being selfish, meaning that I'm choosing this time to study and do my work instead of doing something for you. resources that I reach out to include my classmates and roommates who study with me. And after I study I always feel rewaarded"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2689,"I think the challenging point is to understand the physics concepts, sometimes it may not appear in real life. If it provides real-life examples I can understand them better. Another thing is to try to read and understand the questions in the exam, it gets tricky sometimes, and the exam weights the highest percentage for grading. I usually redo the sample questions and recheck the lecture notes before the exam, it makes me feel easier and remember what is going on now. I usually sleep more and go hiking when I feel stressed, sometimes eating my favorite food and traveling. Talking to my friends is the best way when face challenges, they can help you from different perspectives. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2688,"When times are hard, oftentimes I try to just not think of whatever it is and put my mind on to something else like cleaning, playing basketball, or video games. I try to make a better day out of the one I was given, but this only helps me avoid the problem so I never face it. I like to think about things as little as possible so it doesn’t add to the anxiety and this can help me get done whatever it is."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2679,"To be quite honest it all depends on the issue that I am trying to overcome. When it comes to school, I do two main things. One being I have to remind myself what is important and as to why I am taking the steps I am such as taking chem and physics at the same time, giving myself the confidence and the reassurance that school isn’t forever. The next is by time managing, I tend to stress myself more than I do but when I lost everything that I need to do it gives me the peace of mind of knowing I can’t forget anything. When it comes to life issues it is similiar in the sense that I deal with it differently. Having the family problems I have now I have learned to not take it as personal. I know my family loves me but are having a hard time coping with my new life changes, so I’m being understanding. Even if I hurts me to know that we’re not as close. With my relationship problems I have to remind myself that I am not dependent on that person. I should be happy when I love my life and not constantly stressing about what they want and need even when they are actively ignoring me. So I’ve learned to become more independent by doing things we once together alone now. My life is a constant battle, but I know it’s not permanent. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2682,"The challenges I'm having right now have me kind of stumped. I've been feeling like I don't want to have friends anymore but I'm not sure if it's because I need time away from my current friends or if I need new friends entirely. I stopped hanging out with my main friend groups almost completely and I actually feel really good about it. I'm enjoying having my time to myself and I feel like I won't want to change where I am. I like being alone again and some of my friends don't deserve my company, so I feel free! I've shut my friends out before; that lasted a month, I didn't talk to or see anyone besides sending tiktoks to one friend. Similarly, when I'm challenged with stress from school, my anxiety gets over-loaded, and I end up forgetting to do assignments or panicking to turn in incomplete assignments. When life gets challenging, I pretty much shut down. I know it's an unhealthy coping mechanism, but I don't know how to react in another way."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,1403,"This is something that everyone deals with in varying degrees and something that I have been working on in myself. I find that when things get challenging I put in the minimal amount of effort to just get by. That means the amout of work I do, the quality of my work etc. When life gets challenging and it isn't because of a ""tangable"" task and more of a ""life"" problem such as family/friend problems, lack of motivation, etc. I find that I tend to do fine getting by but after prolonged ""exposure"" I find that I retract into my own little world for a little while where I try to relax and ""recharge."""
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2674,"When life gets challenging I for the most part do my best to not get overwhelmed and stressed out. I remind myself to take breaks and will go on short walks in between homework and studying periods. I also try to ask for help so I am not stuck struggling for hours. In general if life gets challenging outside of school, I just tend to take a lot more personal “me” time to reflect and refresh. Before I would try to talk to someone, but that never really seemed to help so I just try to take my own time and see how things go. I thankfully haven’t run into any challenging life struggles lately, or in awhile. I think that keeping myself busy between school and work, I probably just haven’t really sat down to think about it much. However things have not seemed challenging lately. School, more so math, has been difficult but I expected that to happen as the semester is coming to an end "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2680,When things get hard I usually like to step away and do something completely different for a little bit. I feel this helps me because sometimes its hard to see the issue when you've been frustrated with it for so long. Another resource I use is calling my cousin and asking for help because its easier to tackle difficult tasks with someone else rather than just by yourself. Calling my cousin is also a distraction because we always turn serious topics into jokes and it makes it easier to handle whatever I'm dealing with. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,1465,"When life gets challenging, I have two types of emotions, one would be to just be lazy or not try as hard anymore because in honestly I’m tired of school at the moment when I should’ve graduated a year ago if I had not switched majors. My second emotional feeling would be to be upset with myself in not trying hard enough because I know everyone has the potential to get good grades and to graduate on time, it’s just based on how bad you want things to happen for yourself. So many times I’m in a dilemma with myself on what to do when everyone knows the right answer would be to get up, do those late homework’s, upcoming homework’s, labs, etc but with no energy and with low motivation it’s hard for me to do it. But again, in a dilemma I beat myself up for not doing these things and making myself stay longer in college because of it. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2671,the first thing i do is stress and overthink about it because that tends to happen when i realize that things are not going according to plan. i recognize that this is normal for me and for anyone else that may be going through the same thing. i then evaluate what i did wrong or what i didn't get done for me to get to this point. what is the challenging part about my life right now and come up with a different plan.
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2665,"When life gets challenging, I tend to take time for myself to rest and meditate when I can. I try to manage stress by looking at all of my sources of stress and organizing it into more manageable pieces. By having all of your problems laid out and easy to read, it makes it easier to focus on handling them one by one until enough progress is made to lower the stress load. If meditating isn't enough I look to others for help and try to talk to someone for support. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2683,"What I do when life gets challenging is I truthfully will sob about it but then reach out for help from family, friends, and peers. I will sit down with them and talk it out, I’ve found just venting out loud about the problem helps me much more than keeping it to myself and trying to fix it alone. Mainly because when I talk aloud about it I will say something that may help fix the problem that I wasn’t seeing at first because I didn’t put it out there. So many conversations with friends and family have been solved by talking it out loud because the solution was right there. I also take a step back and just reflect on what the challenging thing is and if it can be solved by me because if it’s out of my control then why sit and worry about it I can’t solve it so it’s not something I will focus mainly on. Lastly I treat myself and take time for myself whether that is getting myself a treat at the end of a hard week, allowing myself to take breaks when needed without feeling guilty, enjoying a hobby or pastime, etc. Things like this really help me relax and enjoy life even if what I’m going through it tough and seemingly impossible to get through. My parents are my biggest help when it’s comes to situations like this because they have so many experiences and advice to give to help me out.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2675,"When life gets challenging, I find that listening to music and relaxing for some time helps me deal with how challenging life is. If there isnt thant much I can do about the current situation, all I can do is find ways to cope with the situation. I feel that its always good to take a step back yo calmly think about how things are going. When its a situation that I can do something about, I think that its best to put thought into action when the action isnt destructive. For example, if I have a problem that can be solved but frustrates me, I can step back, cool down, and try the solve the problem at a later time."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2667,"when life gets challenging, I like to figure it out on my known, no matter the situation.  even if the challenge has to do with either family, work, or school, I feel that I come up with the best solutions when it is only me by myself trying to solve any kind of problem. Even though other people like to get different opinions when they have a problem, personally I like to figure out by myself because it gives me a sense of independence and maturity."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2686,When life gets challenging I feel like I have a tendency to reflect deeply before I act. I always try to see the bright side in these kinds of scenarios but it can be challenging. I find that when my life gets challenging or perhaps I am not in the best state of mental health an extremely important thing for me to do is to sit back and take good care of myself. Finding ways to destress or to find a more stable work/life balance is extremely valuable to me and I feel like a lot of the times we do not honor this as a form of decompressing or providing ourselves with the proper self care or love that we need to heal.
