2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,1465,"My family isn’t too strict on having values or rules to go by and for college my dad is the only one who has graduated with a Bachelors. My three older siblings chose the community college path and chose not to continue with school. When it came to my high school graduation, I unfortunately was not given the option to go the community college route and was opted to apply to a four year (now graduating after 6 years). Navigating my path through these years was not easy, even though my dad had gone through school I felt alone in the sense of being a failure since I had to retake classes. But due to my family understanding the hardships of school work and them understanding that online courses were not for me (during COVID protocols) and still pushed me to keep going. I’m glad I have them behind me as I keep trying. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2686,"The values of my family and community have had a great impact on the way I have navigated myself through college. My parents did not go to college until I was a late teen and as I was applying to colleges I really had no one to consult with for advice and it made selecting a major and colleges I wanted to go to extremely challenging. I have faced a number of failures in college and I am the first person to know how this feels and I have no one else to look up to and ask for advice. My family has always encouraged me to do well in school of course and pursue a major that would guarantee me a job as soon as I graduate. I am not sure I will find the best job in the world with just a biology degree but I can tell you I have had some amazing mentors in my own life that I met in adulthood that have helped me immensely. I have found that I do want to have a STEM major because I want to raise my science GPA. I want to be in the medical field, I want to be a doctor because I love medicine so much and nobody else in my family has done anything like that. It is a lot of “firsts” for me but I would never trade it for anything else. I don’t have the most support with family and finances but I am confident I will succeed in my own academic endeavors."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2682,"Both of my parents went to college and graduated around the time I was in middle school or high school. They didn’t pressure me into going but I always felt like I was expected to go. On my dad’s side, of the family he grew up with, he was the first to go to college and on my mom’s side, most of her family has at least a bachelor’s degree. Going to college, wouldn’t be a huge feat in the context of my family, but it will still be a big accomplishment for me to finish. My passion for the science field is largely inspired by my own interest, but my mom who works as an assistance lab technician has also impacted my interest to go into the field of biology. All of my adult family and family friends also went to college, which definitely influenced how normal and accessible I saw getting a college education to be. Being here now, I’m very grateful to be able to attend higher education."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2673,My mom is a really strong and smart worker. I remember being 5 and her working at the kitchen table working on her master's degree. Seeing what she has been through in life and the sacrifices she had to take to support my siblings and I has made me want to do better and work hard in life. I have been feeling down about not graduating in four years but my mom has helped me see that good things take time and that it is okay not to be done and head into the workforce at 22. I would not be where I am today without my mom and the values she established in my life. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2672,"The values of my family has really helped me navigate through college. I say this because when I was younger my parents never played about my education. Education is something that is highly valued in my family, as most of them went to college. My family believes that a great education can take you to great places. In addition, they just always thought it was important to have an education, even if it ends at high school. As I am going through the process of getting my bachelors, I am beginning to realize the importance of education as well. I think that because my parents and grandparents thought so highly of it, it also made me do the same. This value that I now hold has really helped make college a little easier. It also influenced me to do my best. If I get all the hard stuff done now, the future should be easy. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2683,"The values of my community or my family have heavily helped me navigate through college. Both of my parents went to college as well as their siblings and parents so they’ve had so many experiences and knowledge already regarding college and how it all worked. So entering college after high school was scary and new, of course, but knowing I had them alongside me and backing me up was so relieving and helpful. If I had any questions or just overall needed help I knew I could go to them and they’d know exactly what to tell me to help me figure it out on my own yet was still there and had my back. They gave me the chance to be independent but also reassured they were always there for me and that helped me feel less alone. Especially since I was the first to move out to college out of my two siblings and friends  so it was definitely isolating being the only one but comforting knowing I had my parents to help guide me in the right direction. I don’t know what or where I’d be without their help honestly. I have my friends now as well too. They all stayed home and didn’t move out or far away from home but they have all been in college the same time I have so they have helped me feel less alone in my struggles and anxieties as well. They’re wonderful and help me so much and I feel good knowing I’ve helped them too. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2674,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college because it keeps me on track. It helps to remind me about the choices I make before I make them. And to always keep trying, and that I can ask for help if I need too or can’t figure something out on my own. I am more of a hands on type of person and like to explore and figure things out as I go which also match with my family values since we try to make sure there is some fun included in the activities we partake  in. i have found that navigating through my first year of college has not been too difficult. I have made really great friends that have helped me along the way, and I have a lot of people to ask questions when I do not know the answer to something. I don’t have much interaction with a lot of people on campus as friends due to be bing mostly online for classes so that has been one issue with my first year, but I keep trying to make new friends since my family values also include being friendly to others if possible "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2687,"The values of my community have helped e navigate not only through college but also throughout my whole life. I grew up going to catholic school my whole life until college to the values of responsibility and respect have been engraved into my life. I know what the right what of treating your teachers and your peers look like and that is important, especially In college. College isn't like high school meaning you can slack off and ignore your work knowing that the teaher will still help you get a passing grade. although I was never really taught the value of hard work it is something I'm learning and teaching myself. Another value my family taught me was asking for help my mom is always encouraging me to go to office hours and to email my teacher when I'm struggling to ask for help. College is about discipline for me between, school work, extracurricular activities, work, and social life you really see what is benefiting your future and holding you back. I actually love college you get to decide who you want to be friends with, how hard you wanna study, and what you do with your time off, you just have to make it work in your favor. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2689,"I think the support from the family help me navigate through college.Group mates can provide help and professors can give me guidance throughout my career in the future.The values are:working hard, curious, being positive, engaged, logical, patient, and also persistent."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2665,"For my family, they helped me navigate through college by showing me how much they cared about my education and knowing how hard they work to give me this life gives me the drive to always put in my best effort. They've always supported me throughout my life and college is no different. They value hard work and dedication, which shows in their success and I want to continue to uphold those values.For community, or colleages and friends, their persistence and drive to always put their best foot forward will always stick with me. By surrounding yourself with people with good motivation and attitude, it helps me sustain my own motivation and positive attitude. It's a good reminder everyday that you're not the only one struggling. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2668,"My community is full of hiking trails all around the area, i still enjoy walking around those trails as well. I get really excited whenever i see a small animal run by whether it be a slithering snake, a mouse, rabbit, or even a tiny frog. I come from a latino community the person that really pushed towards college and specifically biology was my mom. she had always told me how much she was interested in it when she was growing up, but sadly she was not able to attend school all the much as it was too expensive. Working with my dad sent me through this path as he also wanted to go to college to be an architect. He always enjoyed being outside and taking my family to the beach. He showed me what was out there and to not be afraid of what it was as long as i had “ganas” (the will) i can do my best. When i told him i would be attending college he was thrilled and pushed me forward. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2670,"In my culture and family, education is the number one priority placed on us from when we’re children. For better or for worse, this helps push us to excel in education. Up until college, I pushed against this and instead said that being a well rounded individual was better holistically rather than just focus on studies. To my surprise, my parents allowed me to pursue other hobbies and activities as long as I also focused in school. They wanted top results, but I could only produce average to below average results and that was a blow to all of us. However once I got to college, I finally understood their reasoning for why education should be a top priority. Now that I am paying for education, it seems almost absurd to waste any amount of time or resources. Because of this, I’ve become a much better student with a better drive. Now my parents don’t worry about me as much because I demonstrated to them that while in high school I was not the best academic student, I learned other life long lessons that I don’t need to go through in college, now allowing me to focus on my education. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2680,"My family helped me navigate through college by keeping me grounded, focused and motivated. They also let me know its okay to make mistakes but I should always be learning. It made me realize that every time I feel like I just did the worst thing ever, I am still going to be okay because I can still bounce back from it. I also grew up in a household where our core values stemmed from a place of striving to be better and change for the good. Once I moved out to go to college, I started to feel like my parents always had there best interest in me even though sometimes it didn't feel like it. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2671,"my community in school, like classmates and professors, have created an encouraging environment for me to pursue my studies. both groups are always ready to provide additional assistance on homework and classwork problems. for example, many of my science and math classes have created group chats outside of ilearn to post questions and answers. classmates also post reminders for due dates and upcoming quizzes. my professors help me navigate by keeping track of my progress. for example, my calculus professor sets up meetings for us with a tutor if he notices our grades are slipping. my family helps me navigate through college by helping me discover what career paths there are for my intended major. they talk to those around them to get more information from those who have taken similar classes or are in the workforce after graduating from the same major as me. i think it is important to network and talk to those who are already experienced in the field because their advice will be the most valuable if I am planning on pursuing the same thing."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2666,Values brought to me by the science community here at SF state have helped me navigate through college. It is helpful to know that there are endless resources to assist me if I need it. I enjoy being a part of a community that shares the same passion for science and medicine as I do and it helps motivate me. My family believes in hard work and I know that my parents especially will support me in any way I would need. Studying with other science students helps me to gain new points of view and ways to study. Science really is about collaboration so if people all share the same value and love for it then I believe we will continue to keep learning and find new information. Being a full-time student really is my job right now and I have been putting everything I have into it. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2669,"One of the biggest values my family has taught me that has helped me work though college is the importance of working hard. When my family came to the United States from the Philippines they worked hard to make sure their children had a good life, these ideas were passed down and have always followed my family. They instilled the idea in me that hard work would get me farther than anything else in life. Along with hard work though they also stressed the importance of support and community. Growing up I was always told I would have to work hard for everything I want, but I would never have to do it alone. No matter how hard the work is they stressed the importance of working though things together and supporting each other through difficult times. I am very fortunate to have an amazing support system that has helped me all throughout college. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2684,"My family values are hardworking and driven. Me and my sisters were raised work as hard as we could towards a goal. I feel as if this helps me keep going even when my classes are hard or I am having an episode. It is hard for me to do things but with how I was raised I know I have too. School is very important to my family and so I work hard to get good grades... or at least pass because again, episodes. Anyway, I feel as if my values are a bit different. I do think it's important to be hardworking and driven but also to be able to take care of yourself and be kind to those around you. While here I have learned that it's important to take time for yourself and care about yourself. Also, with this kindness thing it isn't that my family isn't kind just that they're not very emotional which leads to other things. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2675,"I think the values of my family and community have helped me navigate college by moulding me inti the person I am goday. i think that I have pretty good study habits and decent communication skills, so completing coursework is pretty easy and making friends comes naturally. I think the people I associate with during college definitely change how I feel about the classes I take and how motivated I am. The people who push me to do more are pretty helpful because I'm forced to do beneficial things that I would have never done otherwise. I would not have been pushed to talk with others or try my best at school, for example."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2685,"The values of my community and family have helped me navigate through college because whenever I feel sad or homesick, I always talk to my mom to make me feel better because hearing her voice always just makes me happier which leads me to doing my work for school. And for the community here at sf, I would say going to the library with my friends helps me navigate through college because of the vibes that they surround me with. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2676,"Trinity Calija9/10/2022PHYS 112  Reflective Journaling #3  The values of my family have helped me navigate through college in many ways. In my family if things we do aren’t giving us good results, we always try harder the next time so that it comes out better than the first time. I do follow this heavily as I use it to help me work harder whether it be in school, work, or in practice so that I can reach the goals I have set for myself (so that I can be better). Another thing that has helped me navigate through college is that, not everything will be perfect (it can come out better, but it will never be perfect). I use this to help me from stressing myself out and stop myself from trying to perfect every single thing, this has also heled in reducing my stress as well as help me in working at my own pace. Tis values have helped me to not only navigate through college but also to better myself. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2688,"Growing up I went to a k-8 private catholic school along with my 4 brothers. Our mom wanted us to have a good education so even though we couldn’t afford it she did everything she could to send us there. My mom and dad would clean classrooms for the school along with coaching the sports teams and running just about every fundraiser we had. They did all this because of how much the school helped us out with our financial situations. Though I was brought up catholic and many like to see some of the values they promote as wrong, so do I. I’ve always been able to pick and choose for myself what is right and wrong, so when I get told something that I don’t see as right I am able to have my own thoughts on the topic. In this I feel that growing up and seeing things that I don’t agree with have helped me and I’ve been able to make my own choices this year. I am able to decide for myself what is right and wrong, by no means am I saying that I’ve got it figured out, but I think I’ve been heading in the right direction."
