2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2666,My goal is to as well as I can this semester. This class is helping me to achieve my next goal which is to get into a physician assistant program. This class is a requirement for my degree in general biology. I feel as though I am already behind in that I am having a difficult time with the concepts of this course. To achieve both my short term and long term goals I need to invest more time into my understanding of these concepts and possibly find a tutor. I want to do well I just need to put the time and energy into it! 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2677,"I plan to pass this class and work towards completing my degree. This class is helping me achieve these goals by getting a better understanding of physics. In the long run, this class will be able to help me work towards higher-level courses that I would not be able to do without passing this class as a requirement. I want to be able to know and do basic physics so I can understand it."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2669,My goals for the semester are to work towards A's and B's grade wise. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2683,My main and top  goals in this class is to pass it with as much understanding as I can. I’m not great at math and I have a feeling this class is going to take a lot of hard work and time to have a good understanding of the material. I just want to do well and succeed in this class. I also need this class for requirements so this class is helping me achieve my goals of having this class in my back pocket for pre-requisites and eventually graduating. I don’t see myself loving physics but my goal is to have a basic understanding of it so I can move onto the next thing. I don’t want this class to go to waste and not do well in it because that will just push me farther back. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2686,"My goals for this class are to better understand physics as I have never take a physics class in my life before. I am definitely nervous but excited to do so since I understand that as a STEM major and someone that wishes to pursue a career in medicine that a baseline understanding of physics is essential. I wish to achieve an understanding that would make me interested in taking more than just what is required for my major. Other goals in general for this semester are to pass all my classes with only As and Bs, to definitely need to boost my GPA and wish to do that this semester especially since I have made the decision to move here to San Francisco and live on campus to learn in person. I have not learned in person in over 2 years and am making a very conscious effort to be the best student possible since remote learning was just not working for me in addition to the other investments I have made to be here. Hoping for an amazing rest of the semester!!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2676,"Trinity Calija2/15/2022PHYS 112  Reflective Journaling #2             My goals for this class is to get a better understanding of physics as well as getting better in it. My goals are to also pass this class and to learn how it is used in my major. This class is helping me achieve my goals by how I learn something new every day which is helping me understand more then I knew before, increasing my knowledge on physics. This class is also helping me achieve these goals by how I realize how much physics plays into our Earth and it’s influences on it, which is also helping me get a better understanding of my major. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2671,"This is the first physics class I have ever taken. I did not take physics in high school instead I took marine biology and physiology. My goals in this class is to of course, understand the basic mechanics and principles behind physics and use the learned knowledge towards my major of general biology. My goal is to become a registered nurse and I am working on applications for nursing programs in California. Completing my bachelors provides me an alternative route to nursing program. This is how this class will help me achieve this goal"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2684,"One goal I have is to graduate college. School online has been really hard for me and I was barley passing my classes. I hope that with this class I will be able to do better since it is in person. Also, once I graduate I want to go into some sort of genetics/ microbio related research. This class will help me to think outside of the box more. To question things and find the answers and also give me the confidence in my thoughts and findings. I feel like I am not usually very confident in what I am thinking or my answers to anything even if I am right. Also, this class was needed for me to graduate so it will help me to graduate with my major (which is biology). "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2672,"My goals in this class is to take what I learn and apply it to the real world. So far, I have applied my learning to roller coasters, velocity and acceleration of a car, and directions. I really want to know how physics is applied to physical therapy and an athletes movement. The movement that they do that causes injuries. I feel like that has something to do with physics. The ways that this class can help me achieve my goals is by focusing on maybe potential and kinetic energy. Also, newtons three laws of motion. I feel like once that is covered in class, I will have a better understanding and start making connections. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2685,"I believe that my goals for this class is to understand physics better. Since this is my first in person lab taking physics, I am excited to learn all about it and actually see the affects of physics happening with my own eyes. This class will help me achieve my goals because it gives me the tools and environment to do so. I am able to work with other people and have a professor that can answer any questions that I have. I am more of a visual learner, so I think that seeing things being demonstrated during this lab course is going to really help me achieve my goals."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2687,"For this class, my goals are to participate and be collaborative with my classmates. I have a side goal of making one friend in each of my classes just so I will be more willing to show up to class. I want this class to help me with my seminar physics class and to help me understand the topics that we are learning through the semester. I also have a goal this semester of having perfect attendance which can seem like an ambitious goal but I think it would really make me feel proud of myself and accomplished. I also have a goal to eat every day at least some type of snack before this class because it's a long class and I cant concentrate when I'm hungry.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2679,"I wouldn’t necessarily say that I have many goals. Of course I have my life goals of getting my dream job, family, and life in general but when it comes to this class specifically I am taking it with an open mind. If anything I want to be able to surpass my prior knowledge of physics. I took a class in high school which was a lot of fun fortunately but when it came to retaining the information I can admit I don’t remember much. If anything I want to be able to feel confident when walking in the door of either the lecture and the lab of this class. I do get anxious on a daily occurrence so for me to be able to just walk into a room, sit where there is a seat in the front, and just comfortable in the lesson then that is a win for me. It’s not the people or my surroundings is what scares me but rather the fact of knowing that I don’t know what I am doing. Especially when it comes to breaking out in groups the overwhelming feeling of having to collaborate on a problem when I don’t know what is being asked is terrifying to mw. So overall, my goal would be to not worry about if I know what I’m doing or not if it is a new lesson but rather be grateful I can have help and be willing to accept it. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2688,My goals at SFSU are to graduate on time and keep my grades up so I have the option of continuing school. In this physics is a requirement that I have for my major and want to take away everything that I can from the course so I have a good understanding of how things work. In this I want to turn in every assignment on time and it be good work. I do not want to rush myself through assignments at the last minute because I feel better about my work when I give myself time. In this I am trying to stick to a schedule and physics is apart of that.  
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2675,"Right now, my goalmainly is to pass all of my classes with an okay score. For this class, I'm planning to find a use for the concepts that I've learned and apply it to research or in the medical field, wherever I decide to go. Physics still feels kind of foreign to me, so I just want to see where it takes me. This class helps me achieve my goals because it is still a prerequisite for my major. This class is required for me to get a degree in cell and molecular biology, but I'm not completely sure why it's needed. What applications does the things I learn in physics have in the real world?"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2689,"I think in this class we work as a group meant to help each other. I also find that working as a group can easily figure the problem out and have a better way to solve the problem, My goal for this class is to solve problems we do not have time to do in the lecture, and I can have more time to get practiced on that. My goal for this class is to have a better understanding of the concepts we learned in the lecture and get more practice on them, Lecture problems can be easy, but the practiced problems can have more details on how to approach the problems and concepts. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2673,"For my long term goals I want to graduate from SFSU with a 3.5gpa and be accepted into the CLS internship after graduation. In order to do that I must do well in all of my classes including physics! I am not sure if I will use physics in my future career or life but that doesn’t mean the class isn’t important. My goal overall is to do well in school and at my job. I want to be a well-rounded, smart, and successful individual and by doing well in my classes and work and in my personal life I think it is possible for me to achieve that goal. Taking this physics class is one of the many steps towards my goal, and I am very excited to see how in-person classes go. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2670,"My goals for this year is to move to a better place academically. While I like it here at SF state, I feel that I am not provided enough resources here to excel. Another thing is that I don’t really like SF so it sometimes affects how my mood is while can cause many distractions. By the end, I hope to be some place where I’ll be able to grow my knowledge and know that I’ve learnt all I can. However that’s not to say that I do not like this class. I really enjoy this class and I think you are one of the few teachers here who truly wants to make sure the students understand and learn the topics at hand. I think this class is also helping me find my love for physics. I really enjoy STEM related classes and since I have never taken physics before I don’t really know if I’ll like it or not.  "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2668,This class is helping me reach my goal of getting a degree at the moment im sure that this degree will help me find an even greater goal and help me kick start that goal. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2667,"my goal is to find an interest in physics and get a better understanding of how it fits into a persons everyday life. Though in physics many things such as formulas and theories are used, I believe that there are some topics that will be taught and further become useful in everyday problems even if do not notice that we are using things we may have been taught.this class is going to help me achieve that by doing labs and exercises that are simple things we do in our everyday life and will help me realize how useful physics can be."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,1403,"To me this class is helping me achieve my academic goals. It is one of two classes that are on campus, this is my first semester back in person and I'm excited to be coming into class and experiencing all of the things campus and in-person classes have to offer. For this class specifically, the main reason is that because it's a pre-req for physics 2 and a graduation requirement. Besides it being a required class, it will help my in a lot of my other classes. I am taking an animal physiology course this semester and there are already some cross-overs between the two. I am excited to learn more about our world, I find science, in general, to be very interesting so I am eager to learn more about physics."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2665,"My ultimate goal is to have lived a life that I'm proud of and to look back and know that I've learned a lot from it. Right now, I want to help the world through dentistry and part of that journey includes having to prove myself and grow as a student, a learner, and a colleague. It'll help me refine my discipline by studying, working alone or as a group, finding ways to overcome challenging material, and to end up knowing more about the world than when I started the class. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2680,my goals are to get A's in all my classes this semester. I also want to start an internship before this semester ends. Another one of my goals is to make more friends this semester that I can study and go to the gym with. I think this class will help me achieve that as long as it stays on campus throughout the semester. It is really hard to make meaningful connections with students when all your classes are online. I also hope to connect with my teachers more because I am finally taking classes that are for my major. 
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2674,"My goals are to keep moving forward with my major and figure out what I really want to do later on in life after college. This class is helping me achieve my goals because it is a pathway to continuing other classes for my major. As well as opening up other possibilities for future work as I learn more. Science has always been my favorite subject growing up. So this class is helpful because it teaches me new things and helps go in depth, while giving me a better understanding on how and why things work the way that they do. Or more specifically on how to explain why something is a certain way, explained in a more scientific manner. While chemistry is more specific to my major over physics, this class is helpful because of the basic concepts that expand and go in depth continuing down my path to more science classes. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2678,"My short-term goals for the semester are to do well in my classes which for me means understanding and absorbing all the material. This is also my first semester at SFSU and my first semester back at school, so managing my mental health is another goal of mine. Long-term goals include graduating with my Bachelor's in Biology (Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation). I found a scientist who teaches up at Oregon State that studies Traditional Ecological Knowledge and helps with climate change and indigenous communities in the US. I want to work with nature and help with conservation, but also learn from indigenous communities and blend together western science and traditional knowledge."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2681,"My goals for this semester are to pass all of the courses that I am taking, and also learn all of the material because it goes towards my career goal. I also want to enjoy myself as a student and not just focus on schoolwork because I feel burnt out of all I focus on is school and not having a balanced life. I think having a balance between school life and social life is good because you get to enjoy yourself and also focus on your career. This course, in particular, I would say is helping me achieve my goals because it is a course that I need to take to fulfill my physics portion on my DPR. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2682,"My biggest goal right now is completing my required courses as soon as possible and graduating with a degree in cell and molecular biology! My goals are pretty specific: I want to go into biotech/biomedical engineering for space travel advancement. I'm really hoping to do research and design with my background in art, so I'm also minoring in Studio Art. I've never done very well in school even since kindergarten, but since this last winter break, I started making a lot of changes to better myself and my mental health so from here on I expect the changes I'm making within to greatly affect the outcomes of my schoolwork. For this class, I'm looking forward to strengthening my math ability! I have NEVER been good at math; I usually fail my math classes, but I do enjoy it! Even today, I was able to keep up with my group on the multiple step problems and trigonometry. In the context of physics, I think it's easier to understand the steps of math because we have to consider direction and magnitude, which we can see, understand, and apply already in life."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,1465,My goals are to pass this class and hopefully be closer to my path in graduating this or next year. I’m still nervous because I’ve taken this class times before and it’s scary that this is my last chance to pass. My hopes are to pass this class by understanding the material rather than just doing the bare minimum when trying. I am already behind on an assignment so i will unfortunately have to drop work hours to make sure I’m giving more attention to this class. This class since it’s now in person it will help me be a better student since in a sense it’s forcing me to pay attention since it’s no longer recorded. It is exciting to be in person again because I feel more confident in my learning capabilities.
