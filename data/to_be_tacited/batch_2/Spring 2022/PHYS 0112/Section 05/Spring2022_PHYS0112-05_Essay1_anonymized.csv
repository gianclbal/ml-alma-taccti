Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2718,"I think there are many ways to answer this question. Personally, I am here to live life the way I want to live. I believe there is a purpose for everyone in this world. All we have to do is find what our passion is and continue to do what we love.  Currently, I am attending General Physics I Laboratory, which is a requirement for my major. In this class, I am here to learn about physics. Although physics is a difficult subject, I believe I can learn if I keep practicing and try my best to understand the concepts. I plan to try my best in this class. Hopefully, by working with others and with the help of the professor, I can pass this course with more knowledge. I hope to utilize what I learn in this course in real-life situations. I believe learning physics is important because it can be applied to almost everything. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2719,"At this point in my life, the reflective question of ""why am I here"", brings anxiety and fear into my consciousness. I am concerned with the future and what I am meant to be experiencing in life as a result of recent developments in my life, as well as increasing pressures i have felt from different realms of my life. I have always been incredibly self aware, motivated, driven, organized, and ambitious and have always known what it is that i want to do in life and how i would achieve that. However, recently i have faced many different situations and have experienced different things that have changed this perspective and have left me wondering if the path i have chosen is the right path for me. It is a hard path and I am not sure if i will be able to endure it nor if i want to endure it and i am beginning to ponder whether it is worth the hard work i will have to put in. I know that I am here to make other people happy and to make myself happy and to become successful and self sufficient, I have just recently become unsure of how to approach this and how to attain it in my professional life and in my career"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2720,"I am here because I have to be. This already came off to an insensitive start but it is the simple truth. However, I am not here against my will. I do also want to be in this course. I've never had dreams that involved being schooled; my dreams never consisted of getting an education for a position of income. My dreams were just to learn what I could about what I found to be inspiring. My sophomore year of college I took a general physics class to support my major and I fell in love. It was like the magician was our universe and someone was revealing some of its secrets. But it is the way that the tricks are made possible, not the performance itself is what's fascinating. I mean, we sit here and know there's no mystical magic the entire time, we experience the effects so often it's like going down to the Piers to see the seals and street artists every weekend with your family. Anyhow, at the time of taking the general course I had failed to take the complementary lab due to tight availability. So here I am again, but this time I get to apply some distant learned knowledge to real life experiments. Happy to be here."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2721,"Reflective Journaling #1Why am I here? I am here because I am an environmental science major and I need this class to be able to graduate with my major. I am in this class because I needed to be enrolled in a lab section of physics. I have never been in a physics class before so I am in this class to learn about physics. I am here in this specific timed class because it worked best with my school and work schedule. I didn’t do any research about this class, but chose it because my gator scheduler put this class in the options that I had. I am here to learn physics and to pass this class. I need to pass the class in order to graduate on time."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2722,"To answer that, I would say that i'm here to complete this class, honestly. Physics has always been a subject that I really don't enjoy studying at all. I usually get bored taking physics classes back in high school and that was not a good experience at all. I didn't want to be rude insulting physics but just wanna give you a heads up haha. That being, I still know that it's one of the most important foundation of knowledge. So, it's pretty much mandatory for us to know and be able to apply it in real-life. And I obviously can't argue with that at all, it definitely can be applied in real life because it's actually something that we all do automatically. I'm actually looking forward to this class and hope that I'll be able to enjoy physics more. So, if I'm slow with some parts during this class, please give me some time because as you know i use to struggle with this class, but I want you to know that I'll be trying my best!"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,1584,"I'm here because I want to succeed. I'm here because I want to learn more and succeed to be able to support my family and give back to them for all that they have given to me to be honest. I really want to pass this class with a good grade because I want my GPA to go up as well, so I'm not as stressed about classes as I am right now. I am here to make sure I have a good education and learn a lot of new information because this is one of the first physics classes that I have ever taken. I really hope that I can do well in this class and make sure that I can continue on with my degree. I am also here because I want a higher education and I want a degree, so that I can get a good job that I love and be in a career field that I love. I do not want my job to feel like work. I want my job to feel easy and I want to be happy in my job."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2723,"I am here in college because I want to pursue my education and secure a stable future. That way I am able to support myself and my family. I am in this class because I want to further expand my knowledge of physics. Physics is a subject that interests me a lot, and it is conveniently one of the required classes for my major. Physics plays a big part in the mechanics of everyday life, so having this class to learn from will benefit me a lot. After I get my degree, I plan to go into pharmacy school. Physics may not play a huge role in the everyday life of that field, but having the information in my mind is never a bad thing."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2724,"#1: ""Why am I here?""When I was in high school, I had an entire 5-year plan set out for what I’d do during undergrad, what school I’d go to, and what I’d do after undergrad. However, plans changed and here I am. I was usually a straight-A student who found school extremely easy - which allowed me to attend extracurricular activities outside of school. High school was a lot different for me. I entered with a major injury from dance and my entire outlook of being the perfect disciplined student changed. My grades dropped drastically, I couldn’t focus in school, and I essentially wiped my 5-year plan that I was so set on. Fast forward to the present day, I was still accepted into the college I first intended on going to; however, due to financial reasons, I decided to decline. I accepted SFSU - the school I never imagined going to because I wanted to move out of San Francisco - and it was the best decision I’d ever made. Suffice to say, I’ve gotten so many amazing opportunities so far, and I’m doing a lot better than most of the students in my class who attended college for its name rather than its opportunity. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2725,"I’m in this class because I need it as a prerequisite for my major. Even though I am in this class for my major, I think it’ll help me get better at problem solving. Since physics is a bunch of word problems, it will sort of force me to practice reading and picking out variables. I also think this lab will help me understand what’s going on in lecture a bit better. Having the chance to see it done visually won’t make concepts so daunting and intimidating. Sometimes these concepts can be hard to grasp if it is just being explained through formulas. It’s a little easier to see how it’s applied in everyday situations. Hopefully at the end of this semester I will be able to apply these concepts in everyday life, or just be aware of how they apply to my everyday life and career. I don’t think my future career will be very physics heavy, but I never know when I’ll need this class."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2726,"Lesly CornejoProfessor Priyam MavaniPHYS 0112-05February 2, 2022Reflective Journaling #1“Why am I here?” Well to start off I was born and raised in San Francisco. I am a 20 year old and this is my second year attending the University of  San Francisco State. I am a first generation student and my parents and I didn’t know about the college process therefore I took initiative in my junior year of high school to apply to programs that can help me and my family understand the college process. My goals are to embrace change into society by pursuing the major I am interested in. I would love to become a Physician Assistant but having any career in the medical field would be fine as well. I would like to accomplish this because I would like to carry on my family’s legacy and make them proud. My family is descended from the Aztecs in Mexico, who had a tradition of developing medical remedies from local plants. It inspires me that, despite their lack of formal training, education, or resources, my ancestors taught themselves how to provide medical care for their communities. My great grandmother lived on a small farm, where she used local resources to create remedies which helped those in need. My great grandmother then passed down her remedies to my grandmother, who expanded upon them and taught my mother. Since I was little, my mom has taught me the same things, and I developed a passion for the medical field."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2727,"I am here in front of my laptop screen because I chose to return to my dorm in San Francisco. I was faced with the option of either remaining at home, where I did not have access to a space to zoom in, or coming back to campus. I chose to come back to campus based on not having enough space to do my online classes and because I missed my roommates. I am here in this class because I am a general biology major. Despite having to follow a trajectory and take this class on it counting for my BA, I do quite enjoy physics. When I first applied to SFSU, I applied under astrophysics but soon changed to Biology so I could pursue astrobiology in the future. In the broadest sense, why am I here? This is something that I've pondered for some time in a metaphysical interpretation. Why is anyone truly meant to be here; why do we exist? It seems that we don't have a simple well-rounded explanation for it, but it looks like our existence follows the path of some predetermined entropic push forward."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2728,"Why am I here? I don't really know. I don't know why I have the opportunities that I do when other people don't have them. I made it to college, moved to a different state, I'm double majoring, I'm renting a house with friends; I have these advantages and opportunities that give me a chance to be successful. I'm here because I want to be, but I don't know why, in the grand scheme of things, I'm allowed to be here. Luck, chance, maybe, but I kind of hope that I can use my being here as an opportunity to open doors for other people to also be here. My only thought is that I now have to make my being here worth it instead of waste it. A wasted opportunity is silly, and I think if you don't take any of the opportunities that come at you, then you will never get anywhere."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2729,"I think that in general, I am in this Physics class to finish my prerequisite for my major in Biology. Math is not a topic I feel particularly confident in therefore, I hope that this course could aid in my progression of understanding math using applications from the real world. So far, the formulas and concepts seem fairly moderate to follow. I'm continually getting better at being comfortable with the math expressions and problems discussed in class. I think that the instructor being open to questions really helped. From a geographical standpoint, however, I am here to finish my undergraduate degree, but I'm originally from Saipan. Living in the Bay Area is a complete 360 from the tiny island I am from. I enjoy finding something new to see or do. I love exploring and hiking and California seemed to hit that mark in terms of views and amazing scenery. "
