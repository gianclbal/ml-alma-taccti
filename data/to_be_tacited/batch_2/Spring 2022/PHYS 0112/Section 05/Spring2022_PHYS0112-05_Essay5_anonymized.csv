2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2725,"My family really values education. I guess it was this value that made me work hard in college. They’ve also instilled in me to do something in college that would make me happy but also land me a job. I think that’s what made me switch from anthropology into general biology. As much as anthropology was super interesting to learn about (and also something I think everyone should take a class in), there weren't many careers I saw that I enjoyed or had interest in. I’ve always been interested in biology and when I learned that I wasn’t limited to going into the medical field, I switched my major. If it wasn’t for my family also telling me those things before I even went into college, I think I would still be an anthropology major. In my culture, parents don’t really understand changing majors and how that works. It was a bit scary telling them that I wanted to change but they were super understanding. My mom still helps me look at possible careers in bio."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2718,"My family always encouraged me to do well in school. I always believed that everything I do in school counts toward my future. My parents always tried their best to provide tools and an appropriate environment to help my brother and me study better. They always do their best to support my brother and me in school. My father is an aviation supply officer in the United States Navy. Although I plan on working in the medical field, I plan to join the United States military like my father. My mother did not get to finish her bachelor's degree, but my father recently earned a Master of Business Administration degree. My parents want my brother and me to succeed and stay on track to graduate on time. My parents always had high expectations since I am the eldest daughter. They raised me to serve as a role model for my two younger brothers. I am always working hard, striving for my medical career and future."
