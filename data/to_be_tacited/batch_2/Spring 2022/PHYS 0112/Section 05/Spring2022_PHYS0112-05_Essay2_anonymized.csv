2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2728,"I want to learn something, anything, as much as I can. Not knowing is one of the great pains of the world, at least in my mind. It's always been my goal to help the world learn something, make improvements in everyday life, or change the knowledge of the world just the tiniest bit. In a way, that's part of what I'm doing in this class, though it's more of a stepping stone to reaching the information I want to reach. I have a taste of what I want to do, as I am working in a biology lab as a preparer, but I know that I do not know enough at this point to make a dent in the collective knowledge of the world. Though I do not particularly enjoy physics, I understand its foundations in the very fabric of the universe, and because of that, we must build our knowledge from the ground up using the tools we gain over time, just as our society was made, starting from the ground and building with physics, with biology, with philosophy, with all the tools we gained over time."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2718,"I have several short-term and long-term goals. I plan to be prepared for each class, not miss any assignments, and have perfect attendance. So far, I have been ready for my classes, have not missed any work, and have excellent attendance. I have also been on time for all of my classes. I plan to continue these short-term goals throughout the semester. Each day I achieve my short-term goals, I feel responsible. I plan to get at least an A or B in my classes while understanding what I learn from them. So far, I am learning and comprehending the material for my classes. I plan to put all my effort into my work and studying to help me in the long run. I plan to graduate on time with a decent GPA. I am aiming for a 3.5 GPA or higher. I plan on attending pharmacy school after I graduate from college. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2729,"Initially, my goals consisted of improving my knowledge of the math concepts in Physics. As the semester moves forward, my grasp on the subject has been better and I've been able to apply the formulas and concepts with ease. This is with saying I received plenty of assistance from the lecture and my notes. The homework has also given me the opportunity to make changes to how I input my data and get the solution right. The main strategy to how I stayed motivated was to have a space in which I could focus and be persistent to learn and absorb new information; having distractions would surely affect my study habit and contribute to studying more in the long run. I think having a group that supports you and studies with you would definitely play a critical role in passing the class because we are all in the same boat, but with different levels of understanding."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2719,"My goals are to expand my knowledge in the field of science and physics in particular, and grow intellectually through that knowledge. My ultimate goal is to become a surgeon and this course will be instrumental in my success in and progress towards that goal. I think it is important to have a wide range of knowledge in various subjects relating to the field of science in order to become a well rounded individual as well as be able to make connections in those various subjects when applying that knowledge. Although physics does not particularly align with my goals and passion for biology and medicine, I believe that it will provide me with useful skills that will aide in my future endeavors. I enjoy learning how the world around me works and the different mechanisms/processes that allow various events to take place. In that aspect, physics really does align with my goals and values and i am eager to learn more in that aspect."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2720,"My goals in regards to this class is to stay on top of the workload and really understand labs that we do, hence receiving a letter A grade. I think this course allows me to physically visualize core concepts and laws in physics. The environment as well allows for healthy connection to peers and the instructor if help is requested."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2722,"I feel like this week has gotten a bit harder, all the formulas are getting longer and new terms are getting introduced. But for some reason even though theres a lot of new information to process, everything's seems to be connected to each other which makes it somewhat easier to understand and connect the dots. The topics that were discussed in the lecture class were 2d motions, the forces, and the projectile motion. At first i didn't quite understand the acceleration and velocity that much but after doing the stimulation, I feel like my level of understanding increased a whole lot and from getting frustrated solving physics question, it's getting more fun as I practice more and more."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2730,"My goal is to get into a career field that will be enriching for me and that includes things that I am passionate about. Those things are wildlife conservation and scientific research surrounding the natural world. It is also a goal of mine to be as informed about the world around me as possible, this includes the physical mechanics of daily life on earth. This class will help me with both of these goals because not only it is a requirement for the degree that I hope to obtain for my desired career, but it also is giving me valuable knowledge that I am confident will come in handy no matter the career I get. Also, it has changed the way I view the world in my everyday interactions. I have the words and tools to analyze and understand mechanics in a way that I did not before taking this class. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2726,"Cornejo 1Lesly CornejoProfessor Priyam MavaniPHYS 0112-05February 25, 2022Reflective Journaling #2My goals as previously stated are to embrace change into society by pursuing the major I am interested in. I would love to become a Physician Assistant but having any career in the medical field would be fine as well. I would like to accomplish this because I would like to carry on my family’s legacy and make them proud. This class can help me achieve my goals by using what I learn in the near future. Mainly taking this class will help me move on to the next chapter of my life which is fishing up my general classes and moving to taking classes that have to do with my desried major and graduating within the fourth year range.  "
