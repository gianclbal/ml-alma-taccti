2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2721,"I suppose I have a good amount of resources to support me. I have my family, roommates and my boyfriend that are there to support me when I need them to. I also have resources at school that will be able to help me with my goals for school.even if I do not use them, the school resources, I know they are there to help me if I wanted them to. I don't know what the school could do, but I feel like they could do a better job offering resources for help. I know that those resources are there, but I do not feel compelled to use them? If that makes sense. Overall, I know have resources to support me"
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2729,"Because I am a constant ball of stress and anxiety, I usually go to my friends and family that give me much-needed support. The Student Health Services also has a focus on mental health and wellbeing which were great resources that I could reach out to when my mental health is not the best. Creating something outside of academic pressure or work is also a good resource that helps me get out of a funk. In terms of academic needs, I know that there are tutoring sessions all around campus for extended learning opportunities outside of lectures. In addition, reaching out to professors are essential to success in the classroom. I think it's important to create study groups in classes that are personally a struggle, although this might not be for everyone, however, they provide a great support system. Moreover, I think that academic advisors have been a consistent guide for me as I go through my academic career. They've been supportive and continue to help me thrive in my decisions for the rest of my years here. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2718,"My five primary sources are lectures, Quizlet, Google, YouTube, and Grammarly. I take notes from my classes then I take time to review and highlight the most crucial information. I use Quizlet to create digital flashcards to help me memorize information. Quizlet features minigames and tests which help me learn the material. I use Google to look up reliable sources that will help me answer my questions, especially for my biology courses. My biology courses require me to utilize reliable outside sources as evidence for my claims. I use YouTube to search for videos relating to course material. Educational YouTubers provide informational videos that help me solve problems step by step and show other ways to solve problems. The Organic Chemistry Tutor and CrashCourse are my favorite educational YouTubers. Lastly, I use Grammarly to proofread my written assignments. Grammarly checks correctness, clarity, engagement, and delivery. Grammarly helps me fix my mistakes. Overall, I utilize these resources every day to help me with my work. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2725,"Resources I have to support me are my professors. In a class that I'm taking I also have my mentors for support. I know on campus there’s an advising center and I think there’s a “counselor” (I don’t know the exact name of it). I also have my friends and family to help me, especially when things are getting hard. I think the only thing about advising and counseling on campus is that it’s not very helpful. You can go there and ask for help and I think half of the time they’re kind of just reiterating what I already know. When I went to get help for my classes they told me to do what I wanted and when I asked them what I should do for my major, they still said it was up to me. I don’t know how emotional counseling is here because I haven’t used it but I know that they’re available if needed. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2728,"What resources do I have to support me? I don't know, everything that everyone talks about all the time. Tutors and peers and your professors and things, but I guess I've just always been too anxious to access that support. And then in other aspects of life besides school, I've always thought it was 'me against the world'. I've always been an independent person, and most of the time, to a fault. I don't know why, and I don't really know how to change that way of thinking (other than finding some kind of resource to be supported by, but that's a bit of a catch 22, isn't it?). I think, though, it has come time for me to stop being so independent as it is being reflected in my school work and my mental health, and I know the resources everyone talks about could probably help. Deep down, I think that these resources won't help, or maybe I'm afraid that they will."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2722,"To answer that question, a resource that I do have as of now would be emotional, educational, and financial resources. And I get all of these from my family, they're the main resource for everything. For emotional, they're the support system that has helped me through everything and provided me with warmth when my days were tough. This is the same for educational and financial resources."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2719,"Although I feel as though, and have been told, there are many resources at my expense at this school, I do not feel supported nor made aware of the various resources available to us as students at SFSU. At our school, attempting to navigate tutoring and find help where it is needed is difficult and not very well communicated and/or vocalized. When a student needs help they send us in various directions, department-wise, that becomes confusing and I feel as though I am on my own to figure out concepts that I do not understand. Aside from that I do feel supported by my friends and colleagues who are also in the same struggle as me; attempting to juggle classes, studying, home-life, and work, etc. I feel supported by my professors, however, with the amount of students that they have it is hard to get the individualized help that is required in most classes. Furthermore, I feel as though the advisors on campus are not very helpful when aiding in class schedules and graduate school requirements and they make it very confusing to understand what is required of us to complete for graduation. "
