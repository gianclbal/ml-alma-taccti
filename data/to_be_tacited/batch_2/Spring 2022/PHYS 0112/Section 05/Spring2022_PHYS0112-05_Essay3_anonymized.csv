2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2724,"Between the transition into quarantine and also into in-person classes, I found myself having a difficult time with keeping up with my school work, staying motivated, and finding the discipline to continue with school. Moreover, I’ve found that I’ve had an even more difficult time than I’d ever experienced in the past in retrospect to my academics. Thus, with this difficulty, I’ve slacked way behind on my school work and have needed to retake more classes than I wanted or expected too. In hopes of overcoming this difficulty, I’ve found positivity through my dance classes. I’ve always found dance to come naturally, so whenever I step into a studio or a class, I often forget about issues that bring anxiety to my mind. I’m usually so focused on trying to perfect or remember a combination that I have a moment of meditation whilst dancing. I’ve found this to be extremely vital to ensuring I reduce burn out from my worries over my academics."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2728,"I do a lot of things when life gets challenging. Some of them aren't healthy. Some of them are. I'm learning, though, learning how to deal with challenges in a way that doesn't hurt myself, but it's really really hard. For the most part, in school, I can deal with challenges pretty easily. Breaking things down into smaller portions to deal with, starting small and then working toward the bigger picture, taking my time and working in pieces: these are all things I do with educational/real world challenges. It's really different mentally and emotionally, though, because I feel like I can't apply that same logic to something that doesn't seem to have any logic at all. If I don't have logic as my tool, I have nothing at all, and that is not entirely healthy. With this comes avoidance, withdrawal, and isolation since I cannot apply my logic to solving mental and emotional challenges. It's a lot, and it's weird being so completely different in each area of my life, but hopefully  can learn to apply my informational challenge skills to my emotional challenges or find other ways to deal with them. What I do know, though, is that I've never given up trying to figure things out, and I know I should hold onto that for as long as possible."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2729,"When life gets challenging, I usually take time to reflect and jot down what is bothering me. I like to stay realistic with what I'll do to face the consequences although it's a natural occurrence to stay optimistic above all. My anxiety usually thrives on my avoidance of challenging tasks so if I do have a stress-provoking task, I like to get it over with at the start of the day. Otherwise, it reinforces this counterproductive cycle that doesn't benefit me in the long run. After I write down and acknowledge the difficult things I have, I break it down into smaller tasks that need to be done before deadlines; if it can be done in ten minutes, then I use the opportunity to finish it at the moment and not put it off any longer. By eliminating the hard stuff, in the beginning, it won't nag the back of my mind throughout the day. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2720,"When life gets challenging I do my best not to shut down even though I oftentimes really want to. But in honesty, I cave in and give up on a few assignments; when it's something that I'm not happy or satisfied about doing. When I no longer feel interested nor does the capability to push through multiple assignments last, I usually don't end up doing them - either at all or perhaps I do them during their last days of postage. I self destruct a lot - bite my nails, stay on my phone too long, procrastinate, and consume too much sugar, but I still wake up each day thinking that it can get better if I keep taking my cold morning showers, clean my home, stay active, face my fear of surfing each weekend, keep track of my financials, maintain my job, finish the semester, and pursue another career goal.I think that the most self-care things I've done comes down to spending hours alone walking in the city and photographing its people, art, and even its population of tweakers that are somehow still considered alive. Not to mention having a genuine partner by my side who allows me to enjoy things that I've always wanted to try but was afraid to do alone. Realizing that I still have the potential to learn and try something new helps me to believe I can get out of the holes that I dig for myself. Staying calm and accepting the forthcoming allows me to live more peacefully knowing that what is meant to be will be. The only challenge of life that keeps me in a panic state is the thought of never being able to live in this world again, without doing the things I've always wanted to do first. And I don't always quite know how to meditate through those moments of worry and doubt, but the best thing that brings me back to my inner home is reminding myself that I still live in the moment and am surrounded by an entire planet of natural wonders that I have yet to explore for my own. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2719,"When life becomes difficult and challenging, I react in different ways depending on the situation. One of my coping mechanisms is to become really sad and hopeless and cry and get all my feelings out; then I suck it up, keep my head held high, and move forward. I will try to only let the setback get me down for a moment, and then I try to let that feeling pass and learn from it and push forward. When I am faced with difficult challenges this is something that I tend to do so that I let myself feel the reaction I am having to the challenges, instead of ignoring how it's affecting me. However, I only marinate on it for so long or else it will negatively affect me and there is no point in continuing to let the hardship drain my energy. The other way that I react when life gets challenging is I dissociate and pretend like it is not happening or I procrastinate facing the problem or hard thing that I need to face and distract myself with other problems or responsibilities I have in my life. This is not the most healthy way but I find myself doing this with certain things in my life and I need to work on that."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2726,"When life gets hard I try to take it as a learning experience but I also use this quote my mom has told me once that has stuck with me, the quote is in spanish and it is “Todo en esta vida tiene solucion,menos para la muerte” in english this translates to “everything in this life has a solution, except for death” this quote has helped me consulate from my past misfortune. Ever since my grandma passed away I have been self caring and reflecting at times on this small journal that I own I write on when i'm feeling down. I especially enjoy going to a nice spot by pacifica where I relax and enjoy the nice view of the ocean. I usually go on my own, eat, write and maybe get down and admire the view. Another way that I cope when things get hard in life is and I understand this may not be the best way to cope but It has helped me and many other people. I like and enjoy shopping online and in stores. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2721,"Umm well what do I do when life gets challenging? I actually do not know. I get very stressed until the challenging bit is over. I think of quitting? and then I think no I can't quit and then I think of quitting and then I think what is the worse thing to happen if I do quit? I end up not quitting because by the time I decide to make up my mind whether or not to quit it is pass the point of quitting and I end p having to do those things anyways. I feel like life is always challenging, especially for a full time student that also has to work a lot of hours to be able to afford to live. But you can't just give up so you just keep doing what you have to do. Yea so I guess my answer is to just keep going and perhaps get angry lol. I don't know. Also side note would you be able to remind the class that these are due? I might have missed it, but I didn't hear a mention of it in last weeks class. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2727,"What do I do when life becomes challenging? This question depends on the degree of difficulty that I am faced with. If it's moderately challenging, I will take a deep breath and continue on. If I find that it is more challenging, I like to assess my situation and think about how I can overcome it. Generally, it isn't that easy, and if homework is a challenging situation, I find myself having trouble. I'll procrastinate, dissociate, and distract myself from what responsibilities I have before me. Eventually, because this accomplishes nothing, I return to look at my challenging situation again. Once I return, I like to make to-do lists and pace myself. Work on what is due first and whatever is toughest or will absorb most of my time. I generally like being prepared to go into challenging experiences, whether or not the challenge is homework. In the end, challenging experiences come and go the rest. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2722,"When life gets challenging, all I do would be to try to set myself straight. Sometimes in those kinds of situation, it's the feeling of challenging eats you up because everything is messy. So what I would do is to try to sort out things that are bothering me, bit by bit. It'll take some time for me to come to the sense but that's the point, I can't just solve problems overnight. I would start by planning things down, it might be my routine or things that I need to complete, or simply schedule for that week. It really helps me when I write things down to get organized, to at least cut the part that would make me feel messy because my schedule is all messed up. Another thing would be to not be afraid and face yourself because the best way to overcome the part that is most challenging in our life is ourselves, more specifically our fears. Also a good supporting system would be ideal as well. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2718,"When life gets challenging, I take a step back and look at what I need to fix. I try to locate what is causing the challenges and plan out how to fix the short-term and long-term problems. Before I try to fix my problems, I take a short break. I reflect on things I have done and if I could have done better. Currently, I am trying to do my best to be on top of my six classes. At the beginning of the semester, I was overwhelmed with the amount of work. I was stressed out. I felt like I would not have time for myself and free time. Eventually, I learned how to manage my school work, alone time, and time with friends and family. I tried out different routines until I found one that I liked. I always plan out my week. Planning out my week helps me prepare and helps me avoid challenges. "
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2723,"Usually when life gets challenging I try to reduce the stress as much as possible. Usually its taking a small break from whatever I'm doing to mentally reset my self. Then I think to myself, ""why is life challenging?"" then I try and address those issues as my priority. If that does not work then the issue is most likely out of my control and I try and not let it affect me too much mentally. This process helps me a lot with stress management."
2022,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2725,"When life gets challenging, I tend to read more or watch more youtube. I find more ways to distract myself. Sometimes I clean the whole apartment or I fixate on a book series. I guess that’s a fancy way of saying that I procrastinate on what makes my life challenging until I somehow find the motivation to start it. This semester has been one of my toughest yet so most of the time I procrastinate watching lectures or doing assignments till the last minute. Thankfully I’ve been able to get through the tough times but as the semester ends it only seems to get harder. But once I take a breather from all the work, I can go back and get all my work done and somehow understand the concepts i’m learning (not really for ochem but i’m slowly getting there). What I like about this semester is that my professors have given lots of resources and time to ask questions and just overall been really nice and given lots of support."
