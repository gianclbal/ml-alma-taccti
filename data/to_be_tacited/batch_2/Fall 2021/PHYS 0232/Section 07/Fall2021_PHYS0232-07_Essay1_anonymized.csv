2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1975,"I would like to go into the stem field because I want to study the technology aspect of it, as I am a computer science major. I've always been interested in technology and how it can be used to help and benefit everyone, and I've always wanted to learn how to code and write programs. Another field of stem that I like is science, although I'm not studying it, I've always liked science and my favorite type of science is Biology. I enjoyed taking biology in high school and I found many of the topics interesting, especially genetics. I think stem is a great field of work to go into, because there is lots of work you can find and the work you do in this field can help to benefit everyone."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,186,"The reason I am pursuing a career in STEM is because I believe this field is important to the world. Being born and raised primarily in a third world country, it was instilled in me to try to make a difference in the world from a young age. When I moved to the USA, the opportunity that I had was vastly better than children my age overseas and I understood the importance of utilizing my platform from then onward. This desire to make a difference translated to me, mechanical engineering. At times, it does feel like that I am not capable of this difficult major but everyday I am inspired to keep pushing through the efforts of great professors, the support of my friends and family, and other students who achieve their dreams through hard work and lots of struggling. My dream is to become an engineer and use that knowledge to help my country, Bangladesh, in any way I could down the line. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1976,"Reflection #1""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?""My name is Liliana Samano, I want to go in the STEM field because my career is Civil Engineering. STEM education helps us to solve the challenges the world faces today. I also really enjoy math and science. I have really enjoy everything that STEM has brought to students. STEM-related programs has become a presidential priority because too few college students are pursuing degrees in these fields. I'm pretty exited to be one of the few people who follows a degree in the STEM field. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1977,"I am a computer science major. The reason I chose to go into this specific major is so that I can make money. I've had a large exposure to computers from a very young age so my general tech savviness has always been a driving force for my choice of major. I also really enjoy the act of problem solving and coding allows for that in controlled bursts, it's especially enjoyable because the tools and rules are all very defined. The reality of the situation though is that if money were not involved I would likely go into art or some other field were the ultimate goal is not money. Additionally the fear of automation taking out my job and the job of those around me is also a worry, so why not be in the role of the automaters instead of the automated. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,603,"The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is that I am interested in engineering because that is the major I decided to go for in my journey at San Francisco State University. Ever since I was a kid I always liked mathematics but in high school, I liked the class but majoring in math is not the right idea for me but engineering is something I look forward to because I was always with my father helping him with his company where he uses machines like a bobcat to break down concrete and construction and civil engineering is a major that can give me the environment that I liked in the past. The reason I want to go to the stem field is because of the major I am interested in and the field is really difficult and challenging which I like because you have 1 life so I am choosing a difficult major so I don't regret the decision I made."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1978,"STEM-related fields have got more attention in recent years as the hottest career of today’s competitive global economy. Because of the growing demand in STEM fields, It is more likely for me to get a job in STEM fields easier than in other areas. The second reason I want to go into the STEM field is that the average salary I can make in STEM fields is higher than others.  According to the research, as of Aug 25, 2021, the average annual pay for the STEM jobs category in San Francisco is $54,281 year. That works out to be approximately $26.10 an hour. This is the equivalent of $1,044/week or $4,523/month. High pay makes everything better and makes my life easier.  STEM fields create innovation that brings benefits to people and the next generations."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1979,"I want to go into the STEM field because when I was in high school I took many computer science classes and thought that it was a very interesting topic and since I really liked computers/games I thought that this was the best fit for my end. I know that I will have a hard time trying to graduate with a major in computer engineering but I feel that it was the right major for me because I like doing things hands-on without being bored. Usually, I get bored after a while if it’s all online but Computer Engineering didn’t feel that way to me. I think that if I didn’t like Computer Engineering/Science I wouldn’t be in the STEM field at all and it would eventually probably make me pursue accounting or business. Ultimately though I find that Computer Engineering/STEM pushes me to its limits for majors and I really like a challenge which is the reason why I want to go into the STEM field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1980,"The reason that I would want to go into the STEM field is simply because for as long as I can remember I've always enjoyed being on the computer. That is the reason that I also want to be a software engineer. I've always found it fun learning how things operate on a computer and the process of figuring out problems and learning on my own. Once I figured out a problem it became to continue to try new things. When it comes to STEM solving problems and figuring how things operate is all apart of what consist of. There are so many things you can do when it comes to technology, that is something that I always enjoyed as well. You can build things, update them, and even make games from your ideas to make things fun. I've always found something on a computer that made me want to continue to learn, such as things like how to type, to coding on social media, and even work and learning how things function using a computer program. Although taking courses through STEM can be difficult at times, the process of learning makes it a bit fun when you start to have a better understanding."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1981,"Studying in the STEM field is very helpful to my life. It can let me know some common sense of science so that I can apply it in my work and life in the future. Why pursue science? If I want to leave my mark in the objective world composed of materials and realize my own value, I must do so. It is never true in science, and there is no absolute right. Science is an operational process for exploring the world. This set of procedures is based on the reliable theories discovered by people, and relying on these theories to continuously explore new and deeper content. Depending on the progress of the research, even these theories may be overturned. Continuous exploration has given science a unique charm. Pursuing science is not an end, but a process of continuous learning, verification, modification, and evolution. For civilization, survival is its first need. The development of science and technology can enable mankind to break through one after another obstacle to survival, expand a wider field, create better and better conditions, and obtain more opportunities for survival. That’s why I want to go into the STEM field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1982,"Manish Sharma  PHY 232-07   1 September 2021  Reflection #1  Why do I want to go into the STEM field?              There was no specific reason or events in life resulted to choose STEM as a major in my life. However, growing up I was always curious about how things work? Like I always used to think about how the earth is there, the sun, everything around me. To be honest, I still have so many questions in my mind. I think this curiosity led me to take Science as a major in high school. During the 11th grade, I decided I will be some sort of engineer. And as I grew up in the developing country, Nepal, there is always an enthusiasm in kids to become doctors, engineers,s or anything related to the STEM sector. I think that is because my parents had to grow up in difficult than my generation. And they always used to tell me and my siblings, that you should study better and be an engineer, doctor, or nurse. So, here I am trying to fill my parent's dreams and find the answers to my own curiosities."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,341,"During my 21 years in the Navy, I found my love and enjoyment for teaching.  The simple fact that you can share your love and passion on a topic/subject, and see the eagerness and excitement in their eyes and faces is heartwarming.  Also, when they finally understand and comprehend a difficult concept, they have that ahh-ha moment, is extremely rewarding.  For me, I want to continue to give back to those excitable and eager minds by sharing my love and passion for Astronomy, Physics and math.  I am uber excited to continue my path to completing my B.S., then on to my PhD so I can teach in a 4-year institution.  While I wouldn't be disappointed to teach in a high school level while working on my PhD, my end goal is to teach and conduct research as an eventual tenured professor."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1983,"in my case, I felt most attracted to the STEM field. These subjects have always been my strong suit and what I find most interesting. the STEM field covers so much different areas that I feel you can take away something from all aspects and they all correlate in some way.  I feel that it gives me the most options to find the career path that I want to take in the future"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1984,"I wanted to go into the STEM field because it seemed like a good challenge and I enjoy creating things and working with my hands. My first year here at SFSU I wasn't sure what I wanted to study. I first was a kinesiology major and then changed to an art major. I kept changing and trying things out and then I finally decided on mechanical engineering. To be honest I don't remember what came to my mind and why mechanical engineering popped into my head. Once that thought did enter my mind, I just decided to run with it. Studying mechanical engineering seemed like a good idea because of the benefits in the future and it was a good challenge for me to study in the STEM field. In high school I always enjoyed my science and math classes so I was comforted when I decided to major in Mechanical Engineering. I am a third year but only my second year in engineering because I decided to major later in my college career. Luckily though I think I will be able to finish only a semester after 4 years of college. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1985,I want to go into the STEM field because I see an endless amount of possibility in this field. There are many different ways we can improve the world around us and to me one of those ways is to improve the technology we have. I have always been fascinated by computers since a young age. My dad showed me all of the cool things I can do on a computer. I was having fun but also realized that I could be part of the fun by being one of the people who helps leads innovations when it comes to computer software. One of my goals is to improve the lives of others through technology by bringing together as many people as possible. I believe that is what technology should be used for. Contributing to the teams that are trying to create the next big step towards making life easier through technology is one of the biggest reasons why I want to go into the STEM field. I also am passionate about computers and using them to connect with people I can't see everyday. Computers are part of our everyday lives. We would not have class if it were not for our technology during these trying times. It is important to me that I can learn about computers and adapt to our fast paced changing world. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1986,"I want to go into the STEM field because I am fascinated by how objects work, such as a building, car, train, etc. I have always liked math and am very good at math. The STEM field would not have me sit in a room most of the day when I work. I get to see the world and make the world a better place with efficient things. I want to know how buildings are stable and how they are built. I would like to learn about the stability of a building so we can build buildings that can stand up to very massive earthquakes or any natural disasters. I want to learn alongside other people that have the same goals and interests as me. I have always been interested in how buildings stay up holding their own weight and withstand earthquakes and strong winds. I also have been passing by very tall buildings and construction sites when I was a little kid which made me curious and made me want to get into this kind of field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1987,"I chose to go into STEM because I love gaming. I have always wanted to be a game developer and a designer. In high school, I had the chance to try computer science and game design. I decided it was more fun and I would make more money with computer science than straight game design so I chose computer science instead. When I was little my dad would always teach my computer things like coding and building a computer so I love engineering straight off the bat. In elementary school I also loved math and I was super competitive. My parents had never really given me an allowance and I would always have to work for the money they gave; because of that I would also be conservative and loved earning and saving a lot of money. So with all the little things that I liked and wanted to do in the future, I was able to decide the best major for me was computer science even if it was super difficult with a lot of work."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1988,"Initially it was due to my interest in things and how/why the work.  I have always enjoyed fabrication as well: welding, woodwork, composites, etc. and believed that a degree in mechanical engineering was the most interesting way to do these things and earn a good living.I am not so enthused about mech-e anymore.  Between the lack of resources at SFSU and a soul sucking visit to a manufacturing facility I have lost my drive for this degree path.  Covid and the resulting online medium are not helping much.Currently I feel caught between Plan B: transferring to a different university for a different degree; and Plan A: continuing this SFSU suffer fest. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1989,"I want to go into the STEM field because of my major and dream of what I want to do. My dream is to know more and learn more about technology which falls in the STEM field. Going into the STEM field is competitive however I believe I can do what it takes to reach my dream and have my future job I have always wanted. One of my earliest dreams was to work in the STEM field and specifically in technology where I could learn and innovate new creations. Going into the STEM field will allow me to interact and continue to follow the technology that constantly evolves and adapts to the world's needs. One of my goals is to keep up with technology every year and make sure that I know of new technological inventions and advances. By knowing this and keeping myself up to date, I am able to see how the world is changing in technology and how it is evolving. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1990,"Growing up in a small village, I never got opportunity to get expensive gadgets. We used to play in the woods and chirping of birds used to be our music. As a kid I was very talkative and used to ask a lot of question to elder people. I used to be curious about many things and ask silly questions like why our dog cannot talk to us, why trees cannot walk like us and so on. Sometime my parents used to get bored and avoid answering my silly question. When I was in fifth grade, I saw computer for the first time in my school. And as obvious hundreds of questions arose in my mind like how this thing work, how do they make game and character and so on. Me and my friends used to crack tools and used to try different things on computer. Sometimes we used to break things and leave as if nothing happened. With all the curiousness I keep searching for answer to the question and finally graduated my high school keeping science as my major. After finishing my high school, I wanted to continue my computer science journey and picked computer science as my major. And here I am studying physics and I am enjoying it too."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,305,"I wanted to get into the STEM field for Astrophysics. Math and science are the two subjects that I feel most comfortable with and I've always had a love for space. I never really discovered how interesting I thought astronomy was until I took Introduction to Astronomy last semester. Every day I went into class always asking questions and learning about so many aspects of the universe that I found to be intriguing. Taking that class truly inspired me to switch my major to Astrophysics where I hope to pursue at least a master's degree. Talking to my astronomy professor, my girlfriend, and upperclassmen who were already in the major really helped me to decide that majoring in Astrophysics is totally something that I can accomplish. I also believe in myself and I believe that I can continue in this major solely because I have a lot of passion for math, physics, and astronomy."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1991,"I wanted to go into the stem field, specifically computer science, because it is a very lucrative career path. One of my core values is financial freedom and majoring in computer science aligns with my core values in a financial aspect. Another core value of mine is creating value. I know that I can create value as a software engineer by creating softwares that can have a positive impact on people’s life such as making procedures more efficient. I also thought computer science would be a highly demanded major in 10-15 years from now as technology is the future. Majoring in computer science gives me the secure feeling that I will be okay in life. I was also told by many people that I would be a good fit for computer science. I was always good with math in school. Also, I was always in front of a computer growing up, so people thought it would benefit me as well. A concern of mine is not liking my job in the future, but if that’s the case, I’ll be adaptable and find a solution then."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1992,"I want to go into the STEM field for many reasons. Everyone of course loves the money aspect of it and I also enjoy breaking stereotypes. As a women of color in the the STEM field, it has been a rough journey but never rough enough for me to quit. Being this woman or color has made me stronger because the STEM field presents so many challenges to women. Although I love the STEM field, I am still not 100% sure it is for me. I love the challenges and problem solving but I don't know if it is still a right fit for me. I have found a love in it but I don't think I am in love with it yet. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1993,I choose the Stem field because I have always been interested in building and improving things.  I am an Army Veteran and I worked in Computer Networking.  I hope to take that experience and knowledge and apply it to my future career.  I enjoy working seeing a completed new project.  I want to change the mentality of creating at any cost including our planets health.  I want to join and work on projects that will not only improve our well being but better our and all life’s health.  This seems like the greatest contribution I can help with in my lifetime.  I have a 7-year-old son and I want this world to be here for him and many generations after.  As an engineer I can help develop at ground level so that a project is more earth conscious and that is why I have joined STEM.
