2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1983,"well maybe because it is what we covered most recently but one question I had about the way current moved, is why did the current travel quicker around the system when the light bulbs were parallel to each other but on separate paths. What we found was the current traveled through the path where it would use up less energy, in other words, fewer obstacles. while doing this lab, I realized how everything that we use on the regular in our daily lives is dependent on energy and power. things such as our phones, TVs, appliances, even our homes, and some cars. in our homes, we use up a large amount of energy that is traveling all around us pretty much at all times. So if we know how it works and we use it, we can be more mindful of how we waste it and figure ways to conserve it"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1981,"The Gauss theorem of electrostatic field describes the relationship between ""in"" and ""out"" of electric field lines. In simple terms, for a closed curved electric field line with no internal charge, there must be out and out, and the amount of in and out must be equal. This can be a vivid example in life. The electric field strength at any point on the surface of this concentric sphere is 0 For example, there is a curved surface similar to a spherical shell, which is like a pool filled with water. When the water is released, the amount of water entering and the amount of water released will always be equal. If expressed by positive and negative charges, the positive charge is like a pool that produces water by itself. Negative charges are like a pool that is not full of water. Only by learning Gauss's law can I get this specific information. If we can use this information reasonably, it will benefit society and our lives. In life, almost everything related to energy decline is the application of Gauss's theorem, such as light intensity, sound intensity, electric field, etc. By learning Gauss’s law, I can prove that any object in an empty spherical shell is not subject to the universal gravitation of the spherical shell. The study of physics is not just to deal with exams, it can also solve the questions I encounter in life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1993,"The concept I have enjoyed most recently for this class is learning about was electrical fields.  I wonder if it will ever be able to, one day, create a ship that will ride those field lines.  Then when there is a separation to the next fields find way to pull along.  This would one day create space travel.  I know that is a far thought but I do know that we will one day not fit this earth and need to find an alternative.  Hope this is something to be seen."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1986,"A concept that was covered in class in the past few weeks in the lab was circuits. My question is why is it bad to connect two ends of wires together when their other ends are connected to an electrical form of voltage. I have thought about it and after having it being explained in lab class, it is starting to make sense. Both ends of the wires that are not supposed to touch each other should be connected to an object that would need voltage to run, such as a light bulb which we did in the lab for Week 6. This information might be used to benefit society because if the wires were to just touch each other, it would create a big spark due to the amount of voltage the wires are getting from an electrical box which is a fire hazard. A great example of a correct use of circuit would be lighting a light bulb or how the light bulb in the house gets energy from the electrical box which is by having parallel circuits because if one lightbulb is out, the others stay on. Another example is a series circuit in a house which could be in a room or living room with 4 light bulbs and when the light switch is on, all the light bulbs turn on/light up at the same time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1982,"I would like to look back at Gauss’s law. My question is why zero flux is not zero field?  In two situations, there is zero flux through a closed surface: either  (1)there are no charged particles enclosed by the surface or  (2)there are charged particles enclosed, but the net charge inside the surface is zero.  For either situation, it is incorrect to conclude that the electric field on the surface is zero. Gauss’s law states that the electric flux is proportional to the enclosed charge, not the electric field.  IF the net flux through a gaussian surface is zero, then, either the net charge inside the surface is zero or the number of electric field lines entering the surface equals the number leaving the surface.  The product of the magnitude of the electric field  E and surface area A perpendicular to the field is called the electric flux ФE.               ФE = EA  If the electric field makes an angle theta () then flux is given by,               ФE = EAcos       "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1976,"I would say in general to have a little knowledge in chemistry would be helpful in people's lives. People might not realize that chemistry is in our daily lives, maybe not know every concept in detailed but have the knowledge for it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,305,"What are the pros and cons of parallel versus series circuits?One pro of a parallel circuit is that there are multiple pathways for the current to flow through so if one component in the circuit shorts, the current can still flow and the circuit isn't broken. One con of parallel circuits is that the current is shared throughout each pathway thus each additional pathway divides the current making it weaker. One pro of series circuits is that they're simple to set up compared to parallel circuits while one con is that if there's a short in the circuit, the entire circuit is now broken.These concepts can be seen commonly in older Christmas lights versus modern Christmas lights. A lot of Christmas lights in the past were produced cheaply in series so if one bulb was burnt out, you'd have to figure out which bulb was burnt and replace it for the circuit to be complete and light up again. Most Christmas lights nowadays are strung in parallel to avoid this issue."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1990,Physics has always been fun subject to learn. In most case we study about what is around us. In lab we use the materials that are around us. For example in the charge lab us used tape to detect the positive charge and negative charge and their attracting and repelling behavior. Similarly in Electric field lab we use simulation and it helps to visualize the concept of Electric field and its direction. We learned about Electric Flux and Gauss's law. Overall we have studied about the mechanism of electricity and its properties. I was not clear about the difference between voltage and current. It was clear when Professor gave us example of dozer chan and gasoline. Voltage is like gasoline and moving chain is like a current. We learned that current flows from wire where there is less obstacle and less resistance. There is no doubt that electricity has become a part of our life. Studying about electricity is always a boon to society. Now we have electric vehicle and we are planning to eliminate all the gasoline car very soon for less carbon emission. Every year we are trying to use more electricity than other carbon emission energy source. Learning the phenomenon is always great thing to do.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1984,"In one of the first homework assignments, there was a questions something along the lines of ""Three are brought close to each other, two at a time. When objects A and B are brought together, they attract. When objects B and C are brought together, they repel. From this, we conclude which of the following?"". The correct answer is that more tests are needed in order to determine any information about the charges on the objects. The question by itself isn't difficult, but its the insight and need to do more testing in order to find the actual charges of objects A, B, and C. I think this relates to everything we do not just in physics but in all STEM fields. We are required to always check what we do no matter the subject. In high school we first learned about hypothesis and testing them out with experiments and then we would check and see if our hypothesis were accurate. This is something that has carries over into college and will continue for the rest of our lives. This trial an error method helps humans further understand something.We also don't just trial and error method just in STEM. For example, when we first learn how to drive a car and you are parallel parking for the first time, there is a high chance you will either be too far away from the curb or too close. In order to fix it you will have to do it again. You might fail, or you might succeed. With more trials and even more errors, you will eventually learn how to parallel park. This is the same for anything in this world. You try something, you might fail or you might succeed. No matter if you fail or succeed, you can and will try again. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1991,"Question: How do you determine which Gaussian surface to use to calculate the electric flux?There are many different Gaussian surfaces. When there is a single charge, the preferred Gaussian surface to use is a Gaussian sphere because the electric field lines will penetrate the surface of the sphere evenly. In this case, the electric field lines are evenly distributed, the charge is equal at every point, and the electric field is perpendicular to the Gaussian sphere at all points. When using a Gaussian sphere, the flux can be calculated using flux = E * Area, where the area is 4piR^2.In the case where we have an infinitely long cylinder rod, the optimal Gaussian surface to use is a cylinder. In this case, the electric field lines will penetrate perpendicularly on the sides. On the top and the bottom of the Gaussian cylinder, the electric field lines are parallel to the surface, so the electric flux on the top and bottom would be zero. Therefore, we only need to calculate the electric flux of the middle part of the Gaussian cylinder. The equation used to calculate the electric flux in this case is flux = E * Area, where the area of a cylinder is 2piRh.Another situation is when there is an infinitely large sheet. For the infinitely large sheet, the Gaussian surface we can use is a rectangular prism. On the side of the rectangular prism, the electric field lines are parallel, so the electric flux there is 0. On the top and bottom surface, the electric field lines penetrate perpendicularly so the flux would be calculated as flux = E * Area."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1989,One concept that was covered in class is overall velocity and how acceleration relates to it. We can see velocity as a speed of something in a given direction which can usually be found by change in displacement over change in time. On the other hand we have acceleration which is the rate of velocity per unit of time usually found by change in final minus initial over time. This concept of velocity and acceleration poses a question of acceleration really dependent on velocity. Looking at the notes and past lectures I think acceleration is dependent on velocity but can act on its own. Acceleration kind of works on its own but with respect to velocity when its there. Velocity works on its own as its just the speed over the amount of time however with acceleration it would play a different role. This information could be useful in society to learn the real differences of velocity and acceleration and if acceleration is really dependent on velocity. Would acceleration exist without any velocity? I think it would benefit other students like me learning the difference of velocity and acceleration and how that works along with others. It can be relevant when learning about velocity or acceleration in scenarios of real life or in physics. I think learning the real difference of velocity and acceleration would pose a great understanding and possibly new theories.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1987,"For me, I love dealing with circuits, therefore I think it's most relevant in my life and in society. It was a small section but learning about parallel and series is an important concept such if we didn't have them, we wouldn't be able to make batteries, lightbulbs, and/or cars. Without learning about circuits, we would never know how to increase voltage and/or amperage. If we didn't know about how to increase voltage, our lightbulbs would be dim. If we didn't know how to increase amperage, we would be stuck charging our phones for hours and days. Even the recent phones, iPhone x and onwards have a battery system where having two batteries take on charge is better than one battery for battery life and charging speed.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1985,"My question for me to answer is about circuits. The question I want to talk about is what are the differences between wiring circuits in series versus in parallel. When you create a circuit, you construct a closed path in which electrons can flow in a current. Similar to how water flows. If this flow was allowed to travel down separate paths this would model parallel circuits. If the flow had to travel down multiple paths consecutively, this would model a series circuit. I learned from our lab that current will always flow on the path of least resistance. This detail is important to note because its the reason why short circuits result in combustion or fires. Short circuits are paths that do not have resistance and therefore all of the current will travel down that path and it causes heat to rise quickly. In a series circuit, the same amount of current flows through all the components placed in the circuit. Parallel circuits are placed in parallel which results in a split in the current's flow. This is important to apply in real life because when designing circuits you have to be conscious of how much current is traveling down a wire in a circuit. Things that conduct electricity best is what wires are generally made of, and that would be metal. However the metal's ability to conduct electricity, without combusting, is determined by what kind of metal it is and its area. A smaller area means a lower conductivity threshold, which is something that we proved in our circuit lab. If you were working with wires like this and needed to reduce flow you could wire the circuit in parallel to split the flow and reduce how much current the wire receives. Or on the contrast if you need more current to light up a light bulb for example, you could wire the circuit in series to achieve the highest current. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1977,"The understanding of the flow of currents, such as the attribute of currents following the path of least resistance, helped people create and utilize electricity to power our homes. Ohm's law allowed us to calculate voltage given currents and resistance. Electricity is a fundamental part to the interconnectedness of the globe and has in some cases made our lives far easier. We can attribute the increase in our live span over the past 100 years to advancements in technology that are all reliant on the discovery and utilization of our understanding of currents, resistance and voltage. Society's benefits from these discoveries impact ever part of the world around us today. There exist very few places where this impact cannot be seen, for better or for worse."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1979,"Why do some items like aluminum foil and batteries make sparks/fire?Because of the weak circuit in foil connecting two pieces of foil to the positive and end sides of the battery the foil which isn’t meant to transfer heat the energy cant go anywhere and sparks/start a fire. The foil also sometimes sticks together making the batteries very hot to the touch and takes a bit of force to remove the two foil from each other. This information is generally applicable to people outside of a physics lab because this kind of information may be useful to people going out on a trip and if they forget they’re lighter but have aluminum foil and batteries they can still make a fire with that and not be stranded. This type of knowledge benefits campers the most but it can be used in a wide variety of situations to start a fire for a fireplace or maybe an old oven that people may use. Although it is still dangerous and can burn you, the amount of heat it produces can be very scary and is not for everyone. It can be a potential fire hazard if you have a fear of the sparks/ batteries heating up in your hands."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1975,"A topic we recently worked on that I found very interesting was circuits. Circuits are very useful and benefit our society greatly as they allow us to use electricity to power our homes and various technology that we use. The question that I have been wondering is how do circuits power things. And they power things with electrons by trapping them in a loop, usually with wires, but in our lab we had used aluminum foil. And the circuit gets the electrons from a power source, such as a battery. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1978,"The Circuit concept that we covered in class in the past few weeks.  There are two types of circuits we focus on in class, the series, and parallel circuits.  These different types of circuits work differently. In a series circuit, there is only one path for the electrons to flow. The disadvantage of a series circuit is that if there is a break in the circuit the entire circuit is open and no current will flow. An example of a series would be the lights on many inexpensive Christmas trees. If one light goes out all of them will. In a parallel circuit, the different parts of the electric circuit are on several different branches. There are several different paths that electrons can flow. If there is a break in one branch of the circuit electrons can still flow in other branches Your home is wired in a parallel circuit so if one light bulb goes out the other will stay on."
