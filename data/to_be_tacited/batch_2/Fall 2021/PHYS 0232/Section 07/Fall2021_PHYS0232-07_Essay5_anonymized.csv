2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,603,My greatest takeaway from this class is how energy and resistors work in our homes how can a battery voltage affect the lightbulbs around my house. This was something very important to me how can a lightbulb have the same charge when it's parallel when there are two paths that are parallel. When there is one path but there is more than one lightbulb you can see they both are getting less electricity than one lightbulb in one path I always thought why do we have rooms that are square and the reason is to have parallel paths in order for our outlets to have the same energy in any side of the room to all be equal. That topic that we learned and how negative attracts and positive repels helped me understand more about my home and it honestly blew my mind when we learned about this because all this time we had outlets parallel to each other so they can have the same energy.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1991,"My greatest take away from this class is all the hands-on physics experience I got. Through all the labs, I got a better understanding of physics concepts such as flux, electrical charge, circuits, and more. The simulations gave me a visual understanding of these concepts. On the other hand, the weeks we did labs gave me a physical understanding. It gave me engineering experience as I had to build certain circuits or other things in order to complete the assignments. I really appreciated the hands-on engineering aspect of the labs. It gave me knowledge, insight, and experience all at the same time. I also made a lot of relationships in this class as well through the group work. I will try to build on these relationships outside the classroom as the semester is coming to an end. It would be cool if I could become close friends with my lab partners one day in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1978,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that we get to use materials that we can see in our daily life to make it into a lab.  I would be able to assess the materials that I needed.  For example the circuits lab, we got to use a battery and tapes to make a circuit, to see how electricity flows, and to connect the circuits in different ways, to show how do different types of circuits work differently.  Although, in general, the circuit will be more complicated than pure series and pure parallel.  When we are doing the aluminum foil lab, we get the chance to see the foil got heated up and there might be small sparks due to the currents in the experiment."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1977,So far for the most part I've found many of the concepts of physics to have some the most connection of any math class. However It is very difficult to think of a situation where I would actually apply what I learned in a useful way on the day to day. I though the portions on electrical wiring were very interesting and helpful. It is cool to understand the way that wiring works inside houses and how and why it works. I think this class will give me a helpful understanding of the basic behaviors of the flow of electricity and how we can use it's properties to our advantage. I think one of my biggest take away from physics in general will be the satisfaction that I have completed my credit hours for this portion of my degree.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1980,"My greatest take away from this class is that physics applies everywhere in our everyday lives. Majority of the things that we do in life applies to physics in some sort of way. Physics is in a large number of things that we do, from how our cars run, the electrical units in our home, how batteries work in a circuit, even when we are just sitting down the laws of physics is applied. The interesting part of this class was that we were able to do labs using different systems to show us how each topic in the course work. Overall even though we were not able to work on the assignments in class physically it was really nice to work together in class via zoom and get a better understanding of how physics work. The many examples have shown me how science is a part of our everyday lives when we least expect it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,305,"My greatest takeaway from this class would be the fact that I have a better physical understanding of the world and why things work the way that they do. That's a very general thing to say but it's true. I used to have a lot of questions about the physical world and why things work the way they do however, my parents could never give me a solid answer on why. Now that I get not only answers but the math to back it up and prove to me why these concepts work, it's really satisfying to see. That is by far the greatest thing that this class has done for me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1986,"My greatest take away from this class was learning the concepts of physics more, such as getting more in depth with the topic because we got to experience them through simulations. Even though the questions seem and sound repetitive, I think it helped me understand the concept more. I liked how some labs did not take too long and not over our lab time because I will have time to do other assignments for my other classes. I will miss the simulations because I have worked on Phet simulations before in high school and I like how simple they are to do and follow along. It also showed me how the concepts work in both slow motion and regular speed. I liked the drawing of graphs for the lab because that is another way for us to understand the concept, but I did not like how it takes us so long to draw the graph on word doc or pdf."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1982,"This class supplements the knowledge from the lecture. What really helped me is applying the knowledge from the lecture in the real-life world. Despite, learning from Zoom I learned various concepts of Physics like Electric Field, Gauss' Law, Current, Coding in SAGE, and many others concepts. The Phet-Lab simulation was really easy to use to demonstrate our understanding of Physics knowledge. Despite our lab instructor being sick during the semester, she managed her best to teach during her toughest time. I am really grateful to her. My greatest takeaway from this class is despite the situation we have to keep moving, as there is a saying ""The show must keep going on"". We must be strong and keep the faith that everything will be better if we keep working on the things we are doing in our personal life as well. I believe being perseverant and resilient brings the best out of us. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1975,"My greatest take away from this class is the knowledge and clarification that I got on each topic that we went over in the labs. I feel that every lab has helped contribute to my greater knowledge of the concepts in Physics 230 and I hope that I'll be able to take these concepts and be able to apply them to my life to help benefit me in whatever way possible. My favorite lab was the first programming one we did, as now I know that programming can be applied to physics and since I'm a computer science major, I could probably use this knowledge for whatever purpose later on. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1990,"This was my first semester during covid and I was already worried about how I am going to learn from zoom. On the top of that this is online Lab so I had no idea how we can make it. But when I get to this class, I realized where there is will there is a way. Our professor managed to teach us perfectly theory and practical simultaneously. I have learned lot on electricity and magnetism and its phenomenon. We also learned about the application and engineering of electricity and magnetism. Out of all the topic we learned, I enjoyed learning about charge(positive and negative) and its property. We also did experiment using tape and the property that positive attract negative and repel positive was fascinating to see with our own eyes. Studying in class and virtual is different but for me virtual worked better. Very interesting class and I really enjoyed it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1981,"In the physics and calculus experiment class, I not only learned professional knowledge but more importantly, gained learning experience and experience, which made me inexhaustible in my life. In physics experiments, practical links such as experimental learning and observation have played a vital role in mastering physics knowledge and scientific methods, cultivating my hands-on potential, and constructing scientific qualities. I will cherish what I have learned. Not only have I learned professional knowledge, but also gained a sense of professionalism. Work hard to become better, self-disciplined, and efficient. Get along with the team more harmoniously. Improved my teamwork ability. I think that for physics experiments, it is necessary to be independent and not isolated and to learn independent thinking and independent experiment methods. But at the same time communicating with other people is also particularly important. I need to carefully record the experiment and master the results of the experiment. You cannot realize its importance only when you need it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1992,"My greatest takeaway from this class is the support my instructor gives to her students. Most STEM classes come with little to no support for their student, though this class is one that surprised me. Physics is a hard topic to grasp especially with there being so many equations to remember. My instructor proves that we are all capable to learn and work together to pass the class while doing labs weekly which is what motivates me to continue going. Overall, this class has made me become more comfortable with physics and knowing I have support from my instructor helps a lot."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,186,"My best takeaway from this class were most definitely the tools used in the Lab Explorations. The pHet simulations have been a silver lining of hard physics topics for me all semester as well as last year.  I believe that simply playing with those simulations even high school students and children could grasp the basics of each physics topic and I benefited from that plenty. I understand that for this class and any class really, what you get from that class is a result of the effort you put in, and I wish I had put in consistent effort in this lab class, rather in be in a hurry to turn in the work, because at the end of the semester, now, I just have regrets. I also really liked the explanations of topics in this class over those in my lecture. Academically, the quiz format for this class was my favorite because it was easier to turn in than other labs, and I truly learned series and parallel because of those labs with the Phet simulations and the questions that I worked out on pencil and paper"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1993,I think my greatest take away from this class is my greater understanding of Physics laws and rules.  I always had questions about magnets and how they are used.  I have also always wondered about how color that create the Northern Lights.  Finding out about solar flares and electrical fields has really out a greater understanding in my head.  That is my take greatest take away from this class.  
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1979,"My greatest takeaway from this class had to be circuits, current, and voltage as it made me understand a lot more of how currents and voltage work in circuits and how batteries can become very hot when using aluminum foil to connect. Honestly, I think the interactive labs were my favorite part of this lab because it made it much easier for me to do a lot of things in those three weeks. I think those 3 weeks were probably my favorite weeks because it gave me so much insight into how voltage, current, and circuits all work and why adding too much can be stressful on the circuit or having too little may not give off any current as three different wires are all trying to use the voltage from the single battery. My last takeaway had to be sage as it gave me more insight on how to do work with coding which definitely gave me a better impression on coding."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1985,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that although physics is one of the hardest subjects that I've ever learned in school, with enough hard work and the right mindset I am capable of learning. I am taking a number of challenging courses this semester and physics 230 is definitely one of them with all of its brand new concepts. They are definitely not the most simple things that I've learned but I know myself as a student. What I know about myself is that you need a mindset before you can acquire a skillset most of the time. Then from there, they go hand in hand and I can accomplish whatever it is that I am aiming to. I challenge myself in order to learn. There is far more value in the process of learning and the experience of challenging myself in order to grow. If I want to learn something, then I will. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1984,I think the greatest takeaway from this class is that working with others is tough on online. In some breakout rooms I was the only one participating and it slowed me down when trying to complete the lab. I think in certain situations it is better for me to work by myself because I am efficient and it is easy for me to get into the right mindset. I like working with others but only when they actually help and work on the lab themselves also. I think it should not be a collaborative effort but independent and then check with each other for their answers. I know next semester will probably be in person so this group work style will be much easier. However I think I will still miss doing online school for the pure ease of everything. I think I will be able to meet more people and will learn better because I am forced to go in a classroom with other people. I also think experiments will be more fun because we get to do hands on. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1989,"I think some of my greatest takeaways is learning deeper into physics, working in groups, and learning time management. I would say these are all different aspects I learned from this online class as they were all incorporated in someway to make a change into my life. I learned more about physics and went deeper into the material learning more about electric fields, circuits, and more. We also did more hands on experiments which helped me get the main idea and understand it better. I would also say working in groups is a big take away as I learned to work in small groups with friends or other classmates to do labs while we had time. In addition I would say time management as well as I learned to adjust my schedule during these hard times of COVID-19 and how it works. I had to adjust my own schedule and make sure I was on schedule while also trying to juggle all my other responsibilities. "
