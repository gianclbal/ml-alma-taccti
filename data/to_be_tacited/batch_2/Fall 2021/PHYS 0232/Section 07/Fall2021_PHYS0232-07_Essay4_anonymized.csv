2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1975,"I am not a very big fan of online classes, ever since the start. The thing I don't like the most is that online classes basically force me to stare at my laptop all day which doesn't help my already bad eyesight. I also don't like that it's so easy to get distracted since we don't need to turn on our cameras or microphones, so often times I find myself getting distracted with a class unless I am really interested in the topic. Something else that some of my teachers have started doing is using recorded lectures from last semester to teach, so there are no zoom classes, and although I like the flexibility of it, I just don't like how unengaging the class is, and in order to actually ask my teacher questions, I have to go to their office hours, which often conflict with my busy schedule. So overall, online classes have made my learning feel more difficult, and I'm often find myself getting really tired and distracted by just sitting and staring at my laptop. The one class I have in person is my favorite class, which just goes to show this. As for self-care, I haven't really been doing much other than just taking breaks, listening to music, and hanging out with my Girlfriend. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1978,"I am easy to get distractions and bad time management. While studying at home or wherever, there be more distractions than usual, especially with family and I have two younger siblings around, and it makes time management becomes more challenging. Also, it is hard to get stay motivated.  There's no more other places for a learning environment than school, finding the motivation to get started on coursework is difficult.  Because I don't see my home as a working space.  At the beginning of the online course, people are adapting to unfamiliar technology, students, and professors. All of us have had to learn to use technology in the last couple of months."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1985,"Online classes made it harder for me to be the best student that I can be. I felt a lot less motivation to get things done as a result of online learning because it made me feel very unattached to the things I was doing. At first it was easier to fall behind, because you basically are jumping between 6 different web pages worth of content to look at, and so much of what I do is not even inside of class. It's also harder to pay attention in class due to the fact that there are many distractions present at home and much more responsibilities. So yes online learning made learning harder but in a way it also made me stronger. This semester I put the other two behind me and saw a chance and took it. I feel like I am doing my best in the new school environment created for me and I'm managing my time very well. What I do for my self care is I sleep more often and I go to bed early when I can in order to feel the most rested or even wake up early to be more productive or get things I need for myself that require more time, like breakfast. I also do my assignments on time and usually get ahead of them so that I can take days off of school for me to gather myself and kick back or go out. My main concern for my learning is will things always be this way or will I have to adapt once more. If so, then be it, I think I can become a better student as a result of challenges anyway. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1992,"Online classes have taken a hard hit on me since they started. I do not like learning virtually because of the amount of resources and communication with instructors. We all have technical  difficulties, which I totally understand, but it makes learning, tests, and support, very hard to do.  For self care, I make sure to get out of bed every morning because sometimes it can be tough. I also make sure to take walks or go outside, while making sure to stay hydrated at all times. One day a week I do absolutely nothing related to school and take the time to spend with friends or do other responsibilities. The only concern I have for myself is the amount of screen time zoom takes. It is very bad on eyes and creates lots of headaches and neck pain. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1979,"Honestly, I think that online classes definitely hindered my learning of my courses by a long shot. I feel like I lost most of my knowledge of the course if I didn't take notes after the semester is over and I'm just hoping that we can finally get over this pandemic and get back to regular classes because I hate learning online as it doesn't really help me out in the long run. I think I'm doing alright with self-care though as I find myself doing whatever I can do to pass all of my classes. The only concern I really have for my learning is for classes where you should really be in person how should you deal with it? I find that math for me should be in person because if not I feel that I lose all information and feel that I won't retain it as easily as other classes that were actually in person."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1981,"There are multiple benefits of online courses, for example, students can enjoy high-quality teaching resources that are not usually available. The teaching links are arranged tightly, the content is substantial, and the teaching methods such as multimedia are fully used to increase students' interest in learning. The teaching video can be played in a loop, which is beneficial to students who have problems in understanding during the learning process and can be observed multiple times. However, there are disadvantages of online courses: If students are not strong in self-discipline, they will use the opportunity of listening to online classes to play mobile games. Students do not have time to read texts, think about questions, and most of them show reference answers, which tends to restrain students' thinking. There is a lack of time and space for teacher-student interaction, and there is no way to communicate in time for the generation of students."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,186,"I have had many ups and downs with online coursework as often times it becomes more of a chore to plan to do school and school work, where as prior to the pandemic, I had a mixture of both online and in person coursework that kept me engaged with college and peers. The physical presence of a classroom only helps a student as me who is not the best at self motivating myself until it becomes too late. My self care has just been to look away from my screen as often as possible but that is never too easy. I have picked up a more analog hobby in film photography that has become an outlet but even that I rarely can practice due to time conflicts. My biggest concern with learning is that I learn best when I am under pressure and it can be hard to create an environment of learning in my home. I can not wait to be back in a classroom next semester and be responsible to be present."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1989,"Online classes as a whole have impacted me in how I learn and what precautions I am taking. Since we have switched to online learning the transition was really hard for me. I went from being able to interact with classmates and get tutoring to being stuck at home and staring at my computer screen for hours. Being online I am still faced with some hardships like getting accessible tutoring, understanding concepts, meeting classmates, and collaborating on study groups. Online classes have made it very hard for me to interact with others and mostly understand the material that is being taught. When learning through the online computer screen I feel I have so much going on at once and for long periods of time the screen eventually gets boring and I lose focus. Some concerns for myself is whether I will be able to transition back to in person classes and learning as the pandemic comes to an end. I have spent so much time trying to fit in and change to online that I don’t know what it will be like when I come back to in person classes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,305,"Online classes haven't affected my learning too much aside from the PHYS 230 course since the lectures in my class are pre-recorded. For self-care, I make sure to take breaks often so that I am able to focus better when I come back to my computer. My only concern for my learning is that I am not retaining the information from PHYS 230 well enough since there is a lot of information and concepts to digest and I'm also very busy with other classes and work as well. I feel like I just need more practice with each week's concepts. The homework for my other classes gives me a lot of practice and the lectures consist of the professor going over examples of each week's concepts which helps me a lot."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1991,"Online classes have enhanced my learning experience. With everything being virtual, I have more time since I do not need to commute to school for classes. Also, with recorded lectures, I have more flexibility in my schedule. I think a con of online learning is that I can get a little too comfortable in my own house. I’m so close to my bed and I also want to lay on it. I can get easily distracted and open another tab to watch youtube instead of focusing on the class. In terms of self care, I need to remind myself to reach out to friends more. If I do not regularly see my friends, I will get lonely and sad. Sometimes, I will go out to get food with friends or just call them on Discord in order for me to remain sane. Overall, online learning has its pros and cons, but I enjoy it more than in person classes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1993,"I feel like I understand class a bit more with online classes.  I do still need to see an instructor and have the option to ask questions.  I would say my best style of learning is with and instructor but online.  What I am doing for self care is spending time with family with I can squeeze some time in.  Also the crabbing season is about to start and I am very excited for that weekend.  I will be working hard to get all my work done ahead so I can have a good starting weekend on the beach.  My biggest concern is always passing well in my classes. I believe that is my largest concern for both my well being and learning.  I know that with hard work, participation, focus as my guides I will make it to the end of this semester and further."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1983,"Since switching to online learning I feel that it has made it where I need to rely on the notes I take and make sure that I understand what we are looking at because every week we are moving onto different concepts. on the other hand, it has allowed me to focus more time on really understanding each problem as well as giving me more time to get all my work done because i don't need to commute. With that, I also feel like I have more time to keep myself occupied such as working out and doing other activities  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1986,"Online classes have impacted my learning by making me pay attention in class less when I am tired which then makes me look at the recorded lecture on my own time when I am awake to have concepts going into my head, interacting and meeting people less because breakout rooms over Zoom does not feel the same when we are in person, and not getting the full concept because it is hard to communicate with the teacher if the teacher just wants to go through the lecture fast because they want us to cover everything that we need to know or learn, but teachers having office hours definitely helps a lot. What I am doing for self-care is finishing up all my homework as fast as possible so that I can spend time with my family and my dog, workout, take walks, talk to friends over phone because of quarantine, and do chores around the house. Concerns I have for my learning and well-being is that I will get uninterested in the topic in class and will doze off during the day because of having to learn online which is adding more screen time to what we had before which is doing homework on the screen and going on social media or watching shows/movies on our screens."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1982,"The pandemic has brought wrath upon everyone in the world. Many people have lost their lives because of it. Time halted for a while. It was very scary to go outside. But, as we all know, the show must go on. Despite the pandemic learning process can not be stopped. And the advancement of the technology helped immensely during the pandemic to keep the work and school keep going. Online classes have played a vital role in students lives amid the COVID-19. Online classes helped to keep student safe from the virus while pushing the learning activities from home. However, we as students are missing a lot while learning online from our home. The hands-on experience, group-work, interaction with other students and the classroom environment are some key things I am missing during this online classes. On the other hand it is more time-effective in my opinion. Because we can save the time to commute, be ready to go to school. For-self care, I like to do some exercises, meditation, breathing exercises, listen music."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1980,"Online learning has impacted my learning mainly by using the resources I have compared to when I was on campus I use to go to the tutors that were available on campus. It has been different going to the office hours online via zoom compared to being in the class room in person. I have adapted to being on zoom and having all of my classes online. It has taught me to be more manageable with the time that I have. What I do for self care is to try and take some time away from my screen and go for long walks or go to the gym to relieve any stress I may have. I try to enjoy the time I have to myself by watching television shows, anime, or playing videogames with friends. The concerns I have for my learning would be ensuring that I understand the material and making sure that I have time to study and always take good notes to help me with my courses during the semester."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,603,"Online classes have impacted my learning significantly when it started because when virtual classes started I was struggling to keep up with my classes and struggling to stay focused on my lectures. In online classes, the class that I failed during the first semester of online classes was a class that I can easily pass when we are in person and that Is Math Calculus 1 class it was too hard for me to pay attention in class while looking in my computer. Online classes also affected my health because I would stay on the computer all day during the first months of online classes well I gained a lot of weight my max weight was 260 pounds but this year 2021 is when I changed myself around May instead of just sitting here all day in my room I do exercise daily for 1-3 hours depending on my homework and I lost around 30 pounds I am around 230. What works for me now is to do exercise and to keep everything off my table that can distract me now I pay attention to my classes and I do my work on my time I adapted to online classes and make a good sleeping schedule that helps me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1990,"World is dealing with covid. In this situation we have managed to study through the modern tools. It is never same as attending the physical class having one to one interaction with professors. I am grateful for our helpful professors as they are trying their best to give best for us. I am a type of student who enjoy studying at home than in class. Even before covid, I used to watch videos and learn. So for me I have realized online class is working well. I am concentrating more in online class than in physical class. It can be different from person to person but for me I am enjoying and also online class cuts the time takes to commute to college as well. I am not only learning from professor lecture but also from different source that has broaden my knowledge. Not limiting myself from classroom I have been enjoying self learning and self care."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1977,"Online classes at first made taking classes more difficult, However as teachers have improved I've adapted more to them. In some cases I would prefer an online class to in person mostly in the classes it works well in. I've been finding physics to be difficult mostly because it is almost entirely all self learning. This is also the first year I've lived away from home so it has been relatively isolating but It has its upsides as well so I can't complain too much. I find that some teachers take advantage of the online learning to kind of completely automate their courses and I think that is disingenuous, past that I feel pretty good about my courses so far."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1984,"Online classes have increased my self care because I am doing everything form home. I am able to be comfortable in my own room and not have to worry about going out or getting sick. Even though I do miss interacting with people and walking around campus, I would like to stay home for another semester and maybe another year. Housing is so expensive and classes are already getting harder. With the added stress of getting groceries and tending to my apartment or dorm with other roommates doesn't seem great for my mental health. Worst case scenario I have to commute to school everyday or when I have class to save money on an apartment. Sometimes I wonder why I had to pick sfsu because the housing is most expensive here in the city compared to other school in california. I am a third year student and plan on graduating 4 more semesters after this fall. Hopefully online school will continue or we will have the option to continue online, or else I will have to commute an hour to school and back home when I have class. Or worse, I will have to spend over $1000 a month for an apartment smaller than my room. "
