2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,603,My goals are to achieve success and achieve success is to graduate as a Civil Engineer this class is helping me learn more about my major and how physics applies to my major also the labs help me communicate with classes which I find very important since my major you would talk with a group of people to talk about projects. My other goal is to communicate more because that is one thing I was always lacking communication during this Pandemic with virtual classes my communication skills went down the drain and now it was really difficult for me to start a conversation in a group meeting in zoom. This class has helped me with my goal because in the labs I started talking more ask questions and use my camera more because I have another class that requires me to be on camera so it helps me communicate more which I appreciate.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1986,"My goals are to graduate college hopefully in three years, find a stable job that makes me happy, and take more time enjoying the Earth and nature by going on walks, hikes, and vacation. This class can help me achieve these goals by getting me ready for future physic classes that I need to take and not just getting a good grade in this and future class, but understanding the concepts taught in these classes will help me understand why and how things work in life which may be related to my future job since I am majoring in Civil Engineer. I never really had a good understanding of physics until now because this class is combining physics and calculus 2 together which helps me much better than learning physics itself since I am good at math and understand math more than physics, but hopefully that will change after taking this class and future physic classes which are also combined with calculus."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1982,"My goals are to finish Bachelor of Degree in Computer Science, learn programming languages like Java, C++ and also learn various Data Structures and Algorithms. After I complete my journey at San Francisco State University I want to have a job in reputed companies like Google, Apple, and Facebook. If not, startups are also fine. Besides academics goals, I also want to learn trading stocks and make successful trades. I am in the learning phase in this sector.This class, Physics 232, is a requirement to finish my Bachelor's Degree. So, it plays an important role to achieve my goals in the upcoming future. I will try to learn as much as possible from both lectures and labs in this class. I am often intrigued by the phenomenon that the object possesses in this universe. I am always curious about how, why, and what causes this kind of phenomenon in this universe. Physics tries to provide the logical reason and the science behind the phenomenon of this physical world."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1981,"Regarding the question of what is my goal, I divide the goals into three categories. The first type of goal is the short-term goal, which is to learn the content of this course and achieve a good result. I need to listen to every lecture of Professor Man and complete all homework on time in advance. Although I know the content of this course is a lot and cumbersome, I should still keep everything organized. The second type of goal is the mid-term goal. I need to successfully graduate from sfsu. I don’t want this goal to be accomplished in a day, it requires me to accumulate for a long time. I need to get good grades not only in this subject, but I also need to continue to work hard in other subjects. The last goal is a long-term goal, it is also my life goal, I need to find a job. And I think this job is likely to be related to my major. So I need to accumulate knowledge in advance to prepare for the future life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1988,"Argh I am so far behind in everything!  I have been thinking quite a lot recently about this very question.  Though the longer I ponder it the further from an answer I seem to be.While I am still uncertain about any big goals, I have made the decision to leave SFSU and California after this term.  I have been accepted into a mech-e program at another university and feel some relief at that and at escaping the CSU.In all honesty I have no clue what I want to do.  I do know that I no longer hold any particular love of engineering, part of the reason I am changing universities; to see if it is the degree or the school which I dislike. Globe hopping for the last year + is becoming quite tiring.  It would/will be nice to be stationary for a while... probably more conducive to quality of focus and good grades as well.  Dealing with different covid restrictions everywhere I go, not able to live a normal life.  These fucking masks!  No real interactions with other people, not because of individual fears, but because of draconian measures mandated by those with a little power and no clear plan of a way out.  Why is a 99.9% vaccinated population still hindered with restrictions?  With the R-naught of SARS-CoV-2 a 75% vaccination rate would allow for herd immunity.  University students also make up the age and health group least likely to suffer serious health issues from infection.  And there is never discussion of a clear goal or pathway out of this, just further infantilizing of young adults.  It is all so tiring.Sorry for the ramble.Hope you are feeling better and not being overwhelmed by the small-child-big-energy dynamo in your home."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1993,My goals are to graduate with my computer engineering.  To do this I must pass this Physics class and lab.  They are requirements for my degree.  Other than that my goals for this class is to take the understanding of how thing interact on a deeper level will be applied for any objects of motion I ever want to create or happen to work on.  That is my main reason for taking this class.  It is very interesting and challenging so I hope to do well and continue on.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1979,"Currently, my goals are passing this class and calc 3 so I can go on to complete my major. Hopefully, I can pass them both with a B but I have to see where I’m at with my skills. I know for sure they connect to the work I’m doing in this class since I’m still using calculus and physics in these labs. Overall these labs make me think about what I have to do if I want to complete my major. Learning electric fields and Gauss’ law definitely relate to this class but I am trying to think how this will eventually relate to computer engineering but I think I will figure that out later on. Honestly, though I think that this class will help me out in the long run as it gives us an understanding of all these topics and helps us learn more about our lecture part of the class as well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1985,"One of my goals is to be successful in my future career. I know that with the tools I have been given and my motivation and desire to work hard, I can be successful in my education. I trust myself to always put my best foot forward, to not let mistakes define me but instead learn from them. I also like to challenge myself because those are moments of growth for people. This class will help me challenge myself to grasp new concepts and practice good study habits and thinking skills. I also think that in this class I can practice problem solving which relates heavily to my major, computer science. Solving problems that we face as a society and finding new creative ways to do so will help us create tomorrow's innovations. I think that helping other people would also be considered one of my major goals too. In my field I know I have the potential to help others and this class is a step towards that. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1992,"My goals are to be successful in the computer science field. I hope to graduate with at least a 3.8 or better because I know these computer science classes and requirements are really tough. My goal is to just pass my classes, which is kind of sad because most college students just pass but don't really learn anything. My goals for this class are to learn and be able to use physics later on in my field. Computer science is a complex field that uses all sorts of STEM basics. I can be using physics to create a program that can find electric currents or such uses. This class will also help in getting me closer to my degree and it is a degree requirement."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1990,"Goal are often changed with time but there are some long term goal that remain for long time until they are achieved or missed. There is always time to restart life. When I came to states I wanted to become Mechanical engineer, but with time my goal was changed. I have learned in Psychology that environment affect everything. May be environment of silicon valley pushed me toward computer science. At this point of life my goal is to graduate as a software engineer. In high school, I did like physics and I am glad that I am learning physics till day. Physics is everything and we are pretty much surrounded with physics so there is no doubt that this class will help me to achieve my goal as a senior software engineer. While developing software I need to implement physics in every calculation. This class will guide me through the practice analysis of the problem so that I can visualize it. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,305,"After I have completed my education at SFSU, I plan on attending graduate school in pursuit of a Ph.D. in Astrophysics. My long-term career goals involve pursuing observational research at institutes like NASA and then teaching at the college or junior college level. I've been inspired to follow in the footsteps of my Astronomy 115 professor, Dr. McCarthy. I loved every day of his class it is what sparked my interest to finally change my major to Astrophysics. I would also like to inspire students to pursue careers in astronomy just like he did to me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1978,"My goal is to enter the STEM field. Because of the growing demand in STEM fields, It is more likely for me to get a job in STEM fields easier than in other areas. The second reason I want to go into the STEM field is that the average salary I can make in STEM fields is higher than others.  According to the research, as of Aug 25, 2021, the average annual pay for the STEM jobs category in San Francisco is $54,281 year. That works out to be approximately $26.10 an hour. This is the equivalent of $1,044/week or $4,523/month. High pay makes everything better and makes my life easier.  This class can help me achieve this goal because this class is one of the required classes of the computer science major."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1977,"I hope to get a good grade in this class so I can continue my computer science degree. This class can further my goal for a CS degree by its completion. I think many skills and information that I learn in this class, while very interesting at quite niche and will not make a huge difference in my career in software. There are some aspects that I think can help me, knowledge about circuits and movement of electricity is both interesting and mildly applicable as computing at its foundation is circuitry. This is my first year at SFSU, I think this class helps to assist my understanding in physics in a way that previous physics lab class have not. I like that this course seems to be more focused on creating better understanding of physics, rather than strictly completion and demonstration of the concepts. This is very helpful as the physics lecture professor I currently have is relatively absent from teaching these concepts."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,186,"My goals specific to this class mainly include strengthening concepts I learned in the lecture portion, and also being able to apply the concepts in real work situations with data. Although with the pandemic, more of the hands-on stuff have now become videos or pHet simulations, but in the process I found the virtual tools to be quite informative such as those simulation websites that have concepts broken down to game like detail. I also liked how the lecture portion of this class prior to our experiments really helped me understand both the experimental procedure while strengthening knowledge on theories and formulas. My goal is to walk out of this course with the foundations for my engineering degree and so far this class has helped me engage in the material."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1989,"Some of my goals within this current physics class is to try and fully understand most topics of the foundation of physics and apply that to the next physics class. As the future physics classes build off from the previous ones, my goal would be to know as much as I can know and try my best in remembering and applying all concepts to different scenarios and fully mastering these topics. By knowing and mastering the current physics class I am able to build off of my current knowledge on physics and go beyond learning more every time. To achieve this I will have to spend a great amount of time learning and practicing these concepts while also working in groups with others. By working with others I can learn from their perspectives which I wouldn’t normally see and get a different view of how they think and understand these concepts. This class can help me achieve my goal of mastering and understanding most concepts of physics by dedicating time and learning slowly with others. If I make a good group of classmates and friends I will be able to learn with them and focus on mastering the topics of various chapters."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1980,"One of my short term goals are to pass this class as well as my others so that I can continue to pursue my long term goal of graduating from college with my bachelors in computer science. Passing this class will help me achieve these goals as it is an requirement needed in order for me to get my bachelors degree. This class will also assist me in problem solving which is a skill that is needed to not only pass this class, but to pursue my career as a software engineer. In order to be a software engineer I will need to have problem solving skills which will be needed to work with others as a team and complete any work objectives. Prior to graduating I plan on getting an internship as a software engineer, It will help me get a better understanding as to what it is like to work on projects with others at a company. It will also help me with getting my foot in the door as having that experience looks very good on paper. My long term goal is to work for a major company as a software engineer after graduation and to pursue my masters degree and become a senior software engineer within a few years. As I reach closer towards my goals I try my best to just takes things one day at a time and try not to overwhelm myself with too much. I also try to not be so hard on myself when things do not go as planned and to try and continue with pursuing my goals. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1975,"One of my goals for this semester is to pass my classes and also be able to understand what I have learned from each of my classes. This class helps to achieve this goal by giving me a better understanding of the concepts that I am learning about in my actual Physics class by explaining it in further detail and allowing me to practice what I have learned, which is the best way that I learn. Another goal I have is to get better at understanding and remembering physics concepts, because last semester and even when I took Physics in Highschool, I struggled to be able to remember what I learned and wouldn't be able to apply the concept well, since I couldn't remember it. So this class will defiantly help as It will give me practice and just allow me to reread what I've already learned, so I can actually remember what I learned in Physics."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1991,"I have many goals. A short term goal of mine is to pass all my classes this semester. This class would help with this goal as I would need to pass this class in order to get closer to my goal. A slightly farther goal of mine is to graduate college. I would need to pass this class as well in order to graduate college. Another goal of mine is to become smarter. If I take this class seriously, I can learn a lot and make myself smarter. One of my main goals is to make it into the tech industry and work at a FAANG company. I’m not too sure if this class will help me that much with that goal, but you never know, so I will try my best. I guess you never know when general physics knowledge will be helpful in life, so it's good to just know it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1976,What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?My goals are to become a Civil Engineer. I’m a transfer student & im doing my last three years here at SFSU. This class is one of the requirements. In order for me to continue with my other clases and be able to graduate I need to take physics. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1984,I think my goals at the moment are just to graduate college and live my life. Recently I have been feeling a little lost because I am not sure what I want to do after I graduate. And sometimes I wonder if what I am studying is what I really want to do in life. I know engineering is hard but will pay off in the future but I hope I am happy when it is all said and done. I have been trying to live in the moment more especially with school because it is going so fast. I think I am getting better at that. I think this class is helping me achieve this goal because it is part of the roadmap of getting a engineering degree. I am also learning more about the real world through the class and making some new connections with teachers and student along the way. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,7,1983,"One of my top goals is to graduate so this class helps me work towards this goal. Additionally, this class will also help in my future career because we will use or reference some of the topics that we will go over. Aside from that, I believe that I will be able to meet people that have similar interests or goals and be able to create connections with eachother."
