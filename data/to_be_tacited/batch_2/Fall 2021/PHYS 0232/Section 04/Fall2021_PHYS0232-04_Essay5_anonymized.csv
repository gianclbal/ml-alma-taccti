2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1914,"My greatest take away from this class was definitely coding mathematical sage and learning about circuits and potential. It was a better experience in lab then in my normal physics class because this just felt more hands on. I love how our professor teaches - I feel like she is very considerate on if we actually understand what's going on. Being very honest, I was lost during our circuits units but - it turned out being one of the most fun and cool things I learned! As I was a child, I always wanted to learn how to use a breaker panel which controls everything in our house. And with this class - I learned the functions of it and more! I truly took a lot away from this physics class, I felt like it made the real world make a lot of sense."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1899,"The greatest take away from this class is that learning can be a fun experience. Sure I haven't done the labs in person, but even then, this class is still fun. By implementing an interactive learning experience, any student can fully understand and learn any material. There just needs to be a concept like this for  getting a job, working out, handling responsibilities, and etc. Fall break is coming next week and I just want to use that time to self innovate and take time to explore myself, but now I can understand why many people hate the educational system because it robs people of so much time they could have done if they have direction and ambition to do something already. For example, the physics class I am in (concurrently taken with this one), assigns a lot of work! I understand the need to compact the learning material to adapt to online learning but when so much work is given it crosses a certain threshold where the homework is no longer helpful because you are focusing more on finishing the assignments rather than doing it. My experience with this school is what I have expected so far and I am glad that it doesn't deviate from that."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,801,"I think my greatest take away from this class would have to be the hands-on information we learned and talked about. Because I am going into a field of computers and/or electricity and circuits, it is important to me to be experienced with hands-on circuits for many reasons. One, because this is what I will be doing during a profession, and it is a good way to get experience with this stuff. And also because it helped me learn about circuits and electricity in a way that a lecture didnt. So one of my biggest takeways was definitely the experience with work-like experiments. I think working with people is also a good one. I will have to work with a lot of people in computer science and this was good practice with that as well as experience. This class helped me in many ways improve my levels of skill in physics, as well as get me ready for the work place."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1030,"During this class we learned a lot of great things. From positive and negative charges, and how they are effecting each other and various objects. We have electric fields, current, voltage, where we practices with batteries and different types of resistors. How much energy gets used or how slow it effects with how many different resistors you have within a series or a parallel. I enjoyed doing different type of resistors and seeing how the current and voltage is effect with the amount and how strong or low the resistors are. It was really interesting having the simulation as well because it helped a lot to see how it really works"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1902,"My greatest takeaway from this class is the importance of working together with the group to get through labs. Being able to communicate and work with one another makes it easier to get through the challenging sections of the lab. Not only is it important to have the skill to communicate in this lab class, but it could be an incredibly beneficial skill after college and in our careers."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1901,"This class felt like an in-person class due to the breakout rooms. I got to make some friends thanks to this class. The group work ensured all of us understood what we were doing. Before we went into the breakout room, the brief introduction was short and engaging; at times, some topics were covered first at the lab introduction and then in my physics 230 class, making me learn the concept even better at class. Overall this was an engaging class, and the structure of this class was very good. Concepts were explained really well and in the best way possible, and group discussions in breakout rooms helped straighten our understanding. I would say my greatest take away was the friends "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1917,My biggest takeaway from this class how to do with the structure and planning it took to take this course rather than the course itself. Of course the lab helped me understand what we learned in lecture more efficiently by showing me how to apply the rules and concepts to problems. Where the class helped me the most was really with time management. Out of all my courses I have the lowest grade in this class. It is well deserved as I neglected the work in this class for the first 3 weeks. It made me notice I have to stay on top of my course work. Which I tried to do. But if it weren't for this class and its grade I may not have been able to realize that I needed to step it up. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1900,"I think what I most learned from this class is to apply what we have known to explore those we are not familiar with since some of the experiments are essential to the knowledge taught in the lecture. It would be difficult for us to have a profound understanding merely being showed how to solve the questions rather than knowing how it works. However, with the help of the easy experiments, we could not only know the function and the principle, but also form a general idea about why it exists in our daily life. For me, the tough part of the physics is that we could not visualize it such as gravity force or magnetic force but we do realize they exist. In this class, I think it is interesting to do the experiments to help us learn further, perhaps it would be fun to the physical ones, but the applications are really helpful as well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1908,my greatest takeaway from this class is time management. Before I took this class it was hard for me to manage what was required of me in my other past semesters. At the start of this course it was difficult to manage the amount of work in this course but eventually I was able to break the work down into smaller sections and use this as a template or a guide for my other courses. As we usually have four assignments or more to do for one lab day I discovered it was necessary for me to allocate time towards certain sections of the lab in order to complete it and other course work. I do the same when it comes to my programming courses. I take an early look at the assignments and break the assignment into sub sections and complete those sections throughout the week. I learned that it is easier and more stressful than waiting until the last few days to attempt an assignment and I believe this skill will assist me in my future career choice. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1906,"My greatest take away from this class would honestly probably have to be how to use cocalc. I found that specific lab the most useful throughout the year since it implemented some coding but it also helped with math equations and graphing the equations.  Since I am a computer science major, its important to understand how to write code and understand the syntax on cocalc. I would also say that learning about magnets were somewhat interesting as a topic but it didn't leave as much as a lasting impact as the cocalc coding lab assignment. My thoughts of this entire semester for this class was that it was alright due to there being some coding that was part of this class. My initial reaction for this class being recommended was that it was weird but now that I took it, I could somewhat see how it was justified as a requirement."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1907,"My greatest takeaway from this class is a better understanding of how I learn best. I really like how this class is structured. We start with a lecture and slideshow, then we get to work with our groups on the actual lab, and later, we do a post lab knowledge check. The lecture and slideshow are really helpful in giving some initial background information on the topic of the lab. We go over key concepts, formulas, and laws that we will encounter throughout the lab. I like being given/shown this information before we start the actual lab because when I encounter the terms, I already have a good idea of what they mean. When we work with our groups, it is nice to have peers there to support you and answer any questions that we may have. It also makes me feel more comfortable to ask questions because we are in a smaller group. Finally, the post lab knowledge check is the final step in ensuring that we understood the concepts discussed and explored throughout the lab. I found that I learn the best when actually seeing the lab/doing the labs in a simulation. I am grateful that this class has helped me find where I learn the best. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1912,"My greatest takewaway from this class is that each physics concept that we discuss in the lecture has applications that we can see in real life. In the lecture it is easy to ignore what we are learning really looks like, and what it can be used for. In this class we took those ideas and either in a simulation or real-world experiment, we saw how physics can be applied to our lives, instead of just solving math equations. The experiments that I enjoyed the most was our unit that explored electricity and how that applies to our life. We use electronics everyday and before this class I really had no idea how circuits worked and what was required for every household appliance we take for granted. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1913,"I think the greatest takeaway from this class is connecting some concepts of different classes together. I've already learned about circuits in past classes, but now I've learned how to identify more information from currents such as flow. There are also multiple calculus concepts that were applied in this class, which helps remember things better with these connecitons."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1910,"I would say my greatest take away from this class is the use of simulations and real life application of actual physics. When things are just based in theory or can be read in a textbook, it is a lot of the time hard to grasp the concepts. But when you can add an interactive element to it is where it gets alot easier to comprehend. With the simulation, I can get a better idea of something as well as play around with the values and the numbers, and with an actual experiment, I can get hands-on experience."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1905,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that it showed me that I still have a lot to learn. Entering this class I thought that I wouldn’t learn anything new from my last physics class but I was wrong. I learned the most in circuits. By doing the hands-on lab I was able to visually see how the wire reacted when they were touched when connect to the batteries. The simulation in the course also helps a lot since I’m more of a visual learner. I learn from the hands-on projects that I was able to learn more with everyday materials from my house. It help me enjoy much of the sections that were covered especially when we made a magnetic with the battery, coils, and bolt. I also enjoyed the voltage section due to learning how parallel and series circuits affect the voltage in a circuit. It will come useful to me when I enter the electrical field and have to make sure that my voltage doesn’t drop."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1915,"My greatest take away from this class is that I loved learning about the new materials such as Potential, Flux and Gauss's Law, Electric field, Charge, etc because it gave an insight of how these concepts are used to connect to the real world and how much they adapt to society. I enjoy being in this course a lot because it is such an engaging course where you get to learn much more about Physics and do group activities with your classmates on the materials that you studied in class. Another thing I liked was doing the assignments because you get to do some experiments with simulations and even create some projects in your own. One thing I would say though is that I miss being in the lab course in person because they're a lot more engaging than being in online but due to worldwide circumstances, it is what it is. I do hope that one day that we can get back to do labs in person."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1897,"Before the beginning of this semester, I thought this course was going to be about how physics can relate to our daily lives. After going deeper into the semester, I suddenly noticed that we are learning about something that is way more interesting than I was expected to learn. During the first half of the semester, we get to interact with different types of battery charges circulating around the wires when producing powers onto another place. The lab just demonstrated to me that all of the positive charges can be taken away from the wires when there are enough charges around to fully support the system. My biggest take away from this class is that as long as you spend the time studying about one specific thing you like, there will be no time wasted during the process. The time I spent looking through the information regarding one specific topic really just taught me the skills to always stay focused when studying. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1904,"I would say the greatest thing I can take away from this class is how physics is integrated in our everyday lives. As complicated physics can be after doing the labs and filling out the summary assignments you ask for an example of how the concept for the week is integrated in our everyday lives. I am either able to think of something on the top of my head or look something up and this allows me to be more interested in physics as it is applied to our everyday life without thinking about it. I personally like subjects that are applied to my life because it allows me to see it in action and become more excited about the subject. This also allows me to tell others how certain things work and I could even be able to learn how objects like circuits or magnets work, possibly being able to fix them if they break at home or else where. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1903,"My biggest take away from this class is more practice from what I am learning in lecture. It's a bit hard to visualize the concept, so I am glad that this class can show/visualize what is being taught. I am usually confused during lecture so labs and simulations make it a bit easier to understand and know how to apply it to everyday life.  Besides physics, from being in this class I have learned more about time management. I always struggle with procrastination but with my schedule this year I have learned how to manage my time and work on my assignments efficiently. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1916,"My greatest take away from this class is that everything that we take for granted in society has become that way thanks to physics. With powerplants we had to create a giant battery and rc circuit with millions of parallel circuits to each house and building through underground systems, our newer models of phones and accessories use magnets and precise engineering and coding to work in our convenience, and we were able to learn about forces that can't be seen with the human eye. Physics applies to everything that makes our lives how it is today. If humanity had never learned about physics, we might have not even learned how to make houses, let alone discover fire. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1911,"I think my greatest takeaway from this class was being able to work on time and being able to work as a team with my lab group. I think working as a group has helped me in other classes to work as a group in some projects that I had in other classes, by learning to work as a group I got more comfortable working with other people that I had met for the first time, and doing that makes me more comfortable meeting new people for the first time and beginning to work with them. Also, the dates on getting things in on time have helped me to manage with assignments to turn them in on time, and even though you don’t feel like working that day and don’t have the energy it made me learn that you just have to keep going in order to get what you want and no matter how much energy you have that day or what may be going in your life, those are the takeaways so far in this class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1898,"This class has helped me a lot to understand actively the topics that I have seen in Lecture which this semester was an asynchronous class for me which make it more difficult to learn due to the fact that I have a job and I am not really good at time management. Ilearn labs were my favorite thing to do even though that weren't a lot of them, the few that I did were very straightforward and relatively easy to do in comparison with the pdf labs where I spend most of my time editing the pdf than doing the work which was not very engaging to do. I really appreciate my instructor this semester for being very understanding of my situation and flexible, I hope all instructors were like her. In addition, the topics that we saw were very well explained by her. I am looking forward to have a lab like this again next semester. "
