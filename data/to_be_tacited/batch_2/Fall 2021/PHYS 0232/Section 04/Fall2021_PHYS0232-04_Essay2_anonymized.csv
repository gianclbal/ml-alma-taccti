2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1899,"It helps to be in labs when I need to keep in touch with students and practice cooperation for future careers/jobs. My goals are straightforward: develop great knowledge in the architectures of computer science. It takes more than just school to help me achieve these goals but I just need more time (which is hard to come by). I think this class, much like my other classes, will help teach my how to manage time better. More specifically, working on assignments needs proactive thinking to be efficient. Once I am able to achieve the goals I can finally balance the workload much better. I know that there is not much to discuss but there are too many things to worry about and too little things I can really do in terms of time so I am stuck with a five hour sleep cycle and a really overwhelming schedule to balance and it will be my greatest challenge to finish it all."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1901,"My goal is to graduate on time, and physics is a requirement for my major. I understand the importance of understanding everything I learn in physics 230 and 232 as it helps me better understand computer science and a lot more in life. Doing experiments as a group is something that we do only in lab classes, which has helped me understand concepts well. I want to make the most out of this class and understand everything we do thoroughly. This class will help me gain more confidence in my ability to solve physics problems, even in 230. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1900,"I am yearning for having a profound understanding of each concepts we learned in the lecture. For me, physics is harder to see even it exists in the daily life, thus, it would be take longer to understand how the idea makes sense and how to solve the questions based on the knowledge. The lab experiments as long as the online programs help me to visualize what we learned so that it is easier to study. Besides it, even though online classes cause that we hardly do the lab with the group mates, it is better to share the idea with others. I hope in this class, with the idea brought by scientists, with the explanation taught by the professor, and with the help of students, I could have more fun in the physics."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1908,"A few of my goals include but are not limited to: obtaining a Bachelor’s Degree from SFSU, finding a consistent and interesting career in either software development or web development, getting married, starting a family, purchasing a house. I believe a lot of my classes will help me develop great skills for the first milestone on this list, however, strongly believe that studying physics, (something that I didn’t enjoy too much early on in school), will stimulate my brain even further. I believe the concepts which we as students learn in physics alter the way we think and how we approach problems. I am a visual learning so the physics labs will increase my understanding. I also believe that physics lecture and lab will grow my critical thinking, analysis, and problem-solving skills. I really enjoy being able to take skills from other classes and put them in action in several courses or in my life. The simulations we encounter and the post lab knowledge checks ensure that I am learning and when I do some programming  homework I really try to take a step back and spend more time thinking about the problem other than the solution"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1915,"My goals are to get good grades in all my Computer Engineering classes, general Ed classes and more in order to get my required credits to graduate, not only that I plan on applying for an internship based on my major and also volunteer in some engineering clubs.  To achieve my goals, I need to study the materials that I am given in the lectures for the quizzes/midterms/ final exams, ask my professors questions if I'm confused on anything, and do the assignments on time. As for the internships, I will research many tech companies that specializes on software engineering or data security, and if I like any of them, I will apply. I will also ask my professors and advisers from my major about the companies work environment and such. I plan to join the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers because I'm interested to become part of the Engineering community and I like to volunteer in special events that the club offers; the club also offers details about scholarships and internships."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1030,My goals for college is to graduate. I want to be able to graduate and with the knowledge I have learned over the years of studying I want to be able to take the knowledge I learned and take the things I learned and be able to use it for whatever job I land once I do graduate. This class will help me because I need to learn physics in order to do the work that I want to do. I am hoping to be able to work in some sort of robotics company once I graduate and I will need to know my physics in order to that. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1913,"I think this class helps with problem-solving. We as students have learned multiple tools from different kinds of classes. This class takes many different concepts and uses them to come up with ways to reach a solution. This process can be rough sometimes, but having teammates that can help when you get stuck. All of these process together helps to further remember different concepts. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1910,"My most recent goals are to graduate from University and hopefully already be interning at a tech company. My goals aren’t completely specific yet when it comes to where I would like to intern at, but I’m sure this class can help me succeed with my goals. Having any basis in physics is good for my field of work, so being able to think like a physicist would be very helpful with any career path I take inside of the field. I also think the work load that physics and this lab gives me will also help me being to be better with my study habits, because this class is no joke at all. If I am not paying attention I have no idea what the heck is going on. I skipped class one day for physics, I came back and it felt like they were speaking a foreign language. It was bad. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1902,"One of my most important goals is to graduate college with a degree. My current one being Electrical Engineering, I would have to put in the work to understand the topic and to be able to have the discipline to study if needed. Small steps such as looking for assistance from either the instructor or outside help will benefit me and my studies. For this class specifically, it will help me with my understanding of physics which may play a big role in helping me comprehend my degree. Since it is in the STEM field, physics is necessary for me to continue down this course too. Not only will the physics class strengthen my understanding of the topics, but it can also help me with my critical thinking and my ability to apply mathematics to a physical problem. Being able to think through and solve problems is an important skill in the field that I am studying in. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1905,My goals are to be able to graduate college with my electrical engineering degree and be able to find a stable job to support my future family. Growing up my family has always struggled financially so I never asked for anything because I knew my parents needed to save. I would always decline when they ask me if I wanted new shoes or if I wanted some toys. During christmas they would fill the tree with a lot of presents and I knew that they had to work hard just to save a little more money to be able to afford all of these. But now that I'm older I work long shift hours and take care of my siblings so my parents can focus on rent and car payments. I now buy them clothes and take them out to eat. But with the help of this class I’ll be able to understand the physics behind everyday situations that will help me create new ideas and be able to get paid more. The more I understand physics I can create blueprints of electrical devices that will work without failing any test. It will help me gain more knowledge to get a better paying job to help repay my parents. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1903,"My goal is to get all my credits and graduate within four years. After undergrad, I want to go to dental school. I guess in a way this course will not specifically help me in that field but I know that this class can teach me organization and time management. With this class’s assignments and due dates will help me to work on not procrastinating and to be on top of my work. My upcoming goal right now is to be successful this semester and to pass all my classes with an A. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1897,"When I was little, I set a goal for myself to complete in the near future. My goal is to become a software engineer one day after I graduate from college. I’ve always been interested in the technology field ever since I was a kid, therefore becoming a software engineer is for sure in my bucket list. This class can help provide  the knowledge I need in order to further prepare myself for the real world challenge as I will come across many physics related hard tasks. By knowing some physics knowledge, it will help put me a step in front of everyone that doesn't have this skill set. For programming, physics is heavily needed as every programmer does rely on their computers in order to process code. In other words, having the physics knowledge in their mind can help them fix their broken computer once they encounter such situations. This physics is also a must take for some programmers in order to help set themselves up for success in the near future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1907,"This is my second year of college and I feel like my goals and aspirations have already changed so much throughout the last couple of years. I remember when my goals for the future used to consist of working for NASA or becoming a Disney Imagineer. As of right now, my main goals would be to do well in school and graduate with all of the tools necessary to be successful in the real world. Instead of having my mind set on such a large scale goal, I am learning to set small, achievable goals first. Another overall goal that I want to work towards is becoming a better problem solver both in the classroom and in the real world. Of course, classes like this along with the math classes that I am taking are helping me achieve this goal by literally working through word problems. However, I also want to focus on becoming a better problem solver in life. I have realized that the hardest, yet most rewarding types of problems to solve are the ones that do not have an easy solution or a known solution at all. I feel like solving these types of problems is what being an engineer consists of. In this class particularly, my goals are to understand the material and be able to apply the concepts and ideas to the real world. Practicing problems will help me to build up my problem solving skills and be able to apply them to subjects and issues beyond the classroom. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1916,"My goals are to learn how gravity and distribution of energy works. I want to have an accurate understanding of how these work because when I was growing up, I wanted to be a video game developer. With these understandings of physics and how things work, I can create realistic games with accurate object collision, gravity, and breaking objects when met with the right amount of force. Many games only use polygons that brush up together and do nothing but stop each other, but I want there to be a game where the immersion is one of its best features. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1912,"My goal and desired career path is to be a pilot, and I am well on my way, my private pilot checkride is this Thursday. This class will be very beneficial for me to achieve this goal. Along with knowing how to fly the plane it is important (and required) to know how it works, which is all physics. I have already seen some overlap in what I know about the electrical system in the plane I fly with what we are learning in the lecture and lab. This class will help me better understand my career field and help me pass the required checkrides for the different ratings."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1917,"One of my goals is to get more done over the semester. What I mean by this is I want to be more productive in my day to day life. This means waking up early everyday at the same time, attending all my classes and meeting deadlines for school, work etc. Time Management is something this class helps me improve because I know I need to make time for it. To be honest this is the class I am most behind in. It should not be an issue as I am willing to try harder. With productivity comes not just the time I have to make for it but I have to make sure the quality of the work I am doing is exceptional. When I am in class I don’t want to be just watching, I should be more involved & interactive with the course. I want to stretch my focus to it’s limit so that the quality of work being done can make up for the lack of time I may need to spend on it. This class is difficult for me, which is the reason it’ll help me with my goals. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1914,"My goals in life are to be a computer scientist. I want to become a software developer, cyber security analyst, or something with IT. I believe the steps to achieve my goals are right in front of me - an Education. With my BS degree from SFSU and my masters (at wherever it might be) I will be able to receive all the knowledge I need in order to be persistent. This class can help me achieve a lot. Not only does it help me understand real life situations but, with the knowledge I get in Physics with Calc 2 is a list that goes on and on. With this classes knowledge, I get a sneak peak of not only my major but other majors in the STEM field. Such as, biology, engineering, statistics, structures, etc. With calculus in physics, we are able to calculate things such as unsolved solutions and/or predictions of the future (what will happen next, how can we prevent it from occurring). With this class, I will have a direct impact and connection on my goals and work in this course. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1906,"Well, when it comes to what my goals are in my life, I would like to become a software engineer. I am currently majoring in computer science and I would love to get any job in that field. Being able to work in a field that I like would be a dream come true and it would help accomplish my goal in life. This class is actually one of the prerequisites for a computer science major so I am required to take this class and pass in in order for me to achieve my goal. This class isn't directly related to computer science but the idea is that it helps with critical thinking and that is something that is a requirement for software engineers. This class basically force me to think on my toes on how to solve complicated problems given various scenarios. I believe if I pass this class and continue on my journey to achieving my goal, I will be successful in doing so."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1911,"My goal in this class and like every class is to learn something new that I could use in the future. Everything that we learn has some meaning and use to us. For people like me, that is a computer science major, it's required for us to take physics. I’ve always liked physics and I’ve always loved learning about physics ever since middle school when I took my first science class. It was always something new to learn and use in the real world. I knew that ever since that moment that I wanted to learn about sciences and I have been. What my goals are is to learn as much as I can because I love learning about anything and I think that knowledge really is precious to all of us and the more we learn, the more it will benefit all of us towards the future. Many may not feel the same about how knowledge is precious, but knowledge really is the highest value."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,801,"I have a couple of goals. One is to finish college with good grades and a high GPA, the other is to get a job in computers. Although I do not know what I want to do with computers yet, I know I will be working with them either on the software side or the hardware side. If I go towards hardware, this course will help me a lot because of all of the information about electricity and circuits. This is one of the main courses for the major because of all the essential information in it for computer engineering, so I believe it will help a lot. Even if I go into software, this class will help me because of all of the information about the universe. Physics is a way to interpret and understand how the world works, and I believe that is important going into any field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1909,"In my previous classes with goal reflections, I said that my goals were to get my BA in computer science and become a video game designer for a well-known company like Riot Games or Bungie. After many semesters of online classes due to the pandemic, I reflected on my goals and while my motivation has gone down a lot, I still have some intentions of being a video game designer. My loss of motivation is due to the isolation from my peers and professors while also not being able to have social interactions organically and having to force myself to talk to others just to finish work. Regardless, this class will help me achieve my goal by helping me learn some concepts of physics that may aid me in my future field of work while also completing a required class for credit. I hope that this pandemic dies down and we can come back for in-person classes so that I can regain my lost motivation. "
