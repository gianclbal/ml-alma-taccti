Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1897,"When I was a kid back in China, I was already really interested in discovering how technologies function as a whole. At a young age, I’m already reading books that are related to the fundamentals of computers. Now that I’m in college, I decided to enter the STEM field due to various reasons. First, the STEM field offers a lot of courses that can help me further understand the world of technology. Compared to other fields, I think the STEM field is the only field that would make me feel challenged due to the large amount of math and physics courses you have to complete. The road of the STEM field really feels challenging, but I’m the type of person that loves overcoming challenges. By selecting the STEM field, it really motivates me to stay focused at all times because once you fall behind it is really hard to catch back up to the pace you are hoping to stay at.   "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1898,"""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?""When I was in High School, in my Junior year to be specific, I started to think about what I wanted to do when I am older. I was not sure about what I wanted to  be honest, I enjoyed biology and chemistry classes but when I had to do reports is when I hated it so I thought that it was not for me. English class was definitely not either  because I rather spend four hours doing math than reading a book or writing essays for something that I do not consider worthy. I talked about it with my counselor and she encouraged me to join a coding program called Mission bit. I was hesitating about going because I did not know what coding was and thought it would be boring but since they were going to pay me $300 I decided to give it a chance, I mean, I was going to get paid for learning new things so I was totally sold. The goal of the program was to code either a video game or website from scratch and they taught us the most important things first and gave demos which were fascinating for me, that is when I realized that I wanted to become a software developer or video games creator. When I got to SF State, I quickly made my choice of majoring in Computer Science to hopefully, some day, become an app developer. Despite taking hard classes, I am still determined to follow this path."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1899,"Why did I want to go into the STEM field? I feel like it was because I am more confident in my math than I am with english. The SAT really set me straight, showing me why my weaknesses are there and why I can see myself being a technical person. I sometimes imagine each hemisphere of my brain as its separate person. I want to think about who I am as a person during my last years of education because it will determine if I would want to stay in the STEM field or not. I definitely appreciate the science and what is has become today because it takes us to a level of sentience that only our minds can begin imagine. I am a bit of a nihilist though so it really isn't that much of an importance to me. It would just be nice if I could realize what I want so I can contribute more to this humanity."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1900,"What stimulates the culture of human beings is the STEAM fields that contain science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics. In other words, the reason why people should be educated is to learn more about that complicated knowledge that might take time to understand but essential to our life. It does not mean that we could not live without it if we merely care about food, yet it helps us to study and to improve so that we learn how to use tools and words, and then thanks to science, our ancestors even start to create. With the help of technology, people think about convenience and the methods to benefit the life such as electrics, vehicle, and so on. Therefore, I think the importance of the willingness to go into the STEAM field is for our profound thinking and creative ideas."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1901,"I want to pursue computer science because there is immense potential for more advancements and innovation to take place over the following decades. It is so fascinating modern computing is so new, and the advances have happened relatively quickly. I aim to innovate further and contribute my bit to the world with what I learn. I hope I can be part of any advancement or innovation that helps people in any way possible. Physics is the foundation for everything, and computer science is linked to physics in various ways. I always wanted to pursue this path as far as I remember because my dad is in this work area, and he has always been one of my role models. Today I am driven by curiosity and interest. The fact that the history of modern computers is so recent and what we could see in the future, especially with AI, is genuinely fascinating. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1030,"The reason why I wanted to go into the STEM field was because of my family. A good amount of my family majored in the various STEM fields, and growing as a kid I would go to work with them from time to time. During there work I was able to see all the cool stuff they did and it really peeked my interest. Seeing all the work they do, all the innovative tech that will help people in various ways. It inspired me to do the same, I am majoring in computer engineering so that way I hope when I graduate that I will get to work at a company that makes something to help people, and I would love to be apart of something like that. So that is the reason why I wanted to be in the STEM field. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1902,"When I was younger, I used to be obsessed with playing with LEGOs and family members would be surprised to see some of the stuff that I used to make. Initially, I was not the one who came up with the idea of becoming an engineer as it was my family who brought it up to me. So when I thought about it, I would love to have a career where I create things that may have a great impact in human technology. Though it is much different to LEGOs, the idea is still intriguing to me. Another reason I am in the STEM field is because I would be the first in my family to go to college and get a higher education. I want to make my family proud as they have always supported me with the best of their ability. So in the end, my family is the main reason why I chose to go into the STEM field and become an engineer. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1903,"Since I was younger, my strongest subjects in school have always been science and math. My goal in life is to help others in anyway I can, so being involved in the medical field made sense. I specifically want to use my degree to go into dentistry, because I always enjoyed going to the dentist and learning about oral health. In my senior year of high school, I got the opportunity to job shadow at a dentist office and see how they all actually work, since when I go to my own dentist I can't really see how and ask why they do certain things. I do believe that the courses I am taking are beneficial for me and my career choice. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1904,"Why STEM is a difficult question for me because I am not entirely sure myself. As I graduated high school, I did not have any true direction I was just told to continue school and go to college. I did played sports so everyone on the team just wanted to play football in college, so they chose Kinesiology and took the coach’s class. At the time I was not too interested in what Kinesiology offered so I wanted to find something interesting and difficult. I enjoyed math because it just made sense to me, I didn’t have any family members that were engineers, or anything related in STEM. When I got to community college engineering sounded difficult yet rewarding so I just went with it. At this point I can’t see myself switching majors since I’ve done so much but at the same time, I don’t see myself wanting to switch because I know the challenges of the major and I enjoy it. The STEM field itself is difficult but it is fascinating on have the world works around me, without me noticing, that is taught through the courses I take for engineering. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1905,"I want to go into the stem field because in high school I joined a program called Silicon Valley Career Tech Education. It consists of many careers that students can try and gain hands-on experience. One of the classes that they offered was an electrical class. At first I joined it thinking it's going to be the hardest class I ever took but it wasn’t. It was actually the opposite where everything in that class I was able to learn and memorize easily. In the first semester it was hands-on assignments so we had to run wires from switches to lights. But then in the second semester it was books and blueprints work. The blueprints were the easiest part of the class and I had so much fun doing them. This is when I realize going into this career I would actually enjoy my job and not come home saying I don’t want to go to work. Even though I have to take a lot of math classes, I can’t wait to find a job in the electrical engineering career."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1906,"I chose to go into the stem field because I was generally pretty decent at math and it’s a subject that I personally like. Due to enjoying taking math classes and also being really interested in computers, it was a no brainer for myself to choose to go into the stem field. My hobby was playing video games and it kind of turned into a passion where I would like to eventually be able to program a game. Most of the coding classes have prerequisites that requires math and science classes so it just made it much easier for me to choose to go into stem. I also despise writing long essays so joining stem requires no essays to be turned in so its just a win-win outcome. I also personally believe that stem majors are better to go into when you want to get a well-paid job in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1907,"During my junior year of high school was when everyone in my grade was deciding what university and major they wanted to study. For a long time, I had no idea what I wanted to study in college. I had always considered something in the STEM field, but never felt confident enough in my science classes to do so. For a long time, I tried to just find things that I was interested and enjoyed. After a lot of thought, I realized that two things that I enjoyed were solving problems and making/thinking of new things. From this, I decided to study mechanical engineering. There are many varying sub fields to mechanical engineering but as of right now, I do not know exactly what field I would like to go in to. Part of myself would love to go into something with cars or planes as I find both very fascinating, but another part of myself would also be interested in the design portion of new products or applications."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1908,"I want to go into the STEM field because I genuinely enjoy solving problems which take some thought and practice. I believe I could easily join a major where I can get A's on everything for every task or HW assignment, but I don't think those careers in the future would keep my interest and I would eventually get bored. I'm not in college to Ace my way through everything just to get a degree. I'm here to earn a degree which will set me up with an interesting career where my thoughts are accepted, and my skills are tested. Every day I encounter problems in this major (CS) which force me to ask for help and they encourage me to think for myself. I also dislike writing papers just for a teacher to critique my grade. I wouldn't say other majors are meaningless or other fields don't deserve their due respects I just don't see myself doing work soon where I can't incorporate science or technical skills. Ever since I was young all my interest fell into the category of math or science so I thought it would be best to continue those pursuits."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1909,"When I first got into the STEM field, the goal that I set for myself was to become a video game designer and create/build on video games that I really enjoyed. When I got into my first computer science class in college, I was excited to learn my first steps to becoming a video game designer. Despite the struggles that I have faced, I still have the drive to become a video game designer. Video games have always been a part of my life ever since I was young and I have always used them as a way to help me deal with the reality of life. I hope that I will never lose this drive and continue to pursue my dream of becoming the best video game designer that I can be. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1910,"There are a few reasons why I want to go into the Stem field. One of those reasons is because I was always interested in the sciences as a kid, I stayed up watching the science channel or national geographic. I always wanted to learn as a child.  As I got older, I got more interested in computer things and wanted to do a Comp Sci, so I took an AP computer science principles class my senior year, which helped me figure out that I wanted to major in computer Science. Once I started at SFSU and got into my major, I already had a slight sense of what I was getting myself into. But who knew this major was going to be this challenging. So far this journey has costed me a lot of late nights and hours of coding and studying for math exams ( which I very much hate), but I can not give up now. Not in my 3rd year."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1911,"First, my major at SFSU is computer science, the main reason I want to go to the stem field is that I have always been fascinated by science and technology and I have always been good at math. I also think that I enjoy what I’m majoring in and I have a lot of doing what I do in these courses throughout my semesters in SFSU and ever since high school. I’ve grown up around technology for so long and even started coding by the time I was in middle school and built my own computer in high school once I got a job to afford all of the parts of a computer. Science is also been a fun time for me as well, especially physics to be more specific. I had my first physics class in high school and had a great time with and it just seemed to come to me naturally and I hope I have the same experience throughout this course as well. This is what mainly got me into the STEM field and overall I enjoy it a lot."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,140,"I would like to go into stem to learn more about how the world works in a more technical sense. I also want to devote myself to finding new forms of fuel and reversing the effects of decades of pollution. Our movements with electric vehicles are good, but I think in order to make a greater stride our world needs to convert to renewable energy sources. The sooner this source of energy is used is when we don't have to burn anymore fossil fuels, but also won't have to worry about the next gas shortage. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1912,"I chose my major and a stem degree to help me reach my goal of becoming a pilot in the USAF. In high school I knew that I wanted to be a Computer Science major but I was unsure on what I wanted to do with the degree. Then I applied and received a scholarship from the USAF through the reserve officer training program. They are paying for my degree and once I receive my bachelors I will commission and go active duty. I have always wanted to become a pilot and this was the perfect opportunity to reach both goals. The pilot selection process prefers stem majors over others, and computer science is among the most desirable. This class and the major course will not only help me reach my goal, but also teach me about the the world around me and how I can make changes in it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1913,"I want to go into the STEM field mostly because I like to solve problems and I like to figure out how things work. As a kid, I used to break apart old small electronics and try to figure out what made them work. I think that led me to try to fix things that were broken, which usually required me to figure out how they worked first. I think that STEM classes were the ones that had something in common with what I liked to do."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1914,"I want to go into the STEM field for a matter of reasons. I am a computer science major and have high goals of getting a job at an awesome technology company. I have a great crave for change - change in people and our world. So my mission is to assess the knowledge I can get to make something greater. With the word STEM. I think of everything it stands for. Science - Technology -Engineering- and Mathematics. I fine a crave for each individual subject listed there because they all are so different but do connect in some outrageous ways. When thinking about that - I think about all the things around us that have been created already. A great example is artificial intelligence. It is live and apart of our world currently which is a tremendously cool thing. I would love to create and discover new ideas such as that. Growing up I was not a fan of math and science. I was actually more about books. Reading and writing. English and history were my go tos - strongest subject. But coming into college - when committing to SFSU. I had a decision to make. Though it was a pretty uncomfortable decision - I stuck with it and have seen a tremendous amount of change. I got a growth mindset when attempting science and math. I use to think this is too hard but honestly - it is just right! Mindset is everything! And if you did it once, you can do it again but even better! It is all about how you go about things. But with that I found a passion for programming and have been sticking with it. I would love to grow into a position of  IT, Software, or cybersecurity with this major. STEM is where to be:) we make life changing change and hopefully we can come out with more electric cars so we don't have to pay these ridiculous gas prices."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1915,"""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?"" I want to go into the STEM field because I was always interested in learning the history and process behind technology and how it has evolved to advance our lives in a significant way. I wanted to major in Computer Engineering because I loved working with computers and I also want to build robots one day. Majoring in this field helped me research more about it and take the opportunities that are offered for me; I want to be passionate of the major that I'm studying. Science wasn't always my speciality but I always like learning about it and knowing that Science is part of the Stem Field, I couldn't be more excited to learn more. I am pretty good at Math and all of the Calculus classes I've taken were hard but took a lot of practice I like my major Computer Engineering, I can't wait to explore more of coding programming and hardware manufacturing"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1916,"As I am majoring in computer science, that means that I am considered a STEM major. I wanted to major in this because I wanted to learn about coding, and hopefully I could learn how to make my own programs and even make websites. STEM is all about numbers and calculating facts, and in this day and age, technology revolves around modern technology. If I major in STEM, I’d likely find myself in a successful company in the future, and I could be financially stable. Many companies would include software development, online security, data handling, and a lot more. I believe that the STEM field is going to be a successful and profitable field in the coming years, and I need to make sure I’m familiar with the current and upcoming technology so I can afford a house, car and whatever else I want to buy for myself and my friends and family. "
