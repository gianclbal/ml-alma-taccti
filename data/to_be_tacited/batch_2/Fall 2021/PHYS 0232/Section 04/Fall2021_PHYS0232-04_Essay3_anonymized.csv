2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1915,"One concept that we covered in the lecture and lab that really intrigued me was Flux and Gauss's Law due to the direction of the area vector connecting to the surface of an object and also finding the magnitude of that vector. With this concept, you are suppose to understand how the surface of an object is determined by the Electric Flux using Gauss's Law which uses the total charge within the given surface and the electric constant. The formula is a useful to find the total Electric flux enclosed by a closed surface. This information can benefit society as it can be used to determine surfaces of certain objects such as buildings, vehicles, etc and not only that but it will help analyze how the electric field works. One example is the net flux of a Gaussian surface inside a cylinder where we use Gauss's Law to find that flux with the point charges, the magnitude and direction of the area vectors."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1897,"One of the more important concepts we learned this past few weeks is electric current. The energy that was stored within the batteries gets absorbed out into the wires. This information regarding current all have association with the overall power source, due to the fact that the power source is the only way technology can output power. In today’s society, almost everyone’s household has some type of electric current to power their needs. Within the household, there are LED light bulbs that heavily require the electricity from the current to light it up. Some concrete information that was covered this semester is that the simulations tested proves that the electric current that is going through the wires requires the help of the positive charges in order to have the force to move the flow. This type of information is relevant in today’s world because as the technology sector keeps on expanding overtime, the need for electricity is also expanding at the same time. For example, an electric car requires a 50v battery pack in order to move the entire vehicle, which means that every household must have at least 50v outlet to purchase an electric vehicle. Based on the above expansion, electric current technology will really benefit society in today’s world as more and more households are starting to adapt to this kind of technology.     "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1912,"One question that we can ask from last week's lab (short Circuit), is what is a short circuit and how is it relevant in every day life. As shown in the lab and post-lab, a short circuit is when a current travels along an unintended path with little to no resistance. This can be a problem because without resistance there can be an excessively high current or voltage in the circuit, causing circuit damage, overheating, fire or an explosion. In everyday house hold appliances you can see why this is a problem. If these appliances are short circuited they may cease to work, overheat and even catch on fire. It is important to understand these concepts to help protect yourself and your property."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1900,"One question that has been confused me is that why interior designers or electricians do not choose using series circuits rather parallel ones when they arrange the lights in house. After learning and doing related experiments, I had a clearer idea about the difference between these two different types of circuits. The example of applications is that when arranging the lights in interior design, it is not recommended to put all of them in series, what people would do is to at most put several lights in kitchen as the switch turn on, but not the whole house. Being more specific, when we turn on the switch, we won’t want both lights in kitchen and bathroom are on at the same time, we would expect more functional or save more electricity. On the other hand, even if the lights in the bedroom are separated, it is not common to make them all connected since it is very likely to have something wrong with one bulb, it will destroy the others that are working well as the result. To avoid this from happening, they would choose parallel rather to save not only the money but also the time used to fix the problems."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1902,"One important concept that we had recently learned was about conductors and insulators. These two played an important role with everything that we use in our daily lives but what are a couple things that they are used for. For daily use, conductors such as cooking pans are used since they have the ability to easily conduct heat and insulators such as clothing can keep the heat in. When speaking about electronics, they are used in a wide array of things. Conductors would send a current through a circuit to power the lights or to charge your phone, and insulators will prevent this current from going somewhere it isn’t supposed to. An example of a conductor that is extremely beneficial for safety is the use of lightning rods. The rod itself is a conductor and the tip of it has a high e field, which attracts the lightning to strike it. This prevents lightning from striking the building itself or a person walking down the street with an umbrella, ultimately being used to protect the population. Insulators are used around wires to prevent the current from a circuit from starting a fire. Another example that we use in our daily lives is the use of cell phones which use conductors and insulators."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1907,"How do electric fields work?     During the third week of this course, we covered electric fields; how to visualize them, what they are made of, and what information we can gain from them. This lab covered everything from charges, sensors, vectors, and more.      Before this lab, it was hard to visualize exactly how an electric field worked as well as how positive and negative charges affected the field. From this, I also learned how to test for an electric field using sensors. Sensors help to detect changes that occur within an electric field. The sensors furthered my understanding of the strength of electric fields as well as the vectors that represent that strength. The simulation that accompanied this lab clarified how electric fields work, how positive and negative charges affect the direction of the field vectors, and how sensors can be used to test the electric field. It was fun to experiment with the positive and negative charges as well as how the location of sensors affected the vectors. Some things that I noticed were that when the sensors were far away from the charges, the length of the vector was small and as it was moved closer to the charges, the length increased. The sensor arrows also always stayed facing away from the charges.      A couple of everyday applications that require the use of electrostatics include photocopiers and laser printers. Each of these applications include processes and systems revolving around electrostatic charges. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1916,"How important is formatting a power circuit in an electronic device?Circuit formatting is the most crucial part of building electronics because any incorrect builds can lead to injury from fire, electric shocks, or even death. What's crucial about it is the hazards of where the voltage is going, how much voltage passes through, what materials can prevent the voltage from sparking and creating unwanted damage, mapping, and what kind of battery will be able to sustain all of it. An example of this would be that one time Samsung phones kept catching on fire: because of a faulty battery. Many mobile electronic products rely on the battery, and faulty batteries can have low recharging rates, or have a tendency to overheat. These kinds of batteries can either send too much or too little voltage to certain components of a device that it could cause performance issues or maybe even permanently damage them. Chargers are also a crucial process to make, because the the amount of voltage that are in wall sockets is enough to kill your phone if you connected a piece of metal between your phone and the wall socket, so chargers are made to act like powerful resistors so that only the safe and appropriate amount of voltage would be sent to your phone. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1911,"Going back to week 3 of electric fields, I've found one of the questions that peaked my interest, Why does a neutral object behave the way they do? So going back to my notes, I could answer this because it is that neutral objects are attracted to either charge. The region with too many electrons is negatively charged, the other is positive, because of lack of electrons. I think that this information is relevant to people's lives because we need to understand how charge works in order for us to be where we are at today. If we couldn’t understand the basics of charge and not knowing how neutral objects are attracted to positive or negative charges, we wouldn’t have the fundamentals of having electrically charged devices such as a phone, a laptop, a tablet, and so much more list goes on and on. Not knowing charge could mean so many things to even not knowing how current works and us as a society would not have electricity and knowing how much it helps on a day to day basis, we couldn’t possibly live today without knowing how charge works or not having electricity. So without knowing the basics, our society today wouldn’t be as advanced and who knows where we would be if we couldn’t understand how charges work. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1917,"The concept that I'd like to talk about is Ohm's law. What can you use Ohm's for and why is it important.  Well,  Ohm's law shows the relation ship between potential difference and electrical current. You would use  Ohm's law's o find the voltage, current and resistance of an electrical circuit. You can use it to maintain desired voltage drop across the electrical components. When diverting currents through a DC ammeter you can use it too.  Current can be shown as V = IR, while Resistance proportionally would be R = I/V. In Every day you probably won't be writing down and solving equations with Ohm's law. But knowing the concept of it, along with how currents work is beneficial. Say you were trying to find the resistance of a light bulb connected to an 8V source with a current of 2.0A . You would  use R= V/I  which = 4"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1906,So one question that I have is was based on potential due to it affecting both electrical current and water current. I have been hearing teachers talk about how we should visualize a water current when they talk about potential in an electrical current. I wonder what similarities and what differences does potential share with both of the type of currents. I know that potential tells us the ability of an object to do work and generally when water flows from one place to another there is a potential difference which gets the water moving from a high potential to low potential. Basically water will flow from higher up downstream. I guess electric current is kind of similar due to there being potential difference where electric current is in the direction in which a positive charge would move. An example would be the current moving away from the positive terminal of a battery and towards the negative terminal. This information is paramount to our lives since we all use electricity and water so better understanding how current flows based on potential is important in maintaining our livelihood. Without the understanding of how currents worked we basically would be using candles to light up our homes and possibly washing ourselves using a bucket of water we got from the ocean. Currents have basically changed all of our lives for the better. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1899,"From our previous labs, something that interests me would be the circuits that we used to understand how anything with technology works. I think it's fascinating that we bend the rules that the universe gives us to discover great things. I believe when I was younger I enjoyed building those simple circuit kits that were often sold to the youth and I discovered these concepts such as short circuit, parallel, and series much before then. I want to at least understand the core properties and rules of building a circuit so that I could build on my current knowledge of what I now know of circuits from physics and do something really creative with it. There is a boy in Africa who I am inspired from because it is said that he makes useful appliances from scrap and metal to help communities in his area to deal with environmental changes. I forgot his name but I just know that he was a genius in his own capacity if not a prodigy, and he used the knowledge he had from circuits to make something so cool. One of his creations were a, at least what I remember, speaker that goes out every time interval so that lions don't come into the village at a specific time. There was also a another device which calculated the levels of water that are in the air but I forgot what it was used for (most likely water capturing). Simple devices such as that can be useful to many places and all it takes is some creative thinking to do something great."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,801,"I think about the short circuit lab when I think of a question, and I wonder, how can these same ideas be used to create circuits that are programmable? I am a computer science major and hardware has always interested me. I wonder how wires and metals can be put together to make something that can be manipulated with code by humans. Looking over some notes, it seems like transistors are turned to ""on"" or ""off"". These can be switched by programs to make the electrons and circuits do different things. This makes sense because, when you code, you do a lot of if-statements which can control how transistors react and interact. I think of gates with arrows telling things where to go, like circuits and programmed ""on and off""s. This is very useful different kinds of ways. You can program circuits to make websites which help people learn, and interact with world from home. These can also be used in cars to make them more smart and to help people drive better. Circuits and programming languages are also being used to create AI for a plethora of reasons right now. Such as drones that help deliver packages, and smart doorbells. these are all things that help humans, and that is why it is so important to learn."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1030,"I will be going over Short Circuit and why I think it is important. The lab on short circuit helped us realize what can be used to connect currents and what is dangerous to use. It was really nice to use the simulation to help further our understanding where we had a bunch of stuff to test to see where the current goes, how fast it goes, and if it will fail.   "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1913,"I enjoyed the last two labs dealing with circuits and current. I think that in today's age where electronics and buildings depend on electricity, it's important to learn about these topics. Recently I've had a problem with certain portions of my home losing power and I was wondering how circuits and currents work. I now see how circuits can be split up and how multiple devices and their resistance can drain more current and cause problems. We were also able to see how circuits can be split up so that if a breaker in the house goes off, the entire house does not lose power."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1914,"What are circuits and how are they seen in everyday life?Electronic circuits are how most things work. They indicate as resistors, kind of like a transistor. They connect by wires and this is how the electricity is shown to flow through a current. This is a concept we discussed in Lab and it is only summed up with an example of something such as a kitchen appliance. The best example given could be that because in order for a fridge to be cold and work is to plug in the wire. This information is seen in people's lives on a daily because to even use a toaster for breakfast in the morning, we must plug it in. When plugging in the wire - this causes the current to actually flow so that item (whatever it might be) can work efficiently as it is suppose too. The easiest way to get a circuit to work is by a battery, cable, or heating element. For example, a battery can be used in a circuit because this can drive the current around the circuit. The battery would play the role of the power source. With a cable, you can expect the current to go around the circuit by its conductor. And lastly a heating element could be seen as a motor or a bulb - this indicates the load having resistance."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1909,"A concept that I was interested in was charge and a question that I had was, ""how lightning is created when it is cloudy/raining out?"" After looking through my notes and labs, I initially thought charges may not work the same way in a natural environment as they would in electrical appliances. After consulting my textbook and the internet, I realized that both scenarios would work similarly as they would have to discharge if the balance in their electric current were to suddenly become imbalanced. Moreover, static electric charges are stored in the clouds, and when the negative charge from the ground or another source gets strong enough, the energy from the static charges is released. This process is similar to using a battery as there is a positive and negative end and when provoked, the battery will power the device so long as it has charge stored up. While this information might not be useful for many people who don't encounter lightning often, it would be helpful to know if they were to travel to a place where it rains often. Moreover, if this information is known, it would help people avoid ""lightning rod"" objects so that they don't get electrocuted. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1905,"These few weeks we have been learning about circuit diagrams and how to calculate the current and resistance. We learned the difference between a parallel circuit and a series circuit. In a series circuit it is when the current goes through a device(Light Bulb, switch, outlet)  and then goes to another device which then returns back to the battery/current source. A parallel circuit in which the electric current passes through two or more branches or connected parts at the same time before it combines again.This knowledge can be used to benefit the everyday life of an electrician. They have to look at electrical blueprints and they have to make sure that the breaker they are using can withstand the current going through the circuit. They also have to make sure that if they use a series circuit that the current doesn't go low. It helps them see that everything has the right current and that nothing will cause the circuit or breaker to trip. This week's labs about current and circuits will also benefit me in my life because I’m trying to become an electrical engineer and I want to be able to create Electrical Diagrams for residential."
