2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1907,"Online classes have definitely made an impact on my learning. Like most students in their second year, I have been taking online classes since the second semester of my senior year in high school. In the beginning, it was tough to adjust to online classes. Overall, it was difficult to focus. I also did not like the feeling that there was not a separation between home and school. I either felt like I was ""at school"" even when I was at home or that I was ""at home"" even when I was in school. My main concern is how I will adjust once we start going back to campus. However, I have a feeling that being in a classroom environment with other students will help me to focus more in class and understand the material better. It will also help me to feel more comfortable talking to other students as well as asking questions during class. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1909,"Ever since the pandemic started and classes were moved online, I have lost a lot of motivation on what I want to do for a career and have been struggling to regain that same motivation so that I can do good work in my classes. Most of the time I would see the work given to me as a way to just distract myself rather than learn something new. I have been trying to talk to friends and am currently getting advice on what I should do to remotivate myself in order to get myself back on the right track. Furthermore, I have been trying to give more time for self-care, whether it rewarding myself after finishing a day's worth of assignments or just extra time on video games so that I can some adrenaline flowing. While this reflection might be less optimistic than compared to what people would normally say, I feel as though that I would regain or feel a lot more motivation if classes were to be in person again. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1903,"Online classes have more of a positive aspect on my learning for this semester. My schedule allows me to work on assignments on my own time and still have breaks in between. The only disadvantage I have is that some teachers only provide recordings even though it's a synchronous course. I would understand if it's an asynchronous course, but when we meet on zoom they don't really go over the topic covered unless someone asks a question. For self-care I try to balance my work and personal life. I would block certain times out of my day so I can get work done and finish any assignments and then take breaks whenever I need to. My schedule is perfect for me since most assignments are due towards the end of the week so I can organize which class to focus on for certain days. The only thing I am concerned about is when we go back in person, how it would affect my organization and routine. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1900,"It seems that CS students who work with laptops are not affected seriously as other students, but for me, it is still tough to study. In my point of view, it is harder to achieve success through online lectures since it highlights the self-regulation. In regular classes, professors will remind you the deadline, however, online studying pushes us to catch up everything on my own. It happens that we will login in out account and then go to bed again so that we have to spend other time learning the stuff. On the other hand, it might promote us to arrange our schedule more flexibly and make us think more before asking the questions. The positive impact of learning is that we get used to being more independent, which is what we should deal with in the future, including how we arrange all the stuff and hand in the job on the deadline."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1901,"Covid-19 has impacted each individual in some way. The uncertainty that came with this pandemic has influenced me a lot. It isn't easy to maintain one schedule outside class, especially when there is a load from multiple courses and a short deadline for most of them. This results in a terrible sleep pattern and a lack of sleep during tests. Health is the most crucial aspect to understand lecturers better and perform better as a student. When our mental state is not okay, the lecture we attend might not be all that helpful at all as we cannot give our 100 percent to learn, and we end up re-learning everything, which takes more time and puts more stress on us for not completing what we were supposed to at that time. Students tend to take more classes than they can handle, which does add to the stress and results in the student not performing to their potential. Overall sticking to one routine and being disciplined can a student far. Taking breaks should not be on the screen at the same desk. We need to step outside and take care of our overall health. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,801,"Online classes have made learning for me more difficult for some I believe. The first semester online was not that difficult for me, maybe because it was new and everything was accommodating. Now, it is difficult for me to study and learn without seeing a physical teacher. Especially in Computer Science 230, I do not know why but I find it more difficult to comprehend and I believe it is because the course is being held virtually. I have more Time to do things now that I do not have to commute but SOMEHOW the days just fly. I believe the format of the classes are okay but it is the information that is harder to understand from home. For self care I started working out, I do yoga, and watch youtube to destress. Even though most of the time I do not find enough time to. I am concerned I AM getting too burnt out, but I should try and reserve more time for myself."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1915,"Online classes have been okay for me. Some positive things about online classes are that you’ll be able to do class work and homework at home at the same time, you get to revisit recorded lectures for review and you can get interact with other classmates in breakout rooms. There are times where I like having these classes but I much prefer taking a class in person than taking one online because for me personally I’m more engaged in learning in a classroom and also I’m not distracted easily.  Sometimes being in a class online can make you distracted with the technology you’re already using for example, your computer or your phone. I know that right now with certain problems it cannot be done but hopefully one day we will return to fully normal where students can go to classes in person. I think what would work for me is just to try harder to not get distracted by my surroundings"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1905,"Online classes had made a huge impact on my learning. Before online learning I would usually just come back from class and do my homework late at night and that was that.But then with online classes I had to download the homework and look for the homework which helped me start being independent. It also forced me to start working on my time management since my wifi can go out at any moment so I have to make sure that I have it done before the day it's due. It also taught me how to self learn when I wasn't able to go to an office meeting or email a teacher if I had a question. Although I would say that it has also made me try to focus more on textbook learning because I learned with pandemic that I’m used to hands-on or in person classes. But overall, online classes helped me work on my time management, textbook learning, and self-learning."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1906,"Online classes are kind of like a double edged sword for me since I like not having to physically go to class but not being in class causes me to get distracted much easier. What I try to do is to put myself away from anything that could distract me and focus only on the task at hand. I usually also take many breaks in between classes and study sessions so I don't burn out from school. I feel as though breaks are the crux of healthy learning and taking them in between classes or between homework assignments have really helped me get through all of my classes and assignments. Another positive thing about these online classes is that I can do a quick google search when I don't know something and I want a better understanding of the material. I really don't have any concern except for the fact that I can get distracted easily. Other than that, I feel as though I am in an alright position right now."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1902,"Online classes have definitely changed my work ethic when it comes to academics. Honestly, it is not my preferred method of learning as it allows too much room to procrastinate or to not pay attention in class. In in-person class, I would spend time trying to talk with other classmates to understand a subject, but with online classes, it makes it hard to efficiently work with others online. Trying to understand a difficult subject without anyone to talk with is a big struggle for me. As for self-care, I try to take a break whenever I can, such as a nap or a trip to the gym. Though whenever I take a nap, I would sleep for too long and end up not having enough time to work all my assignments so I try to prevent doing so. At this point I am over with online classes because this method of learning does not work well with me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1911,"I think that online learning has impacted my way of learning in a negative way, the only positive about online learning is that time management is much easier especially with traveling to classes. The negatives for me of online learning is that for me I can get easily distracted and it makes it tough for me to learn, but I try my hardest not to get distracted with online learning by turning everything off and trying to set up a classroom environment within my own living space but that is still hard to do as well. I have to get the feeling that I have done something productive in the day otherwise I feel like I get sort of a depressing feeling throughout the day, which I think that online learning has taken an impact of because going out and traveling to my classes throughout the day makes me feel like I did something productive, unlike online learning I'm just sitting in my room all day making me feel unproductive even though I'm doing the same thing online."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1914,"Online classes have impacted my learning greatly. I feel like it is more intense as in hard. My brain was taught in person and switching to online is fine but, I feel like my time management skills aren't were they use to be. I am lighting a candle and drinking some tea usually for self care. Nothing really works for me to calm down besides that. I have great concern with my well being because midterms have made my brain go crazy and for me to be well - I just simply need to pass my classes and get all my assignments in ON TIME. I feel like I put a lot of pressure on myself and it is because I'm a full time student and full time worker. So it doesn't add up to me how to ever have good rest or a ready mind for a test."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1916,"Online classes have helped me by letting me stay at home and giving me more control of my life outside of school. It lets me have more time for my part-time job, my sleep schedule, and most importantly, myself. I've been slightly more efficient balancing my work life, my school life, and my personal life ever since online classes started. It also helps a lot that since I'm at home, I don't have to pay a huge sum of money to the school for on campus housing, a car, and gas. My only concerns are the fact that I'm not sure if the instructors that aren't exactly fit for teaching an online class are properly teaching their students at the given time that we're scheduled to meet them. Often times what they teach doesn't help me understand the topic as much as they expect me to. Honestly, I hope that all my classes stay online, but I also kind of miss the in person interactions with other classmates, because while I may be saving a lot of money, I don't have a lot of classmates to personally get help from. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1917,"Online classes have impacted my learning for the worst. What am I doing for self care? I am working less at my job and using that time to relax. Right now school is my #1 priority so realizing that and taking a break from my job has been nice. I am getting used to the online learning, but I hope that all of my classes next semester could be in-person. I find it easier to learn and stay focused when in a classroom rather than at my desk in my room. The school environment and being surrounded by other like minded students is motivating in itself but drives more creation out of me. I also find it easier to talk to my professors as well, I think that they give less time to students during online lectures. To end this I'd like to say that my well-being overall is good!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1898,"Since online classes started, my academic engagement has decreased by a lot. I believe that online classes are not as good as in person because you do not feel motivated to learn because you have so many distractions that sometimes it is impossible to pay attention to class. Furthermore, you do not feel like you have to be in class because you're just a click away from skipping the whole class whereas in person, if you are in school might as well enter all your classes because you are already there. This whole year, I feel like I am not learning anything and that makes me feel frustrated because I am in my junior year and my coding skills are very poor compared to other people which makes me feel like a failure. The only good thing about online classes is that I get to sleep a little bit more because I do not have to commute to school which I used to do everyday for 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the afternoon and it is nice to not have to do that anymore. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1899,"When I think about performance wise, I did more than I could have spending my time being at the campus. My tongue is not the only one who speaks in such way, as many people can agree that working at home does carry its benefits but there are definitely cons to living a covid life. Firstly, the idea of doing anything else other than staying at home is out of the question. If you are not like the small percentage of people who are already akin to the life of the computer, than adapting to one is hard, and even harder when the real life you had was through the engagement of meeting people. Most people can go along with not meeting people for a year or so, but the fear that I carry through this unanimous decision is the permanent effect of all of this. What if we end up living the dystopian cyber life where the only real contact with others is through virtual reality? The future of society's isolation is scary, and I think that the more we grow used to this idea - this habit - of working around the comfort of your home will outweigh any good that comes to it at some point. We cannot live a life of isolation, as that is not how we came to be. As for my personal well being, I think I could use some social events to resuscitate the very little 'extrovertness' I have in me before I become like the smeagle from the hobbit."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1912,"Online classes have impacted my learning in a way that I did not expect to happed. Lectures outside of the classroom make it very difficult to focus on the material and self study. When you have no choice but to do class at home or in your bedroom there is no separation of home and school. Even waking up early and getting ready before class doesn't change the feeling that you are not really in school, zoom classes are more like getting an education from youtube or a video service that going to school. There is no accountability or really reason to show up or pay attention in class which causes students to lose motivation and interests in the subjects that they are studying. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1897,"After having two plus years of online classes, I felt that I’m starting to get used to this new type of learning style. During the first couple of months of online learning, I had a really difficult time in making the transition over to online classes as before we all spent all of our class time meeting face to face in class. After spending two plus years on online classes, the online classes have somewhat impacted my learnings within this couple of years. When I come across something I don’t understand, I can’t immediately ask for help as there is only a limited amount of time during the office hours. Compared to in campus classes, I can just stay after class to ask the professor for help instead of having to wait until the next office hours. Now with online classes being the main way to learn, I will need to study extra hard after each class in order to absorb the information needed to complete all of the homework assignments. For my selfcare routine, I often just lay back at my couch to watch a quick comedy film to keep my mind off of other stressful events. By doing this step during my school time, I can basically take my entire focus into the film without any stress at all."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1030,"Online classes are definitely interesting, some classes I have taken the teachers really do try to get your attention and make it as fun and creative as possible to help us learn. Other teachers just don't do much and go through the material which is hard to really focus and get engaged. So for my learning it really has been 50/50 im not sure if things would be better if it was in person or not. Im not sure how you guys can help us during this time I feel like you are already doing the most you can do during these times.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1910,"online classes have definitely made learning for me alot harder, i have gotten lazier, and overall i feel like im not really absorbing much material at all. which makes me really anxious for the future because i have no idea if i would be prepared for internships, my next classes as a senior, and overall life in general. It's even harder now that i am working to pay the bills, so right now im unsure and very stressed about things. for self care, i guess i would say i like talk to my friends on discord or play video games with them."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,4,1913,"Online learning definitely has changed my learning habits in a positive way. Online learning has brought flexibility, which was is definitely useful, but comes with its drawbacks. I have learned to manage my time, which was difficult during the beginning of the transition to online learning. I think a major drawback that I have come across is the lack of human interaction. Sometimes it's hard to remember that there are other students having the same struggles as I am. Having group activities, such as in this class has helped feel connected and not alone. "
