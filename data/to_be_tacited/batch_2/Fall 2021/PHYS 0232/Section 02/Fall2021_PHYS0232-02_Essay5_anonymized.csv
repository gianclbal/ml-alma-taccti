2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1849,"The greatest take away from this class would be not really the material, but the confidence. Let me elaborate. In highschool I did really badly at my physics class and I just don’t know anything I was doing in that class. I know the importance of physics in real life and in my major so I really needed and wanted to learn it, but I just didn’t know if I could. This class wasn’t at all easy, but at least I feel like I am participating in the lab work and I could answer questions in the lab. I may not get how to do problems that are more difficult but it is a first step and a good boost of confidence. Learning the material is an important take away I agree, but having the confidence to learn is a more important take away in my opinion. If I were to choose the second greatest take away would be the material and especially the topics that confused me the most in highschool which was most of the previous labs."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1375,"My biggest take away from this class would have to be time management and just going over the lectures after class. I believe that with that , I was able to be somewhat successful in turning in my assignments on time. As well as understanding the topics discussed for each week. I was able to understand the main topics discussed in each section. This class has helped me with also reaching out to fellow students since most of the labs we had involved being in groups. This was very beneficial in my opinion and also went hand in hand with time management. I think that time management is very important in this scenario since it is an online class so its already a given that the student needs to set time aside to study and go o ver notes / lectures. I really enjoyed this class as a whole and believe i've gained a lot from it. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1863,"My greatest take away from this class is that electricity is not all that complicated when you take the time and break it down. Sometimes when I look inside electronics or house hold items like light bulbs, I always think that the concepts are too complicated for me to understand. After going through these labs and breaking down concepts that are used in every day applications ,I gained a new curiosity and confidence about electricity. Circuits and magnetism to generate electricity are both topics that I feel that I would like to continue to learn about. Especially magnetism, because when I think of magnets I used to only think about refrigerator magnets that go on the door. But now I think of generators, trains, tape cassettes , and etc. While I am not the best mathematician, I think I will continue to explore these areas of physics through articles and free courses online in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1857,"This class has helped me understand the concepts in PHYS 230 better as these experiments we do in class are directly proportional to the topics in Lecture. Every class should be like this class when it comes to late work, as students we have so many assignments due and i feel that being able to turn work late without penalty has made it so much better. I have however, learned that to not miss the assignments as long as I am able to make it before the due date. Overall, I enjoyed the labs and i do not think i will be forgetting the concepts that we have learned. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1859,"One of my greatest takeaways in this class must be the way electricity works. From specific formulas used to measure electricity and magnetism to how we can use these concepts to create tools that will help us live or lives. One of my favorite lectures in the class has to be the voltage, currents and circuits labs because of how useful that knowledge can be when working with electronics. When it comes to working with electronics, a clear understanding of volage, current and circuits allows repair technicians to know how much volts of power to expect at a certain capacitor, the circuits related to the capacitor and current that needs to flow through the capacitor. Beyond repairing electronics, Electrical and Computer Engineers need this knowledge when designing electronic circuit boards and what parts to pick for them that can handle the power. One example of a repair technician and their knowledge of these concepts comes when trying to diagnose a laptop and its inability to accept a charge. We need to know how much power needs to flow through the charging circuits and the expected voltage. A circuit diagram like a schematic or board view allows the technician to trace the circuit to its proper place, expected voltage and current along with what other electronics are connected to that circuit that can also be a cause for its malfunction."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1872,My greatest takeaway from Physics 232 is my understanding of electromagnetics and its use in the real world. There are plentiful ways to use electromagnets which we use in engineering. Having learned how to use the many different laws to comprehend magnetism in a consumable size makes for actual understanding.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1848,"The greatest take away from this class is honestly to persevere through the work load that is given to me. This semester has been a little rough where I have lost motivation to do work for the past month, but I have been trying to get it together and finish most of the assignments that I had. I didn't 100% finish all work assigned to me, but I did work through most of it. This is honestly a good thing because I was feeling really lazy at times during this semester. I could've easily not completed more assignments and got the minimum C grade, but I pushed a little harder to get a better grade in my classes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1865,"I would say that the greatest takeaway from this class was learning about electric circuits and their components such as resistors, capacitors, fuses, short circuits, etc. Since I am majoring in electrical engineering this is very helpful for the future job I will receive. Learning about parallel and series circuits was interesting and helpful. I learned how fuses are a failsafe that combust whenever too much current is flowing through each appliance. If you have your heater turned on and other high-power appliances your fuse would blow in order to protect the circuit and not cause a short circuit. This has happened to me in the past and learning about it in class is good since I was able to apply it to the real world. Electric circuits are also everywhere, in our phones, computers, etc. I have my computer at my desk where the motherboard is exposed and I see the capacitors, resistors, wires, and the battery (power supply). So it is nice to learn and apply what I learn to the real world. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1867,My greatest take away from this class is to be patient and take the time to learn what you thought was impossible to solve. Physics has been hard and this lab helped me understand the concepts a lot easier than the main physics class. It's important to be patient when learning a new concept because there are many different ways you can learn. I learn best from actually seeing pictures and interacting with physics concepts.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1098,"My greatest take way from this class was all the lab experiments we did in class, especially circuits, I enjoyed creating one while also learning about them. We covered many topics like charge, electric field, potential, voltage, current etc. I believe that it is really important for all of us to know how they work, since, they is all around us and it is how our world works. It is especially important for engineers to know these topics. Additionally I believe that working and collaborating with group mates or the whole class really makes the class more enjoyable. Also doing more hands on activities. I've had labs where we only watch videos since the materials cannot be found anywhere and had to be preformed in a lab class, so I didn't learn much nor experience anything. Since I am more of a hands-on learner. Being able to do experiments in this lab was enjoyable, informative and I learned quite a lot too. Working with our group mates and helping each other really made the class more enjoyable as well. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1875,"Zachary Wong11/16/21PHYS 232Reflection #5	One of the greatest takeaways from this class is that when we were working on huge or small groups. It allowed me and my group members to communicate pretty well. It allows us to understand each of the questions that we are answering. In our coding lab weeks, we were able to show our code to our huge groups, and show what we did wrong, and most of them said, “you misspelled something or you forgot to put a comma.” So, I fixed it, and therefore, the code was able to give me an output. Another example was when I was doing the experiment demonstrations for the quizzes, I wondered for a few minutes why the virtual experiment cannot function, and my group mates said, “you forgot to include a piece or you forgot to enable a button.” When I did what they told me the experiment actually worked and functioned well. Working in groups really helps you out, when you are trying to get the assignment done on time and efficiently. It helps with better communication and being able to not hesitate answering each question for 40 minutes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1856,"My greatest takeaway from this class was going more in-depth about how physic sounds to us every day although we do not realize it. As the weeks went on I was able to connect everything we learned in the labs with actives in my everyday life. By fully understanding how things work with one another I'll be able to apply these concepts in my future career. Now that I have decided to remain in the criminal study aspect. One lab that spoke to my interest was when working with magnets, this could help with locating bullets and fragments around a crime scene. Another good aspect that I took away from this lab was using the simulations. It was easy to follow and allowed me to get a better understanding of the concepts in focus. I have learned a lot from this class and although I will longer be pursuing a chemistry career I am grateful that I can still apply what I learned in this class in my future career. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1858,"My greatest take away from this class was taking the extra time to focus in on a subject and really understand its ins and outs can help you go a long way. I found that this lab course was much more helpful than my actual physics class because I was experiencing the lessons and seeing everything for myself instead of just being handed the information and told to calculate things. The labs in the course were fun, some were a bit much but I still enjoyed the course. I found that I was absorbing more information from the engagement and interaction in this course than in my other classes that are less collaborative and more independent. It makes more sense for this course to be more engaging because you do spend 3 hours going over material and working through the labs with others. This course made me realize that understanding concepts takes time and effort. Without this course, I truly do not think I would have passed my main physics course because the information I’ve retained through labs stuck more than the textbook definitions."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1868,"Reflection #5    The lecture and lab have been very enlightening, there has been many new things that I have learned throughout the course so far. I really enjoy how the lecture and labs are correlated , because in the lecture we don’t do any type of hands on activities. We only just talk about what is going on and from time to time we get to see pictures of reactions of certain materials, but I never got the whole understanding of it. So, with the lab you get a better understanding of what is going on, because we go over it again in our lab, but we also have hands on activities to see how to get the reactions and also understand why it is happening. That has been my biggest take away in this semester which has opened my eyes on how things work and realizing that a  lot of things that we learn and do in class happen in our day to day lives. So, whenever I go out or just in my household, I can look at certain objects such as a microwave or power sockets and have an understanding of what is going on inside these objects. It is very cool because then you can tell your friends how certain things work."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1860,"My greatest takeaway was how easy it is to get lost in the thick of the busy schedule that physics implies. I managed to get super behind out of nowhere so there is a lot with managing time that I left as a complete afterthought, this class helped me realize how important it is to stay on top of things to not have to dig yourself out of a hole. For me personally, taking advantage of the leniancy of the class led to me making this mistake but I will capatalize on my mistake in order to not make it again and have a successful career that will take advantage of better scheduling and planning, rather than just coasting and doing as I have been."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1853,"From this class, I have learned multiple topics. I think the topics that have stuck with me are the lectures on magnetic fields and electric fields. I think these topics have stuck with me the most is mainly because this is something that you see and use in our everyday lives. I also learned that many things in physics is connected to a lot of things we do on a day to day basis. This class was cool to understand how little things like a battery or a light switch work. You always look at these things or even you use it, but now I know the behind the scenes of a lot of these topics. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1873,The greatest take away from this class is the thought process that goes into understanding this field of physics. Being able to make observations of certain properties and then go into why they have those properties or how they contribute to how we identify them. Seeing and manipulating different circuits gives us the ability to really understand how they work and some of the different ways things could go wrong. Going through the labs and lectures showed how important different properties are and how we can better understand how they work and what they contribute to circuits and magnetism in general. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1861,"This class was very interesting. We got proper time to learn and explore new concepts. Even some Lab explorations and Post-knowledge were provided with a simulation link of concepts like Electromagnetic Induction, Current, Voltage, Battery, Transformer, Generator, etc. We used the simulation for observation and got answers to many questions. It was really fun using these simulation. Also, discussing doubts and other things with professor and classmates played a vital role in understanding.This class made my concepts stronger which will help me in my future courses related to my field (engineering). "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1862,My greatest take away from this class is how to contextualize scientific finding from labs. After we do a lab the post lab tasks us with taking aspects of our lab and diving deeper into the concepts behind the lessons.  The summary allows us to reflect on how what we learn in class effects our everyday lives. Once you take into account how physics is all around us you have more appreciation for the subject in general. Learning about how and why thing work or react in the way that they do you see how there is so much to learn from everyday objects. You can take this way of thinking and apply them to any subject. The next time we learn a new concept we can take time to think about how this reflects in our lives to put it into context. This is a great way to be an active learner.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1851,One of my greatest takeaways from this class is how much the concepts we've reviewed in this class relate to the real world. Topics such as e-fields and circuits hold a fair amount of relevance to real world concepts such as how circuits are organized and how things are powered. The topic of flux in and of itself holds so much relevance throughout the majority of the topics we've gone over and may even prove essential to later topics such as designing programs and calculating how much memory a function may require. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1874,"I would say that my greatest take away in this class is being able to interact with other students through an online course. I am an extroverted type of person and I like to meet new people/make new friends and ever since we transitioned into ZOOM because of COVID-19, it has been a little difficult for me to meet new people. However, this course includes going into breakout rooms almost every week and after a while you get paired up with the same people and are able to become friends and maybe even talk outside of class like I did. It was nice to have a course like this one and I appreciate the opportunity that was given to us to meet new people. In terms of my greatest take away from this class in an educational manner, I would say that learning/going deeper into physics allows for me to understand why certain objects/things function the way they do. For example, choosing between a series or parallel circuit when building a house. It interests me as to why we choose certain options because every decision we make has a reason. Overall, my greatest take away from this class is just being thankful that I was able to learn more about physics as it contributes to my chemistry knowledge and degree! "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1854,My greatest take away was the fact that the concepts encountered in this class are applied almost everywhere in our daily lives. The application of these concepts can be found in everyday household items that we interact with daily. Another take away concerns learning. I realized that the concepts can be easily and well understood when using simulation tools to illustrate the concepts.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1864,"It is really hard to choose one of my biggest takeaways from the class, I think a lot of different things have been important for me to understand physics. Something that is really broad and is probably my biggest takeaway is how important labs are to be conjoined with the lectures. This is my third lab class I have taken but I wish I have been in person to do a lot of the other labs as it may seem like it could be more beneficial. I used to feel like labs were not so important since they would just go off whatever the lecture was, but in all honesty the lab really gives me an opportunity to further understand what I was previously learning in the lecture. The other thing that helped me further was working with groups. I have always had this thing where it has been hard for me to work with others because I don’t want to say anything that could be completely wrong. The more I was in this class the more I understood that it was ok to be wrong especially with other people who may know the answer and have helped me understand what I was missing."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1869,"So far, we have covered several topics in this class. based on what I have learned, I would say my greatest takeaway from this class would be studying concepts. This course has helped better understand the vocabulary and definitions of words. When taking the main course for physics, i found that i had a better understanding of the concepts which also helped be score higher on homework and exams. Also, this class taught me how to use different software such as adobe editor along with websites that allow you to practice problems. I enjoyed the fact that we had some practice with coding except, I believe we should use a more popular programming language in order to better understand the correlation between physics and computer science. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1855,"Julia Vidal November 16, 2021Phys 232-02 LabReflection #5: What was my greatest take away from this class?     My greatest takeaway from this class is the overall knowledge that I have gained surrounding the way the world works. By learning about the concepts surrounding electric fields and magnetic fields which, although we cannot see them, exist around us at all times and even yield interactions between fields which affect the manner in which things happen. I personally found these most recent labs to be very impacting as we were taught the very difference between magnetic fields and electric fields. Prior to taking this course, I most likely would have thought that the two fields were mostly the same thing, but now I can confidently say that they are not the exact same type of thing but are instead two different field types which yield similar yet different interactions between their identifying components: electric charges and magnetic poles! Knowing this has essentially helped me to understand the way that life yields certain interactions as a result of the way these two fields differ from each other and even as a result of the ways they are similar too."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,282,"My greatest takeaway from this class is all the simulations and general knowlege Ive obtained so far. I feel like a lot of the labs this semester have been similar to past semester's labs, but there is still alot to learn from. For iunstance, the fact that I can look up and utilize a simulation in a second, to answer a conceptual question i had rightin front of me. Also there are constantly little things Im picking up on through these labs, and even though they are similar to ones Ive done in the past, there are always small new things that can really open your eyes. Sometimes I wont be understanding a topic too well, and then i hear one little idea and it all comes to me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1866,"I think my greatest takeaway from this class was realizing that I am actually able to actually learn and do a lab online. A big fear of mine going into the covid semesters last year was taking a lab online because it was not in person. I already struggled in labs that were in-person from the previous semester so I thought it would only be worse online. Another reason I assumed that I wasn't going to be able to learn anything behind a computer screen was that I am a visual and hands-on learner, but all the online labs really taught me what I needed to know in order to excel in the class. They were all fairly simple and easy to follow. It also helped to have peers to work with while we worked in groups because we all helped each other out when we needed it. In the end, I won't be afraid to take another online lab in the future if I need to because this class has taught me that it's not so bad. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1876,"My biggest takeaway from this class is actually not what I learned from the class material, What I learned is that no matter how hard or dire the situation is, its important to keep pushing forward because there will always be light at the end of the tunnel. There will always be an uphill battle, but after the uphill comes downhill where everything is easier and your hardworking pays off."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,602,"My greatest take away from this class was that I was able to experience a lot of new things specially when it came to the experiments at home. We were able to work with the class on new materials. If we ever had any questions or concerns about the class or material my classmates or professor would help me understand it clearly. I took a lot from this class because I enjoyed every bit of it. As long as you participate and help others on what they don't understand, it will make you feel stronger about that material."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1852,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that I was able to manage my time very well. I set a specific time and date to do my work so that I can turn in my assignments on time. This also helped me to not get behind on the materials for this class and also for some of my classes. Another takeaway is that I was able to apply the physics I've learned in class to my everyday life. Whenever I see a lamp, bulb, or anything with electricity and a magnet, I would utter some words or definitions that I've learned in class. These include a capacitor, resistance, and current"
