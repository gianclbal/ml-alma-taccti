2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,602,"Online classes have impacted my learning a lot since COVID-19 because we are not getting that one on one with our professors or classmates. Usually when you are in class you can turn around and ask a classmate for help. Because everything is online now, all you can do is send an email to the professor and ask them what you need help but when you think about it imagine how many emails they are receiving a day. There is a lot of students that do good on their online classes but in my case I feel like I do okay. What I do for self-care is wake up early and get ready to feel good about myself so I can start my day. I try to finish everything as soon as possible so that I would have some hours at the end of the week for myself but sometimes its hard since I have other responsibilities. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1874,"Online classes have impacted my learning greatly during the beginning of the transition from in-person all my life since pre-school, and all of a sudden we went full 100% online. We have been online for a good amount of time now so this semester I was already used to it. It is definitely still not as good to be online which is just my personal preference. I feel that there is more opportunities when we are in person. I also miss being in-person because of the interactions with other students around campus. SFSU has does a great job in making Zoom as close as possible to in-person and the effort is greatly appreciated however it is still online and online will always be different than in person class. For self-care I like to keep in touch with friends and stay active. Ever since COVID hit, I cancelled my gym membership and bought a home gym set up which makes me very happy especially at times when I am stressed I will just get a little workout in. I workout 6 days a week to keep my body fit and mind healthy. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1859,"Online classes have made me increasingly lazy. That is hard to say when there are more disciplined individuals that disagree with me, but I am now able to wake up a minute before class and join the lecture, I am able to participate in class wearing my pajamas whereas before the pandemic, I would have to wake up with enough time to commute to campus and make it to class and put some effort into what I wear that day. Online classes are a double-edged sword in that there is some convenience in being able to stay home all day and learn but at the same time, it messes up with our mental health and gives us a reason to be lazy. On the topic of mental health, there is a separation between our academic life and our home life. When it came down to doing everything online from home, the separation was no longer there so the stress and anxiety that came with taking challenging classes would no disappear at the close of lecture, it would remain there for as long as the semester went on. Having that separation is important to me because I get to leave school related problems on campus so that when I get home I  don’t have to worry about it as much and I am able to take a mental break if I have to."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1858,"Online classes have helped me to manage my time better, though I feel like I am not learning to the best of my ability. I am doing the assignments and labs to get by, but I am not necessarily retaining all of the information. Having online classes, however, has been great in terms of my mental health and anxiety. I find myself having a lot more time to focus on myself and my own growth while also getting work done. My main concern with this class specifically is continuing these study habits and finding myself behind in the next physics class that I will have to take. I do not think I’ve mastered the content enough to be ready for a course that adds to this knowledge. In other classes, though, I am doing very well and understanding the content. Physics is a subject where I’d have to learn everything hands-on and be taught all the content by a professor instead of reading through a textbook and trying to apply what I’ve read."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1849,"I can't say what online classes affected me because I never experienced what it was suppose to be in class in college. I do think that some classes like labs are suppose to be in class and that probably impacted our learned and group work. I'm not sure what you mean by self-care, if you mean covid19 then I usually stay home but I wear mask when I have to go outside. I got the vaccine. If it's just health in general then I do what I usually do not sure what changes are there. I have problems therefore no concerns with my learning and well-being, because it's just what things have to be I can't change that. But professor if you read this I do have a concern with my grade and the fact that I did not have a response from you from ilearn or email. That is probably the only concern I have. I don't know if that is because of online classes or not but that's been a real problem."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1867,I felt like I am able to learn better because of a more quiet environment. The professors has been answering emails quick about any questions I have so it's been better. What I'm doing for self care is cooking and enjoying delicious foods. I don't have any concerns for my learning and my well being
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1866,"When we first went fully online during spring of 2020 I thought it was going to be okay because thought we would be back soon, but that never happened. The first full year of online classes was pretty miserable. I lost my motivation to do school work and would just lay in bed for hours every day doing pretty much nothing other than watching a movie or binging a show. It affected my learning because I didn't want to learn anymore I thought it was pointless because it was online. For self-care, I would try to stimulate my mind by working out but I was very consistent. I even tried to start reading but that didn't really work out either. Overall covid times, and being stuck at home were just very unstimulating for me and did put a pretty big toll on my mental health. The only thing I really learned was how to be comfortable with just myself. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1862,"I prefer online classes over traveling to campus. For those of us that work part-time or have other responsibilities, it is very helpful to not have to travel to go to class. My room is a much more comfortable environment to work in as opposed to a school building. Not having t worry about the cost of transportation has also been an added bonus to remote learning. I know some people have a hard time studying or focusing while they are at home. Some find it distracting rather than helpful or calming. I have no issues with doing work at home. I actually believe that remote learning should be a permanent option for classes that do not do group work or labs that would require special materials. I don't require any type of special ""self-care"", other than being able to take breaks whenever I want outside the confines of a classroom.  I don't have any concerns about my well-being or learning during this time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1856,"Online classes have impacted my learning in a way where I feel like I do not have the same connection with my professors as I do with online classes. It is a lot easier to slack on work, which I do not like. Although I have a schedule to make sure I complete all my assignments in time. I do tend to take more breaks. Since I also work I felt that my school day was still a day off although I had to do school work. Now I feel like I do not have any rest days. So what I do for self-care is go on walks by the beach to help relax and put my mind at peace. I also hang out with my boyfriend when is schedules a line to take a break from the stress of my workload. I also hang out with my roommate and we just have a girls night to get away from the reality of our lives for a bit "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1865,"Online classes are definitely a platform to get used to. At first, I found online learning to be very different from traditional in-person learning. It took me some time to get used to the video conferencing app Zoom and submitting all assignments completely online. I would say that online classes had a little negative impact on my learning since I was able to adapt to my changing environment relatively quick. I had to learn to do things by myself and adapt. For self-care, I have been spending time with my beloved 5 pet finches and weiner dog. I hope to retain all the material I'm learning via zoom as well as my asynchronous classes. I would say my well-being is stable and healthy since honestly, the pandemic did not fundamentally change my life. Personally, I have been using zoom for school for over a year now and I'm honestly tired of it, I just want to go back in person. It is so easy to get distracted in zoom and sometimes I don't have my full focus in class. I just want to go back in person. I'm tired of zoom now.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1853,"Describe how online classes have impacted your learning and what you are doing for self-care. What concerns do you have for your learning and your well-being?So for the past 2 and a half years, I have had online classes. When I first started online learning, it was difficult but I got through it. Once I got to be on campus it got tuff to have to go to classes online when I was on campus. The online class has kind of been hard for my learning. I found that I learn better in person rather than online. I feel that being online I fall asleep in class or don't pay attention as often because it's really hard to focus. What I do to kind of help me through all of these classes is I take breaks in between and I schedule a time to do work. For my self-care, I don't do much. It's hard not to get depressed or have anxiety but sometimes it hits and you have to deal with the results. I just try to not let any of it consume me too much. I try to take time for myself and just have a me day. School is very rough but I know it's all worth it in the end."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1850,"Online learning if very interesting. I started online school during the last quarter of my senior year in high School and it was very interesting. At first I didn't enjoy it but as time past I come to like online school. Why I say that is because it feels as if I have more time to and more comfort to do all of my school work. I can be in class while im at home. It's a very stressful thing no doubt but it's not so bad once you get conformable with the idea which is something I've come accustom to. The impact of online learning is different for all, it depends on the individual and how they engage in their work. If one person slacks off then it will show in their work and the might have a harder time. In the end it depends in the effort you give it.  The only main concerns is the fact that not many can help, and if you receive help it would be through zoom or office hours which could be a bit odd. Overall it hasn't been to bad and I enjoy online school."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1857,"I like having classes online as it makes my life so much easier. This is also very convenient for me as I do not have to go to the classroom. I live in Berkeley, so I have to commute if there are classes in person. I just feel I am able to learn the same way I would learn in classrooms and also feel more safe. When I struggle with something, I usually talk with my sister or just not do anything. I am taking a lot of difficult classes this semester and I feel like I am drowning in homework and assignments. There are times when I feel like my efforts are useless when I get a bad grade for an assignment that I studied so hard for. I tend to run away from my problems rather than face it head on, I feel like if I was able to improve on that aspect then I would be able to do better in life as well as in my class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1851,"While online classes have their benefits and downsides, I definitely think that online learning is inferior and has proven difficult both academically and socially. While online classes are much more mobile and easier to access, I don't feel that I am able to acquire the same level of knowledge and understand the lessons as well without being there in the class and being able to directly ask the professor a question, or show them what might be confusing me. Another thing that bothers me about online classes is that they don't allow nearly the same level of social interaction as in-person. While it is possible to perform some level of interaction online, it's harder to draw attention from a person and maintain a conversation without being able to see them face-to-face. I honestly think that issues such as these are really depriving myself and other students of a proper academic and social environment, though I understand why this is due to the circumstances of the pandemic."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1855,"Julia VidalOct. 21, 2021Phys. 232-02Week 9: ReflectionOnline classes have specifically impacted my learning because, as a more tactile learner, I have found it difficult to obtain the interactive style of learning from simply staring at a computer screen. On top of that, I feel as though the incentive to do well and the ease of remaining motivated throughout the entire duration of the semester has definitely lessened the longer I’ve remained in the remote style of learning. Despite my love for sleeping in and not having to drive to campus, find parking, and walk long distances to my classes, I truly do miss the in-person style of learning because I felt far more motivated and excited to learn about the different things relating to (and not relating to) my major! For self care these days, I have been mainly focusing on trying to drink more water. Drinking water has been something that I have found difficult to keep up with for the longest time due to how easy it is to forget about it. Considering that maintaining good hydration keeps me  from feeling too  tired or sluggish throughout the day, I have been making it a priority to drink more water throughout the day. Lastly, the main concern that I have for my learning and well being is that I think I am going to really struggle when readjusting to in-person learning again. I’ve become accustomed to waking up in the morning and just walking five feet to get to my laptop and attend class, so I can already predict that getting up in the morning and having to drive to class may be a difficult adjustment in the near future. For my well being, though, I worry that I may never achieve the same level of motivation for reaching my educational goals as I had had before the pandemic hit. Regardless, I intend on working towards being more self-motivational overall so as to prevent any declines in academic determination!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1868,"Reflection #4  I personally enjoy online learning, I feel like I have a lot more time on my hand and have more of rested mind. I have more time on my hands, because I do not live on campus or anywhere near Sf State. So, commuting to the campus will take me about 2 hours minimum to get to campus and about the same time to get back home. So that is one big stress let off my shoulders, now I have more time to relax and study because I am already home. I do not feel as exhausted every day, so it makes studying a lot easier because I have more energy. So overall, I really do enjoy online learning, even though I somewhat miss a class environment and having a closer connection with classmates and professors. I still feel like online learning is better for my mental and physical health."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1854,"Online classes have brought about some flexibility in learning. I am able to self-pace my learning where possible and complete the exercises at the appropriate time. Learning can be done at a time when I feel it's comfortable to do so. I can now spend enough time with my family and close friends and the fatigue that results from long commutes is now gone.For self-care, I regularly run around the neighbourhood and also go to the gym. Additionally, I have adopted a healthy diet, watching over what I eat by taking less junk food and incorporating a lot of healthy meals especially organic foods.The workload should be just enough such that it does not overwhelm the students. This will allow students to have a balanced and healthy lifestyle that allows them to engage in other extra curricular activities such as sports and social events.Overall, the online learning experience has been great and I hope it improves and continuous to be the norm in one way or another into the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1875,"Zachary Wong10/19/21PHYS 232Professor ViolettaReflection #4	For me, online classes have actually made learning pretty easy, for me. It has made it pretty easy for me because I am able to comfortably learn in a very quiet environment which is my home. When I am able to have a lot of privacy I can be able to concentrate a lot in the synchronous and asynchronous classes that I am taking this semester and the previous semesters when I was taking online classes in my community college. What I am doing for self care, I wake up pretty early around 6:30 a.m., then I brush my teeth, and fix up. Next, I drink a lot of water before lunch since I practice an intermittent fasting diet. One of the biggest concerns that I have for learning is that I am not able to work with other tutors on campus, and being able to show me what I actually did wrong with my solution to my answer, and being able to correct those mistakes on paper. One of my biggest concerns for my well-being is that I am not able to get out of the house that much, because I have so much due on the line everyday, and I feel that my mental health has gotten a little worse. Let us hope that I can get out of the house a little more."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1869,"In the last year, online classes have impacted my learning in a positive way. When taking an online class, lectures are usually recorded which means I have more time to listen during class rather than taking notes. In other words, I can focus on asking question rather than being occupied with taking notes. Due to the lectures being recorded, it allows me to review the lecture and focus on thing i dont quite understand. When it comes to self care, I feel that online classes allow me to take care of personal matters while still receiving an education."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1848,"Online classes have definitely impacted my learning and self-care both positively and negatively. As online line learning has been in session, my motivation for being in class and learning material hasn't always been there. Sometimes if I am at home, I would stay laying on my comfortable bed while attending class and I did not learn anything on those days. I had learned that I have to drive to the library in order to be able to learn the material being taught. Going to the library makes me concentrate what is being said in class. This was important for me to learn because I'm learning more about myself and this will help me succeed in my classes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1375,"Online classes have impacted my learning in a positive and also a negative way. Overall the ability to stay home and take a course over zoom has a convenience to it. But I also believe this has negative impacts on the well-being of others, as well as the way people learn. This might not be convenient for some people since they probably learn better in a classroom environment. Also, having classes online may impact ones learning since not many people feel engaged in the course. It might seem like they are just taking the course but aren't learning anything. This is probably a big issue for a lot of students, as well as people might not be taking the time to focus on themselves and it shows in their lack of motivation in zoom classes. I like to space out the work thats given to me so i dont feel overwhelmed with a bunch of assignments that are due the same day. I also like to study for a couple hours a day so i dont get behind on the topics being discussed, since its really easy to fall behind, especially over zoom. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1872,"Classes online have helped me manage my time a lot better than I have before. Having to travel and manage my assignments in person was difficult, and time consuming. I really enjoy doing my assignments comfortably at home."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1852,"Online classes have been very hard especially at the beginning of the year. I would sometimes have internet issues and other circumstances that affect my online learning. However, as time passes by, I get used to taking my online classes online. In terms of practicality, I think that online schools have been helpful. I saved a lot of money for my transportation, food, etc. I have also saved my time by not having to wake up too early to get ready for school and drive/commute. Moreover, I am able to help my parents by taking care of my little brother since I'm always home ever since the pandemic started. For self-care, I save some time for myself. I'd usually watch movies or shows to get relaxed. I also go outside for walks and do some stretching to clear my head. These activities are usually enough to get me calm and have a clear mind.There are some concerns regarding online learning. I usually get frustrated whenever my laptop disconnects from the internet. If we ever have a big internet issue, I get scared that I don't get to turn in my work on time. Lastly, I worry that I'm in front of a computer/laptop during most of my day which is bad for my mental health. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,282,Online school has made classes much harder for me. The in class learning really gives me the motivation to keep going but these online classes dont have the same effect. I will say that these labs are the closest thing I have right now to in person classes so these are still prettty fun. For my own well being I try to limit things that distract me but I have ADHD so its pretty hard for me. For some reason those in person clases kept me more engaged.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1860,"Online classes have allowed me to take more classes than I feel like I could normally, although the material seems to get lost because of this. It is almost a double edged sword, it makes it so easy to get lost in the mess of it all when all you have to do to negate all your progress is log offline. If you manage to keep your motivation throughout an entire semester, then you will be able to accomplish much more than a regular semester. Although, I feel like it can get really easy to give up especially in the environment many of us are learning from right now. In essence, it is easy to lose your self and that is what I was most worried about this semester. It is easy to just turn around from a computer screen rather than turning around from an actual live class. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1861,"Reflection #4I think online classes have their own advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are we can learn by just sitting at home but, there are many disadvantages. I think the very first thing that we lack in online learning is experience. When we are on-campus, we interact with many people. Some students are busy creating some awesome project or some sharing their experience they had during their internships. Also, we can take help from professors as I think when we interact with somebody face-to-face, we have better understanding. In online classes, it’s not like that, it feels like something is missing or we don’t get that feeling! In free-time, I try to learn some course regarding my aim like I work on Autocad and Solidworks. Also, to remain fit I exercise daily. Everyone should remain fit and eat healthy food under today’s condition. I think soon campus will open, and we will meet all together."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1876,"Online classes are rather difficult since there are more distractions than in person. For me, I have little siblings running around the house all day and screaming out loud. My phone seems even more tempting to use. I tend to meditate for about 15 mins a day and I make sure I go out to play soccer every once in a while. This helps me clear my mind and relieve stress."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1863,"Online classes have increased the amount of information that, we as students have access to. Now that class sessions can be recorded we are able to go back and review material. Even notes and power points are posted on online to help us study.That said, sometimes we have so much information that it doesn't help our general knowledge of each subject. In this case I am specifically talking about my physics 230 class. There the beginning of the semester I watched alot over the course videos and completed most of the homework assignments. Sadly for the first 4 or 5 chapters I did not take any handwritten notes because I thought I could refer back to them online. While I could during the exam all my notes ""Online notes "" helped marginally. I felt like I haven't learned much when I comes to the computational portion of the class. To combat this I have started working on the homework assignments much earlier than I previously would. I also started to take handwritten notes from the videos. Taking regular breaks to do something out side of class and starting assignment ASAP have been helping my well being. Being able to finish the assignments at least a day before it is due helps me become less frustrated with the assignments"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1098,"I personally, prefer in-person classes rather than online, although, it is not hard but I believe in person classes really makes the class more interesting. Especially for labs since we do not really get to use the lab equipments and it's not hands on, just watching videos and lectures makes it a bit boring. In general, online classes isn't awful since we are all working and attending classes by ourselves at our own comfort spot. I believe online classes can makes someone more independent in a way because now we have to figure out what we need to do, contact the professors or classmate when needed and sometimes need to keep track of timings and schedule. The only concern I have which is a big one is time management. Having planners for assignments and quizzes, and alarms for classes really helps keep track of my school work."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1864,"Online classes have not been the worst sometimes I think it is hard to communicate over zoom rather than participating in an in class setting. I think especially for a lot of Maths and Sciences it is almost preferred to have them an in-person setting. But since I have been online for all of my college so far it has not been the worst, I think sometimes I could learn things a little bit differently. I think it definitely has taken me a little bit longer to do certain homework's, but as long as I take notes I seem to retain most of the information I need to know. The only thing I am very concerned about is being able to make sure I can remember things from previous classes that may help in future classes other than that I think I have been doing well in an online setting. For self-care I try to limit the time I put myself into doing homework. I prefer to do homework in the night time, but if I know I need sleep I try to get some other work done before. I also play a lot of video games with friends and it is something I try to do maybe every other day so I can relax and talk to friends and have a good time since life is already stressful enough. I forgot to mention this concern and it is with every class is just making sure I get the grade I am trying to work for and that could be difficult because sometimes I just have off days and sometimes I am doing great. "
