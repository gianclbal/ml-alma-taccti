2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1852,"One of my greatest goal right now is to be able to graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in Civil Engineering. Once I obtain my degree, I want to have a good job that pays good money. In this way, I want to be able to pay back my parents with their sacrifices and by bringing us here to the US. Living her has been a struggle, especially in the beginning. I also want to be able to go back to my hometown in the Philippines and visit my family there whom I haven't seen in six years. Once I have a stable job, I would also want to be able to travel the world!In the present, I should be able to pass all my classes. One of the things that this class can help me achieve my goals is by learning during the lectures and doing all my homework. When I do my homework correctly and understand the concepts for this class, then it'll allow me to take a next step which is to take another physics class. Since my classes build on to each other, it is important that I succeed my current classes first.In conclusion, I need to pass this class so that I can move on to another class that could lead to obtaining my degree."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1864,My overall goal college wise is to graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Civil Engineering. While working towards the degree I want to be able to gain lots of experience that could be from different internships. It does not matter to me something that will help me further understand what I want to do with my future. The way I plan to achieve this is working diligently and working hard with other peers because I know I can reach out to people within the class and ask for help. This class has really been something that has opened my eyes on that idea of working together and has kind of brought me out of my shell. As long as I can keep the idea of teamwork up it will help me because I know I will not be able to do everything on my own. If I were to talk more specifically about this semester I would want to pass all my classes with an A which seems possible as long as I keep trying to tackle the difficult concepts and further understand them.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1863,"My goal is to of course pass this class and the lecture version of physics 230. So far physics 230 is going well but it seems like I have fallen behind by a week. This maybe because the homework’s are due a week later than the material schedule . The physics lab, so far has been helping me review the topics that I should have already known or watched. By the professor going over the topics on the power points it helps me understand the homework and the course videos. This class also helps me out because it is earlier in the week so it forces me to cover at least some of the topics before the homework due date. This week’s topics has also been very interesting because electricity is practically all around us. By use covering this topic it is helping me learn more about the world around us. I’m not exactly pleased with my current study habits. I think I could be more efficient with my time management but I have to say the topics we are covering makes me appreciate the class more than I normally would. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1868,"Reflection #2     My goals for this class are to understand physics more, I understand physics is not the easiest subject, so understanding this subject and teaching other people about it will be very accomplishing. This lab will help out by truly understanding materials we go over class, because we have hands-on assignments and a lot of visuals which help us understand the material a lot better. In lectures it is a little harder to understand because we only talk about the material instead of going more in depth, by being hands-on and understanding how the material works in the real world. I believe thus far the professor is doing very well with the material, she explains the topic well to where we can understand what’s going on. Another thing that would help is explorations not being so long, we might just try to finish the assignment if it is longer than usually instead of understanding what we are doing. so far the assignments have been good and easy to get through"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1860,"I want to be an engineer. A civil engineer to be exact, and a straightforward, shallow answer would be that this is just a prerequisite course I have to take for my major. Although, there has been a lot of things I have learned from my classes and it is that each one makes me more and more curious. In general, I just want to grow as a person with each class I take and this one is no different. I hope to soak up as much as I can, and also gain more ambition from what confuses me to do more and garner more knowledge.  By gaining that ambition and curiosity, I'm bound to be able to achieve any goals I have in mind. In all honesty, just staying on the straight track will be the most difficult part, and not losing motivation."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1865,"My goals are to obtain a degree in electrical engineering, develop a deep understanding of engineering and land an engineering job after college.

2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1856,"My goal after graduating is to get a career in crime scene investigating at first and eventually move up to become a forensic scientist. This class is helping me understand the physical influence that can occur on an object. By understanding the basic concept of physics, I will be able to determine how elements in my future career were made. Due to the lab being online, the program that is instituted to improve our understanding has been a great help. It allows me to interact with the current concept in class and allows me to play around to see what factors can affect the result. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1850,"This is a very interesting question but very helpful. obviously, I want to get better and improve my skills in the category of physics but my goal is to just keep on getting better every day. which really relates to how I think about everything I do. As I soccer player I always think about how can I get better and improve. and I do that by working hard and staying consistent at what I do. Which relates to this class. And what I can do to achieve this goal is by doing all my work, staying on top of any assignments, going to class, and keeping an open mind, and trying to learn every day. That is how and why I will achieve my goals in this class"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1855,"Julia VidalPhys 232 LabReflection #2My goals are to simply learn how to understand my field of study better and more concretely than ever before. Every lesson brings me a new understanding of a different aspect of science and ultimately helps me develop a more well-rounded, educated mindset towards my major and my scientific interests. Because I want to go into the field of medicine, I find that it is important for me to understand the various ways that the world works around us, as people heavily interact with this world and all it inhabits. Therefore, because I truly believe that each lesson brings me more knowledge towards my field of interest, I believe that this class can support me in achieving my future goals by simply allowing room for error and approaching my mistake with guidance and support. With this teaching style, I truly believe that my interests in science will remain strong and will keep me passionate about following through with my career plans."

This class is a requirement to get to that goal and I plan on using the skills learned in this class in my career. I know that the logic and knowledge I gain from this class will benefit me in one way or another when I'm trying to problem solve. Although physics is not my strongest subject because its concepts are a little more difficult for me to grasp, I am confident that this lab course will help me get through my physics course that is taken with this lab. My physics course is asynchronous and a little hard to follow, so having this lab has helped greatly with understanding the topics that I don't get formal lectures for. I don’t completely understand how this course contributes to my computer science degree, but I know that there is a reason this course is required and I will benefit from the lessons I’ve learned."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1867,My current goal is to pass this class so I can continue working on my major. This class can help me achieve these goals by understanding various types of problems to help me understand other materials from my other classes.

I have always had the desire to know how the inner working of these devices. One of the goals I hope to achieve by the end of this class is that this class will equip me with the necessary skills to repair devices, tinker with the components, design and build.   This class involves the study of electric potential which is a concept that is widely applicable in various components that are used in electrical devices. Through the lessons from this class, I am able to understand what is a charge, its composition, types of charges, it's effect on other charges, how it moves and also its application in our daily life. I am also able to learn about electric potential energy, potential difference, electric fields and how all these are applied in our daily life outside the physics lab."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1857,"My goal is to pass this class with a good grade and I am willing to put in the work. There are so many assignment every week and it just feels so overwhelming but I just need to try to best to do what I can and not give up. I want to turn in all of my assignments and all the work, I just hoped that we had more time to do the lab because it is hard and requires more time to understand the topic and how everything works so we can do our labs smoothly. I have been trying my best to not fall behind but there are times where I missed some assignments. I just hope that from now on I don't fall behind and hope that I can turn all my assignments on time. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1861,"This class will help me clearing my concepts in Physics which will help me achieve my goal of becoming an engine designer. Chapters like Thermodynamics, Heat, etc are an essential part. Also, in rest of the engineering classes there are few principles that we have to learn in Physics. I practice many type of problems in this class that boosts my confidence of problem solving. I try to solve the problems like very fast, I practice my calculations without calculators and try to solve equations in least amount of time, that would boost my calculations skills and will help me in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1876,"I am a civil engineering major and I want to become a worker in the civil engineering field who spend a lot of time time on the job site and less time on the computer. I want my job to include the infrastructure of bridges, roads, buildings, or underground pipes. This class will help me learn basic ideas of how materials and gravity affects these things and that way I can have a great foundation!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1872,I don't have goals pertaining to Physics as much as I do for my major. I decided to take Physics because it is mandatory for Computer Science and really no reason else. This class can help me achieve my basic goals by helping me learn basic understanding of Physics for use in the real world and basic knowledge in electromagnetics.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1851,My current long term goals are to complete college and attain a degree in a field I know I will thrive in and be able to sustain myself with. I want to be able to start a career I know I will excel in and be able to make a reasonable difference in. I believe this class may help me achieve my goals by helping me better understand the concepts and topics that I need to be aware of as part of this course. This course will help me prepare for the rigorous material and subject matter that is to come as well as help me understand how to approach it in a way that will help it make sense to me.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,602,"One of my goals is to get good grades in all of my classes so that I can graduate on time. Anther thing I've always wanted to do is able to be involved in school organizations and activities. Despite the fact that I only had one year of college experience, I attempted to keep up with the events at San Francisco State, but you can't always keep up with everything. This class has helped me by keeping each other informed about what is going on in and outside of the classroom. It doesn't matter if it's for homework or school events. Communicating with your peers might make you feel as if you're a part of something. I believe that given enough time, I will be able to achieve my goal."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1853,"I have long and short term goals. Some of my short term goals are to pass this semester, learn how to high jump and jump 40ft in triple jump and 18ft in long jump. Some of my longer term goals would be to buy a house, find a job I enjoy going to and becoming a better me. I think this class can help me with passing my classes this semester. I’m not sure if this class can help with anything else though. I think most of my goals are something that I have to work for and work on. I think this class will be great towards working toward my dream job and making money to be able to buy my dream house. I feel like the little things in life add up and make a difference in the long run. As long as I have confidence in myself I think I will be to do what I want and dream."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1848,"My goals for this class is to understand the concepts being taught pretty well. This will help with my general knowledge of physics and help me with my future as a civil engineer. So far, I've been understanding the topics being taught in this class' laboratory sessions. The laboratory explorations and activities have been helpful to me because of the simulations that have been included. Whenever I am stuck, the simulations help me answer the questions that go along with the activities."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1375,My goal is to graduate and be able to find a decent job in programming. This class can help me achieve my goals since it a requirement for my major. This means I have to pass in order to get the credit and move on to the next thing. This class can also benefit me in many other ways since it is a physics class. The things I learn here can be mostly applied to real life scenarios so I'll have expanded my knowledge on the topics that we discuss in class. In this class I'm basically giving it my all and keeping an open mind in order to pass and get the credits I need.

For this class, I am willing to work with others whenever, I don’t know what to do next for the lab exploration and being able to answer questions thoroughly on the lab exploration. Working with others helped get the assignments done quicker and they’re able to help me understand the subject or topic a lot quicker, which means I am able to proceed right away with the virtual experiments that we do in the class. This skill which is willing to work with others is able to help me manufacture a well made and thought out video game. If I didn’t have this skill at all for this lab physics class, I wouldn't be able to excel as a great game programmer in the working industry.  					 				 			 		"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1866,"A few of my goals in life are to graduate with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering, get a job in the city, and stay in San Francisco. Being in this class will help me graduate and achieve my goals. It will by giving me the base knowledge I need in order to become an engineer. Expanding my knowledge of physics will allow me to succeed in the future when I start designing buildings or whatever construction I need to do. Another one of my goals outside of just work and school is to eventually buy a home and raise a family and I hope by obtaining a great degree like engineering will allow me to do so. I really enjoy the city so I feel that one of my most important goals is allowing me to stay and live here. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1849,"My goal is to learn about everyday life and everyday objects and how they act and how to act in the world. This is important to me because I want to know why things happen, how it happens and what happened. If I just don’t notice it then I would just be wandering around aimlessly trying to do this with luck instead of a proven solution. The most important thing I would say is to learn how to apply these things into everyday life when I learn it and that is what I hope to get from this class and having good group to do labs with and so that we can enhance each other’s understanding of the topic is a good way or maybe good start for me to learn that. I do think that maybe having real life applications for example problems may be a little hard and detailed, but it can also give us an idea for how the topic can be applied in real life and I like that you gave us it for challenge questions and it being optional for those who want to learn more."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1862,"My goals are to graduate from college with my B.S. in Computer Science and get a job in the tech industry. I need this class in order to more on to my next round of classes. Completing this course will help me continue in my goal toward graduation. This physics course is big on teamwork which ties in to the tech industry which often requires for workers to work together in order to get work done. Although physics at first doesn’t seem to have much to do with coding, it is important in working with technology which will have physics concepts. My major is still a science major and physics is important in that regard. I also think the process of summarizing what we have learned and using experiments to discuss the concepts we learn in class is very important. Overall, the scientific process of this course is greatly helpful. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1098,"My main goal is to become a successful Civil Engineer, and someday opening up my own firm. To be able to reach my goals I  need good grades and be able to actually understand what is being taught to me. This class will help me achieve my goals since it is a required class for my major. Not just that but this class will help prepare me for the real world work experience. Learning physics is not only beneficial to my major but it is beneficial for all. Being able to understand how and why things work the way they do, can be really interesting and is important as well. Either to calculate the amount of force or mass an object can bear, or when the object might fail and so many other things that will be helpful to learn when in the real world. Being able to understand the topics well will help me later on in life, when applying that understandings, to build bridges, or building in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,282,"My goal for this class is to understand physics better than I have in my past classes. In my other physics classes I've taken, I've had a hard time understanding a lot of the concepts. But this semester I'm taking a statics class, and it's really helped me understand vectors much better than I used to. So I'm excited to learn physics with a much better understanding from the get go. This class will help me achieve these goals because labs are what I believe to be the best way to learn physics. Hands on is the best way for my brain to understand things and these past online classes have been tough. I really appreciate the many physical labs we do in this class. The other physics class I'm in is alright but its hard for me to understand the lectures, but the combination of labs and the lectures really helps."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1859,"My goal is to graduate and be able to apply the knowledge I learned in my classes to the real world in a work scenario. Whether I end up working for a tech company as a programmer or working on a film studio. This class will help me achieve my goals by giving me knowledge that can be applied to any scenario that involves a basic understanding of electronics. I know my goals seem rather vague, but I would rather have a vaguer goal with room for flexibility and change than a set goal that will get me stuck because of impossible to overcome obstacles that will get me nowhere. These types of classes always prepare me for the real world because of the problem-solving skills they teach and the fact that they also teach or train me to remain calm and collect while we solve problems under a tight deadline and tons of stress."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1871,"I have realized that my goals were drifting away from reality when I started to not complete all of the labs. I am tryin g to get better with this class and other classes as this semester has been very strange because of my living situation. All in all, my goals are to finish school with an engineering degree. This class can help me because I am learning different concepts and ideas to put to use in the present day and future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1874,"A current goal I have in my life right now is to graduate college and apply to PA school to become a PA in the future. This class is obviously part of the requirements for a BS in CHEMISTRY at SFSU so passing this class would take me in step closer towards my goal. I would like to pass this class with an A grade and I know that I will have to work hard in order to do so. My goal connects with this class because physics is present everywhere in the world. Physics can be used to describe anything and it has relations to chemistry as well. As I am working towards my chemistry degree, this physics class will better help my understanding of how certain things work like for example we have already talked about electrons and protons and how they react in the electrical field. Subjects like that will definitely be resourceful when dealing with certain problems in chemistry. Physics also includes a lot if math, which can also help with chemistry like inorganic chemistry quantum numbers and quantitative analysis. "
