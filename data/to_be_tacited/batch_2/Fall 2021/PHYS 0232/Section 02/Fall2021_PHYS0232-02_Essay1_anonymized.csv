2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1851,"The main reasons that I want to go into the STEM field are because I've always had a fond interest of computers and I believe I am capable of taking this interest to the next level and making a career out of it. I find skills such as programming and developing software interesting and something I would greatly enjoy doing once I have all of the skills I would need for it. I also find that this field of expertise will continue to become more and more important as time goes on and technology further improves and evolves. As it continues to evolve, there will continue to be a higher and higher demand for people with programming knowledge and general computer knowledge overall. I find that technology will play a large part in how humanity grows and adapts in the future, and I think it will be very important to understand how it functions and how to make/repair it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1852,"I want to go into the STEM field because of my own choice and passion. I believe that the STEM field is one of my strengths. I have been interested in solving math problems rather than writing a paper. There is also a bit of history on why I chose STEM and civil engineering, specifically. When I was a sophomore in high school, I was invited by my math teacher to join an engineering camp called ""Discover Engineering."" I was immediately interested not because of the work I was going to do in the camp but I only knew that I was going to have fun since it was a whole new experience for me. When I was in the camp, I actually enjoyed the activities. We were put into groups to build the strongest bridge that is made out of wood. Our team was the first place in the bridge component but after our presentation, we didn't have the best score. The year after, I had join the same camp. I knew that I actually like building the bridge and I knew that I could improve my skills when I was in the camp. With a new group, I was assigned to do the bridge again where I came up with the design of our truss. Our team ended up being the first place out of 10 groups that were competing. Up to now, I still have the bridge that we built which reminds me of 'history' on why I am pursuing Civil Engineering. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1853,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field? It all started in middle school when I decided I wanted to join the MESA class. One or first days in class, we got to build the straw towers. This was the start of my interest in STEM. Our next assignment was the popsicle stick bridge. This was so fun making a sturdy bridge out of sticks, wood glue, and sandpaper. The next year my partner and I made it to compete for our bridge and it lasted a long while. This class was where my interest came from. Seeing people building and just having fun with whatever engineering they were comfortable doing. I love to build and create things. STEM is a safe place for me to think and relax. It’s a place where I don’t have to worry as much and kind of just have fun with it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1854,"When I was young exactly in grade two, my mom told me that I’m going to be smart in math because she was giving me and my older brother a math test one day before our exams begins. I finished the test so quick and having full mark, then I helped my brother on his test because I saw him struggling. I managed to solve a multiply problems and I’ve not learned it at school yet! When I was in high school, I was better than my mother in math and she is a teacher in math. All this story brought me to begin my journey on studying engineering which has to have a lot of math. On the other hand, having engineering degree in my country could put me on place to work that have a very good salary. I also wanted to be a dentist put I couldn’t get the scholarship for it. Engineering sounds fun too!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1855,"Julia Vidal, 08/30/21Phys. 232""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?""I would personally like to go into the STEM field because I have always had a deep fascination with understanding and learning about the world around us. As a STEM major, I am able to feed into my curiosity while also obtaining the necessary knowledge required for me to obtain a career in the scientific niche that most interests me: medicine. While simultaneously having a passion for learning about the world around us, I have also always had a fascination with learning about the ways that medicine can help humans live more comfortably among the various conditions and or diseases that many individuals live with every day. Thus, I learned quite quickly while growing up that I wanted to help people in the future. I would like to help the scientific community better understand how to treat various health conditions while also contributing to the research done towards developing cures for currently incurable conditions. All in all, the reason I want to go into the STEM field is because I would like to pursue a career in medicine that will give me the opportunity to learn about and contribute to modern medicine and the development of life-saving medication and procedures."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,602,"I want to go into the STEM field because from what I remember mathematics has been my favorite subject in school. I want to make sure I like doing something every day, and one way to achieve that is to pursue a career in the STEM field. Additionally, STEM education teaches you how to solve problems in our daily lives. You never stop learning new things and it challenges you to think bigger. My goal in the STEM field is to be an engineer and help others in the community. I'd like to begin working for a company and get experience working with engineers, with the goal of eventually owning my own company. I know it won't be easy at first, but if you set your mind to it, you can accomplish it. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1856,"The reason I want to go into a STEM field is that it deals with a lot of varsities. I wanted a career that was not going to be the same thing every day. Although I might have to repeat the same experiments, I will be working with different materials in order to help solve a case. I want to become a forensic scientist. However, I want to go down the route of working alongside the police or government side. This is why I decided to get into chemistry and why I am heading into a stem field. Ever since I was little I was always amused by how cases were solved through the chemical aspects. But as I arrived at college I had no idea what I wanted to do. I kept bousing around ideas to see what did I truly want to do. And forensic scientists stuck with me I changed my major to chemistry and criminal justice. I like that I am able to help a family and friends get closure for a loved one. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1857,"My major is computer science and I chose this major because it's interesting and facsinating. There are so many new things to learn every day. I want to create things and develope websites and apps to make life easier. I have always been fascinated with the things we see online. Seeing these amazing websites makes me inspired and also want to create similar things in the future. I also feel like there are not a women in this field and thats also the reason why I chose this major. This major involves critical thinking, problem solving and communication and these are the skills that I would like to acquire. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1858,"I am interested in the STEM field because I feel that this field is very vital to our development and advancement as a society. Everything in this field has led us to major discoveries and I want to be part of that in one way or another. Personally, I was introduced to the STEM field at a very young age but what really hooked me was my website development class in my junior year of high school. It opened my eyes to the many possibilities I'd have in my future if I were to pursue a computer science degree. To me, work in this field does not feel like work, rather projects to be worked on. It does not feel like busy work, it feels like something that constantly has something to be improved. There is always something new to learn in this field and that's my favorite part about it. I know that in my future I will never be stagnant because there is always bigger and better to achieve. Although I don't know exactly what I want to do, I know that I want to see technology improve and become more convenient/accessible. We have come so far in the name of technology and I know there is so much more potential left to be discovered. The invention of telephones and televisions alone have come so far since they were first built, they've become smaller and gained more interactive features that one could not even think to have in the beginning. I want to be able to contribute to such advancements and create a world that we could have never imagined."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1859,"I want to go into a STEM field because I have always loved science. It was one of my favorite subjects in elementary school all the way up through high school. I love the curiosity that goes into being in STEM and how we use that curiosity to push our understanding of what the world is and how it functions. As a child, I was always fascinated with computers and how they worked which is another reason why I find myself in a STEM career as I felt that I wanted to better understand how these computers worked. My mom always tells me that when I was a kid, I wanted computers for Christmas when others wanted toys and such. As a Computer Science major, I feel that it will help me to better understand the software side of computers which is where most all human interaction between computers and people resides as we use Operating Systems to help the computer interpret what we want to so and software are tool sets that use the computers hardware to help us perform a task. For as long as I can remember, I have always known how important computers would be and having a career that revolves around them would mean I would never be unoccupied."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1375,"Im currently majoring in computer science which has a blend of all STEM subjects. I chose to go into STEM because computer science fascinates me. Since I was young i really enjoyed playing video games and have always wanted to create/design one of my own which is why I'm pursuing a career in video game programming/ design, and by doing so I have to take STEM classes. Technology is evolving and I figured that I should get into something that will last a long time and be very beneficial to society. As well as there being a lot of job opportunities in this field that pay very well. I feel like this is a double win since i'll be doing what I enjoy while also being paid a decent amount of money. And i could probably be able to make a name for myself and contribute to society in a way. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1860,"Going into the stem field is something I had glorified since I was very young. Growing up around people in the construction and accounting, really narrowed the world down a little bit for me and I chose to be something in the stem field, and set my mind on it when I was still in elementary school. Civil engineering was not my first choice, I initially wanted to be an architect but it ended up working better for me to be a civil engineer. In all honesty it all worked out fine and I am currently happy going into this career and field because I really could not imagine myself doing anything else."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1861,"""Why do I want to go into the STEM field""Since, my childhood I have a great interest for cars. I just love cars. I attend Auto Expo every year to explore new ideas, concepts, designs, and technology. I like to learn about electric cars, sports cars, hyper cars, and formula-one. My aim is to become a car engine designer. I was so impressed with the movies like Pixar Cars, Tarzan the wonder car, and Ta Ra Rum Pum that boosted my interest for cars. I also have approximately 200 hot wheels cars collection, other than hot wheels I have many R.C. cars and even many characters from the movie Pixar Cars. There are many new concepts that are getting discovered day by day that may help to totally improve and change about cars. I practice on AutoCad to improve my designing skills. My major is Mechanical Engineering.  I have many new concepts and ideas in my mind that I can’t share. And that’s the reason I took the STEM field to achieve my dream of becoming a car engine or powertrain engineer."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1862,"I want to go into the STEM field because of my interest in Computer Science, the availability of jobs in my field, the relevance of STEM subjects in the future of technology.  I got into the STEM field because of my interest in coding. I wanted to be a programmer so I went after a computer science degree. My interest in technology is also the main driving point for me. I would like to create A.I. and be part of creating new groundbreaking software that will make a difference in the world. I find the way computers work to be fascinating, I'm interested in dissecting how these machines work and how to push the boundaries of what is possible. STEM is a field where there are plenty of job opportunities. I won't have to worry about not being paid well or not being able to find work with my degree."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1098,"""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?""I want to go into the STEM field, first because I prefer science over literature, english classes etc, as it makes sense to me. I feel like studying things related to science is more beneficial to me because science explains the reason why almost everything is how it is. We learn real world problem solving skills. I want to be a Civil/ structural Engineer and design/build bridges, roads and maybe buildings. It is really cool how they build bridges, with precise calculations and structure, to help the bridge or anything last long and stay strong. STEM can also help improve creativity, boost curiosity, help improve our critical thinking skills as well as help us see the world in a better way. Being able to create something with the knowledge of how to create what you want is really fascinating and I wish to be able to create something that would benefit the community. The average salary for STEM field majors are pretty as well, with an average of $70,000 annually."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,282,"I want to enter the STEM field because I really enjoy Mechanics. I'm studying to become a mechanical engineer, and I've always been fascinated with how things work and interact. I think that I am best with math and science compared to other classes, and I think it would be the best job area for me. I like learning about new technologies we’re developing, and also how to develop projects of my own. Last summer I got really into microcontrollers, and the summer before that, 3D printing. I’ve always had projects I'm working on, some better than others, but every new project I start tends to build on my previous knowledge, and so I’m constantly learning how to do new things. Now my classes are all either prerequisites for engineering classes, or those engineering classes themselves which is exciting. I'm not sure exactly what type of job I want to go into, but it will definitely be STEM based."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1863,"In middle school we had a presentation from a near by high school about the few academy’s that they had. One of them was a tech academy which taught students how to repair computers and learn more about computer networks. After spending 3 years in that academy,I decided to join the stem field because I liked technology. I always found it fascinating how it continually evolves and how people use it everyday. I chose computer science because I liked the freedom that it provided. There is a huge community that creates content to help new people grow in the field. I appreciate the fact that I don’t need to fully graduate from any college to study computer science and practice the things that I have learned. I also joined the stem field because I like to be hands on. I like to take the skills that I have learned and try to use it for my daily life. While some of the things that I learn does not apply to daily life, just seeing how I could have applied it also makes me happy. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1864,"Since I have been a little kid I think I have always thought about being in the STEM field. It was something I felt like I would prefer to be in for many years rather than pursuing something else. For the longest I thought it was the right thing for me. There also is the aspect of it being a well paying job depending on what you do with STEM. I would rather have done something in STEM compared to anything else because every single letter that STEM represents is something so important and interesting to me, but I decided to focus on one thing and that was the Engineering aspect. It also makes my parents proud even though they wanted me to be a doctor for the longest time. I neglected that idea because it was just something I could never see myself in. Personally, the STEM field has something I always encountered in elementary, middle school, and high school so I thought why not do something that will keep me intrigued for a long time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1865,"I want to go to the STEM field because science and technology are responsible for the advancement of our society. Without these fields, our world will not be as advanced as it is today, where we enjoy many luxuries such as phones and computers. Specifically, I want to go to the engineering field since engineering deals with problem-solving and using creativity to solve real-world problems. It is a great feeling to solve a complicated problem since it grants gratification. With engineering, you have the potential to change the world. Additionally, technology is one of the most important aspects of our society. Without technology, we would not be able to utilize platforms such as Zoom. With STEM fields many new forms of technology can be made such as electric vehicles, which are all the rage right now and we are very close to seeing self-driving cars on the road soon. In the STEM field, there are many careers with great job outlooks in which you can pick one that grabs your interest."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1866,"The reason why I am in the STEM field is that I am a civil engineering major. I choose the major because my parents always told me that I should become an engineer when I was older. This is because ever since I was young I excelled in my math and science classes. I also showed a lot of interest in those classes and always enjoyed doing the work because it came pretty easy for me. Another reason why I choose a Stem major is that I know the jobs with a STEM degree tend to pay more than other degrees. I think it is very important when I am older to make enough money to live comfortably. Lastly, I choose civil engineering specifically because it has to do with construction. I have always loved designing and building things. My Dad also has been an architect and is now project/construction manager and my grandfather worked in construction as well. Their work has always interested me and I hope to work in that field one day as well. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1867,"Why did I choose the stem field? Honestly, I'm not entirely sure on why I chose the stem field. If I had to have a reason, I would say that I want a stable job where I can make enough money to pay for my lifestyle and to support my future family. I want to be financially free for my future family. Does technology fascinate me? Yes, I was always been fascinated by what technology is able to do since I was in middle school. I want to be apart of the future and hopefully be able to create something that will help people with their everyday life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1868,"Reflection #1    The reason why I wanted to get into the STEM field was more for my family, particularly my father. My dad was an engineer in Afghanistan, at a young age he had to leave his country due to war and to give his family a better life. So, about two years ago I decided to pursue Civil Engineering, so I can live my father’s dreams and honestly, I am very happy I have chosen this major, because it is very interesting. I enjoy this major, because I am a fan of mathematics when getting the correct answer after so many steps is very rewarding. Another class I enjoy is physics, because it’s all around you and it’s all real-world problems that we can fix or learn more about. So that is the reason I have joined the Stem field and I could not be any happier with my decision. Yes, it is not easy but with consistency and determination I will get it done."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1869,"Hello, my name is Christian Mcglothen and enjoy technology as a whole. My major consists of Computer Science and I am required to take this course to obtain my degree. My favorites hobbies consist of Programming, Sports, and Video Games. because of interests, it has lead me to pursue a science degree.  I hope as I further my education, it will allow me develop software and become successful. While taking this course, I hope that it will challenge me and give me a better understanding of physics in its relationship to computer science. Last year in physics I enjoyed the lab activities along with the communication of fellow students hoping this will transition into the new semester. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1870,"Why do I want to go into STEM field? While science and math have always been my best subjects, I wouldn't say that it's purely for that reason that I want to pursue a career in STEM. They both have always interested me beyond the classroom, specifically sciences. Wanting to understand why and how the world spins were just a natural part of my curiosity. This became especially true when I took chemistry my Sophomore year in high school. From then on I was amazed at how different chemicals reacted and the products they created with one another. Taking a career in medicine has always been a goal of mine so stepping into pharmaceuticals seems like a logical step for me. So I'm now currently trying to get my Chemistry degree and then pursue a career in pharmaceuticals."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1871,"I have always been interested in joining the stem field because of strong interest in problem solving. Problem solving is something that I have accelerated on in the past couple of years. However, I learned that I still need a lot of practice in order to perfect it. I also like to look at life in a different direction than other people. I realized this when I was in high school. While taking a physics class, I was opened to the suggestion of studying a math or a science in college. That is when I realized that I would succeed in physics that had both math and problem solving skills that worked hand in hand with the math courses I was working on. My family comes from a field of sciences and I believe that I am also able to follow in their footsteps and succeed in the stem field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1872,"I believe that jobs in the STEM field are necessary for the development of this society. STEM careers also contribute to furthering knowledge of the studies for future generations. STEM is always progressive, and essentially keeps the world running. The importance of STEM is always a major stepping stone for our future. I want to be a Software Engineer. My job requires being diligent in coding, software, and efficiency. The reason I want to be a Software Engineer is because it is always evolving to fit the shape of our future, it is focused on tech in this world that revolves around tech, and it pays a lot. Most importantly, it makes other jobs easier, making lives easier, and our society easier for people in the long run."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1873,"As an overall field of study, STEM is the one I believe that I can have the most positive impact on the world. It gives us the information we need not only to understand the basic structure of everything around us but enables you to continue to learn and research what we don't already know or understand. I like studying things that have object answers and don't depend on someone's opinion or how something can be viewed. Most everything in the field has an objective answer and way we can solve it. It gives us the tools we need to be problem solvers. I was always interesting in how structures are made and how they can stay standing and the materials that are used to make this happen. I'm studying civil engineering to understand this and hopefully to help create or understand new materials that can improve the quality of construction and create safer and longer lasting buildings. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1874,"I want to go into the STEM field because of a couple different reason. All my life I was never really enjoyed subjects like English or History. I was good at Math and Science early on in life. As I got older I started to like math an science a lot more than other subjects. In high school, math and science were my two best subjects, but math felt very tedious to me at this point. I found many different possible careers if I majored in something with relations to math, but to be completely honest this felt really boring to do this my whole life. So I chose to go with science. Science has the opportunity of keeping me close to sports with my profession as I love sports as well. I came into college as a KIN major in hopes of becoming a PT, but eventually changed my mind. I thought to myself if I want to do this then I might as well do this all the way. I ended up switching to become a CHEM major because one day I hope to become a PA. I will have to attend PA school after completing my BS in CHEM, but that is a story for another time. Long story short, the reason I chose to go into the STEM field is that I have always enjoyed science and becoming a PA gives me the opportunity of having a secure profession with the benefit of possibly staying close to sports. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1875,"Zachary Wong8/31/21Phys 232Reflection #1		I went into the STEM field because I am very fascinated by technology and I would love to know how technology brands such as Tesla, windows, and mac function and what they use to build the program to be able to make it function. STEM is a big part of how technology functions and what is the proper logic to build things like an electric car, a computer, and maybe even automated cars, and robot chefs and janitors. To even create a few technology items such as robots, video games, and automated cars, we have to sometimes figure out what the math is to make them function, what are the physics part to it, and it will require some coding to be able to create a robot, an upcoming video game, automated cars, and robot janitors. You have to have years of experience and knowledge to be able to execute these things so that is why I went into the STEM field. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1876,I liked the stem field because I want to go into civil engineering. I have some friends that are upper class men that tell me this is a good major. You have to put a lot of work the first few years but afterwards it gets much easier. I have talked to civil engineers and the way that they describe a day in the job as a civil engineer fascinates me a whole bunch. I also have some experience working alongside engineers as in my previous construction job the engineers would come on site to sign paper work and what not.
