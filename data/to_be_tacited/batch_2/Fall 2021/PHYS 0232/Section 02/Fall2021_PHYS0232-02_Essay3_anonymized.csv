2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1851,"One concept that I am particularly curious of is that of Circuits. I didn't know very much about how circuits work nor the structure of how they are powered. This information may prove helpful in the real world by helping people perform maintenance on circuits and other electrical equipment, such as when a fuse goes out or becomes damaged. One question that I have in regards to this topic would be how high of a charge could a fuse protect the device its plugged into? Could a large enough charge possibly burst through the fuse and cause damage to the grid or other device it's plugged into? "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1859,"A concept that was covered in lab in the last few weeks would have to be the Circuits lesson as it is one of the few concepts anybody can apply in real life. The concept covers different types of power outputs for batteries when they are wired either in series or parallel. The question I formulated with this concept is as follows: “I have created a small battery powered robot that requires 3 volts of power using AA batteries. A single battery has a voltage rating of 1.5V a cell, how many batteries do you need to power the 3V robot and what wiring method do you need to achieve the proper voltage?”      The answer to the question is a requirement of two AA batteries wired in series. When we wire batteries in series, we double the voltage and keep the same amperage. If we would have wired the batteries in parallel, we keep the same voltage and double the amperage. Using two AA 3V rechargeable batteries with a capacity of about 1500mAh would grant us 3000mAh if wired in parallel. Depending on what we want to achieve we chose the proper wiring. The rule of thumb here is Series for more power, Parallel for longevity."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1098,"What is the reason for the formation of solids and liquids in nature?Electricity and Magnetism (E&M) is the reason for the formation of solids and liquids in nature, not only that it is also the main reason for the operation of most of our electronic devices. It is important to know about the different charges, positive(protons), negative(electrons) and neutral(neutrons). Charges are all around us, we also possess charge in our body. E&M is also responsible for the functioning of our nerves, heart, brain, muscles, etc.. It is responsible for everyday life events, from lights to cars. Like charges repel and opposite charges attract.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1865,"One topic we have covered in lab class that I found interesting and applicable was the short circuits lab. Circuits are everywhere, they are in homes, cars, appliances, and computers. When there is too much current (flow of electrons) then a short circuit could occur and can permanently damage the appliance such as a light bulb. A fuse prevents an appliance from damaging by protecting the appliance by terminating the current in the circuit to prevent further damage. fuses need to be replaced. This is applicable to people's lives since fuses are important in our homes since if there's too much current, then a fuse would blow or combust. For example, on a cold winter day, you turn on your electric heater on high setting and then use your steam iron to flatten your clothes then there would be too much current since a lot of power needs to be delivered to turn on both the heater and steam iron, so you will get a blown fuse and all your power will cut out in the area. This has happened to me before and the fuse stopped the flow of current to save the appliances. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1861,"The concept that I chose is ""Circuits"". When it comes to electrical circuits, there are two basic varieties: series circuits and parallel circuits. The major difference between the two is the number of paths that the electrical current can flow through. Possibly the most noticeable series circuit at home are Christmas lights on a Christmas tree. Admittedly it is not a daily life example but more like one in 365 days. Often lawnmowers have two switches in series with each other so that both switches need to be pressed before the mower will turn on. Dimmer switches are actually adjustable voltage dividers referred to as potentiometers in the electrical engineering world. From a circuit analysis perspective, you can model a potentiometer as two resistors connected in series. The connection or junction point between the two resistors is where the wiper arm is located to vary the resistance. You can connect resistors to a device load in order to avoid exceeding the device’s power ratings. For example, you can connect a resistor in series or in parallel to a device wherever you want to limit the voltage across and/or the current through the device.The Wheatstone Bridge is a circuit used to measure unknown resistances. Mechanical and civil engineers measure resistances of strain gauges to find the stress and strain in machines and buildings. The bridge network has three precision resistors and one unknown resistor. Two of the known resistors are potentiometers, which are adjusted to balance the bridge network and thus determine the unknown resistor. The accelerometer uses a Wheatstone Bridge arrangement of strain gauges."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1854,"How does Ohms Law affect our daily lives?  Is it current or voltage that kills? There have been numerous debates regarding this particular question with some people arguing that it is current that kills while others argue that voltage is the one that kills. According to Ohms Law there exists a relationship between voltage, current and resistance. This relationship can be expressed as:  V = IR, where V is voltage, I is current, R is resistance. Humans have an internal body resistance of about 100 Ohms between the ears and a resistance of 500 Ohms from finger to toe. In whatever voltage, it is the current that is pushed through the body that kills. It should also be emphasized that without voltage or potential difference there would be no current. We can conclude that both voltage and current play a role.  Application of Ohms Law can also be seen in our households through the lighting system, heating system and through other electric components used in the house. Electric heaters have a coil that has a high resistance which provide heat when current is passed through the coil. Bulbs in the house have a wire with relatively low resistance that heats up and glows when current passed through. Fuses also have a low resistance wire that burns out when a high current passes through. This disconnects the circuits and therefore ends up in protecting electric components from damage."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1858,"In the past few weeks, we have been building our knowledge on circuits, electric fields, charges, etc. In regards to charges, how do they interact with each other?Charges interact by attraction or repulsion depending on what their sign is. Like charges repel and opposite charges attract. In the case of a neutral charge, neutral charges are attracted to any charged object. For example, a neutral charge may attract a positive charge or a negative charge. This is easily seen with putting a balloon to hair. When a balloon is rubbed on hair, the charges are transferred and the hair suddenly becomes attracted to the balloon. Knowing that opposite charges attract and like charges repel is beneficial because it gives us background knowledge in regards to static electricity. For example, creating sparks through friction and transfer of charges. If you rub your feet on carpet and touch something like a metal doorknob, a spark or some sort of shock would be created. This is due to the difference in charges. By having this knowledge about charges, we would be able to be more cautious when it comes to things like this and learn to ground before coming into contact with something that could pose harm. This is also evident in magnets in a sense, they are attracted to each other which tells us that their poles are of opposite magnetism."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1869,"In our previous lab, we learned how the size of a conductor can create a combustion. in the lab, The small sliver will combust because of the joule law of heating principle. Which states that heat produced in a wire is directly proportional to the square of the amount of constant flow through it. Due to the silver being thin and small it was not able to handle the amount of current the battery produces and hence burns and combusts.It also combusts easier because its small size means its less resistive to currents than if it were larger.This relates to the fuse in our house or car because the larger the fuse is (large aluminum sliver) the more resistant to the current it is. Depending on how sensitive to current changes we want our circuits to dictate whether we use a small sliver fuse or a large sliver fuse."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1874,"The topic I chose to formulate a question comes from week 4 and talks about infinite vectors. I understand that vectors can be used in real life to find and object's force or velocity, but I question what knowing about infinite vectors will do and how it relates to us in our everyday life. For example, folding a paper twice so that it creates a hollow triangular tube will need a minimum of three vectors, one for each plane. However, if we were to take another paper and make a hollow cylinder tube, it will be described with infinite vectors. What do the vectors actually mean though? Whether it is a finite vector or infinite vector? Well basically, area vectors tell us the flux through a certain surface. This is actually easier than using the mathematical equation of taking the surface area and multiplying it by the field strength and angle. Area vectors make solving certain physics problems in class and real life easier for us. The area vector will require the object/surface to be flat or else it can not be described with a single vector. The minimum amount of vectors needed to describe and three dimensional object will depend on how many planes the object has. The area vector will always be perpendicular to the flat surface. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1849,"Just last week we talked about circuits and I was wondering how big the system has to be in order for it to be used in the world. You are going to get a lot of energy from solar panels and windmills and wire it to every house, put a fuse and just how simple it seems. It feels as accessible as water. I was wondering, what would happen if just one thing went wrong? Obviously there would be backups and emergency protocols if it were to happen, but what if the energy source stopped. First everyone would be upset and it would also cause a bunch of problems elsewhere such as driving with no traffic lights or other stuff. Another thing is that what if the fuse were to not work and there is an overflow will things explode/combust. It’s hard to imagine that over my whole life nothing like that has happened. It must be a really solid and full proof system for that to work so well. I am really curious about what it is now. This is really real and I hope that there will be future physics explaining or showing ways to prevent all these tragedies. It will be really nice to learn extra safety knowledge."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1853,"How are electric fields formed? First, an electric field is the physical field that surrounds electrically charged particles and exerts a force on all other charged particles in the field, either attracting or repelling them. It also refers to the physical field of a system of charged particles. Well to answer this question, the space surrounding a charged object is affected by the presence of the charge; an electric field is established in that space. A charged object creates an electric field - an alteration of the space or field in the region that surrounds it. Other charges in that field would feel the unusual alteration of the space. In an electric field, there are positive and negative charges that are placed on a field, and the sensors surrounding the charges will either attract or repel the charges. The longer the arrows are from the sensors, the stronger the forces will be. If a positive charge is placed in the field, the sensors will repel the charge and the arrow will point away from the charge. If the charge is negative, the sensors will attract to the charge, resulting in the arrows pointing in the direction of the negative charge. The same goes for just regular charges. To of the same signs will repel and two different signs will attract."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1872,"One concept in labs that can highly benefit society is common knowledge of batteries, in our case, our last lab. So many people have trouble staring car batteries because they don't know which wires go where, and it's a very common occurrence. If a lot more people were informed on how batteries work and how to properly make a circuit, we would have a lot less batteries blowing up."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1876,"How does my learning of circuits from last week connect to the real life world?A circuit is made up of wires that are designed to allow electrons to pass through. A battery provides the force that makes the wire work. Work is done at the rate of power. This is the amount of energy that's used to complete a task. Your house's electric circuits carry the charge that flows through them. When used properly, these components can provide useful energy for various tasks. The US standard household voltage is 120 volts."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1850,"We learned many concepts in this class where I feel as if there is so much useful information that can benefit many. From electric fields to circuits.... the list goes on, as one of my favorite things from this course is the fact that much of the information we learn in this course is useful in the real world/everyday life. One concept that we learned in this class was charges. In short, charge is defined as the basic physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when kept in an electric or magnetic field. Charges are seen in basically anything and it can reflect many things for example when a balloon is rubbed on one's sweater or hair you can feel the difference in charge which is pretty cool. The fact is although this is a real life example the main idea that i took from charges is one energy. If one person has positive charges it will reflect in a positive way/charge. but if one person has a negative charge it would reflect in a neg way. That's something that I learned that relates to the real world. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1866,"Why is does the electrical field get weaker the further you are from a charge? In week two we learned about Electric fields and why the electric field gets weaker further away you get from a charge. This is because according to Coulomb's Law the distance between two charges determines the amount of force of attraction or repulsion depending if they are the same or opposite charge. To me, with this information, the first thing I think of is the cellular connection or wifi connection that our phones get. As you move further away from a cellular tower the bars go down on your phone and the bars represent how good the connection your phone is getting with that tower. This works the same way with WIFI because the further away you go from a router the weaker the WIFI connection gets. This is good to know because we can in the future somehow make connections stronger somehow with the knowledge we have. One example in today's society is the new 5G data connection that is supposed to be stronger and faster than 4G or LTE data. They must have somehow found a way to put out a stronger electrical field which in turn gives us a better and faster connection.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1857,"There is so much current being passed around. We live comfortably because of current, we are able to have lights in our homes, devices in houses that make us do work efficiently. I wonder who thought of these inventions and how they made them possible. In the 17th century, William Gilbert was the first to study and to use the words electricity and magnetism. After that inspired by many scientists like William Gilbert and Benjamin Franklin, they started experimenting and so came the light bulb and so came the batteries. Thomas Edison was the one that invented the lightbulb and then came many more scientists like him who came up with new ideas and utilizing them to make our world brighter and comfortable. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1848,"For this week's lab we went through electrical currents. We learned that electrical circuits come in either a series or parallel arrangement. Electrical circuits must be connected together with a battery, wires, light bulbs, etc in order from electrical currents to flow through the circuit. If there is any opening within the circuit, the electricity will not flow properly in a consistent loop. If there is an excessive amount of electrical current flowing through the circuit, a short circuit will occur. This applies to our everyday lives because there are circuits everywhere. Some examples come from our cars and homes. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1864,"Why do charges of opposite signs attract and why do signs of the same size repel? If we think about it as electric fields, negative charges have fields that are pointing into the charge. Positive charges have them pointing outwards. Now if a negative electric charge is paired with a positive charge since their electric fields are pointing in a certain direction it allows them to retract. The electric field of the positive charge is going to point into the electric field of the negative charge. Another way of saying it is the negative charge is accepting the electric field of the positive charge. That is why charges of opposite signs attract. Now charges of the same sign repel because there is no way the electric fields can go into one another. Positive charges are always pointing outwards so the electric fields are not able to attract because their electric fields are the same. The same thing applies for two negative charges since they are both always pointing in there is no way for the electric fields to attract to each other so they will always repel each other. I think electric fields are the easiest way for me to understand if the same signs attract or repel because I could always visualize the idea of the electric field lines."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1856,"What is the best assembly method to use in a circuit to receive the most energy during a flow? Would a parallel or series work best?The best method to use would be a series because the structure of how the circuit is allows both objects to receive the same amount of current through the entire flow. When the objects are in a parallel method it takes the current longer to activate both objects because it has more paths to go through before it reaches the end and restarts. For example, if we are looking at how the power banks are placed during these two methods. We can conclude that when the power bank is in a series their initial amount of voltage is now combined since they are connected. The first wire will be attached to the top bank and will end on the second's bottom bank. If the power banks were coming from a parallel method then the currents flow will have two flows but the voltage will remain the same as the bank the flow is connected to. The power banks are unable to combine during the flow "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1875,"Reflection#3		Circuit lab might be generally applicable to people’s lives because this is to be able to help us follow simple instructions to be able to apply your knowledge of what to do to be able to manufacture things like a lego set, a tech robot, or maybe a printer machine.  In the lab they said, first, get 1 aluminum foil, 2 1.5 V batteries, and scotch tape. In the real world you will need tools to be able to manufacture something. Then they say make a wire with your clipper. Next, Cut two strips of aluminum foil about 15 cm long by 2 cm across.  The dimensions do not matter greatly, it is all right to estimate. Then, Fold the two pieces in half and then in half again to make two long thin pieces of foil. Next, Pull off a piece of tape a little bit shorter than the foil and encase the foil in the tape. This will insulate your wire. Finally, Leave the ends exposed so you can make electrical contact at the ends. Do this to both pieces. If you’re able to follow simple instructions like these in a physics circuit, you can be able to manufacture anything you want by just simply following a specific set of basic rules. Also, it helps give us an expectations vs reality idea, when you try to manufacture something. For instance, when manufacturing the circuit, we made a prediction on, Should you connect the batteries in series or parallel to get the highest potential difference? Why? And our expectations were wrong. Finally, when we observed what actually happened, when we tested it out and answered part 3, applying your knowledge, I was able to see what actually happened. This ability is able to understand what actually happens when you manufacture something in the real world. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,282,"Selecting the last lab we finished, how would you wire your house, parallel or series?From last weeks lab, we learned a few things. An electric circuit in series will have all its components in a closed loop, meaning electrons will have to flow through each component. In a parallel circuit, components are wired in such a way that they share common electrical points. This means that when electricity is flowing through, it splits along the different paths. So should you wire in series or parallel? Well it depends what you are wiring if its lights that you want to turn on at the same time, parallel is perfect, as each light will use the same voltage, and they will be the same brightness. In fact, this is the case with most components in a house. Think about outlets, you would want them to be in parallel so your devices get the same amount of energy."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1867,"What are circuits and their application to people's lives.A circuit is a closed loop that electrons can travel through. There are open circuits and closed circuits. The open circuit can stop the flow of electric current while the closed circuit allows the flow of electric current. Some examples of the uses of circuits are light switches and computer power supply. For the light switch, you can stop the flow of electricity by just flipping the switch. If it is switched to open, the light would turn off. If the switched is flipped to closed, the light would turn on."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1852,"What is the difference between putting the batteries in parallel and putting them in series?Batteries are in parallel when two(or more) batteries are put next to each other. Then, a wire is connected positive to positive and negative to negative charges of the batteries. Batteries are in series when the batteries are put on top of each other. The charges of the battery must be: negative to positive and positive to negative.The difference between putting the batteries in series and in parallel is that one would have a higher voltage. The batteries that are put in series have higher voltage than the batteries that are parallel because the batteries in series will have a higher voltage or has larger ""height."" Moreover, we sometimes need to find a value for the current by combining the circuit elements. This could be done depending on the batteries' position (series or parallel)."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1855,"Julia VidalReflection #3I personally found this most recent lab to be incredibly important considering that it speaks about how the increased number of obstacles in an electrical circuit can have different effects on the way that current reaches those obstacles.  A general rule of thumb is that the more obstacles powered throughout a circuit yield more resistance in the system which then causes less energy flow through the energy source. With this in mind, it can be asked: Is there a limit to how much one power source can hold and power? Well, the answer would be, yes! One energy source cannot power every single thing one may want it to. And by connecting multiple items that withdraw power from the battery, you are essentially reducing the amount of current that can be sent to each of the energy-withdrawing objects. For instance, with the circuit lab done this week, we learned that by adding more light bulbs to a circuit, the voltage remained unchanged but the amount of current within the system was usually reduced with the increased number of light bulbs placed within it. This was especially the truth when looking at bulbs placed in a series due to the obstacle placement and increased resistance within a junction’s branch. Understanding these concepts is generally applicable to people’s lives because it is important to understand that you should not overload one energy source with multiple energy-withdrawing devices so as to not cause a short-circuit situation or possibly even a fire."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1868,"Reflection #3     During this semester thus far, we have gone through a lot of different topics. While talking about certain topics we as a class have learned that practically all of the topics, we have learned so far is that we can relate them to our daily lives. One of the topics that I enjoyed were electric fields. I didn’t really know much about electric field before we talked about the subject but now that I have learned about it , I have come up with a question for electric fields. My question would be how would daily life would be different without electric fields? If there wasn’t any electric field on earth, we would lose very essential items, one being the cellular phone. Nowadays you cannot go anywhere without seeing a phone with a person. Without electric field there would be no radio transmitters, so we would be taking away long distant communication from everyone if we did not have electric fields. The only communication we would have would all have to be in person or through letters. Which makes the world not as progressive. Without electric field the world that we know would seem very foreign and people would feel lost without their phones."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1860,"The previous lab was really helpful in just following instructions and how crazy easy it can be to make something that is interesting. Like the last lab, how we were building our own circuits to perform the lab and it was really interesting finding out how those simple instructions could then manifest in every day life to build something and to create something in the real world. Also, we can also use what we know to build off of what we have done like how to place the batteries in the circuit and so on, in order to build upon and make what we have better. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1862,"On the topic of circuits, a question I would formulate is, “What is the most efficient way to set up a circuit?” In the last class we made a series circuit because that would get the highest potential difference. That way the whole current would flow through each component, unlike a parallel current that would go through each battery. With a series the voltage increases, this is why series circuits are used for lighting so often. They can handle more voltage and use heavily insulated cable in order to handle it. A parallel circuit uses multiple pathways for the circuit, you see this with wiring in most buildings. This is important for people to know so they can get the most out of their appliances. If we had made a parallel circuit in last week’s experiment. The voltage would have been far less, not allowing the silver to combust and would require another wire.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,1863,"The circuits lab is a very important lab that can be applied to everyday life. Today we are surrounded by electricity. Having some basic knowledge about it can prevent accidents and give us more confidence in situations where you must deal with power.                     In the circuits lab we learned about series and parallel circuits. In the experiment with the batteries, we saw that the series circuits caused the “fuse” or the foil to combust much quicker than the parallel circuit.  This is because all the current flowed through one path. Making it much easier to short circuit. On the other had the parallel circuit has multiple paths which the current has to flow through.                   From this experiment we can apply the knowledge to our daily life. For example, if we are fixing a computer, and we are looking at the components. We want to be careful with capacitors, power supply etc. If were to intentionally try to remove a capacitor with a metal screwdriver while the computer has recently been on, we will cause a short circuit. Like in our experiment the foil in the middle created a quick path for the current to flow which caused it to combust. Sticking a screwdriver could potentially do the same thing if you try to remove a capacitor with power stored in side."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,2,602,"What is a circuit and how is it used?A circuit is a closed loop that many electrons travel in. For a circuit to work the way it should it needs to be set up the correct way. There are two ways to set up the circuit to get the highest potential difference, that being being parallel or in a series. For it to have the highest potential difference it should be in a series. An example of a circuit is the wires made up of conductors and some other components that allows electricity to travel on the the wires, like the lights switches in everyone's home/house. When the fuse stops working you need to go and change the old fuse with a new one. Its important to know the basic information about circuits because later you can compare it to your real life situations."
