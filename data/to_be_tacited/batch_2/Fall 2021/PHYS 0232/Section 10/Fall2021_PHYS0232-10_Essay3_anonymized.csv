2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2052,"One topic that was covered in lab the past few weeks is the topic of electric field. A question I have about the electric field is how would the electric field change as more charges are added and if those charges are closer to each other. The answer to the question is that it depends on the type of charge but the electric field would get stronger as more charges are added and as the charges get closer to each other. The formula kq/r^2 is for the formula of the electric field where q is the charge and r is the distance. As more charges are added, the field becomes stronger as the electric charge is proportional to the electric field. When the distance separating the charge gets smaller, the electric field also becomes stronger.The strength of the electric field applies to real life because most things we own run on electricity. One component of electricity is the electric field. For example, when we turn on a light or when we use our phone, electric charges run through the appliance where each charge is contained in an electric field. Electric field and electric charges can benefit society because understanding electricity can help us understand how to control electricity and power to make sure we have power to survive as a society. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2060,"An electronic circuit is typically composed of solo electronic components such as resistors, capacitors, transistors and inductors connected by conductive wires causing electric current flowing. Electrical currents tend to direct and control currents in order to perform various tasks such as signal amplification. Every electrical circuit no matter how large or small has four parts, an energy source, a conductor, an electrical cord, and at least once controller also known as a switch .An example of circuits are freezers and refrigerators, the elements in the circuits allow the temperature to change causing both to become colder once it starts to get hotter, the temperature control switches until the temperature drops. Electrical circuits are important to our society because they allow devices to receive energy such as batteries or generators and many devices around us such as chargers, lightbulbs, and computers use electrical circuits in order to function. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2057,"Why are fuses important?Fuses are important for safety reasons. They are made of thin material and will combust when too much current goes through them. Too much current might go through because houses usually have appliances in parallel, so when more appliances are on, the more current there will be. The fuse acts as sort of a one-time switch. The circuit is closed if the fuse is intact, but once the fuse combusts, the circuit becomes open and there will be no extreme current going through any appliances later in the circuit.This is beneficial to society because it means if you're circuit gets an extreme amount of current, you will only have to replace a fuse instead of all the appliances on the circuit. I think just about everyone can see why that might be favorable. I personally have never had to deal with a blown fuse, so it seems like electricians have done their job well, but it is always better to be safe than sorry."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2048,"One of the concepts we've covered has to do with the current in circuits. We see this in our everyday lives through the electrical appliances we have in our homes. Current is the flow of electrons or electric charge through a space/circuit. There are parallel and series circuits. We have fuse boxes and circuit breakers in our homes. Circuit breakers are arranged in parallel in order to handle more current because if they were arranged in series, the current flowing would get slower with more load added to it. Fuse boxes are arranged in series to protect them from overcurrent. This concept helps us understand how electric current flows in our homes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2066,"The concept that I am selecting is current. My question is at what point do currents stop working. From this week’s lab I can answer this question. We saw during the simulation that when a wire or battery or anything was disconnected the electrons would not flow through because it needs to be connected in order to work. We also saw that you need to connect it in a specific way, or it will not turn on because the wires and batteries and circuits need to be placed in the right order and pattern. This would help benefit society because currents are literally used everywhere. It is used to light up lightbulbs, in cars, in electricity, in houses, etc. It is used in common household objects like remotes. Whatever requires an electrical connection, there will be current there. If we did not have current, then we would not be able to have many things. Even our phones have currents where it has multiple wires that connect in order for the phone to work and store things. It is used even at a grocery place where the cashier is for the conveyor belt. It is used in cars when you press down on the brake pedal. It is used literally everywhere in the world and without it we would not be able to have many things and it’s a very useful concept."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2050,"Knowing how much voltage is being used at once can help benefit society as being aware of how much we're using up at once would discourage us from using a lot at once. In addition, using too much voltage could occasionally cause a power outage, and seeing how this could affect many others, it can make us weary of how much we're using at once, and we could try and find other ways of using less power at once, such as buying solar panels."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2063,"out of all the weeks we had and learned from ever we started from week 1, I'm choosing week 7, the concept of Currents. The question I'm going to make and answer is "" Why is current important or why should we care about it ?"" The reason why I chose this week is because I didn't fully understood how batteries gives the power to out devices for everyday use. In the class, we learn what is used to connect a battery to power a lightbulb and saw what happens if we add more lightbulbs and stuff connecting to one battery. Using this knowledge helps understand and adapt to use how many electrical sources it takes or need to power a building, a room inside or turning a tv or a computer. We need to know this because if we don't, we won't be able to use electric stuff like the stuff i listed earlier. In today's society and how things are done online, it is very important. If we didn't know how to do this by back then, we wouldn't be able to make advances in technology or science and we would be stuck at pencil and paper to write down and turn in work."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2061,"The topic that I am going to be talking about is circuits. circuits are in our everyday lives, from the homes we live in, to the technology that we use every day like phones, computers, and televisions. The reason we want to build circuits is to make electricity do useful things for us. The way we do that is by putting things in the circuit that use the current flow to light up, make noise, run programs. Recently I learned of two types of circuits in this week’s lab. One is a series circuit and the other one is called a parallel circuit. It is very important to know the difference as they have different applications. A Parallel circuit is one with several different paths for the electricity to travel.  A series circuit comprises a path along which the whole current flows through each component. Parallel circuits are used in homes because loads can be operated on their own. For example, if a series circuit was used, the lights would be dimmer with the addition of more lights, and also in parallel circuits, the res of the circuit works even when there is a malfunction in a part of the circuit such as a light bulb out of fuse."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2055,"Why does aluminum foil spark when there is too much volts going through it? Depending on the size of the aluminum foil sparks may happen. If the volts going through the aluminum foil is too much for it to handle then the aluminum foil will start to heat up and combust. To make the aluminum foil withstand more volts it would have to be a bigger piece of aluminum foil. This can be applicable to people’s lives because we deal with electrical appliances everyday. For example computers, blow dryers, phone charge, etc. They all use electricity and they can all be shorted. That’s why a lot of them come with a warning that says don’t let water get on them. The warning is used to prevent short circuiting in the electrical appliances. If water did get onto electrical appliances it would cause a short circuit but it may also start a fire because just like in the situation with the aluminum foil sparking if there is too much volts going through it the electrical appliances will work the same way. Also if you put a metal object like a fork in the outlet where you usually plug in phone chargers or blow dryers you will get shocked because the current would go through the metal object and since you are holding it you will feel the shock."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2065,"Kevin Avedian - ReflectionThe topic that I have enjoyed the most is the short circuit. I found this topic the most useful because when we were doing the lab, we practiced and saw the reactions that the circuit could have if we did something wrong. A short circuit occurs when part of a current-carrying conductor touches or comes in contact with another wire or part of the circuit and gives the electricity a path of less resistance to flow. with this knowledge, we are able to actually make a bulb light up. I think that this ability can be expanded into so many other things which can be much bigger and could affect society in a big way. For example, for people who study short circuits, their study is used to determine the available fault current or short circuit current at each point in the system. People can also become power system engineers whose knowledge can easily determine the required interrupting capacity of the circuit breakers which forms the basis of designing a proper relaying system. Going back to the information we have covered, all I know as of now is how to light up a light bulb very easily with a closed circuit. Also, I have learned that aluminum foil is a great electricity conductor and that it can get quite hot if you touch the two ends of the strips if their ends are connected to each side of the battery."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2064,"A concept that we just covered this week was about electric currents. Why would theunderstanding of currents be something that we would have to learn for our everyday lives? Forme, I think that this would be a good thing to learn about because we all have electrical outletsinside of our house, which all have electric currents inside of them. Plus from what I learnedfrom this lab today, I figured out that all electrical outlets have a parallel circuit inside of them sothat all of the electronics that are being used near that area all have the same amount of electriccurrent. By having this knowledge, you can gauge the number of appliances you can plug inbefore the outlet gets overloaded with electricity. This can also be useful for someone who’strying to become an electrical engineer because having the knowledge to know this sort of thingwill be useful for when you are in a job setting and you need to take electrical currents intoaccount. That’s what I want to remember so that I can also use this for the future when I get myown profession or even my own house for that matter."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2056,"My question is how does these electric knowledge gonna help the people in every day live. By what I learn, these knowledge helps us to create stuff like computer, phone or any electric related things. With out that the entire world would be very different. we will be live like  how people live like 300 years ago our even more. So this has a great impact in our lives. No one that live 300 years ago can imagine how people live like now. The reason we will able travel around the world this quick and easy is because of the knowledge on electric. The reason that people can go to super market and buy what ever they want that easy is because the knowledge we know. So in conclusion, the knowledge of the electric change our entire life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2068,"Why is current important to our society?One of the concepts that were covered in class in the past few weeks is the one we covered today which current. This is always applicable to people's lives because of how technology always kept evolving until to the point where everything around us is electronic. Current has always been used to benefit society to power the different types of technology that we have and use all the time. Current has always been important to society today and ever since it was found and used because of the wide amount of applications that it could have. Especially one topic that we went into detail with, which was how a parallel circuit was used for household appliances. The reason why this is important is because and applicable to other people's lives is because of how it is always being constantly used. There are also many things that it can be used for such as heating up something to the storage of information. Current is constantly here in our laptops, phones, televisions, wires, etc. and it is getting to the point where it might just be a need to keep us alive. From lighting to heating and cooling, if electrons didn't flow at all then life would be very different than it is right now."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2047,"The concept of electrical current is extremely useful to understand as it can help the world limit their energy consumption. By saving energy, we can slow the effects of global warming even a little. Understanding that it is much more beneficial and optimal to use circuits in parallel rather than in series can allow people to put into perspective how they consume energy. Currents in series have more obstacles in the way of the current as resistors in series limit the flow of electricity. A circuit in series can suffer from too much energy consumption despite having lower amounts of current as the electricity needed to output everyday tasks can overload the circuit.If too many circuits are in series, a blackout has a much higher chance of occurring."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2059,"Last week, our laboratory went over circuits and the knowledge I have obtained from the lab allowed me to understand the different types of circuits, the relationship between voltage, resistance, and current, and how geometry affects resistance. Understanding this would help better people’s understanding on how circuits work and how to maintain them and use them effectively. The technology that we use in our daily lives that require a transferred flow of electricity will most likely be through a circuit. Our phones, computers, refrigerator, and lights are all examples of daily essentials that require circuits to function. Expressing the understanding of circuits to more people would allow for safer possibilities as people when be able to understand if something is wrong with their circuits or if there ever needs to be any reason to involve circuits in their daily lives."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2070,"The question I want to impose would be on how we can power a bulb with a battery. Throughout this lab class, we have learned and used simulation to find the answer for this question. When looking through my notes, I can answer my own question. It shows the concept of it and also, with the help of simulations, we can see how everything is connected and how the bulb receives its energy from the battery. Having that knowledge, we can say that we can light up a light bulb with a battery by connecting the two wires to the light bulb. Electrons flow out of the negative terminal of the battery, through the bulb into the positive side of the battery to make the bulb light up. this information is relevant until this day because we use lightbulb in our everyday life. It is useful to know the concept of how the light bulb takes its energy and in the future, we can troubleshoot our power source that is connected to our lightbulb whether if it's at home or in our car. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2062,"I have the question of why don't we use electric current to help people dry their dishes. This is a question based on my response in one of the lab summaries. I based on the fact that we could polarize water and attempt to lift it off of various plates, bowls, etc, and therefore dry them. I think that we don't do this because water is not the easiest thing to move with polarization alone. Water is not a conductor, so while the atoms on the surface may get polarized, the atoms deeper in the surface are not polarized. I feel like though that it is possible to make this work, even outside of dish drying. One method is to add conductor impurities to the water, which may make it easier to move the water after giving it a charge and moving it with the same charge or opposite charge, depending on how you want to move it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2051,"The concept of potential is something that I found very interesting, which is something that I can conceptually apply toward the stock market. So, for example, if my valuation prices a particular company much higher than the price they are currently being traded for on the market, then it would have a high amount of upside potential. Meanwhile, if my valuation prices a company significantly lower than what they are being traded for, then the stock would have a lot of downside potential. If valuation and stock price were charges, they would be opposite since stock price tends to want to move toward its valuation. The farther apart they become, the higher the potential gets in either the positive or negative direction, which is then converted into either capital gain or losses. I guess the only tricky part is figuring out what that valuation is.   Another way stock charts are similar to electric potential, is by figuring out where there exists lines of support and resistance, and estimating potential based on proximity to those lines. These lines and the stock price would act similar to like charges, since they act to repel the price of the stock. If a stock plummets, a support line of traders who refuse to sell a stock will act as a force repelling the price upward. If a stock rallies, a resistance line of traders who are taking profits will act as a force repelling the price downward. When the price gets closer to either the support line or resistance line, the higher the potential of the stock to move then becomes. I suppose the tricky part here is figuring out where those lines exist.And to get the optimal potential, we would have to account for valuation, support lines, and resistance lines. If their exists a stock price (positive test charge) and it is near the bottom support line (positive charge), its potential upward could be nonexistent if the valuation (negative charge) is below the support line."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2049,"What is inside a lightbulb that makes the current decrease in a series circuit? How is it an obstacle for the current and why is a parallel circuit better in distributing current to multiple light bulbs.A lightbulb is like a resistor but it transforms electricity into light by heating up a wire in a vacuum. If the wire wasn't in a vacuum it would start a fire since fires need heat, fuel, and oxygen to burn. The reason why current decreases on a series circuit are because there are multiple light bulbs in the circuit which causes resistance or obstacles for the current to go through. A parallel circuit is better at distributing current to multiple lightbulbs because it creates multiple pathways for the current to go through the light bulbs. This is also the reason why in a parallel circuit, different segments of wire will have different currents ranging from low to high compensating for the equal amount of brightness for each bulb and its resistance. Parallel circuits are also a lot safer since series circuits run only two wires to a light bulb which could break the light bulb easily but could short circuit the whole system."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2053,"One concept discussed in class which I have a question about is how to know where the current of a circuit would be the highest? When going through my notes from this week, I found that depending on the type of circuit and how many bulbs are in it you can determine what the current would be at separate locations. For example, if you are dealing with a series circuit you would know that the current would relatively be the same everywhere through the battery and wires. However, if you are dealing with a parallel circuit then the current would depend on how many bulbs are in the circuit the position where you are taking the measurement of current from? For example, if you are taking the measurement from around the battery then the current would depend on how many bulbs are in the circuit. While if you are taking the measurement from around the bulbs then you will get a lower number than if you were from the battery. This information might be generally applicable to people's lives or beneficial to society as most of the electronic devices we have today use circuits and being able to manage current so that the appliances don't overhead or combust is extremely important in conserving the life of an appliance and the health of the people living with it. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2054,"Electricity and voltage is essential to understand, since we use it everyday. People should understand how wires can only carry a certain amount of current before causing damage, and how to avoid it."
