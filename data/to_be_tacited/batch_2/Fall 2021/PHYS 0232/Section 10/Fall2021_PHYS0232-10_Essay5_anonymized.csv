2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2061,"My greatest takeaway from this class was that no matter what you learn through a textbook or sitting through lectures you will never have a good understanding of how the physics concepts, laws, and theorems are actually applicable to our everyday lives. You need to physically see the concepts being played either in a simulation or in real life. Because of the Covid 19 pandemic we, unfortunately, could not have in-person labs and as a result, the online simulations were of great helo to further my understanding of physics.  Before I took this class I always used to think that physics was just used by rocket scientists and high-level manufacturing engineers to prevent injuries and assure safties but that is not the case at all In fact, the deeper we went into the semester we went the more I started to realize that physics is just the study and observations of how our world works. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2058,The greatest take away from this class has been time management. Things have been hectic all year and they don't seem to be slowing down any time soon. It feels like just yesterday we were learning about charges but now we're two midterms into the lecture and 13 weeks in to the lab. There is a lot of information to take in every single lab along with a nice amount of work so it can be difficult to retain everything. Time management has been a big plus in this class and has helped me in the others as well.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2060,"My greatest takeaway from this class is learning about how critical it is to keep trying, practice difficult problems, and to not be afraid to make mistakes in order to learn something important. Being in physics in college is almost different from high school physics, the questions are more complex which can be a bit overwhelming at times but being in this class showed that it’s okay to make mistakes and to practice in order to have a better understanding of the material. Another important take away from the class is how to read a problem and apply what I learned even if I don’t necessarily understand how to go about the problem, I most likely have the necessary tools to do it but I need to work through it. Some labs were a bit challenging than others but I used notes from previous classes and ask my professor I can get through the material and understand the process"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2057,"The great thing about this class was that it really gave a hands-on approach to the things we were learning. This class helped me understand the topics we were going over as much as the main class, if not more. The small review sessions before the labs were really helpful as well.I'm not really sure what to say my greatest takeaway from this class was. It was all good but no subject really stood out from another. I felt like I got a similar amount of knowledge for every lab we did and they were always interesting.Something I did realize from this class is that Physics can be fun. I wouldn't say it's the most entertaining thing in the world but a lot of the other physics classes I have taken were just taught in a way that bored me so much. So this was something new. I honestly quite enjoyed most of the labs compared to my past experiences with physics. It could just be that the material is more interesting to me but I also think it had to do with the way this class was taught."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2066,"My greatest takeaway from this class was that I learned a lot about physics. I learned how to manage my time better and, I learned how to not procrastinate as much since assignments are due the day of. I learned about the many different subdivisions in physics and, I feel like I was able to go more in-depth this year than I had last year. I also learned about how to do group work online and how to communicate with your team and get assignments done. I learned how to do difficult labs at home and I learned how to communicate with the professor if you're not able to do something. I learned how it's difficult to have labs at home but there are alternatives to making it possible. I have realized through this class that good grades come from hard work and good time management. I enjoyed this semester. Thank you."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2050,"My greatest takeaway from this class is despite being surrounded by physics related materials in everyday life, understanding them is pretty difficult. But with a lots of studying and a good teacher, learning physics (no matter how difficult the process may be) can be pretty fun."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2048,My biggest takeaway from this class is that I was able to understand certain physics concepts much better than I did in the main class. It really helped a lot to go over some of the topics for a second time because it made what I learned to stick better. Some of the labs were pretty cool to me as well. I’m happy that physics classes have labs separately so I’m not too overwhelmed with learning everything in just one class. I’m not perfect at understanding all these concepts but I hope that after this class I’ll be better at it. Being able to work with classmates was also very helpful because I didn’t feel like I was on my own.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2049,"My greatest takeaway from this class was learning about electromagnetism, electric flux, and Gauss's law, as well as learning how to program something in the sage worksheet. In electromagnetism, we learn how the more wires used to make a coil will increase the magnetism of an electromagnet and how the Biot-Savart law relates the magnetic field to magnitude, direction, length, and electric current. In electric flux, we learned about the relations of area, direction, and magnitude of an electric field. In Gauss's law, we discovered the relationship of Electric field magnitude, the surface area of Gaussian surface, and charge. In the sage worksheet, we learned how to graph some of the 3D surfaces and calculate some of the equations we learned. Finally, the last thing I remember we learned was the parallel circuits and series circuits as well as the relationship of current, voltage, and resistance. We also discovered the difference between resistance and resistivity."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2063,"My greatest take away from this class was how to apply the lessons I learned from physics class and from this lab class and apply to everyday things and see it in a new perspective. Before the physics classes, I only knew that electricity powers this thing or it makes this work to push this other thing. The only other physics i learnt was from kids shows that was doing physics to do a funny punchline or show kids that learning physics are fun. But now I know more about how it really works, about what is actually happening to make the things move down to the tiniest thing we can see. While this can be fun to learn, trying to major in this or have a job about physics seems hard, it takes a lot of math and a lot of things to consider before finding the answer and you have to be sure all the units in the problem or whatever you're solving is correct otherwise it can be dangerous if you miscalculate and the building falls down or something explodes  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2064,"My greatest takeaway from this class would be the extra hands-on information that I gather from doing this class. Learning about certain things involving physics is one thing, but actually seeing how it can work by using actual physical examples is even better. It gives me better insight into what happens from a physics standpoint when seeing it happen in real-time. I would say it furthers my understanding of how certain things work when involving physics. I feel like if I just had a physics class without the lab, I wouldn't really understand it as much because I wouldn't see it happen in front of my eyes unless you had examples to look from. That's why I think that this lab is great because you can learn even more about physics when you see it in action because you can actually explain why that certain thing is acting that way specifically through a physical standpoint. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2062,"My greatest takeaway for me from this class is the information covered in the Week 11 and Week 13 lab. I did not know before this class that currents could produce electric fields and that magnets influence currents. I feel that this information is foundational to many of the electrical devices around, so my view of the world around me is now more complete. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2053,"My greatest takeaway from this class is how to perform experiments in a group online setting and the steps you should take when you do not understand the concept or question that is asked. In all my previous high school classes we would always have labs in person and it was easier to ask for help and receive help from the teacher or other classmates. In the two lab classes I have taken in college so far it has been a different experience where we do not have access to the same resources as before and have to adapt to find new ways to solve our questions such as communicating with group members or watching youtube videos on the concepts in doubt. Also, in this new setting, we can't see the phenomena first-hand in person and instead are subjected to an online simulation of it. This takes away from the connection that we get with physics and real life. To combat this problem we have to think of how what we learn applies to real life and realize these applications when we experience them. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2059,"My greatest take away from this class was how to work with a group in a lab. Although this semester was strictly virtual for me, I found that this lab was still very interactive and required us to communicate with other students when it came to break out rooms and working together to complete the lab. There were many moments were I truly enjoyed the labs purely based on the fact that my lab members were friendly and understanding but also focused. This would give me even more motivation to get through the entire lab because my other lab members would work along with me and we would be able to help or give each other feedback."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2056,"The greatest take away from this class is the knowledge on how physics or science affect our life. Every time when we do the lab it show us the application of the science the technology behind it for example the compass. Before I take this class, I know that science is important. It's affecting our daily life, all kinds of technology but I never know the science behind the technology but after taking this class it help me have a better understanding on it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2068,"My greatest take away in this class is that it is good to have my own hands-on experience in order to fully understand the concept that is taught in physics. I first get exposed to the content with lectures from my main physics class and the lab class right now allows me to put the information that we learned into practice, making me have a deeper understanding of the topic. Also with a hands-on experience with other people, it is way easier to learn a concept since we would be able to explain the topics to each other. Overall, I can take away that I should always work with others and to review content that I have just learned in order to gain more insight on a topic."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2055,"My greatest take away from this class is learning how to use sage because it is related to coding and I am a computer science major so it’s good to learn more coding options. I learned some useful things while using sage like plotting and doing calculations. Another great take away from this class was learning about RC circuits because there are alot of electronics that have a RC circuit. Some examples of RC circuits in daily life are traffic lights, windshield wipers, etc. RC circuit is basically a timer that activates something every few seconds. Also I learned that voltmeters are a good tool to have to find the electric potential difference. You can also use it to see how much energy is left in a battery and see if something is getting power. I had a lot of fun doing many different and interesting labs like the electromagnet lab where we wrapped a wire around a nail and connected it to a battery to make it into an electromagnet."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2067,My greatest takeaway from this class is a deeper understanding of electro magnets and magnetism. I joined the class with very little understanding as to how a electro magnet worked and the labs really helped me visualize how everything functioned. I learned about ohms law and the relationship between voltage current and resistance. It explained the applications such as capacitors and inductors.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2046,"My greatest take away from this class is that knowledge of physics can be useful in everyday life.  During my time in this course and the labs, we explored many aspects of physics and much of it can be applied to everyday life or to stuff we may encounter in our future careers.  Sometimes, what we learn in a class seems to have little to do with stuff outside of school, but from these labs a good amount of the topics we've learned could be useful."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2069,"My greatest takeaway from this class was the useful tools we have online to help visualize the things we are in the lab without being in the lab room, Having this as an alternative to not being able to do experiments in class has been very helpful. I also look more online and use these tools and simulations to help my understanding of the topics in the class that I am still struggling and it helps me see what I am learning which makes more clear for me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2054,"Lots of physics concepts are related. For example, I didn't know how magnets and electricity were related, but now I know it's nearly the same thing."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2052,"My greatest take away from this class is how a circuit works and how magnetism and electricity relate to each other. I will need to have a good understanding on circuits when continuing with my major which is computer engineering. Learning about electricity, how it works, and how electricity and magnetism powers our world are some of the more important things I will take away from this lab. I will also be taking away how to code In SAGE because coding in a mathematical language would also help in the future when I would need to code in a mathematical language. I learned a lot from making a simple circuit in the short circuit lab and making an electromagnet in the electromagnets lab about how current flows and how magnetic fields can be made from electricity. Overall, my greatest take away is how electricity flows and works In a circuit and how magnetism is related to electricity because learning about the fundamentals of electricity is one step to understanding a computer and electronic devices."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2065,"I would say that my best takeaway from this class was getting used to the applications of the equations and concepts we went over this semester. I know that this will only get more challenging, and I think that this is a great start to getting comfortable with hard problems. Also being able to analyze a problem and know what method you are going to use to solve it, is one of the most important things I have learned from this class because it not only helps me in physics and other subjects, but it also helps me in real life to think critically and have more tools for utilization. And how I can become calmer and more analytic in my decision-making. I definitely think that the fact that school was online made me learn less than I could have if the school was back to normal, and this is quite unfortunate because I am missing out on valuable knowledge."
