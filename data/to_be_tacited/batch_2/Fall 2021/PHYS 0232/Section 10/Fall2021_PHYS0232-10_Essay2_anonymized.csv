2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2048,One of my goals is to be better at studying. I don't retain a lot of information easily especially physics since it is the one science subject I don't really like. I hope this lab helps me understand physics concepts better. I also want to improve my critical thinking skills. Physics is a subject that really forces a student to work on that specifically because the concepts aren't just simple ones. The simulations and the lab explorations will hopefully make learning this subject fun.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2068,"My goal is to achieve an understanding of physics and to graduate with a degree in computer science. This class can help me achieve these goals by teaching me easier ways to perceive physics and it also helps me understand it by giving me problems to solve so I can achieve mastery. Another way that the work in the class helps with my goal of understanding physics is by leading me to the right path of how I should learn it. If I were to try learning physics myself, I might teach myself content that shouldn't even be introduced yet and it would be confusing for me. In the end, this class will ultimately help me reach my goal of graduating since it is one of the prerequisites for my major. If I didn't take this class, then I would not be able to get my degree since I would be missing one of the prerequisites. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2067,My main goal is to pass this physics class so I can keep on track in  college.  Passing this class will allow me to move on to more difficult  and advanced courses at SFSU and ultimately graduate from SFSU. I hope  to be challenged by the course and learn from the course. This class  will give me the tools and knowledge to move on to more difficult  classes.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2061,"Similar to every person in my age my goals continue to change as I grow and come in contact with new people and experiences. I have many goals in my heart I want to graduate with a good understanding of my major ( computer engineering ) and figure out which specific area that I want to get a job at and master. I think this class will help me reach this goal as Physics is the study of reality and when designing computer hardware you need a good idea of how the world works. This class will also help me get better at problem-solving as essentially physics is just solving the question about our complex and unique world. I am also looking into getting into motorsport engineering and for that, I will need to learn and master the ideas and theories that go along with electricity and magnetism, all of which I will be learning in this class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2049,"One goal I have is to learn about the world and its physical properties and hopefully apply what I learn to how I could improve other people's lifestyles by creating patents or inventions. Another goal that I want to achieve is to be able to create a program or AI to be capable of understanding our language and do tasks that would be menial to us, similar to that of voice recognition software such as Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa. To achieve these goals I would have to understand physics in the outside world and in my classes. I would also have to learn how to code a program in Java and other programming languages to be able to code something like Siri or Alexa. These two goals connect to the work I do in class because whenever I think about how the world works, I think about physics and biology since the world works on these branches of science. Programming Siri or Alexa connects to this class because coding requires some sort of background in physics to have great analytical skills which are used in computer science."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2059,"In this class, my goal is to obtain and hold the knowledge I receive in order to be prepared for my next physics class. I am a computer engineering major so my future in college will just involve more calculus and physics, which, truthfully, I am not that excited about. I love coding and computers but I was never the greatest at calculus and physics and also have a tendency to lose motivation in those subjects. I have always considered myself a student that keeps up with his work, but when it comes to calculus and physics, it is not that I do not do my work, I do, but it is that I do not get excited in those subjects because I have always felt confused, lost, and behind. Since I do consider myself lost, I hope that within this semester and the next semester, I can steady myself and that in the future, when I get a career, I hope that I will be able to understand and remember much of the basic concepts of physics from memory."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2063,"My goals are to learn how technology works and how I can learn and use it for projects and stuff I want to do in the future. What i mean by how technology works is that I was always curious of how the computer programs work and create the digital visuals we see today. If I can learn how it works and use it to apply on projects that I want to make, like creating my own program or creating a robot that helps around the house. If I can do that, I can make the world a better place or more sufficient. How this class can help me achieve those goals is by learning how physics and objects work when things collide with each other or with electric fields. By learning how it works, I could teach this to young kids that want to learn this so when they do go to college or decide what job to have, they can use that knowledge to help."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2057,"Honestly, my goal is to graduate with a CS degree and this class is required for it. Physics has never really been something I enjoyed, I usually just take it because I need to. So this class can help me reach that goal if I pass it. This class can be enjoyable at times so it is one of the nicer required classes.It is also good to learn in general. I'm learning new things in this class and it is more hands-on than the main class, which I believe makes it easier to learn the topics, especially in physics. This class can expand my knowledge of how the world works and that is never a bad thing, even if it does take a little more work than I would like lol.I'm not the person that thinks of long-term goals. I'm more of an in-the-moment/go-with-the-flow kind of person. I'm going for a CS degree because I need some direction at least, and I enjoyed working with computers. If it were up to me I wouldn't be doing any of this. All I really want is to have fun and live comfortably. Unfortunately, to live comfortably, you have to go through quite a bit of unfun stuff."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2051,"Right now, my short-term professional goal is to prepare for a CS internship this upcoming summer. This means that I will have to gather up personal projects, develop a personal website, study technical interview questions, and rewrite my resume. This class could probably help me achieve the sub-goal of gathering up projects I’ve worked on. One of my projects borrows from what I have been learning in my current and past physics and calculus classes. Most of what I’m borrowing isn’t so complex, like calculating instantaneous velocity; however, finding a way to make it work with a programming language is difficult for reasons I’m not so sure of. I believe that this class will help me in general problem solving and connecting the dots, which would most likely help me in optimizing my projects for interview.               Another goal of mine is to beat the S&P 500 yearly gains, which I think I am going to fail. This class will probably help improve my general reasoning skills, which would most likely help me to improve my investing skills."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2054,"I want to be able to better understand how to convert one type of data into another type of data, or take lots of data and produce a statistic. This class can help me with processing data and make sure everything is accurate when converting or multiplying data types. Things such as making sure data is in the correct units."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2064,"My goals are to graduate from college and get a degree in Engineering, specifically Electrical Engineering. The reason why I want to get an Electrical Engineering degree is that I think that it will be more of an important job in the future since that everything is starting to get in touch with technology more and more each day. After getting my degree, I would also want to intern in different companies to see which one is right for me and to also get more experience with how my job works in an actual work setting. Then I would want to get an actual job in a nice company, that resides in a good city that I am comfortable in living in. I also want to get a good house, one that has more than just one floor, a good community/neighborhood, good weather, and has a lot of different places where I can just explore. I also want to be able to get married to a wife, get children, and be able to share my own experiences with my children so that they can pass it down themselves, and so on. 	That’s why with this class, I will be able to achieve all of those things because I can use the knowledge that I can get from this class for my future job. I also need this class because, without this, I wouldn’t be able to graduate and get my degree in Electrical Engineering.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2065,"Kevin Avedian PHYS 232What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals? My main and ultimate goal is to work for NASA and experience what is going on at those institutions. I have always been passionate about working for such institutions, it could be an institution like the Space Force, or JPL, or SpaceX. Of course, in order to achieve such goals, I need preparation in such subjects and that is what I’m currently doing. I am taking a lot of physics and mathematics in which I am preparing myself for the challenging situation that is incoming. Also, in my junior or senior year of college, I plan on applying for internships at any of these institutions so I can ready myself for after college. This class specifically is an introduction to what is out there. I know I will be taking many more classes that will be much more challenging and this is where we start. So far it has been relatively easy, so as long as I study and do research on the things I don’t quite understand, I am sure I will be fine. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2062,"My goals for this class are to reinforce the concepts that I learn in the main Physics class and also to gain more physics knowledge for my fictional worlds. I especially like the labs since they do give me an opportunity to explore the concepts outside the set scenarios of homework problems. The topics that we discuss in physics class become more concrete and less abstract with the assistance of this lab. This helpful for allowing me to achieve both of my aforementioned goals, especially the second goal, since I feel more able to build on the ideas."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2069,"My goal in this class is to help myself better understand the concepts of physics better. It is also to better understand the conceptual theories I am learning in lecture and trying to see it through life and connecting it back to the concept to prove that the theory is right. I want to use this as a way to help me be a more efficient learner. I want to be able to understand why I am learning what I am, and why it's important to me and others around me. Knowing more about this will help me succeed in the future. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2050,"My goals would be to try and learn science in a easy yet efficient manner. This class can help me achieve these goals by simply teaching me in a easy to learn manner, include instances where I could discuss with my groups, and have a time where I could personally ask the instructor my questions on science related materials I'm confused with."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2058,"I just want to pass this class. I need it in order to obtain my degree. While I do find this class interesting, it does not align too much with what I want to do for work. I am really unsure what specifically this class can do to help me achieve my goals that aren't directly related to simply passing this class. The group environment is something I do feel like could be beneficial but it is a bit difficult since the group setting is over zoom. This class has helped me with gathering information and how to apply new concepts in a short amount of time. I do think this will help me down the line as I continue my college career as well as once I enter the professional world. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2052,"My goals for the future are to work in the technological field working with computers with a computer engineering degree and gain skills to work with computer software and hardware. This class can help me achieve these goals because I would learn about electricity and how circuits work which is very vital in computer engineering. Learning about the physics of electricity will help me understand how a computer functions and understand how other electronic devices would function as well. This is an important physics course as it can give me the basics of electricity and circuitry which can help me understand the inside of an electronic device and can help me down the line when I would need to work with the interior of a computer. Because this physics class is a class on electricity and magnetism, this can help me understand computer parts in general which are based on circuits, electricity, and more. Overall, majors involving computers will need to learn about electricity and the fundamentals of a computer which I would need for my computer engineering degree. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2056,I think my goal is to have a better understand of how things are done by the physics law and learn more about the universe. So I this class would help me to learn how it's done also learn more about the universes. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2066,My goals are that I want to graduate in 4 years in computer science. I want to make my parents proud since they worked so hard to have me here at college. I want to take advantage of the oppurtunities. This class will help me since it is one of the requirements for this major. It will help me to understand the concepts better and it will help me achieve a better understanding of this topic. I am glad this class exists because it also helps me in my PHY 230 class since they teach similar things at the same time. Another goal of mines is I want to have straight A's and this class will help me by keeping me motivated to do the work on time and stay productive. I am excited to be here because I like physics and the labs really intrigue me so this is also another thing that will help me reach my goal. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2060,"My goals for this class is to receive an A in the class and be able to understand the concepts of physics in labs. I’m order to achieve my goals in class is being able to ask questions about the lab in order to understand the instructions given and ask the professor or my peers to check on work to know if the work done is accurate. To understand the concepts of physics I would have to do research outside of class to get a deeper analyze on the labs, outside research will allow one to ask questions to better a understanding on upcoming labs and be more confident answering questions during lectures. Another way to get an A is to communicate more with my peers in order to get a different perspective on the concepts and work as a team to get work done if a better manner "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2053,"My goals for college are to learn as much as possible in the next four years and get good grades but not cram for tests and procrastinate on assignments. Another one of my goals is to play baseball for SF state as this has been a dream of mine since I was younger to play baseball in college and possibly even in the MLB and part of it can come true. The last part of my dream is to meet new people and form life-long relationships and even though it has been hard with zoom these past few semesters to achieve this goal, hopefully, this dream can start to be fulfilled next year. This class can help me achieve my goals because it involves one of the most important and interesting subjects, physics, and what I learn in this class can help me in future years. Additionally, I can learn important study and time management skills from this class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2055,My goals are to improve my skills on physics because I still struggle with equations and formulas. Also sometimes I miscalculate and it messes up my progress which forces me to restart the problem. Taking this physics class will give me more practice and examples that I can work on and I can try to make fewer miscalculations so I don’t have to restart many problems. I am a computer science major and I think physics can help with my major since there are a lot of physics related topics going on inside a computer. Also the inside of a computer has many different parts that have many different functions. Each part of a computer is important and unique. I still need to improve my coding skills and there is a lot more to learn from the classes that I will take in the future. Another goal that I have is to graduate college.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2070,"Since, I was young, I always dreamed of being an engineer. I was a very curious person where I would always wonder how things worked, especially when it came to electric machinates. As I grew up older, I began to choose computer science as my major. I didn't know for a long time that physic was this important in computer science. Through physic, I've learned that everything that we use ot do daily has to do with physics. By passing this class, it gets me closer to my goal in which is becoming a software engineer. Through physics, I'll be able to develop and invent something that can help and bring a difference in this world. I'm excited to learn how much more I can take from this class that can help me in future. What has been helpful in this class was the labs which gave me visual examples of how physics interact with the things we do or use everyday and I find that very fascinating. "
