2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2068,"There are many self-care practices that I follow, but there are a couple that I use all of the time: leave myself some free time, get some exercise, and to make sure that I can relax at some point in my day. Overall, online classes have made me considerable lazier than I normally am compared to when I go to class in-person. If I were to go to class in person, then I would actually want to try even harder since it would be fun being able to interact with other students. But sadly, it seems like my entire freshman year of college was online learning and there was nothing else I could have done about it. There aren't very many concerns that I have regarding my learning, the only thing I can think of is to hopefully get all of my assignments in on time. My well-being is also fine, I am currently satisfied with the way I live right now except for the fact that I could put a bit more effort in everything that I do."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2066,"Online classes have impacted me by I procrastinate a lot. I have not been able to focus in in-person classes because I am so used to always being behind a camera. I am late sometimes to my classes and it's frustrating because before COVID happened I would always be the early one. For self-care, I am currently making sure I eat on time and work out as well. I am trying to maintain a healthy diet so I can stay healthy and fit. Some concerns I have are that I am worried that I may not get all A’s this semester because I feel like I haven’t been doing well. I am always tired because of how active I am in the club that I am in. I am worried about not being able to finish assignments on time and having strict deadlines. I hope that my professors can be more flexible with due dates."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2060,"Having online classes has caused my desire to learn to sink significantly, I remember being on campus excited heading to major classes and attending CS events learning about the STEM field each day. The people on campus made the experience much more exciting meeting tons of like minded students in every class on campus. When classes were switched to online, it didn’t impact me until the school kept pushing back in-person classes. It became more difficult to stay engaged during zoom sessions especially during major classes, having the one on one interactions in person helped a lot with my development as a student and work efficiently with students. Now as a third year of college, it’s overwhelming not being able to get the full learning experience and not being able to build a solid friend group in college. For now, I’m attempting to look at the bigger picture which is being able to finish and receive a degree."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2062,"I feel that the online classes have made it more difficult to stay engaged in my classes. Many people do not show their faces in my various classes and I also feel that it is difficult to stay focuses for over an hour with just staring at my screen. My main concern is that as I get into more and more complex topics,  online classes will prove less and less able to give me the knowledge  that I need in order to further build on these topics. I have been using meditation, with help from the Calm app, to help with my self-care. Meditation is useful for helping me concentrate, even when the online classes make it more difficult, and makes it easier to not stress myself out from the situation."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2064,"Online classes have impacted my learning in a lot of different ways. One of these ways is that I can’t really interact with my classmates as much as I would if I was physically there in class. The only time that I can talk to my classmates would be in breakout rooms, or when they would make group chats in Discord. Another way that impacted my learning is that I can’t actually go on campus to go to class. I think that if I was actually on campus and I went to classes, I would be more attentive considering that I am inside of a classroom, listening to the professor go through the lesson. For self-care, I have been taking daily walks every day, whether it’s to clear my mind, or to just walk my dog when it needs to go to the bathroom. I also do daily exercises for my body, but nothing strenuous. A concern that I have for my learning and my well-being is that I would rather go to college physically instead of just staying at home because actually going to the college forces me to not only move around more but to also talk to other classmates and professors to make relationships around campus. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2069,"Online learning has made it hard for me to do my lab online, I am having a hard time communicating with my professors and doing the lab. I also find it stressful to keep up with the ilearn, I find it easier to be told and be able to focus better when in person, than online with distractions around me. I find it hard, as well as also stressing, which makes it hard for me to understand anything. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2067,"Online classes are much less effective for me as I struggle to focus on  the topic after looking at screens and sitting for so long. To counter  this I try to stay as active as possible and look at screens only when  necessary. This has been an effective counter measure for me. I am  worried that I am not learning everything I can due to professors having  tech issues or too much time being spent during lectures on just  getting set up. While it is not a problem in this class, it has been in  several others. I hope that we can get back in person soon but if not I  think my method of self care is an effective way to counter the large  time spent on devices and looking at screens."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2052,"Online classes have impacted my learning because online classes have made learning somewhat the same as in person classes but also having problems with zoom sometimes due to outages. Overall, not much has changed from in person to online learning. For self care, I feel that it is best to relax and watch videos without looking at videos that would increase stress. Currently, I have no concerns for my learning and my well being as of right now because the last few semesters have also been online and I have adapted to the online learning format. Taking care of myself during this online semester is important because learning from the class can be hard when I have feelings of mild stress. What also works for me on self care is drinking water and resting for a period of time when I am free. This rest can help me relax and be prepared for the next class I would have. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2047,"Online classes have impacted my learning very harshly as the quality and knowledge retention of the material I am learning does not compare to being in an in-person class. It is very hard to be doing online classes when your entire life has been in the classroom, learning with peers of your age in person. Online classes simply do not add up to the time-tested system of in-person classes, especially when the transition is forced due to events out of your control. I used to be really bad with my self-care in the middle of the pandemic, with not as much time devoted to my mental health and instead working on schoolwork and a part-time job. As of now, in the later half of the pandemic with vaccines rolled out and life somewhat back to normal, I hang out with friends a lot more and have in-person contact very often. Living in the on-campus apartments has been a breath of fresh air for me and my mental health and life has gotten a little more optimistic."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2050,"Online class has lowered the amount of exercise I've been getting, especially recently, I've noticed that I go outside and walk a lot less, and in fact I rarely go outside of my room, other than to get things like water and food. Personally I'm concerned about my eyes since I stare at my computer screen more often due to online learning. I do already wear glasses but I fear that my eyesight might end up worse if I keep forgetting to take breaks ever now and then."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2063,"Online classes is a good and bad impact on my learning. It's good because I can take classes from my home and all the time that i used to use to get to the college and back home can be used to study and learn more. Most of the time in classes, the professors have slides or have a whiteboard to write on to teach and back then it would be hard for me to see the board so being able to see the board is great. Also the professors can record the sessions when the class is over so when I need help remembering what the professor taught, I can go back to the recording and learn it again. Now why it's negatively affecting my learning is sometimes the professors would be hard to hear from their mic or the zoom would glitch and crash or when the professor is talking, it would be too fast for me to keep pace or too confusing without visual aids. What I'm doing for self-care is not worrying about every disaster or dangerous thing that is happening in the world. I work out a bit and play a bit. I do a balanced style of school work, talking to family and friends and playing games. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2053,"Online classes have definitely been a change from what everyone has been used to and have both positively and negatively affected impacted my learning. The main positive impact has been how much time I have available to me to work on assignments and study for tests. This, however, is a double-edged sword, the more time you have, the more you can delay and push off assignments. I remember right before quarantine in my senior year of high school, I was extremely busy with sports, applying for scholarships, and schoolwork that I only had a small window where I could do my work and this actually helped me to not push off assignments. To counteract this problem, on big assignments and projects I create the desired time window where no matter what I will work on completing them with no distractions. I also have made sure to attend most of my classes even if they get recorded because I realized you are able to focus the most when you are present for the online lectures. Also, in some of my classes, I have purposely put my video on as a way for me to not be able to use my phone or daze off. To better support students, teachers and faculty should try and incorporate more collaboration because that’s the biggest aspect that is missing from an online school. In addition, they should give more students more leeway on assignments because even though we have more time, we don’t really have any classmates to ask for help and sometimes lack motivation to complete assignments. What kept us going for school which included our friends, sports, social life, and clubs got taken away from us."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2055,"I like online classes because I am a slow learner so it is very helpful that I can go back to lecture videos/notes. For self-care, I am doing exercises at home like push-ups, stretches, etc. Also, I stretch my legs a little since I sit at the computer a lot. I don’t think I have any concerns about learning or well-being so far. One thing I like about online classes is I don’t have to worry about being late to class. I feel pretty comfortable doing online classes at home because it’s an environment that I am used to. I don’t really have an issue with doing online classes and honestly, it really doesn’t matter to me if we are doing online classes or in-person classes I don’t think it will affect me too much. I will probably still be able to finish my homework and study for tests/exams even with in-person classes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2046,"Online classes has greatly affected my learning and self-care compared to what it was before the pandemic.  With having classes at home, it makes it difficult to separate class/homework time with relaxation time.  To counter this effect, I have tried to set hard limits on when I am doing stuff for classes and when I am doing other stuff.  This has allowed me to reduce some of the stress and confusion from working in the same place I relax.  As for self-care, it is hard to be sitting for most of the day and not being able to exercise as much as I used to.  Thankfully my dog is always ready to go on a walk, so most days I will take her for a walk around the neighborhood.  While this is not a lot of exercise, it does enough to keep me active and stretch my legs out from sitting all day."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2049,"Online classes have been very informative for me as I listen to all of my lectures and focus on the professor's or TA's PowerPoint presentation. I believe I have adapted to the online learning experience however I do find myself struggling in focusing on the material discussed in class from time to time since there are distractions at home which makes it hard for me to set myself in a working or learning environment. Compared to school or on campus, I do find myself to be more focused in class and able to understand the material discussed more accurately. A concern I have towards my learning and well-being is that if we return to campus 100% then what will be mandatory for students as a requirement to attend classes since currently we are recovering from a global pandemic. What I am doing for my self-care, is that I am setting up a sleep schedule, staying about 6 feet away from people or maintaining social distancing, and wearing my mask when I go outside."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2057,"At first, I thought online classes would be better, as I take computer science classes, and I wouldn't need to leave my place every time I had a class. But even though it is more convenient, teachers are usually awful at it. They just post a bunch of stuff online for us to do on our own and basically relax and put us in breakout rooms during actual class time.I've found in a lot of my classes, I'm not actually learning anything during class time. I'm basically teaching myself in these online classes and if I wanted to do that, I wouldn't be paying for university. I would be taking a free or at least way cheaper course online for something I'm actually interested instead of taking required classes for a major that the teachers don't actually teach.Going to most of my online classes just feels like a waste of my time. Then the work after is neverending. Teachers are way too reliant on homework. In middle/high school, I could get 100% on almost every test without doing any of the homework. They just need to actually teach it. Homework should solely be for if you don't understand the material. All that giving a bunch of homework does is make me learn worse because every class has a bunch of shit due and rarely gives a shit about another class. All that does is wear me down, make me stressed, and be tired from lack of sleep. By the time I finish one assignment, I have two more to do.Also, just the fact that teachers don't talk to each other, even within the same major. It's like they try their hardest to make taking another class as difficult as possible. I'm just following my required major classes and this semester I'm learning 4 fucking different programming languages at once. And I learned a completely different language from those 4 last semester. Fuckin hell, at least have some semblance of consistency through the SAME MAJOR. Learning a new language in any class I take and they all want to do huge projects that are due at the same time meaning I have to work on them at the same time and doing one is not useful at all to doing the other. Them they're like ""I gave you enough time to finish it."" Yeah, maybe if I had one class, but I don't.These classes, except for this lab, aren't about learning, they are about grading. You don't get to learn at your own pace, you spend maybe one week on a topic and if you don't get it by then you fall behind and you don't have the time to go back because all your other classes are doing the exact same thing. You either get it in the allotted time or you fail the quiz/test/class. The teachers don't seem genuinely interested either. They treat a class as review because it is for them, I feel like most teachers have forgotten what it is like to learn their topic for the first time. Some teachers get annoyed when students don't get it like it's our fault, and not something that they need to learn to deal with and help to remedy.What I don't understand is why anything but the final actually matters. Like yeah, have the quizzes/tests/projects/homework, but why does anything from earlier in the class affect my grade If I end up understanding it by the end of the semester? Hypothetical: Oh, a quiz from September where I didn't understand most of it until a week later is worth 20% of my grade. Let us say I get 0% on that quiz, yet I know all of it completely by the time the final rolls around. I get 100% on the final, yet I end up with a 79% in the class because of that quiz way back in September and I lost 1% in some other way. I know and learned everything the class taught by the end, but it doesn't matter, because they don't care if you learned it eventually. Either you learn it in the week given or fuck you.If you couldn't tell from my other Reflections, I genuinely despise the current school system. It has never been good for me, not once, but I don't really have any other choice at the moment. Please let me know when schools actually start to care about learning and not about making students' lives miserable.For self-care, I enjoy ranting about all the dumb shit in this world and trying to focus on my mental health while my grades fall around me because all that school has been successful in doing is damaging my mental health. I'm happier at a minimum wage food service job than I am taking almost any class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2051,"Online classes have had its pros and cons on my learning experience. For the pros, my schedule has become a lot more flexible since I do not have to commute as much, thanks to all my classes being virtual. This has allowed me to focus on strengthening other skills outside the classroom to prepare myself for jobs and internships. Virtual learning has also guided me to become more comfortable working with many different technologies in computing. The virtual environment has also strengthened my soft skill in communication and teamwork through a medium I’m not quite accustomed with. I believe this is an important skill to have as a computer science student since I believe a lot of hiring software-based companies are aiming to keep their staff in a virtual setting. This makes sense to me since a virtual work setting is probably the most efficient way of doing business for software-based companies.   The cons, however, is that communicating is always going to be more difficult in a virtual setting than it is in a face-to-face setting. Establishing meaningful connections and standing out from the crowd seems to be difficult. I think this mostly stems from virtual technology’s weakness in communicating non-verbal cues. It is difficult to figure out what someone is thinking or feeling behind a camera or block of text, as opposed with in-person. Overall, I think my learning experience is doing pretty well for me personally and preparing me for the workforce, since I am aiming to work in the software space."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2061,"Online classes during the fall of 2020 were not too bad in fact for a while I think I actually preferred it over in-person classes as we had more freedom on when we could complete our assignments. While taking online classes realized that I had much more free time because I did not have to commute to the physical classroom. But however, as the semester progressed I realized that I was getting very agitated just staying home all day every day during quarantine. As the school year progressed I just lost the motivation to learn and study and almost made the courses that I had a passion for a painful experience just learn the course curriculum. As far as self-care is concerned I try to exercise whenever I have free time or just go on walks around my neighborhood for some fresh air. The only concern that I have for my learning is that I hope when the university opens back up again I can adjust to it as soon as possible."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2058,"Online classes just make it so much harder to stay focused. It is so easy to lower the sound of a zoom meeting and go about doing something else. As for learning it just means that I have to teach myself a lot more of the material. It's also very inconsistent because internet is unstable sometimes and for some reason there has been more power outs these past couple months than the last 3 years where I live. It feels very disconnected since I am nowhere near the bay area, let alone SFSU. I haven't been able to step foot on campus once since I transferred. As for self care there is none from me. I just grind away waiting for the sweet relief that is a single week off for thanksgiving. There are no concerns for my well being because that has gone down the drain and I do not think that they can get any lower than they already are."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2065,"Online classes have impacted my life tremendously. More each semester that passes by, because the more online classes I take, the more time I have to learn different things. I do have more time to go out and learn about other hobbies that I have in life such as business, real estate, soccer. However, I do have to say that there is much less learning when we are all online because there are many resources online that help us find the answers to many of the questions for most of the classes. This, unfortunately, should not be done, and many people, including me, do not understand as much as if we were in person. Even though it has been tough to understand all the topics for some classes, especially physics, I do enjoy having the opportunity and the time to focus on myself and learn about myself. Take care of my family and have more communication with them."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2054,"It's a bit harder to do experiments, since we can't physically touch things. I can only see how things are done abstractly, rather than seeing it physically."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2056,I think that the impacted of the online classes on my learning is it is more difficult to ask teacher stuff if you there is no class and office hour is passed. What am I doing for self - care is would go play basketball every week to keep body healthy. I don't really have any concern I have for my learning. The concern I have for my well being is the covid that is going on right now make things difficult.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2048,"Online classes were hard at first but then they got easier because it's a more flexible form of learning. Apart from the fact that internet connection isn't always the best, online classes have helped me get more comfortable with my classes since there's no pressure of being in person. On the other hand, professors tend to think that because we're learning from home, we have all the time in the world and they give so much work to do in such little time that school becomes overwhelming. When I start to feel like this, I give myself a day off from work and school to recharge even if that means turning in an assignment a little late because I prioritize my mental health. I think professors need to understand that we do have other classes, and some of us also have other responsibilities outside school like work and family.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2059,"Honestly, I liked online classes at first because I was able to sleep in a little before class started and grab some food while still in class but as time passed, I felt like online classes started to create a negative impact on my learning. Online learning has affected my motivation, time management, and self-care. I feel more lazy than I have ever been just because I have the same routine of just joining a link to join class and just watching the class through a screen. I hope that once I get to go in person, school will be a lot smoother and I am hoping it does not take a turn and gets even worse and makes me more stressed."
