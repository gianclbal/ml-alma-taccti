Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2046,"I want to go into the STEM field because it interests me and would help give me the opportunity to find a good job when I graduate.  Before college, I initially wanted to major in aerospace engineering.  However, I found that I was more interested in computers and decided to apply as a computer science major.  With a computer science degree, there is are a lot of fields that it can be applied to.  This means that after I graduate, I can apply my skills and knowledge to whatever takes my interest or what a future job requires.  People who get a job in a STEM field also tend to get a higher starting salary than some other fields/jobs.  This would help me create the life I want when I get older."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2047,"As a child, video games were my world. Not an uncommon topic, I know, but they were my entire existence during my childhood. I wanted to make games when I grew up because I wanted to give the emotion of joy to kids everywhere, like game developers did for me when I was a kid. I joined the STEM field for this purpose, I want to give back to future generations of kids for their entertainment. However, after the lockdown, I began to second-guess my career choice as my classes got harder, more frustrating. The virus did not help either as I actually contracted it for about two weeks and my mental state began tumbling down and down.It was tough to try and regain my confidence in my major, especially now that my classes are harder than ever. However, I am on a mission to grow myself now that school is somewhat back in person. If I do not try to progress this year, I never will. I have to succeed. I have to."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2048,"I went into STEM because I've liked computers since I was a kid. My dad also worked in the IT industry so his interest in computers sparked my curiosity. I never really saw myself going into liberal arts because I wasn't really interested in that field. As I got older, I saw that there's not a lot of women in the tech industry especially women of color and I wanna be one of the women that will change that. The world is diving more and more into technology and making more scientific discoveries so I think it'll be interesting to get into."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2049,"I want to go into the stem field because I would like to learn more about new discoveries we make about the world and how we could use this newfound information to help ourselves benefit from it. An example is how when the US launched the Apollo missions to land a man on the moon, it paved the way for new technologies that we use today such as smartphones and so on. In the future, I would like to learn more about Artificial Intelligence and hopefully program one to aid us in our daily lives, similar to how we use search engines like Google to provide us a list of websites to choose from. I also find myself choosing a stem field to be more comfortable since I feel like becoming a business or art major is something that I don't consider to be interested in nor do I have any incentives to go into those majors. Another reason why I want to go into the stem field is that I would like to create or invent something that would help people."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2050,"I want to go into the STEM field because I believe that STEM (mostly technology and engineering) would be the future of humanity...at least according to all those futuristic movies with all the robots. In addition, making a program and seeing it run on its own is really satisfying to me, and is one of the few things that encourage me to continue programming. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2051,"I am majoring in Computer Science because it is the perfect balance of enjoyable and profitable. I enjoy programming just enough to be okay with doing it for the rest of my life, and the money that comes along with it is just enough to overlook the not so enjoyable parts of programming. Alongside this, I also would like the opportunity to be flexible in where I can work, which I believe a CS degree can help me with, since I believe practically every major company requires some form of software or data presence. Other than just my needs, I would also like to contribute to the technological growth of our society as much as possible by being directly involved with it. Things like space flight, commercial flight, and automotive travel seem primed for exponential growth, and I would like to be a contributing factor. I strongly believe a degree in Computer Science will put me on the field, and in these categories of exponential growth."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2052,"I want to go into the STEM field because I am interested in technology and mathematics. When I was younger, I would be fascinated by a computer and what it can do. That experience would develop my passion for working with computer hardware and software. My passion of technology and computers would fit with what the STEM field would offer for me when I would pursue a job in the field. Another reason I want to go into the STEM field is because I would like to pursue a moderately paying job when I would graduate and get a job. I want to have a comfortable life doing what I am passionate in and a job where I would learn more about the technology and the engineering part of STEM. The STEM field already works with my biggest interests and some experience I already have working with computers and computer software. To summarize, I want to be in the STEM field because I am interested in STEM and have a passion in technology and math."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2053,"I want to go into the STEM field because ever since I was a kid I was fascinated with almost every part of STEM. My interest started when my mom got me my first lego set and I build my first lego starship. Ever since then, I have had a passion for engineering and build a number of Lego projects that I kept around my room. My passion for technology came when I helped my dad build a gaming PC when I was six, and I would use this same PC to play video games for ten years and went on to build my own PC a few months ago. Technology has always been something I have been interested in and what been comfortable using since I was a kid. For the mathematics part of STEM, my passion began in elementary school when I realized how important Math was in real life and it was always my favorite subject because of easy it came to me. Lastly, for Science I always wondered how the world worked and why life was the way it was and Science would answer my deepest questions. Whenever I was bored I would look to Science to learn something new and unique about how the world works. In conclusion, my passion for each of the subfields for STEM is the reason why I want to get into the STEM field. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2054,"I think math is interesting, where even advanced problems are solved by some of the simplest math, just with many steps. Even with things like programming, it is mostly using the same few commands, just advanced programming uses those commands differently."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2055,"I want to go into the stem field because I like science and math. My major is computer science and the reason why I chose to major in computer science is because I found coding and programming fun and interesting. Also, I think in the future technology will be important so I want to help develop more technology and improve them. I am still trying to improve my coding skills. Even though I’m not the best at coding I do enjoy making small projects and messing around with code. I sometimes like to build my own computer and upgrade the parts for my computer but I’m sticking to coding and computer science. After finishing college at San Francisco State University I’m going for a master’s degree. I’m hoping to stay in San Francisco though because I like the weather here. Physics in high school was pretty boring but so far in college, it’s been going well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2056,"The reason I want to go in the STEM field is because I like computer. When I growing up I play all sorts of video game, using lots of apps and it makes wonder how do people create these stuff. So when I choosing my major I decide to going to computer science then I know that we can use many different coding language to create games , videos and others stuff. After I start to ask question like how are computer created what's science behind it. So I think that my motive."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2057,"Honestly, the only reason I'm in the STEM field is because I spend a lot of time with computers anyway, and I don't want to have to worry about money. I enjoy the actual coding, but the math and science part, I really just don't care. My personal experience with the STEM field hasn't helped my view either. At SFSU, many STEM teachers know their subjects extremely well but are just awful teachers. I feel like I'm basically paying for a class to teach myself. Feels like some teachers are just annoyed to be there. I've hated most of my major classes. Not because of what we learn, I often find it somewhat interesting, but I find myself saying ""These classes/teachers are awful"" semester after semester.I enjoy this class. I feel like you actually understand that we are here to be taught. That we don't already have the knowledge you do and that you are willing to walk through exactly what you're talking about. Maybe it's because you are also a student. Also the ground rules for an effective classroom environment. You actually listen to what the students need to learn better instead of assuming you have it all right from the start. I've never understood how teachers will think it's the student's fault if the majority of students (or at least a decent amount) have trouble or complaints about the class.I never really had that problem with GE classes or language classes. They might not need as much expertise, but they are definitely better at teaching.I know this sort of got off-topic but I really don't have a huge reason. And that despite being quite interested, almost every class somehow makes me dislike it more and more. I feel like I would be better off just learning by myself online at my own pace except for the fact that won't get me a degree."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2058,"I wanted to go into the STEM field for two main reasons, my love of computers and to be financially stable. There is other passions that I had that would have been interesting career choices however they are a lot more volatile. Computer science was something I naturally gravitated towards. My first experience with HTML for myspace pages that my older siblings had was enough to get me hooked and I knew I wanted to do more with that. I originally went to college wanting to be a physical therapist, however that changed once I realized my true passion revolved around code. After 2 years of being kinesiology major I switched to Computer Science. The need to solve problems is what continues to drive me and remain in the STEM field. There feels like there's an infinite number of methods to get to one solution. I want to learn as many as I can."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2059,"Ever since my junior year of high school, I was interested in a computer based career. That year, I took a computer science course at my school and extremely enjoyed it. When I was coding, it felt like I was putting a massive puzzle together and was relieved and excited every time I completed a working program. My desire even got to a point to where I wanted to take AP computer science but, unfortunately, there weren't enough students my senior year to make a AP computer science class. Once I got to deciding what major I wanted to pursue, I cut my options down to computer science and computer engineering. I knew computer engineering was gonna be more difficult but I sounded interesting actually getting to be involved with the internal components of a computer as well as understanding how to program it. I want to go into the STEM field because I always found it interesting and challenging, but fun."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2060,"I wanted to go into the STEM field because when I was younger, I’ve always been fascinated about how fast technology has evolved from ordinary brick phones to having a full blown computer in our pockets. I’ve also been curious about how things worked such as, how does a stoplight know when to change colors? or , how is an ATM able to find my information in their system? In 6th grade, companies send employees/representatives to schools in the city and provide classes based on their field. I chose to take part of the coding classes and in my experience it was challenging and rewarding. During the coding classes, I realized that technology will have a major impact in our everyday lives in the future and the possibilities are endless. I want to be part of the team who creates the next evolution of technology that will benefit future generations. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2061,"Since I was a high school freshman I knew that I wanted to pursue a degree in the STEM field but I was not sure which particular major that I wanted to pursue a degree in. As time progressed Heading into my sophomore year I was focused on becoming a sports medicine doctor because I played football and battled through many injuries and our football team had a sports doctor that rehabilitated me through my injuries, so I became really interested in the sports medicine field. But in my Junior year, I took a computer networking class and fell in love with the class, mastering that course's material was like second nature. The class not only worked with the software but also had an emphasis on working with wires and hardware, rewiring the whole classroom to improve network performance and speed. It was then that I decided to become a computer engineering major because it's the best of both worlds the major teaches about hardware and software. Also, the fact that I lived in the Bay Area I knew I couldn't pass up an opportunity to join the tech Industry as It is the perfect place to reside in for my major.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2062,"I want to go into STEM since want to better understand the way that many industrial processes work. I find this process, especially when I get hands on into it, to be interesting and even fun, especially once you get past the more tedious parts. I also like to learn about these processes to help with my fictional world building. I really like to create fantasy and science fiction worlds. I cannot effectively tweak how those of another world make their technologies if I do not understand the foundation of those technologies in the first place. I finally want to go into stem to help improve society. I am especially interested in the many avenues of renewable energy. I find that the development and proper deployment of these technologies to be essential for the movement away from fossil fuel technologies. These are three of my main reasons for entering the STEM field.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2063,"why I want to go into the STEM field is because I am pretty good at math and technology. I wanna do something that can use both technology and math together and use it throughs gaming, either in building a game or teach young kids how to use it themselves. My goal is to either become a game developer like those big game companies or work as a programmer in one. Or become a teacher that teaches kids how to use the computer and programs so they can be ready for the future. What first interested me in the STEM field was my desire to learn math at a young age and when I played computer and console games back in middle and high school, I was always curious of how it worked and how do people make the game. That curiosity led me to wanting to be in this field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2064,"I wanted to go into a STEM field because mathematics is probably one of my favorite subjects to do in school. Doing math is like solving a puzzle, that takes countless steps in order to complete, but is still great when you see its end product. Since that STEM revolves around math, and I can also use math to help me in a work setting, and I want to use my knowledge to be able to improve or help on the work that's being done today so that I can be a part of the community that's trying to shape our world right now. That's why in the future, I will work in a job that can help improve the safety of people and make it easier for them to do their own job through the advancement of technology."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2065,"Kevin AvedianPhysics 0222-02 ""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?"" Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics are the fields I always enjoyed the most in school. In fact, when I first started college which was a couple of years ago, I first started as a Business major; however, I did not feel like this was the right field for me. Even though it was science, it had very few STEM classes, such as Physics or Calculus. Considering that I wasn’t fully satisfied with my Business major, I decided to change my major to Astrophysics since this was and the subject I have always strived to perfect. When I took Calculus I and Astronomy, I knew that the STEM field was the core of my interests; thus, I came to a conclusion and kept pursuing my true passion. You might wonder, why ASTRO-physics? From I was little until this day, I have had such an intimate passion for black holes and their theories and equations, and this topic broadens my mind and drew me to liking many more subjects. So far, I have been happy studying the STEM field and I will continue to thrive in these subjects. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2066,"I want to go into this major because I really like coding and it makes me feel smart. Also, there are a lot of jobs offered in this field and a lot of money can come out of it. I feel like it's something that's fun to do. Something I'm worried about is that when I don't know how to do some code I get a little upset because I want to know how to do it but I just don't understand it sometimes. I like this major because it helps me to think about what goes on behind stuff and I like that. I think I like doing web development but I don't see it as an everyday job. I'm not sure what specific field I want to go in but I do know that I really want to work in a big tech company like Twitter. I am excited about the future but also scared."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2067,"I want to go into the stem field because I enjoy creating and designing things. Since I was younger I have always liked working on cars and other mechanical things such as tractors, bulldozers, lawnmowers, etc. This got me interested in engineering and ever since majoring in engineering has been my goal. I also simply enjoy doing almost anything in the stem field. I enjoy being outside so I have also enjoyed being in science and biology classes in school. I also believe it is the most challenging field you can choose which I like because it means I will be always learning."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2068,"One reason why I wanted to go into the STEM field was because of how interesting I thought it was. Many of the classes in the STEM field and in my major (Computer Science) require a lot of problem solving. Problem-solving is one thing that I enjoy doing a lot and I think it is fun. Another reason why I wanted to go into the STEM field was also because of how the world today is making a huge transition to technology. As a result, technology is something that is soon to be a major part of our world and we would see it everywhere. I think that this will also lead to many companies offering jobs that involve at least some part of technology. Since there will be a lot of job offerings for technology-related items, then I might as well be good at the field so I could be accepted anywhere."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,10,2069,"I want to go to STEM because I want to work in a hospital and be able to help make a difference in health field, in a way that makes it safer for the human body to get tested, and in a more efficient way as well. This way we don't have to risk more than it's worth. I would also like to make a difference and show the world that anyone including women of color can make a difference. Even if it has been proven multiple times, some people still do not accept it. And I want to show people around me, that I am just as capable as anyone else. "
