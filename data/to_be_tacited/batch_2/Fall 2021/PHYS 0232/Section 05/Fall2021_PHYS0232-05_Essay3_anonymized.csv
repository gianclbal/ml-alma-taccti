2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1925,"Why should you not create a closed circuit with batteries and no other objects that provide resistance?  If you were to do this, you would create a short circuit which will have infinite current as a result of the incredibly low resistance of the wires.  This can cause harm to people, and if any other electronics are connected to a short circuit it could fry them.  This can be used as safety information for people working with circuits who may not have experience in order to keep them safe, and also as a general rule whenever working with electronics or circuits."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1943,"A concept that we covered during class that I feel is particularly important is Circuits. The modern world runs on circuits from motherboards, to memory to processors. Even the simplest piece of hardware has delicate wiring and circuits behind it to make it operate. When we look at the benefits it has given society, it has given us a structured and life changing work schedule of 8 hours a day, 5 days a week with no paid time off. We are slaves to a capitalist system that has come from the technological advances of our engineers and scientists because the greedy exploiters in the upper echelon of society has deemed profits more valuable than human lives and enjoyment. However, the quality of life in society has improved tremendously for the average person since the Industrial revolution. Since we have automated many of lives hardships, we can focus on the small enjoyments we can do outside of our job and instead of having to wash clothes, the circuits we devised have automated the processes and we can instead load the dish washer which also uses circuits, to prepare food that might be cooked in a microwave that is also full of circuits. In essence life has become overly dependent on circuits and maybe that is not so bad itself."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1942,"a question I have is why does it sometimes feel like my hands are charged and every time I touch something or someone that is oppositely charged I get electrocuted, looking through my Lab notes my theory is; my hands are neutral charged, when it is near a positively charged object, the electrons in my hand start moving pulling the negative charged electrons to the surface of my hand making it attract to the positively charged object resulting in my hand turning into a negatively charged object, and every time I get near another charged object and I touch it I get electrocuted which is the electric field force. which ends up in hurting my hands which sends a signal to my brain that it shocks my body. The simplest way to discharge an object is to connect it to the Earth itself by means of a conductor. Which is a way I found to use when I start getting shocked from touching anything."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1932,The general question I got from a concept of the past few weeks is how do certain systems regulate current flow?The answer to this question can be summed up by one main word: fuses.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1926,"One concept that I have used a lot in my life thus far is all this work with circuits and schematics. For a little over four years, I was enlisted in the Navy. We being selected for a job to perform while I was in the Navy, I got the great jobs of Aviation Electrician. This involved a lot of studying schematics and troubleshooting electrical systems. The specific platform I ended up with was F/A-18 Super Hornets. I was sent to a master jet base in Lemoore, California to a squadron for training pilots and later at another squadron getting ready for deployment. During my time, I spent many days in the hot sun reading wires to check if there was continuity. One of the biggest lessons I learned was that when reading a wire, if there is no resistance there is a short and if there is max resistance it means there is an open or break in the wire. Unfortunately, the military trains its people to do the job, but not necessarily understand much of the concepts, so I have a general idea of what is going on, but when we get into equations and such, I am not quite sure what is going on. Ohm's law was definitely used a decent bit though."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1928,"In the modern day, we've made lot of improvements on previous century's inventions and used it on various applications. For example, using transformer in the microwave heater and electric vehicles using lithium ion batteries. With all of knowledge I gained from this class, I wonder what I can experiment to build in a laboratory or in the industry. Learning about AC and DC electric current, electric flux and electro magnets really helped me to understand how many of my home devices work. Upon my graduation I'm entering a cybersecurity industry and I'm going to discover what can be achieved in the hardware."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1924,"Concept: Gauss's LawQuestion: What role do famous theorems have in new innovations?Answer: Guass's Law is simply the integral over a closed surface of the dot product between electric field and an infinitesimally small area vector, or charge enclosed divided by permittivity of free space. It is such an easy formula that it is standard curriculum taught in high schools and colleges. However, this is significant, because in Gauss's days, people struggled to calculate such values, hence the need arised for Guass to come up with the rule. It was through his genius and dedication that people were able to understand how the laws of physics and the natural world worked. It is similar to today, where we may not know how things work (for instance, a power drill), yet we use it to create much more complex things (such as a house). Another amazing realization is that Gauss's law is universal to every scenario; in any scenario where it applies, the charges on the outside contribute 0 flux; without this law to remind us of that, we would be spending much more of our valuable time finding values that do not contribute to the final sum. To conclude, we need to encourage innovation and out of the box thinking, as it makes today's work easier, and frees our mind for newer and more exciting innovations."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1927,"How can the knowledge behind electric potential help us in our every day lives? Well there are many instances where we take advantage of electric potential. Many of those uses can range from simple double A batteries to the electricity we use to power our cities. A low potential can be useful to power simple objects like a toy or a radio, while having a large potential, usually something above 10,000 kilovolts, is useful for transporting electricity across vast distances in an efficient matter. Knowing the dangers between a high and low voltage is also very helpful and knowing what precautions to take before handling various levels of voltage."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1941,"One concept covered in class was the general rules for how to determine the net flux within a gaussian surface. Those rules being – whatever the charge is entering the gaussian surface creates the opposite charge value of the initial point charge, at points where the electric flux is leaving the object the value of the charge is the same as the point charge that entered it. Finding net zero charges is a matter of determining if the total charge going through it is somehow canceled out by another point charge. Increasing the total electrons or the total charge by some multiple increases the effect it has by that multiple. Two positively charged electrons on one side of a surface will have twice the influence and therefore negate some of the influence of another singular positively charged atom on the other side of that surface. Coupled with the knowledge taught to us in the first week of the class- information about the interaction between positively, neutrally, and negatively charged electrons, attracting and repelling each other- is the basis of a seemingly endless litany of scientific breakthroughs.A clear understanding of this concept supports a wide range of fields and occupations which rely heavily on this basic electrical concept. Computer components, electric grids, even some children's toys all rely on this basic physical interaction. It's where the magic of electricity and magnetism comes from. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1918,"What is the purpose of a fuse?A fuse's purpose is to keep track of the flow of electricity, and make sure that electrical overflow doesn't occur. The purpose of this is to prevent an electric fire from occurring in any place that uses electricity. This keeps people safe from worrying as much about the potential of they immediate area catching on fire.How do the opposite electrical charges work?Opposite electrical charges attract towards one another. I can't really think of an everyday situation that required electrical charges.How does a gaussian surface have flux?A Gaussian Surface can only have flux if it has a charge inside of it producing or receiving E-field lines. If there are only charges outside of it, the flux inside will be zero. I can't think of a real life situation that uses this.What happens if your remove electrons from something and bring it close to an object with more electrons or neutral charge?This object would be attracted to the object with more electrons or neutrons. This can be shown when you rub a balloon against your head, and watch as your hairs begin to attract to the balloon's surface due to the exchange of electrons.."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1936,"In the past few weeks, the short circuit concept really stood out to me. The question is, what is a circuit and specifically what is a short circuit. From my understanding, a circuit is a medium in which there is a potential difference ein which current can pass through. The simplest example is that of a battery and a wire. The battery has a certain voltage which when connected from one end to the other with the wire(the medium) then current can flow through the wire. How much current is flowing through the wire is dependent on the resistance in the circuit. Another important aspect of this is the idea of 'the path of least resistance'. If electrons have the ""choice"" of going through a wire of high vs low resistivity, they will go through the low resistivity. This is really what a short circuit is. Rather than the current flowing through the entire system, the current flows straight to a path with low to no resistivity. Current is really the flow of electrons. Certain materials do a better job at passing electrons which is why we classify them as conductors vs insulators."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1945,"The lab that I enjoyed the most so far this semester was learning about charge. Charge is all around us both on earth and throughout the universe. For example, electrons have a negitive charge while protons have a positive charge. Charges also create an electric field in which like charges will repel each other and oppsite charges will attract. For example, when holding two batteries near eachother with the same sides next to eachother they will repel and one can feel the electromagnetic force. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1944,"My question is how can one determine the flux over any closed surface? First to find the answer, you take the dot product between two vectors for each surface of an object that you are trying to find the charge enclosed of. The first vector is the vector for the electric field going through the surface, and the second vector is the area of the surface. Once you have the dot product of each surface and the electric field, you add them all together. This is also equal to To find the charge enclosed, and divide it by epsilon. This is also equal to the charge enclosed divided by epsilon. This concept is important because it is a fundamental part of how electricity works and so is integral to understanding anything to do with it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1919,"One question that I had was ""why does a wire with a smaller diameter have a higher resistance?""  to me it seemed counter intuitive that  wire with a small diameter would have a higher resistance because it would seem that the wire has less mass for the electrons to pass through.  But when I asked for clarification, the answer made sense.  The wire is essentially The Pipe"" that the electricity would flow through.  So rather than mass acting as a barrier for and electron to pass through, it is actually more similar to the empty space you would see in a pipe.  So in other words, the larger the pipe, the more fuid can flow through it at a given time.  And with wires, the larger the guage, the wider ""the pipe"" is, which mean more electrons can flow through it at a given time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1921,I would like to talk about the concept I learn in our previous lab which was about short circuits. We had an experiment with the 3 batteries and aluminum foil and scotch tape. It was interesting how when the aluminum foul and wired get in contact with each other then a closed path is formed and current flow resulting in shock. When it was connected with the wider silver it withstands more heat when the circuit is connected and won’t combust. It would be really important for us to know how current works also it helps us to know how circuits function. Jumping a dead car or working with circuits that lead to multiple sources from a single point. Learning about what is open and the close circuit would be the generic idea to understand how current flows. One can also be safe if one is aware of it.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1938,"Ohm's Law real life examples:1) We can control the speed of the fans at our homes by moving the regulator to and fro. Here the current flowing through the fan is controlled by regulating the resistance through the regulator. A circular knob on the component can be rotated to achieve a variable resistance on the output terminals. For any specific value of the input, we can calculate the resistance, current and thus power flowing through Ohm’s Law.2) The electric heaters are the common appliances used in winters throughout the world. The heaters have a metal coil which has high resistance that permits a certain amount of current to flow through them to provide the required heat. Also, the power to be supplied to the heaters is calculated using this law.3) The electric kettle and irons have a lot of resistors in them. The resistors limit the amount of current to flow through them to provide the required amount of heat. The size of resistors used in them is determined by using Ohm’s law.4) The electronic devices such as laptop and mobile phones require a DC power supply with the specific current. Many devices need a certain amount of current and voltage to operate. Ohms law tells us the amount of resistance we need to establish a certain current with a certain amount of voltage.5) Fuses are the protection components that limit the amount of current flowing through the circuit and to establish a certain amount of voltage. They are connected in the series in the device. Ohms law is used to figure out which resistors are needed."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1930,"The whole lab that covered short circuits was one of the more interesting labs that has come around. Understanding the general layout and equipment used to form a circuit helped myself a lot because my uncle is fixing my kitchen and had to check all the outlets and all for energy. I guess it was more of a perfect timing with the week that we took to understand some circuits. It was very interesting to see a concept from class applied in the real world because I am a more hands on type of worker and learner so I guess it just helped the overall idea that was presented to myself. The demonstration with the balloon and sweater was also a good representation of how charge is disbursed. After that lab, I tried to resemble the charge distribution by having me and my friend hold a light buld and sub the floor with socks on and after making friction with the floor. Our fingertips touched and the light buld happened to light up. This is one of the more connections that I found during the start of these lab sections during the semester. I hope to see more connections between topic in this class in the future of this class duration."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1935,"At this moment the only topic that I would use in my current day to day life would have to be the concept of Short Circuiting with batteries to create heat. I do not think at any point I will ever have to use the concepts of Electric Field, Flux and Gauss' Law, or Potential, aside from maybe charge to prevent myself from being shocked by static electricity. When I am camping out in the wilderness on the outskirts of town where I live and I do not have any tools to lite a fire to keep me warm so I do not freeze to death because I was careless and did not manage to pack a sleeping bag or tent, and the reason for why I do not have any tool to start a fire is either because I did not remember to pack it before leaving, I some how have managed to break all the fire starting equipment, or the one that is probably the most possible at I dropped them in a river and they are to wet to start a fire. The reason on how I think Short Circuiting will be the most helpful in my every day life, is because putting a piece of tin foil on both of the ends of the batter will heat up and will catch on fire, with that I will be able to start a fire and not freeze to death. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1940,"One concept that I learned in class that involves everyday life is circuits. Circuits are everywhere around us! Freezers and fridges use series circuits. The most common circuit in daily everyday life is a light switch. A series circuit is a loop that is completed when a switch connection sending electricity through the loop. There are many types of series circuits, such as a computers, televisions, microwaves, that work through the same basic idea.Parallel circuits are used when wiring houses. A parallel circuit is used when the current through several components is needed to be independent of each other."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1934,"What is a current in a circuit? Explain?A current is the rate of flow of an electric charge. A circuit is a closed loop that electrons travel in. A source of electricity, such as a battery, provides electrical energy in the circuit. If the circuit is does not do a full loop, then the current will not flow. This also means no electrons will move through the system. A current flows through a circuit to power to an appliance or multiple if needed. The value of the current will always be same throughout the entire circuit. In a series circuit at all points, current has the same value. In a parallel circuit is will not be true. What will be true is that rate of current into the circuit will always be same as the rate of current leaving the system. Now when a circuit is in parallel, the rate of current will be different at different segments of the circuit. In a parallel circuit the current is split at various points of wire junction. If one of the parallel paths is broken, the current will continue to flow in all other paths of the circuit. In a series circuit, if at any point the current is broken, no current flow anywhere throughout the circuit. This information can be useful for setting up electrical circuits throughout a home. At home is made up of multiple outlets that are all connected to a circuit to power appliances. For a home a parallel circuit will be better because in case an outlets short circuits, all other outlets will still be able to provide power."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1922,"Short circuits are a practical concepts that are easy to understand, not only are they super useful, they are easy to understand. The use of fuses and understanding the flow of electrons and amperage specifically allows for us to scale systems correctly and design safe systems."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1931,"I have a lot of questions about the short circuits that we discuss during class. I think I would like to study the specific function, voltage, and current that flows through. I think it will be helpful for me in engineering. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1920,"One topic that I actually talked about in my last summary for lab was about this story were I hotwired a string of fairy lights back together by burning the wax coating off and then fusing the things back together and this has to do with how wires have single circuits because the lights went out because they were all on a single circuit and one little piece of the wire broke. I did this a few weeks ago and it was amazing because me and my cousin just spent the last hour putting them around these posts just for them to break but because I took ag mech in high school which went over the same things we are going over in this class, I was able to fix them and this kind of knowledge helps me all the time which I really did not expect for some reason.       "
