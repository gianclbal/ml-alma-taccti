Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1918,"I want to go into the STEM field because so much of my life has been based around technology, and I would like to be able to understand and create programs for people to use. Plus, it pays pretty well, which would be nice in order to do things without worrying so much on the cost, like I have for so much of my life already. What I really want to do is make games because I want to be able to create something for people to enjoy experiencing, especially after a stressful day/week. I would not have stuck with the field if I didn't feel like I fit well into it, however after the courses I have taken surrounding computer science, I feel confident in my ability to understand an perform in the field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1919,"I wanted to join the stem field because during my time in the Marine Corps, I met many engineers that designed some of out equipment that we used on a daily basis.  They would bring us some piece of gear that they designed and would have us test or use it in the field and ask for our feedback.  Furthermore, I really enjoy math and science, despite how difficult it can be at times.  The challenge of solving a physics or calculus equation is incredibly satisfying.  Lastly I want a career that will make me decent money, but also be something that I would enjoy doing for the rest of my life and I think engineering will be that career path.  Ideally, I would like to find a job in the defense sector, developing and improving on gear that I used when I was on the Marine Corps Bomb Squad.  I think I would be especially well suited for this occupation because I could bring both a practical, experienced view point to the table, as well and a engineering point of view."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1920,"Why do I want to go into a stem field... well it is because I love math. I was a theater major before and I got to the point where I was only doing theater major classes and it started to feel like I was just going to school to play games all the time, which was fun but I did not want to do this my whole life and for my job. The thing that I noticed I missed the most was math and I could not stand to live without it. I actually wanted to be an engineer before when I was in high school because my whole life I spent inventing little gadgets. But last minute I changed that and decided to do theater. So now I am here back and a civil engineer because building have always meant a lot to me and when I think back into my memories the first thing that comes up are the places and buildings the memories were in. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1921,"My path for majoring in computer science started in my high school year. I use to always wonder how a computer system and machine learning work. As programming was mandatory in my first year of high school and I was never good with it. So, I took some programming classes in my last year of high school, which helped me understand better after suffering from a failure before in the class. But, I learned that knowing programming won’t just help me, I have to also learn physics and mathematics which are as important in this field. It was a struggle in the beginning after starting college in California as education was different in the STEM field back in India, but following my passion for cybersecurity is just keeping me up. I’m learning more about the field I’m interested in as there are a lot of opportunities in the Bay area. I’m well aware of my passion for computer science and the field I would love to work in the future. Programming is much more interesting and fun to do after knowing how the machine works around you on day to day basis."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1922,"I have been obsessed with science since I was a child, whether it was watching shows dealing with it or having a science segment in class, I couldn't wait. That being said originally I had given up on doing any form of STEM due to advisors telling me I would not succeed. Because of this I went into the automotive field only to come back after several years to do my STEM degree in computer science. It is so interesting how our lives revolve around science, math and tech, that also being said there is the aspect of living in the bay and the reality is we need to pay for rent, and life. This allows me to have my other interests seperate from my major while working on a way to combine aspects of them in CompSci."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1923,"I want to go into the STEM field because I liked doing research. I was not sure what I wanted to do for a long time and when I went into research for an internship I suddenly felt like I had found out what I wanted to do with my career. I started taking classes more seriously and doing much better in class in general. I loved what I did and wanted to make sure I could do what I could do to be in that environment again. Not only did I feel like I liked research, I also felt like I was good at it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1924,"I want to go into the STEM field because it is where innovation and problem solving are often rewarded. There are a lot of issues in the world, and each is complex in its own way. The only way we as humanity will ever be able to fix these issues is through technology and innovative solutions that fix these problems at their source. The model of trying to alleviate the problem's symptoms isn't sustainable; for instance, sending food to nations in order to alleviate global hunger, or cutting back on one's car usage to combat climate change won't work, as these are only temporary fixes that won't solve the problems themselves. STEM can fix these issues, through solutions like genetically modified plants (such that they can grow anywhere, creating food for millions), or creating efficient green power that can overtake coal and fossil fuel usage entirely. These things are entirely possible, as STEM sometimes entertains the most ludicrous-sounding ideas at the time, which eventually turn out to be revolutionary. For instance, at one point, the idea of the light bulb might not have been thought highly of outside of scientific circles; however, it is a crucial part of daily life today. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1925,"I want to go into the STEM field because it is vast and covers a lot of areas that have a way to change or determine how things will work in the future.  New scientific discoveries happen all the time, and they can help make technologies to make things more efficient, or provide alternatives to previously used methods that may be harmful to the planet.  There is a lot to learn and explore in this field that seems interesting to me, and I want to learn how a lot of things work.  For example, I like to see how things are built and how they work, but I don't have a lot of experience in building and do-it-yourself.  One specific thing I am interested in are computers because it seems like there is so much they can do and help people with, but because of technology they can be extremely small nowadays when they used to be huge about 50+ years ago."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1926,"I attended school in a village of about 1000 people in southeast Wisconsin. There wasn’t a lot of effort put into learning about computers and definitely nothing involving programming. I did not take physics in high school and I graduated in 2009. I attended a local community college for some time for computers, but it didn’t pan out for me and I did not receive a degree. After spending some time working, I decided to make a change in my life and joined the military. In the military, I got the job of aviation electrician and had some fun. I then decided to separate from the military and live in California. After some more time looking for work, I decided to use my military benefits to go back to school. I have always had some interest in computers, so when it was time for me to decide what my goal was for attending Pasadena Community College, I decided on computer science."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1927,"I want to go into a STEM field for many reasons. One of the biggest reason, and one I consider to be the most important is because it is something that I really like, and something that I know I would enjoy doing. My major is engineering, and engineers are problem solvers, that’s essentially what  they do, they solve problems, and some of these problems can be thought as puzzles. Solving problems and trying to find their solution is something I’ve always personally enjoyed doing. I also like that we interact with stuff that engineers have worked on, on a daily basis. We drive on roads every day, we live in houses, we work in buildings, we cross bridges, etc. These are things engineers work on.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1928,"My first exposure to computers was back in early 2000s when my family bought our very first computer. My uncle who has CS degree showed me what can be achieved with computers and ever since then I was interested in computers. I'm majoring in Computer Science and the reason is I'm really like building softwares that can be used in our daily life. Whether it's word, excel or some computing program, I always found them fascinating how it changed our lives. People used to use typewriting device to write articles but nowadays we use typewriting software and publish them on the internet. In a way it makes me feel like I'll be left behind if I don't learn how these work. I'm not only feeling threatened by technology but also passionate to learn how they work and be part of the innovation for this era we're living in. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1929,"Since I started attending college, I always gravitated towards STEM majors. For a long time, I did not know what I wanted to major in and it changed a lot. I would say what really spiked my interest to pick a STEM major was calculus. My freshman year of college, I did not know what I wanted to major in, but I did know, no matter what, I wanted to take calculus. I ended up taking 3 semesters of calculus, all which my community college offered. Along the way, I switched majors from biology, engineering, math, and applied math. During that time period, I also felt some kind of fear of wanting to program and thought it would be too hard of a field to focus on. But, I finally decided to settle on majoring in computer science. I took my first programming class about a year ago and I enjoyed it. Learning how to solve problems with programming was great. I look forward to learning more about programming and technology during my duration of attending SFSU."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1930,"I find it pretty funny how I was introduced to the STEM field. I was originally a nursing student back in community college because I just thought it was a fit for myself because I'm Filipino and we are more commonly known as nurses and thinking that my family would help with my studies. I later transferred to a different college, not knowing fully if I should pursue nursing. When spring break came around the corner, I took a vacation to Tahoe with my family, specifically my uncle who happens to be a civil engineer. This uncle, I am very close with, showed me his work that he was trying to finish up before we started enjoying the week in Tahoe. He later began to ask me questions just about college in general because I explained to him how I was scared that I would pick the wrong major and forever regret my decision. Toward the end of the trip, he started showing me more of his work as a civil engineer and it kinda just sparked my interest. So once my campus was open again, I signed up to meet with a counselor and stated how I do not wanna be a nurse anymore and I would like to switch to a civil engineering major. I never looked back at this decision and I am sure I will be happy in the future with my decision."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1931,"I have always known that I would get into STEM, but I have no idea where would be a good fit. I started exploring for myself in the science class and environment of my high school years. Physics, Biotech, and Marine Bio have played a major role in my pursuit of STEM. For while I wanted to explore the oceans more. However, we need better technology and supplies to further exploration. So overall I found that Ocean engineering would be the ultimate goal and my reason to be in school."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1932,"I want to go from into the STEM field (Civil Engineering) because math and science have always been interesting to me, especially in items that we can see. Civil engineering also gives me the ability to help people and design structures that will keep people safe. I really like how CE weaves physics and math into everyday life and how society runs. You can point to a structure and say that it was designed by a civil engineer. Furthermore, the nature of design work allows for some creativity and team based problem solving. I thrive in group projects (when everyone else is also contributing). Thus, when I am able to discuss projects with other individuals, it helps with the design portion of a project. Design work on the computer also allows for some technology to be used which also peaks my interest. Therefore, these are my mine reasons for going into a STEM field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1933,From a very early age i found myself trying to figure out how the elctronics of my house worked. i took apart everything. Obviously a small child cant learn much from taking apart a VHS player but it did lead me down this path. i started out taking Drafting classes in highschool. I thought that most of the process was way too tedious but the part that i did like was the problem solving. Most of drafting was like a puzzle. The process involved looking at a picture and reverse engineering the rendering process. I had to figure out how to make curves and angles that i didnt directly have the tools for. I have this series of classes to thank for my problem solving skills and my general interest in a dynamic work experience. One of my bigger fears is ending up with a job thats boring. I do not want to do the same tasks every day in the same way until i die. I like the idea of being a part of the solution to a big problem or being a very unique part of a products execution and deployment. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1934,"I am in the stem field because I have always loved using technology growing up. At home, I have always been the guy to go to, if you needed help with setting things up or simple troubleshooting. Math has always been the easiest subject during school. I chose Computer Science because of a teacher I had in middle school, who really inspired me on what tech can do. This class was a robotics class where we build robots for simple automation. I really had fun building these things and wanted to learn how to program because the programming side of the machines would only be handled by the professor and his raspberry pi. Eventually later life, I would end up building my own PC and really begin to code various project ideas. Some of those project ideas included Minecraft Mods, server chats, and making websites."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1935,"The reason for why I want to go into the STEM field is a long story. The abridged version is that I want to get a job that makes a lot of money. My life Story so far is that I watched a lot of episodes of early Pokemon, this got me into video games. A few years later I started to watch a few videos of people playing video games on YouTube, this is the point that kicked off my love for technology and I knew that I wanted to do something with computers or video games. I carried this love for technology for years, with strengthened my love for video games and found a new internist in anime. When I got in my first year of high school I had my first true programming experience with a intro into computer programming course were I learned HTML and CSS. After that I took at least one CSC course every year so eventually it will result in me getting a high paying technology job."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1936,"Stem, and specifically physics, helps me understand the world in really interesting ways. I find myself quite frustrated when thinking of the scale of the universe and I want to understand better how it came to be. For a similar reason, I am also majoring in philosophy. In that regard, I am seeking to understand better how we function in the very existence that I'm trying to understand as well. I want to keep learning no matter where I am in life, and as such, I want to pursue my PhD in either physics or philosophy, so I can not only continue my journey of learning, but help others with it as well. Although the applications of stem are highly impactful, I find the implications of the theories to me much more interesting. I don’t yet know if research is something I’ll find passion in, but I’m hopeful that it will be. Another aspect of stem that I enjoy is the tangibility of improvement within it. Understanding of math is easily measurable, as opposed to many of the humanities. For my biological anthropology class for example, it can be hard to tell if I am understanding all of the information in a way where I can synthesize it and apply it to different studies. It mainly comes down to the fact that I am comfortable with a struggle in math as opposed to other fields of study. And physics is the real world application of that math. Although I must admit that the application of it is obviously much more difficult. I’m more easily met with dismay when working on physics problems."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1937,"Honestly, STEM wasn't my choice until my senior year of high school. I took one intro to engineer/robotics class and thought that is what I would be learning/doing in college. I was sort of right and sort of wrong. I wouldn't necessarily say I chose the wrong major, but it is not what I expected so far. I know there are many more classes to take, so I am just waiting to take those. I love tech so just going into that field as a career is what made me choose STEM. Also, I looked up starting salaries for some jobs and it really caught my eye. It isn't all about the money, I want to be able to help low-income communities and give opportunities to minorities like me, and tech is the future so I want to help them with it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1938,"I want to get into the STEM field because I've always loved math, physics, and technology. It is my passion. Being a problem solver in the classroom and at work can lead to you being a problem solver in life as well. Being trained in a STEM field can assist you in your everyday world and can even save you money. The STEM field offers a wide variety of jobs, with high pay. There are STEM jobs in numerous different fields ranging from research assistant to physics educator. The STEM field even has less competition and you get lot to learn and experience while working in the STEM field. You also have the chance to work on the cutting edge of fields like medicine, computer technology, robotics, and moreThis is the reason why I want to consider the STEM field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1939,"About four years ago I didn’t really know what to do. But I ended up visiting a friend and he showed me his programming when he was working on a game, and I got a little inspired by it. It wasn’t until a year in when I tried my own hand programming. It felt nice like solving a puzzle. After that I decided to seriously take on learning how to program through a proper education pathway. I wanted to learn more because it felt like it was something I actually wanted to do in life. And only later when I tried making data structures and trying my hand at reverse engineering a sorting algorithm that I realize it’s something I want to keep doing. I’m a little jaded with all the extra classes I have to take but at least now after 2 years of extra classes I can start taking programming more seriously."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1940,"I want to go into the STEM field because of the variety of subjects that are within the field, which are very important for the future and understanding of our world. Since I was a kid, I was always interested in computers, how they functions, how websites are made, and coding. I always felt very good and happy about myself when I accomplished creating a piece of code for a website, and anything computer related. I would constantly be on my computer, and I knew that I wanted to go in the STEM field as I grew and still kept that interest. To me computers, coding, and technology are going to be a big part of our world in the future, and I am happy to be a part of that in the future. It also involves math and science, which is why I have to take physics as well, as a part of my major."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1941,"I definitely have a greater love for the arts than I do for the STEM field, but that's precisely why I prefer to work within the STEM field. I love art, but I'm *good* at math. STEM-related practices seldom face issues of subjectivity, so success often comes with achieving the perfect cross-section of thorough and succinct. With STEM the problems faced are often clear however the solutions are widely varied (within reason). With art, there really isn't a ""problem"" so the answers are infinite (devoid of reason). Having no clear direction every day working outside of STEM and yet being held to capitalistic 40-60 hour work weeks suggesting a significant expected output of content would leave me with nothing but stress. Such stress would kill my desire to continue in the field and probably destroy my hobby on the way out. STEM, on the other hand, follows the same logic and processes as much of life's unavoidable work so I don't mind doing it, again and again, day after day. Ultimately, I consider STEM to be work and the arts to be fun in my life. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1942,"The most important reason why I have to get into the STEM field is because it is  mandatory for my major, I am a civil engineering major so for me to be able to understand my major I need to have the general education of the STEM field. Other than a huge reason why I chose my major was because I am into the STEM field. Physics has been one of the only classes that I have actually loved solving and studying. I always wanted to know how everything works, how cars are moving, stopping or braking, I wanted to know to were walking and not flying, how are things falling and not floating, and that's just the start of it. I always had unanswered questions that I was so interested to learn about and I believe getting into the STEM field will help me solve most of these questions. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1943,"I am going into the STEM field because of Computer Science and Engineering. I have been surrounded by computers since a young age and got fascinated by the endless possibilities they provided. At first when I started messing around with computers playing video games, I did not know much of what happens underneath the cover. When I started digging into how a computer is able to visualize graphics to display on a screen using mathematical and electrical proofs was a great day. I got sucked into a bunny trail, going from a software perspective into a hardwire perspective. capacitors, diodes, resistors and the rest of the fun stuff. I started and pulling apart laptops, computer towers, even keyboards and mouses. I somehow ended. up working at a computer cafe where I had to handle upgrades, networks, software maintenance and it felt amazing to be surrounded by it. Now I want to further my studies and learn more about the basics of how it formed. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1944,"I want to go into a STEM field because it will make me enough money to live a middle class life. It’s also something that might be interesting, so I wouldn’t have to spend my life doing something monotonous, and in this day and age it’s all you can do to stave off the boredom created by the mechanisms of our lives which satisfy and create an increasingly short attention span. Truly this world is the only one, and we must embrace our worldly desires in such a way that creates a cocoon of desire and achievement, so that we could shield ourselves from eventualities, if only for a little while. The creation of knowledge, acting upon that knowledge, and creation itself are simply existential cries for help. It’s an endless staircase that people descend until they themselves are a step, having known nothing else in life but what comes after."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1945,My main reason why I am going into STEM is because I have always had a deep interest in astronomy. I love educating myself about the universe and I’m excited to apply some of the skills that I am learning in physics to my future career.
