2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1944,"I think my greatest takeaway from this class is the accessibility of learning about electricity. By that I mean it seemed much more straightforward than what I had originally thought before joining the class, whereas prior to the class I had known next to nothing. For instance, the first lesson of the class, where we learned about charge, was very straightforward and a good foundation to go and learn about what the rest of the class had to offer. The simple concept that a positive charge is attracted to a negative charge, and like charges repel gave way to visualizing the electric field, which is manipulated by different charges, and of course which led to our understanding of electric flux when talking about the electric field passing through the surface, and so on until we reach the end of the semester. In particular, I took away the concepts from this class to remember, which were accessible because they were a lot of the time discussed first without the mathematical principles behind them, instead their basic intuition, which really helped my understanding. I hope that made sense, basically the concept before the underlying principle really helped put this into perspective, and is a good structure for learning things in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1933,"my greatest take away from this class is that the information can be presented in an engaging way no matter how complicated the topic. the reason that i view this as a lesson is because i can use this to benefit myself in future classes. When dealing with the base physics class it kind of just felt like i was doing math problems which didnt stick to well where as the the applications we pick up in the lab get the point across as well as connecting the dots. if i can manage to make myself a once a week ""lab"" for my tougher classes i think that it would be very beneficial and easier."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1942,"The greatest take away I took from this class is Ive learned a lot on how to be able to look at a physics problem, in other words when I look at a physics problem I always used to start it up by solving for numbers and trying to get the correct answer however, after this class Ive learned how to understand the problem, what is going on in the problem, find an actual real life example to such a problem to be able to imagine it, and from there I am able to know whether my answer makes sense or not. Another thing I took from this was how to work as a group, be a group member which encouraged me to be able to communicate and participate with other students and brainstorm our ideas to be able to reach a conclusion. To sum it all up, this class showed how to imagine a physics problem I am approaching and be able to brainstorm many ideas with a group of other students and to be able to reach a conclusion to our answer for the problem and describe our answer. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1926,"My greatest take away from this class is that I learned more in the Navy about electronics, while working as an aviation electrician, than I thought I did. I would say another thing that I took away from this class, or physics classes in general, is that I find physics interesting. I may not be the best at understanding physics, but it is still interesting to me. I have had all my physics classes online and physics labs online, but I have to say that this physics lab was the best one I've had so far. I feel like I learned a lot from this lab, even without having to tear out my hair over some of the lab designs of previous classes. Thankfully, I don't believe I have to take another physics class after this semester, but if I did I would try to get you as an instructor."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1927,"I think my greatest takeaway from this class is that you don't always need a physical laboratory to make a good well rounded lab that will help us understand the basic concepts of what we are learning. While I still prefer to have a physical lab, and I still believe it to be better, I have seen that it is not always necessary. A good thought out and properly executed online virtual lab will in the end achieve its goal of helping us better understand the material we are learning."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1941,"My greatest take away from this class has been that it's so much more important to understand the generalized concepts and interactions between these physical phenomena in a simplistic and visual way than it is to understand the hard math in terms of making the information meaningful and having it stick to you. All of the exceptionally more difficult work done in my physics class taught me very little about the true nature of these concepts. Instead, I just shoved a bunch of formulae into my brain and spit out numbers whenever commanded. This class was actually fun and memorable as seemingly easy the assignments were. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1925,"My greatest takeaway from this class was how to think about problems conceptually or qualitatively rather than always trying to figure out exact numbers for problems.  Sometimes it is faster to solve problems this way because you don't need to calculate anything, but understanding how things work and how things will change when one variable in the problem changes is really useful to understand first what happens, which can help when trying to solve a problem."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1940,"My greatest take away class, was how it was taught and explained. In my PHYS 232 lecture class that I am in, it has not been very easy to keep up with the material, especially since all the lectures are pre recorded, and we can only ask the professor questions on the one day we meet. But in lab, it has allowed me to expand my knowledge in physics, since we can ask any question that we are confused in during lecture, as well as the labs also give us a clear view of what the topic we are learning in lecture is about. The labs have been very nice to do since it is not repetitive, and some day it is a simulation, while another day it can be a in person lab. It has been very nice being part of this class, and it has definitely helped with my learning in physics and I appreciate everything professor Tennant has done for us."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1924,"My greatest take away from this class is seeing things for yourself is always another great way to learn, if reading about something isn't doing the trick. For me, physics is something I have trouble understanding, but when I can see the phenomena occurring right in front of me, it becomes easier to comprehend and digest. However, for other classes like math, I prefer reading about the theories and proofs, and doing a few examples. For math, the reverse is true; my understanding doesn't change much when I see it visually, such as on a graph. Moving forward in my college classes, I will try to see what method works best for me, ideally at the start of a class. I will then use that method to succeed, and make improvements on it if necessary. It has also made me appreciate the role of teachers/professors, who have to account for the many teaching styles and speeds of their students, while achieving the objectives they have set out for the class to complete over the course of a semester."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1935,"In the time that I have spent in this physics lab I have learned a few things. One of which being the most important that has been reinforced my entire school career, the idea that I should pay attentions to the smallest details while also looking at the bigger picture. I now take a mental note of each part of the equation in the formula so I can find what I needs so that everything will fall into place. Looking at the bigger picture does help me see what I will need to solve the problem by looking at what parts of the formula are given and what parts I am missing. With this idea that I have been taught my entire life and reinforced by this class It will help me through out the rest of my life, paying attention to the entire picture helps me find what I need to keep tract of to get the desired end result and looking at the little things does make me try to find all the smaller aspects of the question so I can get the desired end result.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1930,"I think that this physics class has helped me become a better overall student because we have been forced to do zoom. Some subjects are just a bit more difficult to understand in your home environment with all the distractions so this forces students like myself to gain a better grasp on what works to help my understanding of subjects and topics. This semester has been one of my most difficult semester on zoom and i think that being how it is does force myself to become a better student and just be more responsive toward my grades. I am just very curious about how my strategy for learning new material will transition to in person because we will be in person for next semester and I will be honest, I am very nervous. This semester being one of my most difficult semesters in a while after returning to school, I am more curious as to how the environment at the campus will affect my overall performance at my school work."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1920,"I think that my biggest take away from this class is that no matter how hard life is getting to you, if you have a good professor that goes through the work with you in class, you won't get behind. I had one of the worst months of my life this year and this professor (who I have had before and helped me so much last time too) had such a wonderful class to come to where it felt like she really cared about her students and it was just really nice. I did get really lucky and all the labs that we had to do during this really hard time, we did all together as a class and I got all of my work done in class including the post labs, summaries, and feedbacks. It was the only class that I did not get behind on and I am really thankful for her.    "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1938,"I love the idea of Laboratories. There are a lot of great things that can be learned from this course. It a great way to individualize students work and reposes and learning how to collaborate with other on different topics and ideas.This seems like a great resource to us in the classroom and it is definitely something I will explore more. I think there needs to be some face to face training where we can see first hand how to utilize all the resources the laboratories have to offer.I think this course will aid students into learning and understanding physics better, especially in college. Students are use to specific styles of classrooms and lectures and this breaks them out of that mold.I am really happy to be in this class, and I've learned alot."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1932,"My greatest takeaway from this class was not so much the material, but more about working in a group. i really got to learn how to interact with other students to complete a shared assignment. Furthermore, the use of online simulations and communications helped when connecting with new students in a safe and positive manner."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1931,"A takeaway I took from this class, was learning different aspects of physics. Some of the materials were online and on a google document, others were physically in our hands, and others involved online work. My favorite was the Matlab portion. Even though I was lost half of the time, I slowly started understanding the material and learned how to use functions and get outputs from an equation (like the differential equation, as well as graphing our function). Overall I loved the groups and interaction with other students and the professor. I hope others enjoyed the class as well. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1919,"My greatest take away from this class was a more thorough understanding of some of the tools and equipment I used when I was in the Marine Corps.  For example, The metal detectors that we used to sweep for IED's with, would only sense the wire or object if the Detector head was moving.  Another tool we used to detect for deep buried ordnance such as bombs, would sense changes in magnetic fields.  Lastly, this class helped me understand basic electronic circuits better. I actually sent the link to one of the simulators to a few buddies of mine to help them teach the new guys about circuits.."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1934,"My biggest takeaway from the class are the concepts and how difficult they are at first. This lab class is schedule in accordance to our lecture class. In my case, this lab class has most of the time been ahead of my lecture class. So that means some topics were totally new, or not yet spoken about in lecture class. I know realize that this is actually helpful for my learning style. I am used to being able to solve, for example math problems very fast. I already knew how to approach my math problems. On the other hand physics takes time for me because I need to re-read problems over and over. This class has helped understand the physics problem even though I could not solve it in that moment. This class is more informative than my lecture which has helped tremendously for my webassign problems."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1945,"my greatest take away from this class was learning how to apply the concepts I learned in the physics 232 equvilent class I took last semester at the other school I attended my first two years of university. Overall, I enjoyed this class and enjoyed learning on how to code and use SAGE. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1936,"My greatest takeaway is really that I have no diea if I want to stick with physics. I am also majoring in philisophy and so far I've had a far better experience with the faculty in that field. Prof. Tennant has been wonderul and by far the most condusive to my learning experience, yet at the end of the day, I thin kthe ciriculum is lacking in facilitating motivation in learning each section. Having the contrast of high levels of interaction in this class, and such little interaciton im my other lecture helps keeps my hopes high but ultimately leaves me feeling frustrated that I dont have someone passonate in teaching physics in my main lecture, as opposed to someone as enaging as Prof. Tennant in for the lab section. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1928,"The greatest take away from this class for me was learning how electric circuits work. I didn't understand the concept of resistance and current that well but with the pipeline and water analogy it became much more clearer. I'm the type of student who understands concepts better with something to compare to from real world. Also, I got better with management because of this class. I used to usually push things until the very last second and I missed 2 post lab work earlier in the semester. I then decided to do the post labs right after the lab finishes and that worked out pretty good for me. I think I'm going to keep that habit for my other activities in my life as well. I also like how professor go over concepts before we head into the lab. It really makes lab more straight forward and easier. Maybe that's something I have to do in the future for other activities too. Review and understand it better before actually start doing the work. :)"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1921,My greatest takeaway from this class is that I learned a lot about electric fields and currents. The class was really fun to take as it was really interesting the way the professor explained all the concepts. I’m not that great with physics topics but not I know pretty well how electricity and magnetism work. I would say the experiments while home doing gives a better idea of how in our day-to-day life those topics revolve around us. Overall the class was really great and the professor made it really easy for us to understand and work in a team. It went interesting and I liked the way we use some coding to evaluate the equation and create one with provided details. Lab lectures were really helpful besides the actual physics class.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1918,"My greatest take away from this class (besides some of the people I've met) would probably be comprehending how resistors and capacitors work. I feel like out of everything, it's probably the part that would help me in my life the most considering how you can essentially find these components playing an important role in most day to day appliances. I never really knew much about them previous, and I never really knew how placing them in series or in parallel played a role in the resistance that would be applied, and having learned about it, I'm curious about the application of them and where the different placement of them would best apply. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1943,"My greatest takeaway from this class is the friendship and bonds we made these 13 weeks of class. The physics and math was pretty cool and all, but it made my head hurt and I would rather have a smooth shiny brain instead of an ugly wrinkly brain. My electrons firing got too tired to the point their insulation fell off, alas that is the sacrifice we make in order to become more knowledgeable. Hopefully it heals from resting up. The class taught me the value of hard work, perseverance and how to follow instructions well. Given that following instructions is hard since I tend to break them, it taught me to be more concise and double check my work. Even tho I rarely do, I checked my work more than twice on several occasions so that is a dub. Yeah, maths and physics are cool but I am happy to finally stop dabbling in them. I would rather mess with computers and wires and software."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1937,My biggest take away from this class is that working with a group is a skill. There were times when I would join a break-out room and there was no cooperativeness and other times where everyone did their part. I feel this isn't talked about but would greatly help out in a future job. I feel I gained more experience in group work to be a better co-worker.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1922,"My greatest takeaway was even when I was confused about concepts it was still valuable to talk them out with others in groups and most of the time I was not as confused as I thought I was. Being able to talk with my team and actually have an engaging class even when we were lost in a concept was such a powerful experience since we could always find a way out of the problem or spur on a convo about the topic. It wasn't about being right, it was about figuring out the answer together and building that team connection. I really have learned to appreciate the in class environment that much more than what it was before covid. I feel like we took interaction for granted and we probably will again once we have more in person life come back but in this current time its been a refresher being able to see folks, and work on problems together while making friends."
