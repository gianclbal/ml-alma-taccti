2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1938,"i was taken over with the joy when i got the opportunity to learn online, it was like the power of learning has my control over it. In the beginning i felt it was very helpful as i could work around things and don't have to stick with the original way of learning. But, then i got introduced to the evils of this new world. I learned that students started abusing this golden opportunity, by secretly collaborating with other classmates, search answers on online platforms for tests and quiz. I also experienced some un-ethical behavior from some professors online, as they didn't seem motivated enough to spread the seeds of knowledge rather did a lazy job just to collect paycheck. As my elders have always taught me that there are no shortcuts to success, i always did my work with honesty and it paid me in the end with a good grade. I believe that honesty is the best policy and every one should work accordingly, but i feel that a lot of people from both student and professors side were not prepared for this sudden chang, but i am glad that its over and we can get back to the traditional learning style. Just because its old doesn't mean its obsolete, and i am a firm believer of the fact that old is gold."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1926,"When classes first shifted to online, it was a huge adjustment for me. I have attended a college before, nearly ten years ago, and attempted online classes, but they did not go well. I started going to school with the mindset to avoid online classes as much as possible. When that was no longer an option, my grades suffered. I have since become more accustom to online classes and have been doing better. I am someone who enjoys staying home, I just get way too distracted during online class periods to effectively pay attention. This is why I still prefer in-person classes to online classes. I feel that I learn much better in face-to-face classes. I don't seem to have too much of an issue with mental problems while attending online classes and being stuck inside more than usual, because as I said I enjoy being inside. When it comes to paying attention in classes and limiting distractions, I found it useful to plan out my schedule so I know when to focus and when to relax. I also find it useful getting rid of my phone or other distractions while attending class so I can focus entirely on the material. This is still difficult to do as we are using computers with a lot of resources for distraction, but I have been managing so far."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1932,"Online classes have been a two sided coin for me. On one hand, I have more freedom and seem to get good grades, but I also seem to learn a bit less because of the lack of physical presence. It is easy to just log into zoom and only listen to certain parts while doing other tasks at home. However, I do like them because I have been able to continue my education in a safe and healthy way."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1930,"I think that online classes have helped me gain a better understanding on how i can fully become a better student. Since covid has forced us to go online, it would be seen as harder to get real in person help toward class and school work. Since I am forced to learn more on my own, it helps me understand more of how i can learn, how to retain more information for myself only. Teachers in my experience, just give the bare minimum for some topics, so with us going to online it forced myself to gain a better understanding of how i can retain information better and will help myself over the years in school. I think there is just a limit to how much I can learn on my own and being transferred to online helped solidate how i can improve as a student. Having to be forced into online classes for certain classes is challenging because I still do believe that I learn better with hand to hand experience and some classes do not have the same feeling as to being in person. Having online classes causes students to be more lazy because it is online so you can find videos and recordings that you can watch later, but if you would like to more understand the material, online classes force students either to become a better learner or more curious as to how the material should be learned."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1918,"When I get the chances to be at home to take online courses, it allows for me to fully wake up before getting to any of my assignments, as well as saves me money, and a trip on Bart which tends to not be the cleanest mode of transportation in the world, the trip to campus also tends to cost me about 1.5 hours each way, resulting in 3 hours of my day that I could be doing work being spent commuting.. When I need to take a breather to do something else, I'm able to at step away from my computer, fix myself some food, or watch a video or two. I'm not particularly worried about how loud I am, and am able to reach out to other students via services like discord if I do find myself having trouble with the material and want a better understanding. If I'm feeling tired, I'm not reliant on grabbing something to give me energy such as coffee or an energy drink, or what I tend to do which is try and push through it resulting in me potentially falling asleep on bart or immediately once home, rather I can simply take a quick nap and wake up a little while later ready to continue whatever it was I was focussed on previous."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1945,"Learning online has been incredibly difficult for me in the sense of doing physics. Online learning made it harder for me to understand the concepts of what we were covering but I am doing my best to make it work. I have adapted to online learning but it still is hard for me sometimes; I can learn and understand material for better when I am in class in person. For self care, it something that I prioritze; I spend lots of time outside, getting fresh air, working out, and eating healthy. The concern I have for my learning and well being is semester has been a bit challeging for me regarding mental health issues that got in the way of my work. Overall, I am doing my best and looking forward to going back to in person learning!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1922,"Online classes make life easy, they allow me to stay remote while still getting an education, on the downside is social iteration and that extra cohesive glue to my education, but when time and money is saved and I can add stuff that boosts relaxation."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1933,i cannot wait until i have no other choice but to return to the classrooms. my mental health really took a dive when we began zoom university. waking up and doing work in the same place is not a really healthy routine. the best that ive been able to do as far as maintaining myself is just staying aware of my situation. Ive had. a lot of highs and lows these past few terms and what has gotten me through most of the lows was waiting them out. i couldnt really do much if i started the day off on a bad note or woke up miserable other than waiting for the next day.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1934,"Online classes have required me to do a lot of self-teaching. I think self-teaching could be good or bad for some people. I do really enjoy when my online classes have their assignments due by the end of the week instead before the class time. I think it adds a lot of flexibility on my schedule, and in general add more time to get help with an assignment if needed. I think if we moved backed to pre-Covid times, I think it will be more stressful because of the more immediate due dates. Before Covid my homework sessions were about 1-2 hours, but now because we have more time to do our assignments I spend 3-6 hours a session. Although it is more hours at the desk, it does pain me as much as you would think because its fits my schedule. I also like that I dont have to be in San Francisco because I would have to work many hours a week to pay for rent. Whereas I can stay with my parents rent free, as long continuing my studies or else I would have to pay here though."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1920,"It has impacted me in some really difficult ways. It is so hard to learn a civil engineering degree online, almost impossible, professors are so hard to understand especially when you are a visual learner. I have no motivation to go to class, I have no friends which have never been a problem before, the only good thing about them is that I can go home to visit my family. This online learning makes me feel like I am going insane. All I can do for self care is step away from school and my computer. I just don’t know what else to do other than just leave. It is so hard, and I just really really cannot wait for school to be back in person again. I miss the professors. I miss leaning. I miss caring. I just really don't like this. I know some people are loving this, but I feel like my life was just ripped out from under me. I feel scared to go back to school, like I won’t be able to do it anymore. I was not prepared for this type of learning and you can tell no one else was including the school which is why it made it so difficult.    "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1936,"Online classes have been a mixed bag for me. Somtims it feels as though I am gaining convenience at the expense of the quality of my education. Some classess have been setup in such a way that I have learned more than ever, and others where I constantly feel like Im lacking conceptually. In online classes, if I ever get behind, the bare minimum always feels like the best option while trying to catch up. But, having online classes allowed me to attend my grandfathes funeral this past week in Rhode Island, and allowed me to be there to help my Uncle when he hasa serizure. Online classes gives the flexibility to make plans and not have to spend extra on Bart fares. My self-care is somewhat behind. I have found passion in school which keeps me going, but I’m worried I’ll hit the same rut I did last simester."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1940,"During covid 19, and attending san francisco state university, it has definitely been a difficult transition from in person classes to online classes. Online classes are very difficult for me to maintain, since I sometimes have a lot of things going on in life, that I hold back on doing assignments until the last day because a lot of classes are at your own place. It has been nice being able to be at home, and spend more time with my friends and family, but it definitely could be a struggle paying attention to class, when you are constantly staring at a screen. I feel like I have been staying up later, which has not been good, but online classes have definitely helped me learn to schedule."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1937,"As far as it impacting my learning, it ruined it. The way I learn completely changed, I feel like I need to be in class now, I need to be in a space where I can get help from my peers. When it was in person I felt I could do it all on my own, and for the most part, I was able to, but as of late... I can't. For self-care, I am playing a lot of video games and going out to do stuff on my own or just be outside rather than staring at a screen all day. Most of my days I'll be looking at a screen for at least 8-10 hours, classes only take up around 2-3 hours but with extra work and projects, it just bums me out, de-energizes me, and actually causes me pain. Not excruciating pain but my eyes start to burn and cause me headaches. I'm really excited to be back in San Francisco because although I am not in person I get to see more of my friends in person this semester so that helps me destress from school. It's fun to always have someone to do something with and little by little everything is getting back to normalcy or safer."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1924,"Online classes have been a double-edged sword for me. On the one hand, I agree with most people's sentiment, that online classes remove the in-person element that is crucial for many courses; however, I have personally felt that I have become a better student due to this shift in learning. For instance, because you don't have immediate access to an instructor, you have to be resourceful: the internet has many great sites such as YouTube, where a quick search can reveal videos by many talented creators on a topic. Being able to find these videos has helped to solidify my understanding, and has allowed me to excel in the classes I am in.As for self-care, I believe it was always important, even before the pandemic. Humans are not robots; no matter how hard-working you are, your body and mind have limits, and must have the appropriate amount of rest and nourishment in order to work at its highest level. I try to step away from the computer every 1 to 1 and a half hours, and during that short break, I run on the treadmill or go outside.Overall, with 5G already in the hands of many people, and rapid advancements in technology, it was only a matter of time before remote learning & working became the new normal. I think for some, online learning provided a lot of freedom, as they were able to plan their schedules around themselves, rather than external events such as when school opens/closes, or how traffic is like at a certain time of day. I think I fit into this category, as I like to see how I can excel in a challenging environment."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1942,"Online classes have affected my learning so much, When covid hit I had to move back to my parents place to be near my family, My family are not very advanced with technology, they did not have a wifi router at home and the network where we lived was beyond horrible, the nearest wifi place was not so close and their wifi would sometimes shutdown and restart so I would get kicked out of the wifi and have to connect back again which happened to me through several classes and my professors would get mad and frustrated as I would have to log in and out into a zoom meeting while a lecture is being taught. So I wasn't able to attend many classes when all my lectures were online, not only that but also, during midterms, labs, or even quizzes (which are the most important requirements) I was not able to attend which affected my grade a lot. This resulted to having to repeat classes twice and still failing them, so I had to move back to the city where there is WIFI. So I am able to pass the same classes for the third time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1943,"Online classes have impacted my learning significantly, it actually made it a lot easier and better to manage because I do not have to walk around classes and exert social energy as much as I would have in an online setting. I am more comfortable with taking online classes than in person classes because I can zone out when I need to and not be worried about social conforming. AKA I can sleep in class with my camera turned off and no one would notice a thing. Yes! I love sleeping in class occasionally. I love sleeping, period. It is also a lot cheaper, because I do not have to commit to campus and buy my own meals. I save both time and money by staying at home like a sloth slobbing away at life. I also get to play games while I am in class so I can better focus on class. I do hate how non communal of a feeling online classes have, there is no feeling of class struggle as much as a in person class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1925,"I think online classes have been both beneficial and detrimental to my learning and self-care.  On one hand, having online classes makes it easy for me to attend, because all I need is a computer or laptop (preferably) and an internet connection, and I can immediately get to homework or other things after class ends.  It takes less time, and I can even re-watch the lectures if they are recorded, so it is easy to review what I may need or may have forgotten.  However, I feel like online classes have made me more lazy and less disciplined when it comes to school work and self care.  First of all, I don't need to worry about my appearance since I am staying at home most of the time.  It is also easy to make a habit of waking up late or not using a schedule, since it is so easy to attend class or even skip it in favor of watching the recording later.   Finally, there is a huge difference between in person and online classes because we are not physically or socially interacting with other students, which is an entirely separate issue.  These are my main concerns, although there are likely more issues or benefits to online classes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1919,"Online classes have tremendously increased my capacity for learning.  Although it does have its own set of challenges, the benefits have far out weighed those difficulties for me.  Online learning has allowed me have a much larger part in my daughters life while still pursuing my degree in mechanical engineering.  Having to commute to the city every day would absolutely make this immensely more difficult.  Furthermore, I am able to simply walk my daughter to her school in the morning and then get on my laptop for my classes all within the span of 5 minutes.  Having to commute would be much more time consuming, financially burdening, and negatively impact my relationship with my daughter and my family. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1921,"Online classes can be tough to learn the concept. Learning the material and keeping up with the class does get difficult. As for most of the classes, the lectures are already recorded and we don’t get the same environment as attending the class. Some students get disturbed and can’t study well due to this reason. I feel hard because you have to study and research a lot of concepts online to understand what’s going on with the class. It does get stressful throughout the semester but I try to keep it calm by studying every day and attending the lectures, so don’t miss any important details on any topics. I try to go to office hours frequently with my questions, as that’s the only way I can clear my doubts out and work with my assignments."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1935,"There are a few different types of way that online classes have had an effect on me since I have been taking all of my classes on line ever since the COVID 19 pandemic has hauled all of the in person classes. One good thing that I like about taking online classes is that I do not have to take the bus to get to my class. One thing that I do not like is that I feel like the classes are going a bit too fast, but luckily most of the professors allow us to see the slides the use for the lectures. Another thing I like about how classes are online is that I have a bit more time to rest in between my classes so that I can go to the kitchen to eat a proper meal and not just a bag of chips or go to the bathroom. Over all I do feel like online classes and in person classes do feel very similar since when I was still in in person classes I would just sit there an listen to the professor or instructor talk about and I would take notes on what is on the slides or what the instructor is saying almost word per word. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1928,Online learning has been convenient experience so far without having to commute. It has been positive experience and the only downside is that I had to keep good track of due dates of the homework. It was getting almost too comfortable that I got lazier compared to in person class. I feel like having some of the classes online and rest in person would be a good practice in the future. Because I like the convinience of not commuting and staying home but I definitely get lazier if I stay home all day for the week. Having to commute to the campus and studying in the library is quite essential for me to be productive.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1927,"Online Classes have negatively impacted my learning by a lot. I like going to school, I get in a very study ready, focus ready mood where I'm ready to learn and ready to do work. But at home I'm in a very lazy relaxed mood, home for me is where I relax, not work, so since the start of the pandemic it has been very difficult for me to stay focused and to be productive at home. Recently I have started to go to my local public library and I have seen very good positive results. So good that i ask myself why I hadn't done that before. I have been much more productive at the Library, I get everything I need to get done, sometimes I even get ahead a little bit. Overall it really has helped me a lot to get my work done. Seeing how productive i am in the library makes me really excited to soon be able to go back to campus because I know it will really help with my productivity and I will be much more successful at getting my things done at campus."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1941,"Online classes are WAYY easier and WAYY better in terms of access to materials and lectures etc. It's really nice to get to stay home and just roll out of bed a few minutes before class and hop in rather than go through all of the extra steps. So that's been good. However, I find it increasingly more difficult to focus in class, start assignments early or on time, or study. I think it's because nearly every waking moment of my life is spent right here in this chair in this corner of my apartment for every single reason you can think of. Bills, medical, groceries, taxes, appointments, friends, games, learning... it's all done right here so i'm hardly ever moving.I'm concerned I'm slowly losing my mind and losing all motivation to study / improve because the reward of seeing people at school and interacting in person is honestly what keeps me going most of the time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1931,"Online has been a struggle overall. Learning the tricks to be efficient and effective with quality work in my classes took a lot of time and continues to be. You can also see the way the professors teach as well. They struggle to try to teach us and we end up teaching ourselves. Another reason that it has been a struggle is the mindset and environment we create for ourselves in our own homes. When studying at home, there seem to be many different distractions that one might not be prepared for compared to studying at school. One for me could be parents needing help with technologies, or noises coming from their neighbors, or no sense of wanting to work since everything in your room is too comfortable. What I can say for online classes, is that it was a learning experience. I learn to discipline myself even more and I learn to time manage. I hope we can go back to in-person classes. "
