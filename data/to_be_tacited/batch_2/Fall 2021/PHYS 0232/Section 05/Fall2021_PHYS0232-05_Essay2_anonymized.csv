2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1934,"My current goals are to pass all my classes because this my first semester here at SFSU upon transferring. I major in Computer Science, so eventually I wish to start applying to internships. In order to get an internship, I will have grind technical problems because the internships will ask to solve various types of problems. A major immediate goal is to pass this class because I had previous taken this class at community college and I struggled so much. As a result, this is my second time taking this Physics 230. This time around the topics are more understandable, but I do still struggle. Thankfully there is some people in a Discord server, and sometimes help to understand our lectures. I also wish to stay on top of my due dates because iLearn is very organized compared to Canvas, used at my community college. A connection I can make is when I code basic video games. I must include some sort of logic of various forces than could be found in-game. For example, when had to include physics when I created a 2-D shooter game."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1935,"My goal for my entire life has been to make money, that has been my greatest motivation since I was 11. When I first decided on this I wanted to do something with video games but it changed into the much more vague ""something with technology"" when I found out that beta testing for video games is mindbogglingly tedious and not profitable. I knew since I was little that computers were the way of the future and that it would also pay well. I am going to college for a computer science bachelor's degree, this class is the last of the traditional science that I am required to take for my degree. At times I do not enjoy coding but I know that it will help me with my goal in the long run. By passing this class it will take me one step closer to being able to afford a house in this high housing market. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1941,"My primary goal is to get the knowledge I need to become an adept programmer and ultimately run my own consulting firm producing specialized programs for specific industries. Although the specific knowledge rendered from this class may not help me in my work as a programmer, the generalized concepts and mathematical relationships I'm learning about pervade most mathematics-based majors and the careers that follow. Successfully parsing a problem down into its necessary parts and solving chunk by chunk is extremely similar to the logic and thinking behind writing a successful program. Essentially, no day is wasted in these excess classes I take for general ed. etc. provided each one of them gives me an opportunity to ""stretch"" my brain and bring me closer to true comfort when dealing with complicated concepts in my field of work later. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1943,"My current goals for College is being able to finish a computer science degree. To meet the requirements for the degree I have to take and finish Physics and Calc 2, so it is a Necessary condition but insufficient towards completing the degree. The class is also helping build an understanding of electromagnetism in everyday life. I will find the knowledge particularly helpful if I do pursue a computer hardwire job. The degree does make science because it is a Science and Engineering degree so it would make sense to have some background in Science, particularly physics. The critical thinking skills imparted from the course will also help me towards the future when dealing with tasks on the job. I do enjoy learning about things that I will never use, just for the sake of collecting knowledge. It does broaden my sense of self and reveal how complex things in life are and how we take it for granted. For example, through the class I've been learning about flux, gauss law and how it occurs at the molecular level. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1937,"Honestly, it won't happen for a while, but I just want to graduate. The only way this class can help me is by passing, but that's on me putting in the effort. That is my goal, to graduate. And it is a bit cliche, most people that end up going to college want to graduate, but man is it rough out here. I know many people that will graduate with all these internships on their resume and I will have like 1, but I'll be proud with my degree. Just one struggle after the next, but right now I'm only worried about graduating, one way or another I'm going to have to get my Bachelors."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1930,"This class overall is keeping myself more scheduled and organized. After going back to school full time, the due dates that are set for this class have pushed my need to not procrastinate. I feel like I have a good pace on this semester and do not see any way that I can fall off. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1925,"My goals are to be someone who can contribute to society and have a stable living situation by getting a meaningful job, and to do so I will need to learn what I need for my Computer Science degree, how to interview and get a job, and how to budget my time and money, and how to work effectively.  This class can help me by causing me to critically think to solve problems, which is a skill that I will need in the future, as well as how to work with other people, which I may need to do when I get a job.  I also need to learn how to manage my time in this class and all my other classes, which is another important skill that I will need in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1933,"well i want my degree. in order to get my degree i need to pass this class. My degree would mean more to me than most things ive done with my life so that gives this class a lot of value. i understand that the problem solving skills will be very important as a professional but i believe i can get those skills else where. the only true value of this course to me, is the wow factor of the information and the fact that im one class closer to my degree."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1940,"My goal in this class is to learn physics with calculus and really understand in detail every aspect of each topic. I would like to learn it in an interesting, hands on, aspect, and learn through demonstrations, projects, and experiments in the class. So for what we have done has been very useful for my learning, and I have learned a lot in this class. I really like the simulations, and the questions that guide us through the simulations. Even though we are not in a in person class, it really feels like it, based on how we do the lab. I really like the structure of this course, and it has been very valuable to my learning. This class definitely helps review the material that we have gone through in lecture, and helps me understand material that I have not understood in lecture. I definitely need to start making some flash cards, rather than writing just notes so I can practice and really fully understand the material."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1919,"My goals are to graduate as fast as I can and find a steady job that I can support my family with.  I started my college experience later than many of the people here at SFSU so I feel I might be a little behind the curve.  To get back on track, I took some summer courses and am currently taking 19 credits this semester.  Probably wont take 19 credits again but after completely this semester i will have accomplished 2 years of schoolwork in 1 and a half.  Also, I would like to enroll in the combined bachelors/ masters program for mechanical engineering once the program is approved by the csu system.    "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1942,"I am civil engineer major and my goal in life is to open my own development company. opening up a developing company does not mean you have to be an engineer however, you could be a business investor however being an engineer would help you understand what your company does exactly since it has to do with building towers, building roads, building compounds and much more. Part of understanding everything, you will need to understand so much of physics which is a huge part of being an engineer. Therefore being in this class helps me be an engineer which helps me accomplish my goal and be successful in it. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1924,"My goals include becoming a good computer scientist. In computer science, it is crucial to be a good analyzer, as there are a lot of variables and things that need to be tracked. You need to have a good attention to detail, and have domain knowledge of many fields, in order to instruct the computer on how to become good at that thing. This class, like all physics classes, focuses on these core things, like how variables may change, and how different interactions may occur. It is good to have a domain knowledge in physics, as it is used in many other fields of science, and will be used in the future to make many new advancements. Having a good understanding of physics will help me greatly in my pursuits of STEM.Another goal I had was to be constantly curious about the world around me. I think we take the things in our life for granted, like electricity, hot water, and computers. Learning about these things and understanding what makes them work, I feel, will make me more appreciative of these inventions, and hopefully, I can create something like these inventions one day."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1928,"At the beginning of the semester, my goal was to learn about electricity and how modern devices work internally. I didn't really understood why we have couple breakers in our home electricity box and why every room has different breakers. I also wondered why electric cars like Tesla is struggling to expand it's commute range. Currently, Tesla Model 3 can travel up to 260miles but compared to gasoline cars it's not great number. I knew that my macbook adapter used 60W power and it charges slow compared to new USB-C type chargers. I wondered why can't we raise the 60W power to 120W or something to make it charge faster. I hoped to find answers to all my questions born out of my curiousity in real life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1918,"My goal is to become a computer scientist and make games for people. Honestly, this class can give me a few basic ideas on equations that could help me program mechanics, but besides that, the only real thing taking this level of physics really does for me is get me one step close to my degree. The content of the course is interesting, but it is so incredibly stressful and and difficult to learn in this period of time that it just doesn't feel like it was meant to advance computer science students in their field of study, it feels a bit more forced in. So essentially, my goal for the class in general is simply to pass, as unfortunate and unmotivated as that sounds. Although my goal is also just to pass this class, I suppose a sub category is to understand the concepts well enough to implement them for the problems given to us, although that is also just so that I can pass the class.(Notes: This isn't meant to bash the course, it's just how I feel considering the field I'm majoring in.)"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1922,"My goals in life might not tie directly to this class aside from it being required information but physics itself is widespread so having a little extra understanding about how physics works will not be detrimental. I am going into computer science so that field is pretty wide in terms of scope, meaning there might be a time that these physics classes might be beneficial. My goals are to graduate, find work and hopefully make enough money to enjoy my hobbies, and through those hobbies continue to connect with others as I have done in the past, increasing my networking. Mainly if I could omit physics I would but I think it is still an important stepping stone in the STEM path. I have used some physics concepts when working with other folks in the automotive and the engineering we sometimes have to use."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1938,"My goals:I want to be a computer programmer, I have very good interest in Web Development. This class can help me improve my critical thinking skills and it'll really help me go over my physics concepts so I can implement in my websites and projects in the future. My goals are to become a successful web developer, I have created many websites in the future, and I have both back-end and front-end knowledge.I love computers, physics and programming. I know a lot of CS languages: Python, Java, C++in my free time, I keep experimenting with the computers, and languages. Physics is also one of my favorite subjects because I have interests in things that make me put all of my mind into it. And I really like experimenting in physics, and this class helps me understand concepts easily, the explanation is amazing and I really enjoy working with these laboratories. So that's all."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1921,"My path is about majoring in computer science and working with both hardware and software. This class especially helps me with building a foundation of how to work and electric forces works. Physics is important in general when it comes to the computer engineering or computer science. This class would actually open more doors to get a job as I can work in machine testing and robotics, which are my fields too I’m interested in working in. So having the knowledge of physics with the field I’m majoring in would really help me achieve my goals. As of now, the place I work is a networking company, electromagnetism, and eclectic current are really important for us to understand the workforce. So I would say this class would really help me to achieve my goal besides just working with the software."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1920,"What are my goals? well I would say to learn to grow and be happy really, I think that is all people can really ask for. And this class is just one step of the large goal I have in mind. I took a class with this professor before and when I got asked this question I thought it was kind of stupid, I always thought... ""this class... I am taking it because I have to, how could it help me really.."" but after taking it I started to look at the world a little different. I started to see how this class really did help my understanding of the world. I would be sitting in the car and think ""wow this is happening right now because of this this and this which i learned from my phys class."" And to be honest it kind of makes me angry (not really angry of course) because like... I did not sign up for this, I am only taking this course to be able to take the next class on the list. But really I am learning and it makes me so happy and that .. That is my goal."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1927,"My goal is to become a civil engineer, and thus in order to achieve that goal I must graduate college. In college I have and will continue to learn many new skills that will make me a good civil engineer. This class being one that is required for me to achieve that goal is very important for me. The class will increase my knowledge and understanding electricity and charges. It will further increase my knowledge in many things that an engineer should know and understand in order to properly do his or her job. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1932,"My goals are to become a structural engineer. I would eventually like to own a firm that designs building and bridges. In order to do this I need to graduate, get my FE, get my PE, and gain enough experience and knowledge to start a company. However, before any of that, I must fulfill requirements in order to graduate. This class is one of those requirements. Although the content is not directly related to my major, it may help in critical thinking skills, communication, and a general understanding of how things work around me. Thus, I need to do work in order to pass this class and then move onto courses more directly related to my major and future career. This class is mainly a stepping stone in order to get to upper division engineering courses that will help me gain knowledge for my future aspirations. I am hoping that this class will go smoothly and thrust me into my future and help achieve those previously mentioned goals. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1936,"My goal right now is split in two directions. I'm currently double majoring in physics and philosophy but I’m not sure which I want to pursue. I love being in school and I don’t want to leave it, so I want to go as far as I can and get my PhD. So far I have more passion in philosophy but that might change the more I’m in the field of physics and start learning some of the more fun stuff. Being able to teach people at such a level is my real passion. This class is a step in that direction and I hope to continue learning so I can pass it on. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1926,"My goal is to attain my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. After that I plan to go for a Master's degree. I am not sure exactly which field of computer science I would like to go into yet. This class can help me achieve those goals by fulfilling a requirement to graduate. Hopefully I will retain plenty of the information from Physics, because I think it is a very important subject to understand. I find Physics interesting, but I feel that I struggle with many of the topics. Even though I have struggled with Physics, I feel as though I have learned a lot about the world around us and how to explain why some things happen the way they do."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1944,"One of my goals is to become a programmer when I get out of college. To do that, I have to pass this class which is a prerequisite for the computer science major. Beyond that, I suppose I have a more broad goal of learning everything that I can, and so this class would be able to achieve that as well. It's always good to be prepared, so knowing stuff about electricity would help with that as well. To be honest, it's interesting learning about this stuff, but I only think there will be a few specific times when it might apply to my life. granted, it would really help, but for the rest of it, this will just sit in the background. I guess it could influence my thought in a more subconscious manner, but that's just speculation."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1929,"For the time being, I have two short long term goals. The first one is graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Science for Computer Science and the second is getting a good stable programming job with my degree (or just a stable job to providde me with enough income to buy a house). The way this class will help me into fulfilling my goal is it will help me fulfill my course requirements for my degree. Without physics courses, I will not be able to obtain my degree. Like every other computer science course requirement that isn’t necessarily about computing, this class will require me to put organized work into it. All course requirements for computer science are on the difficult side. Since this is my last semester of physics (I hope it will be), I won't learn anything more about about physics during my college career. But what I have learned so far changed my perspective on how I view certain life processes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1945,"My goals for my future are to go to graduate school and  become an astronomer. By taking this class, it can help me achieve these goals by teaching me hands on version of general physics. By knowing the basics of physics, it benefit my learning in astronomy. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,5,1931,My goal is to get good grades and learn enough for my future goal. This class should help me reach a high understanding of math and physics to help me developed problem-solving. I would also like to learn something that valuable and useful but from a different perspective.
