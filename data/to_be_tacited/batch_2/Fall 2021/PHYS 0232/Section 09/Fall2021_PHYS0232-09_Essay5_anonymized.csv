2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2041,"I think that my greatest takeaway from the class was definitely learning how circuits work within a household. I think that being able to learn about those in such detail would be great in the future because I think it is great to have at least a basic understanding of them and later on in life when I have issues with such things I would be able to diagnose the issue and maybe even be able to fix the issue myself. Overall, I do think I have learned a lot of topics that are useful. I think that they definitely lead to another topic. Having all of those basic understandings will aid me in the future in a more practical sense when fixing and dealing with electrical objects since I electrical objects and appliances will never disappear in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2029,"My greatest take away from this class is being able to use math to calculate the laws on the topics because physics does involve a lot of math, and I think that it is important to understand the basics before going into learning more complicated stuff. Another take away from this class is that time management and I think that this class definitely help me with time management because there are many things to do in college and I think that this class help me in some ways about time management due to many things that we have to do. Lastly, greatest take away from this class is be able to do a lab experiment on a certain topic, although I would like it to be in person but I think that what is going on in this world, it can be difficult to be in person. But the lab nonetheless very interesting to do."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2027,"My greatest takeaway from this class is what I learned about how electricity works in circuits, which is not only useful for my career in Physics, but my personal projects often have to do with circuitry so having a more formal basic understanding is extremely helpful. Without guidance from some external resource, electricity is a super complicated topic, especially if you dive in deep. I'm glad I had this lab to help me through it. Now I need to learn more about circuit design, I may take a circuitry class soon so I have a better understanding there too and then I can combine knowledge between this and that potential class and know what I'm doing. In theory I guess."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2030,"I dont think there was one thing that stood out for me from this class. I think every week I learned something that was equally as important as the last. From learning about how charges behave, how circuits work, to magnets, these are all equally important to me. So the greatest take away would just be being to able learn all these concepts and applying it in the real world."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2022,"Yemane Ogbalidet  Prof. Aaron Eiben  Class PHYS 232-09  ID # 922150902  December 11, 2021     Reflection Paper  This week’s my greatest take away from this class is that we use the simulation link software to discuss about the “Bar magnet”, “Electromagnet” and “Pickup call.” Which helps to see the magnetic effects on the compass in different directions instead of Earth’s geological North Pole.  We use the arrows to indicate the direction of the magnet in the North Pole and South Pole bar magnet. We observe the magnet behavior in different positions. In case of the electromagnet tab we observe the current flows positive to negative, out at the top of the coil and in at the bottom. We move the compass around the coil to compare with bar magnet and we found out that the compass needle would point towards the coil when it is in the negatively charged end of the coil, however, it points away when it is next to the positively charged end of the coil. The North Pole of the electromagnet found on the right of the coil. But, if we reverse the battery, the North Pole would’ve been in the left of the coil instead.      "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2038,"This class has helped me understand the basic concepts behind a lot of modern physics, and has definitely helped me study for the main physics class. However I would say that the greatest take-away I've had is in how we use these theories to do things in the real world. The chapters on magnetism and how it works really shed light onto how we generate, store, and transfer electricity to our modern appliances. Before this class these things seemed to work like magic, but now I have a greater understanding. You know what they say, there is little distinction between magic and sufficiently advanced technology!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2045,"My greatest take away from this class, is honestly something I don't know what to say. This class has been something interesting because of the fact that this is the first professor that has taught an online class that has actually cared about their students learning the subject in order to make sure they understand the subject. I think that is one of my greatest take aways from this class, being that this is the one online class i had where the professor cared. Not only that but as well as working with classmates and how each subject matters within the realm of physics. All the labs we had were fun, interesting and neat in their own way. My favorite so far has been about magnetism and what affects each little thing about it. Not only that but as well as about the wiring and how the resistors functionality, which was fun to learn as well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2035,"My greatest takeaway from this class was to listen and learn new things, understand basic concepts of physics, and be able to apply this knowledge in my future career. Interacting with students, helping each other is also one of the important aspects of the class, communication, and interaction help to work in groups, to find new connections, and allows to see the problem from different perspectives. Working in a group will stimulate you, improve your critical and independent thinking, and it will also build trust among peers helping you and your group members to be more organized and productive. My major requires taking this class which will help me to use the concepts of this class in my future courses, allowing me to learn new things. Not only that, but I also will be able to apply these concepts in the real world, and just know how everything works from a theoretical perspective."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2025,"My greatest take away from this class so far has been that not everything needs to be as hard as it seems. Typically people would think of Physics as an extremely hard class that takes hours and hours of studying every week, but that simply was not the case for this class. This class took much less time than expected, even though the assignments were decent lengths every single time. The main reason for this is that I had a plan to just focus on the assignment the entire time, not let myself get distracted, and just do everything that I understood after reading the entire assignment. In the end, this class helped me better my scheduling and dedication to my work."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2023,the greatest takeaway from this class is definitely the lab instructor and the lab experiments. i loved that the instructor was super fun and super kind to us when we were on zoom. he seemed very engaged in what he was talking about and engaged in what we have to say. It feels like if we were in person doing these experiments with this instructor we would’ve definitely had the most fun doing our work and getting help from a physics teacher coming from a different state. this class we learn a lot from each other and we learn a lot from reading and experimenting and trying out different labs i feel like this was the best lab class i ever had in my life. my high school labs were boring but this lab class was really intriguing and I took a lot out of this class and i learned many topics i didn’t know before and i’m really grateful for everyone that got to spend this final online semester it is truly one to remember and the lab instructor will be missed dearly. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2039,"The greatest take away from this class is that electricity and magnetic forces can react differently depending on the circumstances. Higher electricity making a nail become more magnetic due to the electricity making the nail redistribute the charges similarly to a magnet, or the reasoning on why magnets work the way they do is because of the magnets having different charges in each of their ends. I even understood how the current of a circuit works and understand how more sources of electricity can affect, depending on the type of circuit, like a series circuit can increase the amount of voltage with more batteries, but a parallel circuit keeps the same amount of voltage. And the equation of how a resistor affects the circuit’s voltage, as the voltage would shrink as more resistors are added to the circuit, like three resistors on a circuit of 9 volts would make each resistor have 3 volts flowing through them."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2042,"My greatest takeaway from this class is being able to better understand different concepts and then being able to solve problems with them.  Many of these labs helps us have a better understanding of different physics concepts and require us work through the different problems in the lab.  Students of every major can experience these kinds of situations that will happen in our career.  When these situations happen, we need to be prepared to be able to handle it.  The labs have visual simulations which helps us get a visual on how these concepts work, and allow us to test different factors and see how they affect the simulation.  The mix of visual and written examples help with a more well-rounded learning experience that I can take away from this class.  The things that we learn in class will be useful for broadening my understanding and how these concepts apply to my life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2031,"One of my greatest take always is about circuits and about how resistances in circuits are calculated. I find this as one of my greatest take away because to me, it was interesting to see how a certain configuration of a circuit would affect how the current goes through the system, if at all. This became interesting to me because before I used to think that the current would still flow through parts of a circuit that aren't fully connected, however, now I know that the current in a circuit would only flow though the fastest path. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2037,"Carmelo De Guzman   November 18, 2021  Lab Instructor: Aaron Eiben  PHYS 232 Section 9     Lab Reflection# 5                 Since taking this Physics lab class, my greatest takeaway is that physics can be seen or experienced all around us in our everyday lives. From magnetism to current and resistance, to even potential/kinetic energy, there is always some sort of physics interaction happening in the world at any given time. While I do not see as much correlation between physics and computer science as opposed to other fields such as electrical engineering and architecture, the general process of testing out a hypothesis and answering it through performing trials/experiments remains the same. Even though the scientific method is heavily relied on by physicists, biologists, and chemists, computer scientists can also use this method to test out a hypothesis about their software or overall code. It is from this scientific standard that all science fields can have at least one thing in common, and that is the process of gathering evidence and forming a conclusion based on a performed test/experiment. All in all, this class has taught me to have a scientific mindset when I am approached by a question that cannot be easily answered with a few simple sentences."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2028,"My greatest take aways from this class are probably the external resources like the circuit simulation and electric charge programs. Those individual programs really cautified the lessons learned and taught more than my lecture did.This class also reminded me to temper my expectations and value in faceless organizations like universities and such, by means of their half assed worksheets provided by said university."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2026,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that with science and especially physics experiments we can see multiple ways to solve for certain questions and problems. Through a simulation we can set up the topic or problem at hand and physically see how the physics concepts work where it would be different from real life in which we can see the flow of current and other small details we would not see in person. Physics itself to me is also something that is both straightforward and not straightforward at the same time. But as long as we know the givens and which concepts and equations to use, I am able to figure out and determine how to solve a physics problem. Physics concepts now are also something I see more and more in my day to day life as I learn about it and something I notice more and more than I have before."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2034,"I guess my greatest take away from this class is the ability to apply the concepts taught in this class to everyday life. In other words, this class has taught me that physics can be found everywhere and anywhere in our day to day lives. This class has given me a new perspective on concepts that I have never thought about outside of a classroom before. While some may say that this is one of the obvious take always from this class, this is something that will probably stick with me in the long run. I don’t know, maybe this is one of the greatest take aways from this class because I see this question on every lab summary that we write, and this is the only thing that comes to mind every time that I come across this prompt. So, if this isn’t the greatest take  away from this class, then I don’t know what is."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2040,"This class worked heavily as a reinforcement. The main lecture class is very difficult to understand as it is only hour-long videos for lectures. This class was able to go more into detail over the topics that the main lecture briefly went over. The lab instructor was also able to go at a pace that helped us all understand the topic better. He was also very open to questions and took his time explaining them, and seemed as if he really wanted us to learn the subject. The labs were also very interactive and helped me see where some formulas and concepts came from. "
