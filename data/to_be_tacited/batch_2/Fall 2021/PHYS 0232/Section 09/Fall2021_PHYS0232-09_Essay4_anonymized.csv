2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2026,Online classes have impacted my learning in many ways and a STEM lab class is a good example in which is when we are doing experiments over the internet and at home instead of doing it in person with a whole lab group seeing the concepts in real time. Some things I have been doing for self care is literally sleeping or going out to have fun. Some concerns about my learning is the way that I adapted to how online classes worked in which I am sometimes lazier and just interact with a recorded lecture rather than taking notes during the actual time of the lecture itself. I don't have many concerns but once classes switch back to in person is where I would have to change my life style and break habits that I've developed while taking online classes. But hoping that the transition can be smooth since it's literally just conducting classes but in a different setting from home.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2039,"My experiences with remote/online classes is that I do feel as if it is easier with the learning, but I have some issues when learning the material. The issue is that I usually worked best with not only verbally/textually, but also physically, like with experiments and the lab explorations in iLearn “quiz” form. My well-being is fine, no issues with staying home and learning from the house. I’m still learning well in classes and my health is doing fine, the only issue lies if I can find ways to make these remote lessons more memorable. Luckily, the “iLearn quizzes”, physical experiments, and simulations provided by the lab explorations. If more classes can utilize the simulations and place classwork in the form of an “iLearn quiz”, I do believe the lessons can be learned and memorized better this way. Many other classes mostly utilize only the whole “download and edit the PDF” method and providing little to no simulation of the scenarios would be a detriment for learning, in my opinion."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2035,"I think I got used to online classes and distance learning in general, my major is computer science so working on distance is important in this field. It felt unusual and weird at the first, having everything online and not going anywhere just sitting in front of the screen the whole day, but you have some pluses here, you can finish your work earlier and have access to everything at your house. The only thing that still bothers me is that you get distracted easily while being at home, looking at your phone often, getting a snack, saving work for later, and other small things like that. It is just hard to stay motivated, but what I do is try to stay focused, finish the work earlier and rest after. For self-care, I spend more time with my family and friends going outside, sometimes watching movies, or getting a good night's sleep to rest. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2044,"Online classes have freed up a lot of time for me, and as such I'm able to do a lot more for myself, while keeping up with classes. I'm able to pace myself, and build a stable work ethic. Online classes remove that aspect of having to get ready, go to class, etc. Which really frees up a lot of time and maneuverability for me. I'd get back from my classes and I'd wanna just rest, put the work off for later. The joke being, later never comes around. Not having to deal with the energy and effort of putting myself in class and engaging in person saves a lot of energy/spoons to get my work done after. With some classes being asynchronous on top of that, I’m really able to pace myself and do my work as I please. Since most of my assignments are due at midnight, this gives me the time necessary to pace myself and work healthily, rather than staying up all night doing work that’s due the next morning, when they’re due at midnight I get more time to work on my assignments, or at least it feels like it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2028,"My preferred social interaction is a very casual hanging out with dorm neighbors kind of situation. Quarantine made that kind of social interaction extremely difficult if not downright impossible. A lot of teachers are extremely poor online teachers giving a quality of teaching incomparable with what they would have given in person. Using the online classes as an excuse to do the minimum amount of work. And on top of that some teachers expect a higher level of understanding than their in person classes despite completely and utterly failing to teach at times.While online classes has given me better access to communal forum through things like discord, a lot of teachers have really dropped the ball and utterly failed in their jobs through this change."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2025,"Describe how online classes have impacted your learning and what you are doing for self-care. What concerns do you have for your learning and your well-being?Online classes were somewhat difficult at first, but now it’s not that bad. With online classes comes alot more time to actually do school work, along with chores and other things as well. What I’m doing for self-care is getting more sleep than I was ever able to before, because now I can wake up with less time before class starts because I don’t have to go anywhere for class. Another thing that I am doing for self-care is going on walks as well as other things as a form of exercise to make sure that I don’t worsen my health. Some concerns that I have are whether it will be easy to go back to normal classes, and will the online education have impacted any of my learning and therefore my potential success for the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2027,"Online classes initially really fucked me up - in the first semester where we transitioned very abruptly. I took a year off in hopes that we would return in person, but it didn't quite work out that way. I'm having a much better time this semester but some part of me wishes it was in person. Although, I do like being at home and being able to have a very flexible schedule as I don't have to physically be anywhere for class anymore. I can travel around and do class as long as I've got an internet connection. There are definitely benefits to both sides. I don't have a self-care routine necessarily, just trying to interact with friends as often as possible and playing sports every week to stay in some sort of shape. It should all be ending soon anyway, I would think, but I guess let's see what happens."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2023,online learning has impacted my learning and it has damaged it very significantly because in the beginning i thought that i would lead a. lot better at home in a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable sitting at home. But it does not help to learn at all. I was very excited at first to do online learning and then as time went by i started to hate it because it was making me unhealthy in my learning. i did not pay attention like most people do during online classes and i missed many due dates. I feel like it will always be better to learn in person than any online environment unless you are a different kind of learner. i learn more when i’m in person with face to face eye contact with the professional who can physically help us get through these tough years of online learning. i’m really hoping to be back soon. for self care i have been constantly showering and washing my hands when i get home. i try to stay home and avoid going out as much as possible but i would say i’m mostly home and staying at home is the biggest safe environment anyone can be. i do not have any concerns for my well being except the stress and the headaches but i’m excited to finally be back next year and pick myself back up.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2024,"Online classes are good,but also bad.  They're fantastic because I don't have to go outside and see people, but they're terrible because I feel like I don't absorb information as well as an in person class.  I am horrendously awful at selfcare.  I have no sense of self preservation, so whenever I'm swamped with homework, I kind of just go numb for a few days and finish it all in one go without eating or sleeping.  It's super unhealthy."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2034,"Despite being back on campus, most of my classes are online, except for Friday. Everything felt fine at the beginning of the semester, but now I feel like I'm not doing well. Now that we are nearing the end of the semester, I've been more tense and frustrated. I have trouble sleeping at night. Also, since I'm more classes relating to my major, I've started questioning whether I'm cut out for this, being a part of STEM and a mechanical engineer because I'm struggling in some of my classes. Sometimes it's hard to stop working on whatever I'm doing and take a break because I have so much to get done. Sometimes, when I can spare a couple of hours, I set a time and play video games, watch TV, or draw. If I feel agitated, I take a bath and listen to some music. These activities usually help because they relax me and give me time to get into a better headspace to focus on my assignments properly."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2040,"With online classes, I've felt a lot less enthusiasm for school. I used to enjoy going to classes and challenging myself with something new. I felt as if the professors themselves were a lot less invested in teaching, and did so just to get it over with. All this really affected me, especially during the beginning of the pandemic where everything was closed, and the fear of going out was still high. During that time I really suffered as I would stay home without leaving for weeks at a time. I went from being a pretty active person to sleeping all day. So I started to take walks around the neighborhood and enjoy the scenery. I began to go out and that really helped with releasing some stress. I also came to terms with the fact that in not every test I take or class that I'm in I'll receive an A. These things helped greatly with just dealing with everything that had been going on. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2043,"Online classes have made motivation to attend lectures a little harder, as there is no incentive to really go unless it is an important topic to attend. Another impact from remote learning is the amount of interaction between people being less, which makes the course less fun. In order to take care of myself, I make sure to take breaks from work to make sure I am not getting burnt out, and I also go to the gym and hang out with friends to make sure I get enough social interaction on a given day"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2029,"This is my 2nd year as a SFSU student, I feel like it definitely has impact on my learning because at this point I feel like it is pretty normal to study online now. Due to the fact that this is my second year and my first experience at college, so I kind of already getting used to remote learning. Although remote learning is not the best way to learn. In terms of self care during online classes, I think that I get to spent a lot more time by myself, which is good and bad because I have a lot of time to spent but at the same time don't socialize as much. And, this socializing really took a toll on me.Concerns that I have for my online learning is getting back to an actual classroom because I'm already getting used to this type of environment. If the school is open, I have to move to a new apartment, walk to classes, and pay for my own stuff. Which is kind of unfortunate but at least I get to experience new things instead of sitting in my room."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2038,"I've noticed with distance learning that professors have assigned much more homework to compensate for a lack of in-person classes. I do not like this approach, since the previously existing amount of homework was already perhaps too much. I've had to drop all classes other than this one and the main physics course just to keep up. Not to mention I have a full-time job to pay for rent food etc that I need to keep up with. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2045,"Online classes have impact my learning in the sense of making it easy to manage my classes and work, though it also has impacted it negatively due to how it has been noticeable that some professors don't seem to care about the work. This is extremely discouraging because not only did we lose that touch of in-person work, but as well as motivation to even do the work or care about the class all together. Even professors who know what is going on in the students end and still blaming them to say that they can't be organized when in reality there isn't much one can do, which also makes it more depressing. I have been struggling for self-care because of the fact I lose track of time when working on assignments or don't get the chance to actually eat food and even drink water. What I have been forcing myself to do is to take breaks, even if it means during class to go make food, eat and then get something to drink due to the lack of self-care I now have because of this pandemic and how some professors approached this online education system now. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2037,"Carmelo De Guzman   October 21, 2021  Lab Instructor: Aaron Eiben  PHYS 232 Section 9     Lab Reflection# 4                 Since the start of remote online classes, my learning has somewhat been impacted in a way in which I no longer feel like I’m in a real classroom environment. Although it was very difficult to transition from in-person learning to online learning, over time, I was able to find something that made me comfortable in keeping up with my online classes. I hope in the coming semesters that we will finally be able to have in-person learning as I feel like other students, including myself, would benefit greatly due to the easy access of asking a professor or classmate for help on an assignment, lab, or project. In terms of self-care, I have a weekly routine of going out for a walk or run as it usually helps me relieve some stress that I have in my classes as well as staying safe and healthy. While I do miss the times where I would be able to hang out with friends on the weekends, either for fun or for studying a midterm/final exam, I will remain optimistic that day will come eventually in the future. All in all, my college learning experience can be considered somewhat balanced and partially affected, however, I have gained the necessary skills to persevere and do my personal best to get through this difficult time while also pursuing my goal of graduating and getting a degree."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2030,I personally feel like online classes have impacted my learning a lot. Having classes online becomes very distracting and my attention span is a lot shorter when having online classes. I end up not learning as much and doing worse. Im not really doing anything for self-care.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2041,"Over the past year, I believe that online classes have greatly negatively impacted my learning. It has been a hard adjustment for me and I still struggle with it even though it has been a year. I feel like it is just so much to ask for a person to change the routine they have followed over the past 20 years of their lives waking up early or in the afternoon to go to school to an all-online session. Of course, it has its pros but I have been feeling a lot of the cons heavily. I have been struggling to focus in a lot of my classes over all of the online class sessions and it's taking a toll on me. Not only that, but it is also taking a heavy mental toll on me. Some things that I do for self-care are to try to go outside more as well as work out. I have gotten to the point where I sometimes loathe being at my desk where I once thought I could enjoy video games and destress but now it is filled with ideas of school and stress. I am hoping that a lot of the major upper-division classes are in person so that I can maintain a greatly better focus."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2042,"Online learning has made some things easier and harder for me in terms of learning.  It is easier for me because there is so many modules and resources that are available online at all times.  This means that  if I have any questions, I can refer back to these materials and go over it as many times as I need.  The lectures are also all recorded and saved onto iLearn, and that allows me to go over the entire lecture and pause and rewind certain sections.  The negatives are that sometimes it can be hard to communicate with certain teachers, because some classes don't have a lecture so it can be difficult to contact them and  get messages back in a certain amoun tof time.  The way how I handle self-care is that I can take breaks in between assignments and projects more often since communiting to school is not necessary.  This allows for more time for myself and allow myself to rest more often.  I don't have any major concerns in terms of learning and well-being, because everyone is learning how to handle online classes and for me it has more benefits than negatives."
