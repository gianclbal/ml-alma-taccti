2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2039,"A question I have for short circuits is: “Since there are numerous ways to help start the flow of electricity across a circuit, is there truly a limit to generate electricity? Like is there a limit in finding out new ways to help generate more and more electricity?” This can help in everyday life as people become more and more dependent on electricity, so if there were more ways to generate electricity, hopefully some are eco-friendly, would be beneficial and convenient. Even though we mainly used batteries to help with generating electricity in last week’s class, I’ve seen many other ways people generated electricity in their short circuits in the past, like utilizing magnets to help spin a metal wheel to help turn a lightbulb on. Some experiments like that makes me question how to understand the limits in making electricity and if there are any further ideas that help with generating more electricity. This question makes me wonder if we are truly limited to: simple turbines, water wheels, lightning rods, and batteries, to help fuel electricity for houses and buildings. I have a feeling there more ways to create electricity and if there can be ways that can benefit many, hence asking if there are more eco-friendly ways to generate electricity."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2035,"Every concept in the last past weeks was interesting to follow and learn, one of the concepts I found interesting was related to short circuits. After the lecture, it made me think about how exactly it connected and work? Only after running the experiment, turns out that the short circuit is a connection that helps the current take the path, having different voltages, and it also can produce high temperature. There are two types of circuits, parallel and series, they are both connected in different paths. When connecting the batteries, the series will have the highest potential difference than parallel. While doing this lab, we created a short circuit connected with 2 batteries and foil wires. After touching one wire to one end and the other of the other end, it created a small spark on the tips of the foil wires. To prevent combusts, it’s better to use series in order to protect other elements from blowing. It will have a higher potential difference, but the capacity will not increase. We can use this method when we use batteries to power up anything, toys, technical devices, and etc. For example, a light bulb makes current from the battery flow through it and lightning it up."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2026,"One of the topics that we covered that I could ask a good question about is how short circuits can affect people on a day to day basis. Short circuits is not something we can see often with our own eyes but if we have enough knowledge about it we can tell that something will have short circuited. Short circuits can occur in lot of our daily appliances. And by figuring how to prevent short circuits we can make it so that things will always be running. But what if we are able to use a short circuit as a way to generate more power. If we look at a car fuse and how overloading the car fuse can break the fuse and cause the fuse to do it's job there could be a way to harvest energy that way and store it. Since energy is power is often wasted when something is left on, what if in society and in our daily lives there was like a safety or fail safe system that made it so if we let out too much energy something can short itself without causing harm like using a fuse for an example and we save that energy that could be used later? But on a bigger scale so that we can make it so that we don't waste as much. This is relevant to somethings we learned in class because the charge let off may be more than what we need when using an appliance."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2045,"When we did the the lab regarding about electrical lines, it was interesting actually seeing that these lines need to have strength in order to withstand the power from the electricity. Seeing the line just fry and basically get killed was interesting and I can honestly see this concept being in many peoples lives as important knowledge. The reason why is due to the fact that we don't normally know about this and when we want to fix the wiring that is occurring. An example of this is when i was working in the mechanics, we had to wire an entire car since we were working on a old car being brought back to the modern age. It was an interesting project to work on however the most difficult task was trying to make sure that the wires were strong enough to with stand the power of the electric. It was concerning as the first time both of us were almost shocked, twice as it was the first time we had to wire an entire car from scratch. Although this is a specific situation, it can be used for others to know in order to be safe for the future.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2025,"When dealing with potential energy, describe the relationship between a particle constantly being displaced by an outside force while in an e field, and the potential energy of the particle, and relate it to the real world.A particle that is constantly be displaced by an outside force will be constantly changing its potential energy relative to the e field except for when it is being displaced in a direction perpendicular to the e field. The potential energy of this particle relative to the e field will increase if it goes away from the direction of the e field, and will decrease if it travels along the direction of the e field. This can be easily related to life because we can think of the force gravity applies on us as an e field, meaning the higher we go from the center, the more potential energy we have; while the closer we get to the center, the less potential energy we have."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2042,"A question would be what to consider in terms of short circuits?  Short circuits have to consider current, voltage, resistance, and Ohm's law.  These concepts have units and relate to each other.  The types of circuits and how the connect is important to understand so that we know how strong the current needs to be.  Current is the rate of flow of charge and the symbol is I.  The units for current is amps which is 1 1 amps for every 1 coulumb/second. Voltage is the potential difference, the symbol is V, and the units are in volts.  Resistance depends on the material and geometry of the object.  The symbol for resistance is R and units are in ohms.  These are all tied together in Ohm's Law and the formula used for this is V = IR.  These formulas and variables are useful so that people can understand how much current is needed for safety.  Series circuits are connected in a series where all of the current passes through each object.  Circuit in a series produce a smaller amount of current.  Parallel circuits are ones where the objects are connected in parallel.  These types of connections create stronger current.  Understanding these circuit types are important so that current doesn't short and create dangerous situations."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2028,"Week 4 lab Flux and Gauss law helped a lot to help and be a better foundation for my understanding on the topic. Before the week 4 lab I had a shaky understanding of Gauss Law at best and working through the questions with a group and a professor to help me through it helped a lot. Understanding what electric flux and Gauss's law are might undermine enjoyment of some science fiction content due to the constant miss use of the terms, otherwise there is likely not much practical application for electric Flux and Gauss's law in the layman's common day to day life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2041,"I think that one of the most interesting concepts that I have learned so far in physics is how circuits work. I think it is great to learn about it because I feel like it is something I have dealt with a lot but I never looked at or explored that concept deeply until now that I am taking this physics class. Having built my own computer, I think that it is very helpful and interesting to learn how exactly circuits and computer parts work together with electricity. I think that its great to learn about this concept since having this basic understanding is helpful since shorted outlets are a common occurrence and having that basic knowledge is helpful in fixing the issue or preventing the issue."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2043,"The question I am posing is, why do opposite charges attract? The answer to this question can be found in the presentation as well as the lab and notes that were done during class time. Basically, as the charges interact, the forces act in the same direction. Due to the resulting force from the two charges, a field is created where there is opposite polarity, which causes the charges to attract each other. In the other view, like charges repel each other due to the respective forces acting in opposite directions, so the charges will repel rather than attract"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2024,"The concept of magnetic attraction has always been fascinating to me.  This leads me to question, what would happen if there was a planet sized charged particle?  Would the gravity be stronger because of the attraction, or weaker because it would repel things away from it?Let's say this planet is negatively charged. I believe that this planet sized charged particle would act the same way as a normal planet.  These charges do have mass, so I am under the assumption that gravity wouldn't matter.  Depending on the magnitude of the charge, other negatively charged objects would behave strangely.  If the charge of the planet is too strong, the other charges will be repelled into space.  This would also mean that there is potentially a point in space where the object could orbit indefinitely at whichever speed it wants, because there is no gravity to determine how fast it needs to travel.  However, if the charge of the planet is weak enough, negatively charged objects would be very light.  This would be because they are still under the influence of gravity, but they are being constantly forced away by the planet's charge."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2040,"In the last lab, we explored short circuts, which is something that we greatly see in our lives. Electricity is everywhere and it is something that many people depend on. yet we don't know the specifics about it. From the notes that we took last week, we can see how it is that electricity works, or at least get an idea of how it should work. With more people understanding how electricity works, we could see improvements in the design and use of circuits in our lives. With a slight understanding of a topic, we have the ability to ask questions and seek answers, though we might not know them, we can have an idea of where to look for them with the knowledge that we have. The more questions we have, the more answers we will come to find."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2022,"Yemane Ogbalidet  Prof. Aaron Eiben  Class PHYS 232-09  ID # 922150902  December 11, 2021     Reflection Paper  This week’s my greatest take away from is that the brightness of light bulbs in the circuit. We use the simulation link software to see the different outcome of the light bulbs. We tested all case scenario in series and parallel connections and observed the what it looks like when you connect all the elements in circuit with one, two, and three light bulbs. How it seems when we use short way to cut the flow of current and conducting resistance. So, that the outcome is different when we cut the length of conducting material which is making it short in length path of the wire. We discussed about the voltage distribution across the circuit across all. We use the current connection to measure the current in terms of Ampere.       "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2029,"One of the concept that was covered in class recently is current and how it flows through light bulbs and other electricity. I think that this topic is  generally applicable to people’s lives and can be useful to the society because current pretty much relates to electricity, which we use daily in our everyday lives. With current, we can see the idea of how things such as phone or other devices work when we charge things  Another topic that I think is applicable to people’s lives and can be useful to the society would be short circuit because by knowing how short circuit works, we can kind of understand how to prevent short circuit from happening. Although, short circuit does not happen all the same, by knowing about short circuit we can understand why short circuit happened in the beginning. For example, when I was little about 7 years old our family started to smell something burning from upstairs. It turns out that the power outlet extension was burnt and smoking due to the short circuit, but since nobody knows what short circuit was we started to freak out and don't know what are the cause of the power outlet extension burnt."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2031,"One concept that we covered so far that is useful to know about is positive and negative charges. This knowledge of how positive and negative charges interact with each other has already been used for the benefit of society in many ways. One such way is with motors. They work by having two of the same charges repelling each other, one being fixed by an axis to allow it to spin. This concept has been shown in our labs when we had a simulation with the balloon, sweater and wall. From that simulation we saw that when the balloon had more negative charge and the sweater had more positive charge, they attracted each other. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2037,"Carmelo De Guzman   October 7, 2021  Lab Instructor: Aaron Eiben  PHYS 232 Section 9     Lab Reflection# 3                 A concept that I learned and found intriguing in the lecture portion of Physics 230 was about the electric potential and its direct connection to electric fields. They both work in tandem with each other and if one gets affected, either in magnitude or direction, then the other will be affected as well. A question that I have is, how would we calculate the electric potential difference if the surface has a non-uniform e-field? What about if a point charge is placed on that same surface but with a uniform e-field? To answer this question, we need to have already known that the electric field is performing work just like the force of gravity. If a point charge on that system moves from one part of the e-field to another, then it will have some displacement that caused work to be done, in this case, a change in kinetic and potential energy. To find the potential difference on a non-uniform e-field, you would have to divide each particle(s) path into two pieces and calculate a specific point between those two paths to get the potential difference. If a charge is placed in the uniform e-field, then calculating the potential difference would require the use of the point charge formula with either k or Q being a given value. All in all, knowing about electric potentials can be applied to everyday life that involves anything with an electrical charge. This could be used to calculate the potential difference of an electron or proton inside a charged cell or maybe even be used to determine the work done by a charged object’s displacement."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2023,"Ive been most interested in the battery and voltage topics because I have many family members uncles and cousins who work for PG&E and other voltage companies that have to go through all the electrical engineering and college career experiments that we were just learning during these labs. I feel really greatful to have learned how to measure measure volts, add resistors, find out what makes a complete circuit and some wiring techniques as well. i feel that this can apply and benefit people a lot in the real world because People who work in electricity are the most important factors to contributing this world with light they are the ones that light up our houses and give us the ability to see at night. knowing how to run electricity circuits is really important for knowing how to operate different machines and power homes when you are stuck one day and need power. Knowing how to run a simple circuit can mean a lot to people in the world because then they would be smart enough to operate their own homes in their own light. Learning how to circuit is really beneficial for wherever you are i’m really glad i’m learning this now in my college classes."
