2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2025,"My current goal is to become a civil engineer, but I have also been thinking about double majoring so that I can become a mechanical engineer as well. One reason for this is because both pay well, but another reason is that my family is in real estate. This means that if I were to be involved in some sort of engineering, I could be involved in the process of flipping homes as well. This would make the entire process run more smoothly because I would be able to work directly with them to ensure success in a timely manner meaning we would be able to finish with the houses relatively quickly compared to the normal process. This class is necessary in order to become a civil/ mechanical engineer, and therefore will help me achieve my goal."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2035,"For now, my goal is to stay productive and focus on homework to graduate and get my degree. This class can help me achieve this goal because it's one of the requisite courses I need to take for my major, plus physics is interesting in general. Understanding how things work in the universe, and apply these principles later for complex problems will help me in the future when I get a job. Also taking physics will improve problem-solving, critical thinking, teamwork, communication, and time management skills. I will definitely need this for my major and I already learned so many new things, formulas, and rules from this class. So yea hopefully I will pass this class with good grades and proceed to the next level of physics next semester, and do that, I already took Calculus 2 to make this happen. This classes material will definitely help me this and next semester. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2045,"My goals are to pass this class, and not only that but as well as understand as much as the subjects as possible. The reason why is due to the fact that my current physics class for lectures has been suffering harshly till the point that no one is understanding what is going on. So my goal is to try and understand as much as the subject as possible and put as much work as possible in order to not only pass class but as well as to have it for life overall. The way I will reach this goal is not only work on studying the context that is being provided but as well as work with classmates in order to understand what is going on. So far I have been understanding what is going on thankfully to this class, but as well as working with others have actually helped me learn the material even better."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2027,"I'm not really fully sure what my goals are but they definitely involve having a degree in Astrophysics and more than likely a degree in computer science... I hope to work for a company dealing with rockets, space exploration in general, or astronomy research. But I'm not really set on anything... maybe a job in computer science wouldn't be too bad afterall. This class helps me extremely directly 'cause I'm a physics major and this will give me a basis for electricity which is important down the line, even with computer science."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2043,"My goals are to get an engineering degree so that I can be qualified to work in that field. Eventually, I will have to decide what to do after the job process, and I might even become a teacher down the line. This class can help me achieve my goals by giving me the understanding of physics required to graduate in the first place, and then hopefully the knowledge will be useful later on if I do end up getting a job in the engineering sector. If not, then I can always teach physics or math, since I will have a good understanding of those topics and can choose to teach them to other people"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2044,"My goals here at SFSU are to learn the science of Chemistry with an interest in physical chemistry. This class leads me directly to that goal as it gives me a firm base-understanding of physics to branch off from and learn. This course prepares me directly for my future as a chemist as it teaches me the underlying topics that chemistry derives from. Physics, which honestly at this point is more interesting to me than chemistry… But I do think that as I get into physical chemistry, (aka can i be done with ochem yet? -.-) this class will have prepared me to go further. I really do enjoy physics though to begin with, and this class is very interesting,  just kinda wish I got to be in person now that I’m moved back up to campus."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2040,"Engineering is the solving of problems. In order to solve problems, you need to be able to understand what's going on. Physics and the physics lab will help me get a better understanding of how the world works, which will greatly help me in solving engineering-related problems. The better I can grasp the world around me, the more options I will have when looking at a problem. This section of physics goes over electricity and magnetism, things that greatly affect our world today. This class will also teach me a new way of looking at things, reasoning that's used in physics which I can and will apply to other aspects of my life. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2039,"My goal is to graduate from a university and get a job as a “Video Game Tester”. A Video Game Tester refers to people who can usually test out the gameplay aspects of a pre-released game, from its alpha testing to before its final release. Testers play the games and communicate to the game makers any issues with the gameplay aspects. Many video games have failed due to the lack of game testing. This class can help as I require the class to help me in my Computer Science major. Computer Science helps with how computer’s software and understanding the software can help even further with the aid in repairing the code of a game. A good example of people testing out pre-released content for a game before its release is Minecraft. Mojang, the company who helps run and updates the game, would have both artists and testers see how the game would run in the pre-released update and how they can change it to be more playable. They also give these snippets of the new upcoming update to the game by handing them to their community. These are called “Minecraft Snapshots”. Untested games would usually have a hefty amount of glitches and be considered as unplayable to many people."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2026,Some of my goals for this class is to try my best to pass the class but also to get better prepared and ready for higher level engineering courses after this semester by taking this course. In this class it is the second step of physics and while I need to take Physics 3 with calculus as well you can not skip steps and hopefully from this class it will prepare me well for Physics 3 as that will be the last physics class I will be taking in my whole college career. This class I know from the beginning was meant to be challenging but as long as I am able to juggle everything and learn the course material I should be able to do fine so that I am ready for other courses that may require physics concepts later on. Through this course as well I will be able to visually see the physics concepts as well which will be super helpful to me.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2031,"My current goal is pursuing a major as a computer scientist. One of the main reasons that I'm currently in this class was because it is a requirement for the major. However, another reason physics can help me achieve my goals is learning more about how different things interact with each other, such as gravity and projectiles. This is helpful because, I also want to be able to create a simple game in the future, and to add realism, I would need to know some physics properties."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2030,One of my goals in the future is too become a game developer. One of my favorite genres of video games are simulators which are games based on realism. I am hoping that physics will be able to help me understand how the world works and interact with itself to be able to implement everything I've learned to help create games that can rival real life.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2022,"Yemane Ogbalidet  Prof. Aaron Eiben  Class PHYS 232-09  ID # 922150902  December 11, 2021     Reflection Paper  This week’s my greatest take away from is that we define the work in terms of its force and displacement and see its relationship with electric field in various vector points. Similarly, we have seen the work done to move the charge from rest and work done by electric field. We observe the sign and magnitude of the work done by the external force. In addition, we define the electric potential difference in its integral form to find its formula. We use the simulation link software to use the equipotential lines that goes through different point charges to determine the distance, and voltage between all this points. Using the simulation set-up, we see the equipotential lines and electrical field vectors in terms of its direction and find out the equipotential lines are perpendicular to electric field lines in every case. We draw the equipotential lines and electric field lines around the negative point charge and its direction between the plates.   "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2038,"My goal is to do good things with my life and help the world. This class helps improve my critical thinking, knowledge and dedication. It is a part of my training, so to speak. One day I hope to be able to use my skills for good and contribute something meaningful to the world."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2041,"I think my main goal in life is to be able to live comfortably where I can afford to buy into my hobbies, have a house, and go on trips. I think that a lot of this simply boils down to work ethic. I think that if I work hard in college and get a job where I'm happy but ALSO able to afford the things I have listed will truly make me happy in life I think. So that is one of the ways I feel that I can reach that goal. It all starts in school really which will translate later on. I think that another simpler goal is just passing all my classes this semester. I think that as the years go on as I'm in college it will only get harder. I have been struggling a ton this semester. I think this is the most I have been stressed about in a long time. My goal is to honestly survive and pass."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2028,"My goal is to pass my classes and finally get my degree. This class is a stepping stone on my way to said degree and will continue to train my work ethic. I suppose the fact that myself and other students fighting to learn and complete this class in spite of the poor conversion from in person to online lab that is reflected in the lab experiments and the horrendous lab worksheets trains us to succeed in spite of road blocks and trials. Well the PHYS lab is not the only section guilty of this, my actual physics 230 class teacher has no intention to teach and has only posted slideshows of unanswered example questions and poor quality videos that aren't even his."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2023,I have several of goals that I would like to accomplish in my lifetime. The first and main goal that I would like to pursue is to graduate from university. graduating from school is the best feeling anyone can ever experience. graduation is the best key point in everyone's lives and graduation means everything to a person's life. I would like to graduate from college and finally start my dream life which leads me to my other goal is to get a job. I would like to one day work in a technology company for gamers like me and make the gaming experience rise for everyone who loves games just like I do. I will achieve my goals by first making sure I am passing all my classes by staying organized and willing to work hard for my diploma. I have to make sure I am paying attention to all my classes and looking for help for anything I don't understand. College is hard and stressful but with the amount of work one can put in anything is possible and achievable.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2034,"I‘m not sure as to what my goals, either long-term or short-term, are at the moment for this semester. However, I guess one of my goals is to have a long-lasting understanding of physics. This class can help me achieve this goal because it’s one of the few classes where physics concepts are further discussed or explored. For instance, the labs we do in this class give me a better idea of what specific results would look like and what each result means. This class is also one of the few classes that helps me connect what I’ve learned in the lecture segment to daily life, or some instances, other courses related to my major. Each lab session is an opportunity to see whether I truly understand the concepts taught during the lecture. If not, it’s an opportunity to continue exploring ideas that professors barely talk about due to time constraints.   "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2042,"My goal is to graduate with a major in computer science and find a job related to my major.  This class will help with that goal in different ways.  A job may require that I understand computer science and apply some physics concepts, which would make being familiar with this topic very helpful.  This class also helps out with mathematics which is useful because computer science also uses a lot of mathematics concepts within the field itself.  Science classes in general asks students to problem solve and apply concepts to different situations and how to understand them.  Many of the labs also asks students to think about these concepts and learn when they are appropriate and how to see it in real time.  These problem solving situations train students for computer science classes to be more flexible and have good complex thinking strategies.  This class will always be useful for me in the future and will apply to my goals."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2024,"To put it bluntly, my goals are to get a good job in the CS field, and this class will help me by being a class in the CS degree.  As much as I would like to, I don't know when I would ever use any of this information professionally.I don't mean to sound salty, but I'm not a physics major.  I'm a CS major,  and as a CS major, I have no idea when a client will say ""hey find the flux of this enclosed area for this website.""  Even though that would be super cool, I don't see that ever happening. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2037,"Carmelo De Guzman   September 23, 2021  Lab Instructor: Aaron Eiben  PHYS 232 Section 9     Lab Reflection# 2                 My goal, from an academic viewpoint, is to finish my higher education and receive my degree in Computer Science so that I can pursue a career in software development. From a personal viewpoint, my goals are to at least secure a decent job that has a high-paying salary so that I can put my computer science skills to the test. By taking this Physics 232 Lab section, I can achieve my goals by learning some physics skills that I may be able to apply towards my degree and future goals. Some examples would include performing hands-on research and experiments that are needed to answer or prove a scientific theory/question or maybe getting proper instructions on how to use a scientific tool/device and the importance of lab safety. Since computer science, specifically software development, is mostly based on researching, writing, and testing code, I think this physics lab is structured similarly to emulate what it feels like to work on a team of software developers for a big company."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2033,"Reflection #2So far, this class has taken me back to my high school time in my country when we would learn about charges in 7 to 9 grade. It also helped me to think and remember some of it to help pursue this laboratory class. I wish or I hope that I can finish this class just not with a good grade but also a knowledge that I can use in the future, in any time any places when I face any circumstances. I do feel sometimes that I don't take it as seriously as I should sometimes but I also feel guilty and tell myself every second that this is important and I should take the time to reflect and just learn more, be more productive towards it. Of course, I was not born what the talent of learning everything fast but I hope that a day comes that I wouldn't or won't be disappointed in myself to learn and reflect outside of life. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2029,"My goal would be to get my computer science bachelor's degree and learn about things that would be helpful for my future career. Getting a bachelor's degree in computer science will be my proudest achievement because getting a bachelor's in computer science is very difficult and I need a lot of motivation to keep me going to get my degree. The reason I want to major in computer science is that it is one field that will grow as time goes on since modern days require technology, and as years go by technology will always advance to the next phase which will help society improve as a whole. Additionally, as more technology grows there will be a need for security which is one of the career paths that I want to pursue since I think that network security is very important because privacy can be leaked due to the lack of network security. Lastly, I want to earn a good salary so that I have basic needs such as shelter and food as well as be able to support my mom since she has been working very hard for me since I came to the United States."
