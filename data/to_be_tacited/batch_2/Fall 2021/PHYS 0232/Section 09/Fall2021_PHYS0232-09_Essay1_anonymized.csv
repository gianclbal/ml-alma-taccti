Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2022,"Yemane Ogbalidet  Prof. Eiben  Class PHYS 0232 – 09  ID # 922150902  September 1, 2021      Reflection #1  “Why do I want to go into the STEM field?       While growing up as a child I was always good in one subject only above all other which is Mathematics. Since, I was the last and youngest child in my family, all my older brothers and sisters use to encourage me by saying you will be a pilot, mathematician or mechanic because I use to collect wires, plastic rubbers to build small wire cars (the skeleton) part and play with them.      When I start to take science class, I start to enjoy it very much. I use to like Physics and Chemistry respectively however, for some reason Biology was not my favorite part. Then my teachers and friends use to ask me if I am planning to go to engineering fields. I began to analyze my options and my interest in science and technology motivates me to fellow the STEM field. For me STEM field is challenging, fun, and a place where you can get answers practically the way we live today in our daily life. Where its principles serve as a pillar to our planet. (I might be wrong but that is how I see it.)      "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2023,"I would like to go into the STEM field because science and everything technology based is fascinating to me. I love the way technology has progressed throughout times and I feel as if getting used to today's and future technology will be important to be a part of, work in, evolve into heading into these fields. I love technology and most of the things we own today are based on technology. It helps us get us through our day and it can be used in many different areas. Navigation, daily chores, reminders, transportation etc. Technology will always be a factor into our lives and it is important for me to know how it works and how we can program many different aspects so that we can help ourselves and help the community around us. We progress and invent many technology based objects through our lifetimes and it would be fun and enjoyable to head into the stemfield."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2024,"I've always had a strong passion for figuring out how things work. Since I could remember, I've always been passionate about physics and astronomy.  It feels like it's a natural part of me, and I believe I will have a fulfilling life and career in the stem field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2025,"Why did I choose STEM? Well honestly, the main reason is that I happen to really like math, it was my favorite subject growing up. This was partially because it just made sense to me. I saw that a lot of people struggle with math as a whole, while I usually find it pretty easy and straightforward, and basically just applying common sense. But I chose to go into engineering specifically because I also really like to build things, and solve puzzles, so engineering felt like the perfect way to be able to do math while also applying it to something that might be fun and still secure my future financially. What I have found recently fun about my major is the tools that I will be working with in the future, the software used to create blueprints can be fun to use once you get to know how to use it and know what you want to create with it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2026,Why I wanted to go in the STEM field is because of my interest within the STEM field and coming from high school I spent a lot of time the automotive shop and class and it was something that I really took an interest in therefore it made me want to go into the STEM field and with mechanical engineering being closest to cars it was the reason why I wanted to go into the STEM field. While I wasn't great at math or science in high school through my teachers that encouraged me in the automotive program it made me want to pursue a higher education and specifically in the STEM field since it was something that I was already doing but hands on. Other than that it has been a rough journey going through these classes but I am trying to do well in order just succeed and I think that's all I need.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,416,"I want to go into the STEM field because I like programming, which is a part of STEM. I have been exposed to it from an early age as my mother is a programmer. I wanted to learn how to use a computer when I was four years old. That being said, I've always insisted on doing my own work. Otherwise I won't know how to do it myself. That would be very problematic!To top it off, there is a diversity problem in this field.I love programming. There are times where it gets annoying. There are times where you feel wonderful. It (can be) a relaxing line of work. It can be stressful because of the deadlines. There is different kinds of programming as well. There is object oriented programming, which has objects and basically you can store methods and data together. There is functional programming, which has functions and data storage separate. The difference between functions and methods is, methods are inside of classes. An object is an instance of a class. So if you didn't know the difference now you do. I like functional programming more than object oriented programming in general, but I've heard if you write giant code bases, objects are a better way to organize code. Generally functional programming is ""harder"" by many, which is why I like it. Languages like C require you to manage memory yourself. There is no automatic garbage collection. It makes it more fun. You can also go lower level than most high level languages as C is a low level language. Sometimes you do not have a choice unfortunately, so you are required to use some weird language you never heard of! Well, fortunately the logic in programming is generally the same. The only difference I can think of are domain specific languages like MySQL, which is database stuff. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2027,"I want to go into a STEM field really because it's what I love doing. I'm studying Astrophysics but I love to code and do math so STEM is the obvious choice. Also, we're at a point in history where STEM jobs are becoming more and more prevalent, so I (hopefully) won't have a very hard time finding a job after college, whether it be in Astrophysics, or it's a software job that uses my knowledge in Physics and Python. STEM is a field that very directly changes the world. STEM is slowly creeping its way into every other field, too. Take biology for example; we can learn a lot about biology using microrobots or something similar. There are lots of ways STEM will help."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2028,"Ryan Martin917728609I am studying to be a mechanical engineer and my dream dream job is to create extra terrestrial super structures. I know humanity will probably never do the big name sci fi projects like a dyson sphere or a ring world but I still enjoy the concept. There's also the fact I just enjoy making things and it's more likely I would be making things as an engineer rather than a business major. It's also fun that the added benefit of being a mechanical engineer is that you get to break stuff and claim you are doing so in the name of science, be it stress testing or crash tests. I suppose the reason I went to STEM instead of the arts as an outlet to create is that I can’t envision myself being a professional artist, be it that doing art for profit might suck the life out of it or that I don’t see myself skilled enough to survive as one. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2029,"I think the reason that I want to go into the STEM field is because I want challenges in my life as well as accomplishment in life. Another reason why I wanted to go into the STEAM field is because when I was a kid I really liked computers. I would watch YouTube videos for hours to see how people built computers. When I was in high school I decided to choose my major as computer science. But to be honest, I did not think that I would choose computer science as my major, but my mom saw my cousin studying in computer science, so she also wants me to choose computer science for my major. In the beginning,  I was thinking of some kind of engineering major but I ended up with computer science, which is fine with me. Truthfully, I think the reason that my mom wants me to choose computer science as my major is because this degree can get me a stable job and she also wants me to be successful."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2030,"I decided to go into the STEM field because technology interest me a lot. I love to see how things work behind the scenes and want to be able to help or even create my own type of technology in the future. I'm not very good with science or math but I hope by the time I graduate I can have a good understanding of both. I am a first generation, so there is pressure for me to have a good future, and STEM would help me in that."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2031,"I want to go into the STEM field since computer science is a part of it. I got into computer science and programing during high school where we got to learn some basic coding for how a game would be built, using things like Scratch. Ever since then, I liked programming and being able to create things with just lines of code. I also have had thoughts of one day creating my own game, and to do that I would need to know how code works."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2032,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field?  Growing up I was always fascinated by the world around me. I grew a particular interest in cars and planes. I was eager to understand how they moved, what made them fast and whether I could make something myself one day that could do the same things. As I grew older I took math and science classes in school, they tended to be my better subjects because they were easier for me to understand due to the clearly slayed out steps involved. When it came time to apply to college I felt I should pursue what I knew best, I applied to enter college as a mechanical engineering major. I did that for close to 4 years and I enjoyed the coursework but I felt something was missing. To me, being in stem has a lot to do with being on the cutting edge of technology. Keeping this in mind, I made the difficult decision to completely change my major and pursue computer science. Overall this has been a great decision for me, I feel a lot more fulfilled being in an industry that is continuously expanding and making life easier for people around the world."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2033,"Reflection #1 ""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?""Steam, what does steam mean, it stands for “science, technology, engineering and math” and it's been a buzzword in education for several years. First, I don’t really like the Steam field, but I do love to interact and have experience in this field. Right now, I am majoring in CS, even though I mentioned that before that I am not really interested but I do love the field. I come from a background in which people are not very connected to technology and they are not really fond of it because of cultural differences; but that made me be more interested in computers which were never accessible to us, also, since I loved math/physic (any science subject) back in my country (Afghanistan). I used to pick up my father’s computer and open word and just type anything with Dari—English, I was so happy that I even learned how to add pictures into the article that I would type. My father was proud as well. When we moved here, I tried to change it to Software Engineering but then changed my major to computer science since my father said, “you will find jobs easily and it has money”, after that I started to peruse what’s best in here.  I hope that it becomes the one and only major that I would like."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2034,"I’ve never really thought about why I decided to go into the STEM field. Growing up, I’ve always enjoyed math and science. I was probably the only person in my class that would put down math as their favorite subject. It wasn’t until my last year in middle school that I’ve thought about looking into STEM-related careers. At first, I wanted to go into genetic engineering because I was really into Jurassic Park at that time. I don’t know why. By the time I started high school, I had thought about looking into other STEM-related careers like civil engineering. Around my junior year, I’ve already settled on a career in engineering after taking an engineering 101 class and some physics classes. My teachers would sometimes explain what engineers would do and how the class my peers and I took what was related to the subject. I guess the reason I’m going into the STEM field was because I was naturally drawn to types of careers that are related to two subjects that I liked."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2035,"We all experienced ourselves in the STEM field when taking math or science classes in elementary, middle, and even high schools. STEM stands for science, technology, engineering, and math, where problem-solving and critical thinking is important. It includes all possible majors related to these four fields, and some of them even include areas such as psychology, architecture, finance, medicine, and etc. Some people find it easy to solve math problems, enjoy working on science projects, programming or coding, testing experiments, and proving theorems. It is something some people enjoy working with. If you are this person, then it’s a number one reason for you to try yourself into the STEM field. For me, going into this field, I want to improve my knowledge, learn new things from professionalists to, later on, use this knowledge to help other people because when I discovered STEM, I felt that’s exactly what I want to study in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2036,"The reason I want to go into the STEM field is because I really enjoy tinkering and exploring mechanical devices. I was thinking about computer things other than Mechanical Engineering but I realized that I really don’t want to sit in front of my computer for a super long time and I really wanted to be able to work with both computer programs and with my hands. I also really really enjoy just how mechanically complex many machines are, whether it be cars, machinery lines, airplanes and just technology. And technology is something that really excites me and seeing how that affects today's people and knowing that a great mind who went through the same things as me created something that affects the world."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2037,"Carmelo De Guzman   September 2, 2021  Lab Instructor: Aaron Eiben  PHYS 232 Section 9     Lab Reflection# 1                 I want to go into the STEM field because I want to pursue a career of being a computer programmer for one of The Big Three companies such as Apple, Google, or Microsoft. I want to be able to apply the skills I’ve learned in college/university to an actual working environment where my skill set is put to the test. The STEM field is filled with all kinds of interesting ideas and beliefs that it’s almost as if it’s a big “scientific melting pot” that any scientist can add his/her own ideas. I’ve always had a piqued interest in programming and computers when I first took an introductory course in computer science during my high school year, and I have had that interest since then. All in all, the STEM field is something I want to get myself into because I think it's driven by research and curiosity, features that I think make STEM very intriguing for many.    "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2038,"I'm going into computer science because it's what I love to do. I am generally a scientific sort of person and I have a good mind for numbers etc. so it's a good choice for me. Personally I am not enamored with university or the school system, but I do love doing work in computer science, and would like to earn a degree to that end.(I didn't realize we were doing this until there was a minute left on the clock, so that is why it is so short, my bad)"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2039,"I want to go to the STEM field not just because I am good at Math and Science, but also for the fact that I seek to help improve my learnings on the subjects and get a good job ahead of me. My career goal is to become a “VideoGame Tester '', a job where I can test out early versions of a game before its public access. The job may require me to understand the ideas around Math, Sciences, and Communication. Math can help show any small snippets of bugs within the code of the game. Science helps me view the making of the game and helps me add more appropriate logic towards the story, setting, and/or characters. Communication is for me to help communicate my ideas on repairing the game and/or bring light to a new way of viewing logic to the game. Besides the whole “Game Testing” career choice, I do enjoy the subjects in the STEM field and I am eager to learn more about the Math and Sciences around my environment."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2040,"A lot of the people I grew up around were construction workers, and they liked to show what they were building. My dad would always show me photos of the building which he was working on, and show me what he did. I always found it interesting how things start off as empty spaces and then turn into huge buildings. I always had an interest in building things, and I knew from a young age that I wanted to do that. In school math and science have always been the subjects that most connected with me, I could see how these subjects interacted with my life. So I wanted to choose a career that involved the building and making of things while using my skills in math and science. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2041,"""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?""Ever since I was a kid I was always fascinated with video games. I think as time went by and it became the time to choose what I wanted to do in life, I decided to choose Computer Science as my major. I never really wanted to create my own video game but I think I want to just learn about how computers work and being able to fix them. I think coding for me is okay, I definitely enjoy learning more about how the parts work together and how we can troubleshoot and fix computers when issues and errors do arise. Don't get me wrong, I love video games, they helped me destress ever since I could remember. Being able to escape into another world and not have to worry about current issues has been beneficial to me and being able to work in a field similar to it I feel would be best for me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2042,"I joined the STEM field because I enjoy coding and being involved with web design.  There are a lot of things that are involved in web design that includes more than designing the web sites.  There is a lot of code both front end and back end.  It allows me to problem solve and be creative at the same time, which makes the process more interesting.  The STEM subjects that are related to computer science also expands my knowledge of the world by having math and science be part of the process.  By understanding these subjects, it helps me understand the how things work in the background which is very important to improving problem solving.  A lot of CS major students hope to work for companies like Tesla, which is something I would also consider in the future.  I also want to help keep the planet sustainable and I think understanding mechanics of the world is important to that goal."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2043,"I want to go into the STEM field to hopefully improve the quality of life for people in the world. Personally, I get irritated whenever I see paths or roads that seem to be laid out in no particular order, such as the infrastructure of some San Francisco streets. In order to fix that, I thought of becoming a Civil Engineer to hopefully create roads that have minimal traffic, while being able to navigate them without having to pay attention for the entire time that you are driving. Another reason for going into the STEM field is that I enjoyed physics in high school, and I much preferred it over chemistry or biology. Since I also did pretty well in the calculus courses there, it just made sense to major in engineering, rather than a specific science major. Hopefully, I will be able to help a lot of people with the degree that I get in the future, whether I finish with an engineering degree or something else."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2044,"I want to go into the stem field because of my interest in Chemistry. I'm a chemistry major, and have been generally curious and interested in the field from the get-go of early highschool-late middle school. I have always been curious about it so exploring it in college only seemed natural. I haven't figured out exactly what I want to do with the field, but I figured as a career chemistry would be the best fit for me (although I really do enjoy physics), I'm more into physical chemistry. I want to go into the stem field because I believe it is the best fit for me, my toolsets, and how my brain works."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,9,2045,"The reason why I wanted to go into the STEM field is due to the fact I always enjoyed working with computers. I've always seemed do be attached to technology one way or another, probably cause of my living situation if I had to be honest. Wanting to know how things function, what makes them tick, as far as to fully knowing each part to make the machine function has been interesting. Even the software parts catch my attention. I may not be the brightest and struggle due to my detartrating mental health but I try my best to understand what's being presented in front of me. Computer science is what I am aiming for as I work a lot on 3D modeling with unity and blender, and have always been interested in what goes on behind the scenes. Whether it be programming, or building the pc itself, it's fun to some degree and I want to keep on going to see how far I can go until I fall."
