2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2014,"One topic we covered has to be the wiring of wires and how electric currents go through them and give power to certain areas of the battery, and how resistors contribute to the power source of the batteries. It was interesting to me because I never knew that the resistors would add up to the total of the battery. I don't even know how the resistors are able to do that either."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2017,"Reflection #3 Connor Galvin PHYS 232 One question I would ask from what I have learned in this course is what are the practical applications of superconductors and their ability to conduct with no resistance? My response to this would be the superconductor’s ability to maintain a strong magnetic field without burning through current due o resistance in the material. Since there is no resistance to stop the current, the current will continue to move within the superconductor allowing for it to make a very strong electromagnet. One practical purpose of this is with maglev trains where you could have an extremely heavy train suspended in the air via superconductive electromagnets causing there to be no friction between the train and the track allowing for high speeds. Another purpose of this could be in a particle collider when strong magnetic forces are needed to accelerate a particle to high speeds."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2002,"I think that Flux and Gauss' law is something that will always play a role in people's daily lives since nowadays we use a lot of things that are electric-based. Even though the average person may not be aware of the use of this law when using technology, it still is playing a big role in the things we use daily for ""basic"" uses. This law deals with the stability of atoms, equilibrium with conductors, electrostatics, and equilibrium in an electrostatic field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2010,"Reflection #3 One concept we learned in this class was charge. Opposite charges attract with each other while two identical charges will repel each other . This concept applies to many aspects of daily life even if we aren’t aware of it. The static shock you might feel from touching someone or going down a slide is a result of the movement of these charges because they or either attracting or repelling each other . Whenever we interact with certain objects or certain objects interact with other objects, charge is being transferred. Phenomena such as a balloon sticking to objects are caused by the attraction of charges. This concept also applies to objects such as batteries. The negatively charged electrons flow to the positive side of the battery because opposite charges attract. This is what creates the energy necessary to power electronics we use like phones, lights, the microwave and many more common objects. Without this understanding of how charge works, we wouldn’t be able to power these electronics."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,156,"Guerrero 1 Sid Guerrero Professor Grigorescu PHYS 232 13 October 2021 Reflection 3 What type of circuit is better: a series or parallel? In weeks 6 and 7 we learned about circuits as well as current. Through that I wanted to know if either a series or a parallel circuit is better than one or the other . At first, it has been a while since I first learned about series and parallel circuits, but thanks to the lab I was able to understand both easily . I learned that a series can only have one current path while a parallel can have multiple current paths. By knowing that I was able to understand which series or a parallel circuit would be better in certain cases. Overall, it hard to choose between the two since both are used for a certain purposes, but I would say for terms of ef fectiveness I would say parallel because with parallel circuits when a part of the circuit stops working the others components of the circuit continue to work whereas in a series circuit, if one fails the whole thing fails as well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2011,A topic that I really enjoyed would be the short circuit topic. The lab was based on making a circuit and showing that the battery and the voltage would flow through the aluminum foil and it would show sparks when introduced or connected to a small sliver of aluminum foil. I think that it would be beneficial for people to not only learn it but to also try it out and visualize it themselves because it seems useful in some situations. Such as if you needed a way to charge your phone in the wild or some similar situation you could use this lab to find a way to use a battery and some wires to be able to charge your phone or power something else. This specific lab did a very good job of showing how to set up the circuit. Not only was it fun but it was also really informative about the different circuits like series or parallel. We were also given the task of calculating the amount of current possibly running through the circuit. Other ways that this could be useful would be showing how the batteries could start a fire. Showing that the wires put together can heat up and potentially cause sparks can be useful to make fires and or be a safety precaution in knowing that the batteries are capable of such things.

2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2016,"Brandon Foley PHYS 232 Reflection #3 What are the dif ferences between series and parallel circuits? Series and parallel circuits have many dif ferences.  First of all, series and parallel circuits look very dif ferent.  Series circuits only have a single pathway , while parallel circuits have more than one pathway .  Voltage and resistance are also dif ferent for series and parallel circuits.  In series circuits, voltages add up with additional components and currents do not.  This is the opposite of parallel circuits.  In parallel circuits, currents add up with additional components and voltages do not.  Because of this, batteries connected in a parallel circuit last longer than batteries connected in a series circuit.  If a single component breaks, series and parallel circuits can react very differently .  For example, imagine some light bulbs connected in a series circuit and some light bulbs connected in a parallel circuit.  If a single light bulb fused in each circuit, the series circuit would stop working while the parallel circuit would continue on. Light bulbs connected in a parallel circuit also burn brighter than light bulbs connected in a series circuit.  This information would be very useful to someone if they wanted to create some type of circuit to power a light bulb, a speaker , or something else like that. This information would also be useful to them if they wanted to know what the ef fects of adding a component to a certain type of circuit would be."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1996,"Week 7 Reflection      A concept that was covered in the lab that I wanted to talk about was this week’s concept, the current. Why is understanding the current and how it works very important? An electric current is a flow of an electric charge between two points. Imagine it being like water in a river carrying energy. The electric charge in the electrons causes resistors in light bulbs and electric fires to heat up. It also creates magnetic fields in motors, inductors, and generators. Current is one of the most important and fundamental elements within electrical and electronic technology. The current flowing in a circuit can be used in a variety of ways from generating heat to causing circuits to switch, or information to be stored in an integrated circuit. Obviously, the most important use of current is in electricity since we can’t live without it. Given a surface through which a metal wire passes, electrons move in both directions across the surface at an equal rate. When a metal wire is subjected to electric force applied on its opposite ends, these free electrons rush in the direction of the force, thus forming what we call an electric current. a"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2013,"Through   these   past   7   weeks,   I   have   learnt   a   lot   about   physics,   especially   about   charges    of   atoms   and   circuits.   I’ve   learned   that   positively   charged   ions   have   a   pushing   force,   while    negatively   charged   ions   have   a   pulling   force,   and   of   course   neutral   charged   ions   and   no    charged   ions   will   have   no   force.   I   have   also   learnt   that   these   forces   can   be   represented   through    vectors,   and   these   vector’s   length   and   arrow   actually   matter,   where   length   represents   the    strength   of   the   field   and   the   arrow   represents   the   direction   of   the   field.   There   is   also   the   electric    field   or   E-field,   that   exists   in   the   space   around   a   charge.   I   have   also   learned   that   these   charges    can   also   have   a   potential   energy   just   like   Gravitational   potential   energy   and   spring   potential    energy.   And   just   like   with   Gravitational   potential   energy   and   spring   potential   energy,   this   electric    potential   energy   can   be   changed   into   kinetic   energy   by   getting   closer   to   an   opposite   charge.    And   recently   I’ve   learned   about   Circuits   and   Short   Circuits.   A   circuit   being   a   close   path   for    current   to   travel   in,   and   a   short   circuit   is   an   electric   circuit   of   lower   resistance   than   that   of   a    normal   circuit.   I   have   also   learned   about   two   types   of   circuits,   which   are   series   and   parallel    series.   In   a   series   circuit,   there   is   a   higher   voltage   and   lower   current,   while   in   the   parallel   circuit    there   is   a   higher   current,   but   lower   voltage.   And   with   short   circuit,   they   are   actually   really   helpful    in   real   life,   usually   being   fuse   box   and   circuit   breaker   that   break   or   burn   up   with   the   current    flowing   through   the   circuit   is   too   high,   because   when   there   is   a   high   current   in   a   circuit,   the    circuit   could   burst   into   flames,   the   circuit   in   this   case   would   be   the   house."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1998,"Select a concept that was covered in  class in the past few weeks, either in lecture or lab,  and formulate a question. Then look through your class notes, lab notes, and/or textbook and  write  an essay  in response to your  question,  summarizing the relevant i nformation.     Discuss how this information might be generally applicable to people’s lives and/or how this  information might be used to benefit society. Be sure to include some concrete information that  was covered this semester, explaining  why this specif ic information is relevant.  Be sure to  give  examples.   A concept that was covered  in class that I would pick is the Circuit  and sho rt circuits , The  question that I would ask  that would be applicable to peop le’s lives  is like what kind of parts do I  need to make a complete circuit ? In o rder to make a complete circuit you will need voltage, a  path, and resistors. The vol tage is usually  the ba ttery or the electrical outlet in your hom e, the  path which allows the flow of the charges , and the resistor is the object that needs the electricity  to function. Remember  to connect the positive  and the nega tive side of the battery for the circuit  to light up. Also need to know when to build it in series and paralle l. In series is when objects are  connected in series meaning that the current passes through the first object  also passes  through  the second object. In Paralle l is when the right side is connect ed to the positive side charg e and  the left side is connected t o the negative charge. This inform ation might be generally applicable   to people ’s lives because this can help the m to have t he knowledge on how circuits work  and  how to make them . If they are interested,  they can make man y things with te chnology  and when  building  circuits in house s for out lets."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2009,"One concept that was covered in this class was current and one thing we touched in this section was parallel circuits. We learned about how most circuits that we used everyday in today’s society is arranged as a parallel circuit. For example using your phone or turning on the lights at home we use parallel circuits. Why is parallel circuits is more widely used than a series circuits for wiring things like a house? What we learned is that a parallel circuit allows for more current to run through the circuit compared to a series circuit where the current would become smaller with every element that is added in the circuit. This means that in a parallel circuit the bulbs would be just as bright with one blub or four bulbs, while in a series circuit all the bulbs will become more and more dim with every bulb that is added. This is why in houses or circuits for things that we use everyday is a parallel circuit because it allows for every element to receive a high current. For example when you plug something in the socket it will receive the same amount of current as a sokect in a different room."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2000,"What are circuits? Circuits have current, voltage, and resistance. There are two types of circuits which are series and parallel. Series is when two objects are connected in a series if all of the current that passes through object 1 and also passes through object 2. While the parallel circuit is when it does not go through all the objects. It has layers so that it does not go through too many objects at once. The voltage spreads better in a parallel than series because if the current goes through too many objects then the current will be less and less spread apart through the circuit. Some information that supports this is during the lab we had a simulation, which we made parallel circuits and series circuits, and then we tested and checked for the ohms. This is relevant because it can help you not short circuit at home."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2003,"One of the concepts that we learned during class that is going to be important for our daily lives  is being able to understand somewhat of circuits. Maybe not being able to understand it  completely like that but for someone like a technician who needs to m ake sure all the cables  are good. What I mean by that if the current is being equally transferred around the house and  not at risk of something going wrong on one side of the house. If the current isn’t set up  correctly, it could end badly with something c atching on fire. Another reason this is important is  maybe someone is building some type of robot and it has a lot of batteries around it. It has to  have the proper wiring and voltage around its necessary parts and making sure it’s not  overheating."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1999,"Mariela Moreno  PHYS 232.08    Reflection #3    So, we have recently covered parallel and series circuits in this class and we have learned  that in homes, series circuits are the preferred setup. It helps to prevent fires and catastrophes and  what not.   So, that got me wondering are car batteries setup in a parallel circuit or in a series circuit?  The reasoning behind my question is that in homes we prefer a series circuit because we are able  to achieve a higher voltage while maintaining a stable current. While in a parallel circuit the  voltage remains the same but the current can be manipulated (doubled).   So, what would be the preferred setup when discussing the necessities of a car?   After going over my notes and reading some chapters from our lecture textbook, I have  concluded that the lights in cars are wired in a parallel circuit because the supply in each branch  is halved. I am confident about this answer but I was not confident in my answer for the battery  that impacts the output voltage and capacity of the car’s battery system. So, I researched online  and founded that cars can wired in either series or parallel depending on what the manufacture  prefers to achieve from the car’s production."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2018,"Reflection #3 Are series circuits a safe option for a house’s electrical system? Series circuits are a great option when prioritizing safety in an electrical system. The way series circuits work is that a charge flows in one pathway. The one pathway is a great way to implement some sort of fuse so that if too much current was to happen, the electrical appliance would power off rather than anything were to cause a hazard such as electrical fires or explosions. This is essential providing a failsafe if anything bad were to happen! There should always be a backup plan for all projects that put people in harm's way especially when dealing with housing units. Many appliances such as space heaters may be left on overnight and while many may not know the amount of current it has being substantial, this can be very dangerous without there being a series circuit and a fuse allowing the space heater to shut off if any dangers were to rise. In addition, series circuit provide an easier idea of how much current there is to a newly educated person about how circuits work providing them a simpler way of detecting how much power should their appliances should be drawing from a single outlet/circuit."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1997,"Reflection #3                                                                                                       Karell Kouakou How are charges related to electricity? Electric charge is a property of matter carried by some elementary particles that tell how the particles are af fected by an electric or magnetic field. Electric charge can be neither  created nor destroyed. For example when we rub two things together , charge is  transferred, not created or destroyed; in this process one object loses a certain amount of charge and the other gains the same amount of charge.Rubbing increases the contact area and chance of transfer .  Electric charge can be positive or negative. When  a positively charged object is brought near another positively charged object the objects repel.When a positively charged object is brought near another negatively charged object the objects attract. When a positively or negatively charged object is brought near an uncharged object the objects attract. When two uncharged objects are brought next to each other the objects do nothing. Electric charge is our way of measuring how much  electric force an object can exert or feel. Electric charge forms the basis of the electrical and magnetic forces that are so important in our modern electrical and electronic luxuries. Electric charge Quantity of electricity electricity . Electric charge is measured in  coulombs. They can be stored on insulated metal spheres, insulated plates like  capacitors or in chemical solutions like electric batteries."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2004,"What is an electric circuit and how does it exactly work? This is a concept that is used on a daily basis from devices and other mechanisms but we tend to forget what runs those objects. This concept is not only part of physics but also revolves in the engineering field as well (especially electrical engineering).   An electric circuit can contain multiple components such as resistor, switch, capacitors, battery; in which they are connected by a wire that has current passing through it. This Can be as little as lighting up a bulb to huge generators in power plants that work on electric circuits.There are two types of circuits: series and parallel; This means that in series, resistors are all going through the same current in one wire. However, in parallel, resistors are cut up and divided through a closed circuit that changes the current for different resistors. In addition, circuits can be open and closed; that states that the path in an open circuit is always interrupted however that in a closed circuit is complete and current flows normally. As a matter of fact, if in series connection one bulb goes bad then all other bulb will stop working as well. On the other hand, if one bulb goes bad in parallel connection all other bulbs will still work fine."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2008,"The assignment that I look back on is the circuit  and how all the charges work and the effects it can  change on the c urrent. I think that is important because  there are lots of circuits and wires in the real  world that come to play with thi s. It can be implied  to real lif e throug h work and everyday life. It is  important to know how everything works and how it can be affected. For example, if a wire or circu it  isn’t  working then we are now able to find out the problem and find the source  of where  the power is  coming from. Like if the power is dead or it has no  current then we are able to determine the root of the  problem. We did a simulation  on how much power is received  depending on  the placement  of the  circuits . This shows that the current is important and where it goes. Using the knowledge we know  now  we help us with real life problems if it contains about current and circuits. For example, we now k now  that if cir cuits are in series than it will produce more power than circuits in parallel. I think that this topic  was important not only for class but in the real life world as well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2001,"Janice Arteaga Violeta Grigorescu PHYS 232 14 October 2021 Question: Why is the current system in a household parallel and not a series? The current system in the average household is a parallel system and not a series system because a parallel system distributes the electricity evenly throughout all the light bulbs and electrical sockets in the house. Meanwhile, a series system the electrical items in the house would get weaker as more are being used. For example in the simulation [Currents], the more light bulbs we had in a series the weaker the light that it would emit. Compared to the light bulbs connected in a parallel that had the same brightness even if we added more bulbs (still parallel). This could also be seen in the Voltages lab. In that simulation, the voltage measured in the resistors got weaker the more we added together in a series. However , in parallel, the voltage in the resistors will add up to the total voltage provided by the battery , so that the voltage would be the same throughout all the resistors. These two labs combined go to show that a house must be hooked up a parallel circuit because otherwise whenever you turn on a light or use a plug and someone else does so too, you would lose some voltage; but thankfully that does not happen."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2007,"Name: Bhuvaneshwar Shanil Prasad   Date: 10/13/2021   Reflection #3     A concept that was covered in  class in the past few weeks, either in lecture or lab  was  short circuits and making a bulb light up. As per the lab, we were able to find out how the flow  of the electrical current needs to be to get your full potential of light. You could wire things  parallel and get more current and then you can wire thing s non -parallel and not get your full  current. Short circuiting basically just means the electricals failing or being in a malfunction. A  wrong connection of two ends with different voltages can happen to cause a short circuit.  This  information might be gen erally applicable to people’s lives because this can help a person light  up a light bulb or even save a light bulb from exploding.  How this information might be used to  benefit society  is trying to jump your dead battery of your car. When jumping your car,  often  times, your parents or elders tell you to never touch the negative and positive, this is because it  will spark. I accidently touched them together when picked up the wires and it did spark. The  spark, if held together, could’ve caused a short circui t. Overall, I think it is very important for  people to know how these problems are caused and how it could be fixed."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2012,"Daniela Martinez PHYS 232-08 December 1st, 2021 Reflection #3 The concept that I will be focusing on which was covered in one of the lectures for this class will be Week 6: Circuits. The question that I will be forming is as provided: What is the purpose of a circuit and why is it important? Physics can be involved in many ways which many may not notice, but learning about currents is absolutely important to us because there will be times where if we had no knowledge of how they work, it could potentially lead to a disaster and would not give us the ability of electricity , gas, etc. There are circuits in our devices like computers and the electricity that we use every day to light our homes, but it’ s important to know about the voltage which is used to measure electricity . In order for the class to learn more about circuits, we saw a demonstration of how to make a current involving aluminum paper , wires, batteries, etc. but we also learned the safety of why it is important to not touch the wires together . It is fascinating seeing how one can make a circuit and turn on a light bulb but it takes more knowledge to use this in the future and is a reason why we are able to use electricity; to use this safely will ensure that we can keep our homes bright and circuits are the. In our lecture, we learned about how to draw circuits as well as what the symbols mean, for example, we learned how to draw circuits by using symbols and knowing what each symbol is like the light bulb, resistor , etc. which can be used when people want to make alterations in their own homes: It is important to call your electric company so that they may assist you with any electrical needs that you may have. This concept can be generally applicable to people’ s lives because there will be times when middle or high schoolers will be introduced to this and it’ s important to learn how to draw these circuits as well as seeing how it actually helps light what we need in our daily lives. This information can be beneficial to society because it helps people learn about circuits and how there are two types of circuits, but it can also help people learn about the importance of learning how to do circuits and overall just helping people become interested and aware of the Physics behind currents."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,175,"Henry Hall Reflection #3  	One question that I could think of that involves material that we have covered recently in class is are the major electronic components in cars wired generally in series or in parallel.  In relation to the short circuit lab, we talked about how circuits generally worked and what the purpose of a fuse would be for that circuit.  The fuse is an element added to a circuit that will fail if too much current passes through it.  We also know that cars have at least one fuse box, and that those fuses are there for a reason.  This would mean that the fuse box itself should be wired in series with each element that you want to protect, with the battery most likely wired in parallel with the fuse boxes.  That way you get constant current from the battery to the boxes when you, for instance turn on the overhead light in the cabin, but if the circuit were to short the fuse will burn out rather than the bulb."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2020,Reflection #3 Some things I've learned in this class are how voltage transfers across circuits in parallel vs in series. I found this to relate to real life as to circuits in a house. When voltage sources are set in series the voltage is added together to increase the voltage which can be used to increase power in a house. In a real house the voltage is divided into parallel paths. This actually allows to keep the same voltage across each path allowing for outlets to all send the same voltage. When the current becomes to strong for a circuit a fuse will break which will immediately cut of f the current preventing further damage or even fires.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2019,"Looking over one of the topics we spoke about in a previous lab is circuits and how it relates to fuses. Using fuses, we understand that in order for there to be an observable current of electricity the silver which lies in between the two pieces of foil connected to batteries must be thin. We know that the lar ger surface area that the silver has, only causes the current to be less noticeable. This is true because lar ger surface areas can withstand more electricity which as a result does not allow the silver to break or combust. This is important because fuses are meant to protect electrical equipment found in households and cars from being damaged due to too much electricity being delivered. With thin pieces of silver placed in fuses, if too much power were to be delivered through the fuse it would result in the silver combusting which would disconnect any power being delivered to the equipment causing it to damage the utilities from excess output. In many cases this might be useful if power outages or ser ges were to occur , in the case of thunderstorms which strike telephone poles might deliver too much power to equipment which would cause a lar ge amount of equipment to be damaged. However , in this case the fuse would combust before the power could even be transferred to the equipment which would ultimately prevent fires and excess ener gy from being exposed to the household or people."
