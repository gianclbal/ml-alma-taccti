2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2003,"Online classes have really changed the way I learn and not in a good way. The reason I say this is because I can't really keep what I learn in my head for a long time. All these distractions at home make it hard to focus and retain what is said during my classes. Because of this it makes it really hard to not stress when it comes to the mid terms. Recently we had our mid term and every time I took it I had a really hard time making me feel anxious and feeling like I didn't do my best. However, the way I help myself to get rid of this stress is by maybe playing a game or listening to music on my free time. Even then its hard to get the free time because of work and the homework we get out of class, but in the end I'm sort of able to manage both things in my life. The biggest concern I have for myself right now for school is maybe failing a class because I don't understand something."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2000,"Since the start of covid-19, online classes has been introduced to many people. Online classes affected everyone differently since not everyone has done an online class. For myself, at first, online class has been somewhat challenging, unless you get a really good professor. It feels like you are learning by yourself most of the time. There are zoom classes but they're really different from in person classes. I feel like I do not get the most content from the professors. I also understand some professors have never done online, so for some professors I am actually amaze how they adapted quickly, but some professors are having a hard time, which also makes it hard for the students. In online classes, sometimes it's hard to watch zoom classes and stay up specially when it is in the morning. What I'm doing for my self-care is, do not stress too much in school even though it is very stressful. Do not be too hard on ones self and take it easy on yourself. Some concerns I have for my learning is I feel like I got lazier when it was online, but I also do not mind online because it gives me more time. During those free time, I could study more, have more social life. My concerns for my well being is, maybe it is harder to communicate since I have not seen too many people or made friends since the start of covid-19. Hopefully life will get better for me and everyone."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2019,"Online classes have really required me to overlook the way I spend my time. Whether the way I use my time is efficient or if I am just procrastinating. Alongside this, taking online classes have really made me change the way I usually approach class. Sometimes not having a reliable internet connection can be challenging, but also self teaching in some classes have really become more relevant. Now that asynchronous classes are more relevant than they have been in the past, I've really had to look at the way I study and if its efficient for me. Although online classes haven't been the best, they also have not been all bad. I've also had to do my best with self care making sure that I still am able to maintain a health sleep schedule and do my best with managing any hobbies or stress relieving activities. Some of my biggest concerns are still receiving the support I need from professors of my higher major classes but as of now physics has been well taught and understandable. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2004,"Online classes have impacted me positively in numerous ways. It helped me be a visual and creative person. However, it impacted me negatively too by not being in a social environment and socializing with classmates. Moreover, not being able to experience the real college experience has been a tough one. On the other hand, virtual classes have been to my advantage somehow in which I'm working at my own pace. Online classes made me feel less stressed and worried. It made me stay living with my family since if I were to go to campus I had to leave my family to live near the campus. This helped me mentally and psychologically which made me the person I am today assisting me in having a great semester. With that being said, I’ve been able to set a healthy sleeping schedule and some time for sports aside from my studies. Another aspect that has been positive to me is quality time with my family; this made me come closer to them and has impacted my grades big time. In conclusion, this experience has benefited me in many ways but I’m definitely waiting for the day we could actually go back in person."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2011,"I think that online classes at first were very hard to get adjusted to. I think I had trouble keeping myself focused and engaged in most lectures. Homework-wise I think I was able to plan and organize myself to get it done on time. Another problem that I would like to highlight would be the quality of some lectures. Most of the time I would get some professors who were not very tech-savvy and thus that would translate into the lectures being hard to follow. Aside from the lectures being hard to follow and or being prerecorded, I feel that I had trouble understanding some of the material. During these online courses, I have been able to take a step back and take care of myself more. As for my concerns, I hope that in the future I continue to pick good professors, which would hopefully improve the quality of education online. Other than that I do not think I am very concerned for my well-being because I try to take care of myself in various ways. Such as managing and organizing my time and work, making sure I eat and sleep the right amount, and also exercising from time to time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2006,"Online classes have not impacted me negatively yet there so much school assignments to do. Certainly it had gotten very overwhelming with the current load of work and it does not help to grasp the concept. But there is always positive and negative aspects. One of the positive concepts  is helps to manage time better while putting priorities to the assigned tasks. A negative aspect is that sometimes some of the assignments are turned late.Facing this issue I developed a  strategy where I put more focus on high priority on assignments that are more heavily graded. So far this have been very effective and allowing me to pass my classes. None of the less, I could do better but is also important to balance our personal lives.So, I am not necessary looking to be a A student but to learn and graduate while maintaining a balanced life and healthy habits."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2020,"Journal reflect Online learning has made it much more difficult to pay attention especially because of how when you are in your own home there are so many more things that can distract you from what you need to be working on. For self care I am regularly attending the gym to stay healthy and in shape. Lately I haven’t been able to go as often as I have wanted to because of midterms but now I am back on track.My only concern is that because I’m not in person I am not contributing the level of dedication I should, but I found a solution to this by forcing myself to go and work on my homework at the library because there are so many less distractions."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1999,"I am an unmedicated ADHD student, so it is extremely hard for me to focus on my classes online- because learning online is a lot less engaging than learning in person. I have trouble staring at a computer screen for over thirty minutes straight during lectures. I also get upset when something is difficult to understand because I know it is so much harder setting up study groups online than it is in person.  However, I will say that my grades have gone up tremendously since we have started online classes. Before online classes, I was striving for a C+ now I striving for all A+ in all my classes. I think although it is harder for me to maintain focus in lectures, being able to rewatch recordings of lectures has what has improved my grades so much! I get to rewatch lectures and write down the small details that matter so much. I think a lot of the time it is the small details that matter the most in any subject! I think when or if we return to in-person learning- professors should keep recording their lectures posting them to their ILearn pages because I like to rewatch the lectures I have already attended and most of my peers do as well- especially before big exams. Mentally my well-being is not doing so well, but I doing everything I can to improve my mental well-being. And my grades have been amazing, somehow. I received the highest grade on the midterm in our physics lecture. So although I'm not doing great- my grades are! I hope you're doing good! :) Mariela "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2008,Online class has been okay but it has been draining stay in the house most of the time. It is convenient to have class so close to you when you wake up but it takes a toll on self care because you do not have to get ready to go outside. It's more comfortable to do online class but it is also hard if you need help immediately help because everything is online. The concern I have is that not getting out as much to go to school has made me feel lazy to do things because I spend most of my time at home on online school. The concern for learning is that it isn't hands on and is mostly through zoom recordings.  
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1997,"An online class is a course conducted over the Internet. They are generally conducted through a learning management system, in which students can view their course syllabus and academic progress, as well as communicate with fellow students and their course instructor.Back in 2019 I was afraid of taking online classes, since I have always been taught in person. In 2020 when I decided to take one of my classes online to see the experiment, everything shifted online because of the pandemic that we were facing. At first I thought I would not be able to focus, since it is a different environment. My questions were will I be able to pay attention during lecture? What if someone in the house is making some noises, how can I listen to the lecture? What if  Instead of focusing on the lecture I spend time on my phone? There were so many questions. But, Finally I got used to online classes and I am planning on taking more classes online even if we get back to normal classes. You spend less money with online classes by not always driving to school, looking for parking spots and more."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2010,"Online classes have made learning much harder when it comes to focusing and retaining information. It's easy to be distracted because you are in the comfort of your own room. Learning things such as math is not the same line compared to in person. Socializing is also much harder because everyone has their camera and microphone off. We can't communicate with each other outside of the chat and breakout rooms. For health care, I typically try to take a walk outside at least once a week for fresh air. I also try to keep in touch with friends as much as I can to maintain those connections. I am most concerned about trying to remember all the information I am learning for future classes when school returns back to normal. It's going to be strange that I'm going to the campus for the first time despite being a student for about a year."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1998,"Online classes kind of impacting my learning by making me very lazy to get up for classes and doing homework last minute. I learned more about myself this semester and overall I want to improve my learning abilities and want to do better in school. But over all classes online are not bad except for some teachers that don't really teach well on zoom which affects my learning. What I am doing to self care is making sure I keep up with my work, taking a walk outside to clear my mine, and talking to my friends or family. Some concerns I have is that one of my classes does not teach the course requirements in which I am scared of failing that class but the Lab class is teaching me more than my physics class. My well being is that I hope I can keep up my mentality and having a healthy mentality through out this semester."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2017,"Online classes have made it harder for me to learn the curriculum over the pandemic. My grades have gone down and I find that there is a lot of difference in quality of online classes. Some teachers have good online courses and adapted to the change, however many courses would be much better in person. For self-care I make sure to set aside some free time to workout or do stuff with friends, however during the height of the pandemic when I couldn't be around friends I played a lot of video games with friends online. The main concern I have about online learning is that some classes will remain permanently online, and I think a lot of people can benefit by having the option to take a class in person."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2016,"I don't think online college classes have affected my learning at all.  This is because I was home-schooled online for several years before college.  This made my transition from high school to college pretty simple.  I am in computer engineering and some of the classes I am taking are quite challenging, but I think that is just because they are hard classes and not because they are online.  All of my classes are still fully online, but I think I will probably have some in-person/hybrid classes next semester.       As for my self-care, I have been making sure to go outside and exercise everyday. I normally go jogging or biking around my neighborhood.  I also try to spend time with my two dogs everyday by taking them for walks or playing ball with them outside.  I think all of these things have been great for my well-being.  I don't have any concerns for learning or well-being."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,156,"At first, when online classes started I really liked having these online classes because I was able to stay home and relax while attending school. Now after doing these for practically 2 years now, I never realized how much I enjoyed having the classroom environment. It is also hard since I missed 2 years worth of being ""in"" college. Learning overall is becoming more difficult because courses like lab aren't hands on anymore so I can't actually experience actual lab. But with that I'm still able to learn through these current labs, I just wish that I'll be able to experience an actual lab hands on in the future. Even though it is tough, I'm still able to do things I can do at home like working on my car as well as learning new skills. I recently picked up building model kits to take up some time off of my day. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2005,"Online classes have been like a 50/50 coin flip when it comes to classes. Either I get a decent teacher who knows how to structure and manage an online course. Or I get a teacher that has a disorganized ilearn, doesn't know how to teach, reads directly off of a power point and just regurgitates what's on the screen rather than teaching. It was the same coinflip for in-person classes, but I feel as if covid making people teach online weighs the coin down on the terrible side of the coin. As for self-care I already lost my sanity in middle school so that ship has sailed. My concern for classes is that I learn more in my physics lab class than I do in the actual course. Since in the actual course the teacher does not teach a single lecture herself, still maintains a disorganized ilearn, and still does not make use of her zoom class time allotment just directs us directly to the recorded lectures planned. Overall it kinda just sucks to have teachers like that."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2018,"Online classes have impacted me in a few positive and negative ways. In terms of positives, I feel like I have so much more time and energy from not having to commute to campus as well as walk from class to class. I’m also being disciplined in remaining focus during zoom sessions even when it’s so easy to just go on the Internet or browse on my phone. On the other hand, there are times where online learning can lead me to lose my focus on some days, and then I end up struggling afterwards until I look back and review. In addition to some other cons, I lack the motivation sometimes to finish all my work in a timely manner. I see myself procrastinating more often than before, and this could be due to the decreased in diligence from losing focus. Overall, online learning has been nice, but I for sure miss going back in person."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2001,"I feel like online classes have slowed down my learning. Some subjects (or professors) aren't well suited for online learning. I also struggle to stay motivated or focus in synchronous online classes; in the comforts of my house, I have every possible distraction within reach. What I do for self care is take study breaks to play video games or chat with friends online. I also take naps (I tend to stay up very late). Sometimes when I'm craving fresh air I annoy my siblings and parents into taking me for coffee or to a store that I like.The pandemic has had a toll on my mental health, giving me really bad germaphobia and almost teetering on OCD-like tendencies but thanks to the school I have access to free counseling which I have been attending for a while. I am concerned that the longer I'm online that the harder it might be for me to return but that is something I am working on."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2013,"Online classes has both positively and negatively impacted my learning. I don't have to worry about leaving some work at home and tests are easier, and finding the materials for class are easier to get. On the other hand, I have no idea what classes offline is like. I haven't been on campus once yet, I don't know where anything is nor do I know how classes would work. I also haven't felt like I am in college because most of my time is online, and the time when I'm on campus, there's nothing going on to make it feel like college. I'm with doing work online, but I feel like I'm not connecting with other people that I would be helping or getting help from. In all honestly, if I wasn't so close to my family and visit my grandparents every other day, I feel like I would get bored same in my room all day. For now I'm fine, but I feel in-person and online classes really depend on the professor, whether it's a good class is if the person teaching the class a is good or bad professor."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,175,"Online classes have been very difficult for me personally.  I do not perform very well through the online medium, mainly because I am at home and sometimes find it very difficult to be fully productive or to not get distracted by my housemates.  Before Covid my GPA was in the mid 3's and I'm sure it has suffered since going online.  My self-care has actually increased since pre covid, I just forced myself into a better routine when the lockdowns first started. I even started working out again, which I haven't done since I was 16. My largest concern is spending more time in college than I would need to due to the unique times that we are currently living in, as well as my mental health from being at home so much. Hopefully my classes next semester will be in person!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1996,"Week 9 Reflection Online classes have had their pros and cons with me personally. I live 470 miles away from SFSU, and it would’ve been so hard to travel there due to several reasons so thankfully, the online classes saved me a whole year that I took whilst at home. Even before I transferred to SFSU, my grades were a lot better in the last semester I took online in Egypt. When subjects got harder, it was harder to understand since it is hugely self-study which is very challenging. Obviously, the bad part about online classes and being online in general is that you barely see people and for me it was a lot worse than that since I am a new immigrant who doesn’t know anyone in the area I live in, and my university is hundreds of miles away. It has been like that ever since I came here one year ago but I had to deal with it and never lose hope that all of this is just temporary and hopefully it will get better soon. My only concern is that it gets better before it gets too late."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2009,"Online learning, in general, has been an okay experience because I am learning some new things, but some things it is harder to understand some new topics. Learning online has some positive aspects, like not having to commute every day to school which allows me to get more sleep and more time to do homework. Another thing that I have liked is the time management it has given me because some classes are asynchronous which is helpful if I missed a class. But there are also negative aspects like it is harder to learn the material compared to in-person classes. An example is the number of distractions there are at home so it is hard to stay focused in class. To help combat this I would take breaks in between classes by eating, sleeping, or playing games. In some classes, they cover different topics very fast and I don’t understand that topic very well. So I take extra time outside of class trying to understand that topic thoroughly."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2007,"Online classes, in my opinion, has opened many different opportunities for me throughout the past year. Self-care wise, I have been getting a bit more time by myself since there is no traveling portion of the studies. And learning wise, it is better as well because like I said before, no traveling portion. Because of this, so much time is saved enabling me to do other activities, spend more time with family, help my sister with anything and most importantly self-care for myself. I believe staying at home by myself and joining the zoom call is much better because I personally can get my work done faster without any outside distractions. There are assignments online that the system grades by itself that they don’t have to grade, which is awesome for us students because we don’t have to wait the extra week or 2 weeks for our score to appear. Again, like I said, this is my opinion and others can have a different view. Overall, I think online classes has had more of a positive impact than a negative impact."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2014,Online classes are horrid. they are just outright horrible. I hate it here especially with all these labs and assignments it really doesn't make sense at all. we pay up to 3 thousand dollars minimum to do what? turn in assignments braindead not taking in any new material because there is no engagement in the classes between professors and students. I don't even want to attend class anymore because of this because there is literally no point to attend any of these classes. It is just assign and do the workload nothing else. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2002,"My senior year in high school was online so the change wasn't that sudden. I would prefer in person but online helps me a lot since I got to stay home and get extra family support. I have one in-person class this semester and it has helped me a lot, especially since it also is a lab. For my self-care, I decided to get back into creative writing, drawing, and I picked up a hobby of Brazillian Jiu Jitsu. I have made some friends but since I could not meet them yet we would have zoom game nights or facetime each other. I have fixed some bad habits as well such as, biting my nails, I fixed my sleep schedule and I gto better at time management. I think that is also something positive that came from having to take college courses online, is that I had to get better at time management because teachers can't/don't remind you as often as in person. I still can not wait to get back fully in person though."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2012,"Time has been pretty weird ever since the pandemic hit, sometimes classes feel slow or pass by pretty fast but it has been about two years of online classes since the pandemic came around which has impacted so many students. Online classes have had such a huge impact on my learning both mentally and academically because at first it was something confusing to shift into but I have recently felt like I have been losing interest in any of the classes I have done resulting in missing assignments, loss of interests, etc. This has gone on for a long while now that I absolutely feel like I need to go back to classes in person for my own health. Being at home does not put me in the environment I work best in and is making me lose interest and the determination to finish my final years of college. I don’t really do much for self-care these few days, the only thing I have is to call my online friends and unwind when school becomes too much of a burden for me mentally but because I am also doing school at home I tend to get distracted quite easily which makes me feel guilty. I usually unwind by playing video games since it gives me something else to focus on rather than school which helps me feel relieved but I do tend to draw any ideas I have in mind, basically, I do things other than schoolwork to forget sometimes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2015,"Remote learning 	Remote learning has pros and cons. When the pandemic hit us, I remembered I went to the morning to school and one of the students was diagnosed with COVID-19, so they closed the campus. I was worried about how I’m gonna adjust to this new experience online but I had experienced learning on remote because I took one class that was online the previous semester. So, I set up my table and I made a schedule for every class I have for the day, I would study that material of the class. One of the pros I like remote learning is I am flexible for my studies, I don’t have to worry about going to the campus, not worrying a gas or traffic in the morning. In addition, I feel like I have more times to do things, for instance when I have a problem solving I would make my own research to understand deeply the material because I don’t have a professor all the time. So it’s kind of like self-taught, you will figure out on your own when you are stuck on the problems. In addition, remote learning has more challenges than in person. Because remote learning is more stressful but what helps me with my self-care, I do work out daily, to release my stress. Working out helps a lot mental, physical and emotional. There are times I’m feeling very down but when I go to the gym, all those thoughts I had in mind goes away.     "
