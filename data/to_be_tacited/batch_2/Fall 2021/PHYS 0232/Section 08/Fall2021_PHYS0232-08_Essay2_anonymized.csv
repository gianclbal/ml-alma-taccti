2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2019,"My goals for the future are to hopefully become a successful scientist or pharmacist involved in the process of creating medications. The real drive behind this goal comes from the accessibility and availability of medication to the general public. I think in today's society, medication comes at a very high cost due to labor and materials. It’s due to this barrier that many people do not have access to medications that they might need or possibly be life saving. With that in mind, I want to work with medicine in hopes of one day having the opportunity to cut down the cost of materials used in the creation of modern medicine. If the materials used allow for the price of medicine to become more accessible while still being just as effective, then maybe people who did not have access before due to high costs will now have that option available to them. By continuing my studies in chemistry, physics, and mathematics hopefully one day I will make this dream a reality. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2000,"My goal is to get my computer science bachelor's degree. In order to get that degree I would have to take this physics class. I have to work hard and pass this class so I can get that degree. Physics may be hard but I will be trying my best to pass this class. The thing about physics is, I like the concepts and how hands on the experiments are since you can use in everyday life. I really like physics, but I lack on doing the math part. I think I just have trouble on word problems, but I try. Even though sometimes I do not score the best on my tests/quizzes what matters to me is that I am learning, but the only bad part about that is if you fail the class then I am wasting money. I also am trying to graduate in 2 years or so, so I have to work very hard. Honestly, I am not very excited about the 9-5 job, so I am kind of taking it slower than the norm on finishing my degree. I feel like once I get a job, I would be very busy and I would not have much time to have fun. In life I just feel like you have to enjoy it and not stress too much. Even though education may take time for me, I would love taking care of my mental health. Honestly, I just want to travel the world and explore while of course supporting my self and my future family."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2011,"My goals for this class are to do my best in each lab and have fun with the experiments. I think that you are a pretty good professor with a very nice teaching environment. I don't think you need to change anything to help me succeed. This is due to the class having a positive aura and also the labs and work and such have been fun and engaging. Overall, what I want to do is to continue being consistent with all my other classes and work. To do this, I have created a google calendar which will help me keep organized and on top of all my assignments. Another thing I am having trouble with would be my main physics class as most of my lectures are pre-recorded. To combat this I have learned to just watch the lectures again when I have the chance so that I can review and learn the material better."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2013,"I don't have any solid goals for my future, but I do have some goals for the present, and this class can help me achieve these goals. Currently the only goals I have are to pass all more classes and graduate from college and get a good job that I can help support my family with. But to achieve that last goal of mine, I have to achieve that first goal, which is to pass all my classes. This class is going to help me achieve that goal by helping me review what I should be learning in my physics class and applying what I am learning in real life and seeing how it actually works. Hopefully everything that I am learning in this class will help me in the future. I hope that I can use what I am learning in class to apply it in real life situations."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1996,"My Goals The first goal that I want to achieve is to obviously graduate from university and earn my bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering. I’ll probably go on with graduate studies, but I am not sure about this goal yet. This class will help me achieve this goal because it has a lot of experiments that correspond to real life situations that we face in our lives or jobs. It also helps me understand concepts that I didn’t understand before I saw them in this class. Dealing with charges, electric fields, equipotential lines, electric flux, and things that can’t be seen in general was always a nightmare for me, but now things are getting better thanks to the simulator that we used in 2 of the lab explorations that we finished earlier. I will hopefully give this class everything I have and in return I should get a satisfying grade and keep moving towards my goals."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1996,My%20Goals.docx
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2004,"My goal and dream is starting up my own electrical engineering company. I am striving and  will continue on working hard to accomplish this lifelong dream. I have built up throughout my life the love for electricity and managing skills. So, starting up my own company is the perfect combination of both of my hobbies and interests. I know it is very tough and needs a lot of work, and that's why I'm in it till the end! There will be ups and downs, but I am confident that the perseverance that I carry by nature will allow me to reach my final target. As a matter of fact, this journey has already begun through my highschool years. I have already started picturing and designing the perfect company in my head and started researching and pointing out what needs to be done. This class will definitely help me reach my final destination. This is because the core of this class is learning how to solve problems efficiently in physics and also in situations that I may come across in my daily life. It made me look at things from a different perspective and angles that enhanced my thinking skills. No successful company can run without the owners having these complex thinking skills."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1997,"Karell KouakouFirst of all, my goal is to one day work as a civil engineer. In fact we cannot mention engineering without physics. This class of General physics will help me understand most of the basic material that I need to do for my engineering classes. This class covers a lot of useful topics like charge, electric field, flux and Gauss’s Law, potential, short circuit, Current, Voltage, Coding, RC circuit, Electromagnets, Magnetic interaction and Induction, speed of Light that will help me better understand physics concepts. Also, the lab is one of the greatest advantages for me to actually get to practice and have some experience on things around me . The lab makes me feel more in the subject, and it helps me understand real life more. Finally I can say that this general physics class will develop more aptitude in me, meaning I will focus more on the experiment before drawing a conclusion. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2018,"My goal is to graduate with my bachelors in Electrical Engineering and becoming an electrical engineer. This class helps me achieve that goal because it is one of the requirements part of my major. However, that is not the only reason why this class may help me achieve my goal but this class also helps me develop time management since there are assignments due throughout the week that I need to work on. This will for sure help since I have so many other things going on in my life that the class helps me balance my time for each activity. Not only do I develop better time management from this class, but I also develop critical thinking since the subjects we are learning takes more than just plugging in numbers but takes an actual thought process before even approaching a problem. All in all, this class seems like a great tool in achieving my goal."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2005,"My goals career wise is to be working somewhere in the game development field after I get my computer science bachelors. I would like to be a gameplay programmer, but as an entry into the industry I don't think I have that option. I think it will be one of those things where I find a company that after I get my bachelors will hire me, teach me on the job, and then put me into a role where I will be most confident in after being taught more on the job. This class will help me by satisfying a-g requirements to get my degree. As well as teach me more about physics in case I ever write my own game engine I would like to have closest to realistic physics. Other than that at this point I am really just trying my best to get my degree within the online capacity. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2007,"My goals for overall life is being able to build a character who can get along with people and be able to communicate everything to the best of my ability. Another major goal that i have is becoming a computer engineer, this goal can only be achieved by me fulfilling all my degree requirement and physics is one of those requirements. I believe this class will help with math and just thinking more deeply about certain scenarios which will help me open my mind to everything else. I think. the environment of the class will also help me improve my confidence and just overall be smart with my decisions.Another one of my goal is just becoming a more organized person. With the assignments being due on the tim ethey are,  i think this class will help me be able to practice my time management skills. Because of this skill, it will also help me with my career goal of becoming a computer engineer as many people need to be smart with their time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2003,"One of my biggest goals of this class is to be able to fully understand the physic concepts we go over in this class. I feel that it will be essential for my future career if I want to continue in computer science. You never know if you have to create some type of software relating to one of these concepts we've went over. I want to make sure I'm prepared for any type of situation when it comes to coding so I won't have to go through a bigger struggle. Another goal I have for this class it to be able pass, I tend to have a hard time to take online classes because of easily distracted I get at home. Its also hard to pay attention to my classes with the amount of people at my place and the amount of noise that goes on in the back. However, I'm always going to try my hardest to get a good grade coming out of this class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,175,"My goals in general are to get a Mechanical Engineering degree as soon as I possibly can, and from there manage to land an engineering job.  I’m twenty-six, and I have done my fair share of minimum wage jobs.  I find the subject that I’m studying very interesting, and I do enjoy the material, but I would say that my major incentive would be the career prospects post graduation.  I am hoping to be able to land a job at Lockheed Martin when I graduate, due to it being a very interesting industry to go into, as well as the job security.  This class is very helpful for myself achieving those goals; not only is it a required class but it is also a core class to a lot of classes I will take in the future.  On a side note, I also believe that learning about electro-magnetism is a good skill to have when doing repairs around the house, so I can install new sockets or replace switches without giving myself a shock."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2017,"My goal is to become a civil engineer and although this class isn't particularly the side of physics that I would use in civil engineering, its useful to have a well rounded understanding of physics in general. In addition to that I enjoy making stuff including electrical stuff, so this class will help me with my hobbies. That said this class will also help out in my general life when I need to fix or make anything electrical, I'll know what I'm doing more so than if I didn't take this class. Although this class won't help me achieve every goal I have its at least a stepping stone to help achieve maybe a couple of them."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2001,"My current goal is to not only to just pass this class but to also understand what it is I'm learning. I feel like this class can help me achieve that because the lab gives us opportunities to work ""hands on"" which enhances my comprehension ability. Also, this class lets us work in groups so if/when I am stuck I can turn to my classmates for help; sometimes having a topic explained to me in a different way helps me to understand it and by working with others it grants me many opportunities to do so before turning to the professor. This also allows me to work on speaking up; in previous science classes I would feel dumb to ask for clarification but since starting college I have been working on it and I feel like working on groups has made it easier as well. So, I really feel like I can achieve my goal in this class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2009,"One of my goals for this class is to use what I have learned from this class and apply it to my major which is civil engineering. The ability to understand and analyze what I have learned in this class would mean that I can use different subjects in this lab and use that for civil engineering. The other goal for this class is to pass this class, so it would not slow down my college plans. To help this goal I would have to spend time studying and go over the problems to understand the subject matter and this would help me complete the work in the class. My overall goal for college is to have a career in civil engineering and this class will help me understand how physics affects the construction and the forces on a building. So understanding what I learn in this class will help me to have a career in civil engineering."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2010,My main goal right now is to simply get through my current and future classes in college. I hope to understand as much as I can from each of these classes and retain it. This class is teaching a huge concept of the world. Physics pretty much applies to everything and it would be nice to know how some things around me function. Physics also allows me to apply the knowledge (math) I learned in my previous classes. Connecting what I learn previously to something different I'm learning will help my goal of retaining as much knowledge as possible. I remember taking physics in high school but conceptually understanding it was difficult for me. This class will allow me to brush up on the old knowledge and give me another chance to understand what I couldn't a few years back. I need to continue connecting with others if I need help and spend extra time understanding all the material I am given in my classes. I know that many concepts won't be easy to comprehend
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1994,"My academic goal is to get my bachelors degree in Computer Science; interestingly enough I don't think I need a degree to do what I want to, career-wise, as a lot of the people I find career-inspiration from either don't have a degree or don't have a degree in the areas which they are working. For me, getting my B.A. is a deeply meaningful and personal goal, so I am dead-set on completing this goal.As to how I think this course could help me, there are a lot of academic opportunities that I would like to take advantage of and I think more training in lab writing and conducting research is invaluable for my competency as all of my training thus far has been done during remote learning, due to covid. I think real, hands-on training in STEM skills will make me much more capable and well-rounded as an applicant for research positions as an undergraduate."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2014,honestly I just want to pass this class I don't care if it is a C at this point. I am struggling in all my classes due to it being online and limited attempts on homework problems and professors not caring about the classes. This online learning has taught me one thing and that thing is to turn things in braindead and not really intaking any new materials. I wish everything was back in person because I hate spending hundreds of dollars on online programs that are poorly designed and just a money grabber. This class hopefully actually listens to student ideas and change them for the better. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2008,My goal is to become successful in life and enjoy working at my future job. I think this class can help me with my goals because this class shows that you will need good discipline in order to succeed which is also an important part of fundamentals in life. This class also helps with communication development with peers for future jobs because we are put into breakout rooms that make us work as a team. This is important because working with others and being able to work as a team allows us to learn and develop as a person that are going into the work force. Writing feedbacks and summary about the week’s lab helps us learn from our mistakes and allows us to review the topic that we just discussed. I think this class does a great job at preparing you for the work force and it helps me reach my goal.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2015,"As a computer science student, physics plays a big role in my major. This class is important because it helps me to understand the physics we do in real life. All of us use physics daily but we don’t realize that we are using physics or we are not aware of it. This class makes me think twice, how to use physics in my routine life. My short-term goal is to graduate and get a job as an Engineer. Being an Engineer in physics is going to be part of my career. In addition, this class will help me to gain more knowledge about the concepts of physics. After graduation, the concepts I learned from this class will be my tools to get done my work. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2016,"My biggest goal is just to graduate on time (a couple more years) and get my bachelor's degree in computer engineering.  I also hope to take some software engineering classes later on in my computer engineering degree and then become a software engineer after I finish college.  Lots of the classes I am going to be taking are pretty challenging, but with a lot of hard work put towards studying and finishing assignment plus a good amount of perseverance, I do think I can manage to finish everything.  I think taking this physics class is very useful to me in achieving my goals.  This is because physics is all about how things work and and how things interact with each other, while computer engineering focuses on these things too.  I also think that the logical thinking that is present in physics is something that will carry over very nicely into my other classes.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2020,"My goals are to work as an engineer for Disney. I am very interested in working in Amusement park design. As an electrical engineering major, this class will definitely help me learn my circuits and electricity that I would need to set up anything electrical components in the Disney parks."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2002,"My goals overall is to become an entrepreneur and a mechanical and civil engineer. I plan to work in companies like Tesla, Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc., to gain more knowledge and hands-on experience, and then branch off into my own company. I know I will need to understand how things work with one another in order to achieve and be successful in my goals. My goals for this class are to learn more about physics while also figuring out how it relates to the world around me. I also know that physics will be a key component for me since I'm double majoring in Mechanical and Civil Engineering, and this class will help me grasp the real world examples and uses of the formulas used and given to us. Even though this class is not in person, it still helps me get an early idea of things and mechanics that I will need later on in my fields of work and occupations. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1995,"My goals is to eventually graduate with a computer science degree, and this class can be helpful for building problem solving skills that might be transferable to computer science. It will also help me understand physics better because learning from just the normal physics class can be difficult, especially when I don't see real life situations of how these concepts are applicable."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,156,"My goal for the future is to work in the mechanical engineering field. Specifically, I want to work with cars because I was around cars growing up. I loved building which sparked my passion for engineering, but I fell in love with cars back in high school. After seeing videos of people bringing cars back to life, I always wanted to build a car from the ground up as well and now I’m starting to rebuild my own car back into a working state. Last year, I picked up a car that I'll be working on for a while and hopefully through this class I'll be able to understand the physics side of cars when it's time. For example performance wise, I'll be able to see how the acceleration of the car is working with different parts that I put into the car or how I can reduce the drag of the car by calculating different methods I learn in physics."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1998,My goals are to graduate from San Francisco State university getting my degree in computer science and then getting a job in Information Technology. My goal is to get into Information Technology is because I had an internship in UCSF IT and I learned a lot from the internship which made me very interested in Information Technology. But in order to achieve my goal I need to get my computer science degree. I know that physics doesn’t really relate to the goal that I want to go into to but it is a requirement that I must do in order to reach my goal. But Physics can help me better develop how to solve hard problems. I think that I have read somewhere that it is in computer hardware that needs physics and large scale coding simulations. This class can help achieve my goal is getting my requirements done for the degree in computer science.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2012,"The goals that I am hoping to accomplish this semester are to set up a schedule that would work for me to become more flexible with classes and learning to set up priorities like what should be done or any important deadlines for school. Ever since the pandemic, I believe I have been losing my interest in classes and I get distracted much more easily. This change has not been good for me since I have been losing grasp of what is important and what I should be focusing on when college is really the only thing I have going on. Many students have changed, but I believe if I set up a schedule I will feel more in control of my life and stay at a pace that will not overwhelm me so much. This class will help me with my goal because this is one of the classes I will have to make time for but I am hoping to reach out to other students whenever I need help since I believe it is easier for me to ask for help especially since I feel like I have lost the ability to socialize since I have been at home ever since the pandemic started and had no chance to go out since I lost connection with friends so I resort to group chats which make me feel more comfortable reaching out to others. There are also some other minor goals I want to achieve like learning to appreciate Physics despite having a bad time with it back in high school and learning more about it! This class has been hard at times, but the great thing is that I have classmates who can help, and you as the professor are another of the best Physics professors I had, so thank you and I hope that your class will help me grow and expand."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1999,"My goal was to simply pass this class. I do not consider physics my favorite subject to learn- it is an interesting subject but it is so challenging! The math we do in this class is simple but the actual concepts are super duper hard to grasp sometimes. However, I somehow received the highest grade (out of all my peers) during our first midterm! So, apparently, I am understanding these concepts, I have always just found it takes me longer to understand physics concepts than it does for any other subject I learn ( which I find frustrating at times). This lab section covers some pretty interesting topics, and the material explained in this lab section helps me understand the material that is explained in our lecture- but my goal for this class was simply to pass this class- after finding out my midterm grade I think my new goal is to pass the lecture portion of this class with an A!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2021,My goal is to be able to create any sort of program at my whim. I personally have times where I get caught up in certain topics for a while then won’t really move on unless I am able to fully grasp the idea of it. I think this class can help me achieve these goals in that they would help me have a better understanding of real world environments. I always enjoy playing games in  my free time and an important aspect of the video games I like to play are the physics of the world. Having some background knowledge on how physics work can help me replicate it  if I were to want to create a game as well. The process required to solve physics would definitely help in programming as well. By breaking down the problem into smaller parts then eventually putting all together is a great method in tackling coding problems.
