2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1994,"As best I can tell, tech/industry are often too efficient (to the detriment of the people; think Amazon and small business owners) and politics are often too inefficient (to the detriment of the people; think basically of all politicians). I’m a STEM major (and seeking to also study Political Economics) because I think one component of helping everyone progress / improve more equally is through the access and implementation of technology, but without the knowledge of the consequences and best ways leverage tech to raise as many people as equally as possible can have the potential to be harmful."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1995,"I didn't really know what I wanted to do for most of my k-12 experience. I only knew that I was good in the STEM field, maybe because it was the environment I grew up in or because I didn't like interpreting things. When I found Computer Science though, I fell in love instantly, and I realized that the problem solving aspects drew me in. I thought about the time when I loved puzzles, and compared how similar computer science felt to me. Programming was like creating problems for yourself, and finding ways to solve them. The amount of freedom and creativity could be endless. And that's why I love programming. It combined the ability to be creative, and the ability to problem solve. That's why I'm really passionate about computer science. And in the end, it is possible to create a product that you can be proud of, and show off."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1996,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field? When it comes to why I wanted to go into the STEM field, there were several reasons that made me do it. First, most of my family were engineers, doctors, etc including my mother so I looked up to her. Another reason was because of gaming but how did that happen? Simply I was fascinated with the graphics and the very high-speed networks needed to play online games without too much lag, so I decided that I wanted to learn more about how networks work from A to Z. In the beginning, I thought I made a mistake by going into the STEM field since I am not the best when it comes to math and physics, and I also don’t like them that much. But after spending some time on them, I found out that I can pass them even if I had a hard time. I hope that I can graduate with my bachelors’ degree, get a nice job, and continue graduate studies if it’s possible. I guess I have also made my family proud by just going into the STEM field."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1997,"My name is Karell Kouakou and I am from  Ivory Coast which is located in the west side of Africa. I decided to go into the Stem field for many reasons. In fact, since my childhood I had in mind that I will do a job that women are not used to do. In my country for example women like to work as secretary, office assistant, nurse, or teacher. From my part I am inspired by the type of work which allows me to be on the move instead of staying in one place. In addition, as I had always loved and been good at math and physique during high school, I decided then to go into the STEM field. The STEM field is also the path that will help me do the job I want. Among the numerous disciplines in engineering I chose to pursue my study in civil engineering because I have always been fascinated by the creativity used to construct big bridges."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1998,"I want to go into the stem field because I want to learn more about coding and that I want to go and get a job in the Information and Technology Field. I think this field will help me improve my skills in problem solving and to learn how the new technology works. In this field I can learn new things and that it will help better prepare me for future jobs. What made me interested in Information Technology is learning about computer parts, problem solving skills in helping customers fix their computers and getting tickets done. I think that learning how to code is pretty fun because it can make many things with code and that you can learn many coding languages. There are a lot of subjects that everyone can be interested in going into the STEM field. In this field you can interact with many things like technology and science. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1999,"I was a senior in high school when I declared my major to be Civil Engineering. At the time I was not only good but I exceed math and science classes. These subjects came easily to me. When there was a chapter that I was having trouble understanding- I loved the challenge of learning the material. I didn't get frustrated when I was having a hard time solving a problem instead I loved the challenge. Also, I hated writing essays... but I knew I wanted to do something that included math and science. I did some research and stumbled upon the idea of majoring in engineering and I was up for the challenge! Eventually, the math and science classes got harder and life got in the way a little bit but I am slowly finding my way back to my passion of learning and sitting with a difficult problem. My mother and father were beyond proud and felt extreme pride that their oldest daughter was studying to become an engineer. Personally, I want to go into the STEM field because there are many advantages. The pay is good. There is great job security. I think it's kind of a flex. And most importantly I find what I am studying to be extremely intriguing. There is a lot I can do with a Civil Engineering degree. I can travel to different states or countries if I found the right job. I am not sitting at a desk all day. My job sites will change constantly. I won't be doing the same thing every single day. There is an excitement about becoming a civil engineer in many aspects. I have also found a great group of women that support each other in this male-dominated field. Really this major has already evolved me into a better person all around and I could not be more thankful for who I am today. And I could not be more excited for my first internship, when the time comes! "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2000,"""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?"", this is a question that I asked myself when I was choosing my major. I chose computer science because I have a parent that work in that field and he seems to enjoy and I have heard STEM field jobs has a good salary. I wanted to go into STEM field because I was good at math but when I first did a computer science class, it kind of clicked to me easily, but maybe that was just the beginning. I was always better at math and science compared to history and English classes. Since STEM jobs have good salary I would also be happy that I can support myself."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2001,"I want to go into the STEM field because it has subjects that I actually enjoy and would like to learn more about. I am majoring in Biology Concentration in Physiology because I like learning about the human body. I particularly enjoy understanding the why and how of things, which was always my struggle in Math and Science classes with teachers that emphasized memorization rather than understanding. I can't grasp a subject or if I don't know the WHY. In the STEM field though I have found that a lot of the way things are taught and learned focus more on Why and providing explanations; this intrigued me even more because that is exactly why and how I like to learn about the world. Since coming to college I have come to enjoy the STEM field even more than before because now I’m surrounded with more people who prefer comprehension to just memorizing; I feel like I’m the right place to be for who I am and what I am choosing to study and be."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2002,"Growing up, I was raised by my mother and Bibi (Swahili for grandmother) for the most pivotal parts of my childhood. They did not want me to grow up thinking that all I was meant to do was fulfill the woman stereotype. As an African-American daughter of a teenage mother, they did not want me thinking all I was meant for in life was to be a mother and caretaker that only knew how to cook, clean, cater to a man, and take care of kids. So in third grade as a birthday gift, my Bibi got me a set of the small Legos, and I fell in love with building things. After years of playing with Legos, I decided I wanted to be a Mechanical Engineer, and after taking ENGR 100, I decided to add Civil Engineering. I want to break stereotypes while making the world a better and more productive place. I want little girls and even my peers to look up to me and be like, “Wow, we can do it too, nothing is going to keep us down.”I want to change the world, and I’m using this as my first stepping stone. I plan to change a lot of things and hope I get to help make these changes soon."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2003,"The reason I want to go into the STEM field is because it is an amazing topic for me, especially the electronic and computers parts. Ever since I was little I would always be fascinated by how technology works, I would always ask my dad to let me use his phone just to mess with it. It would always be the phone at first but then one day he had brought back a computer that allowed me to run programs. I would always use it just to type and draw on an empty document on the desktop. I found it fun how it would work and I was able to write and draw without any pencil or markers. Over time, I started wondering how this all works and how it all comes along. As a high schooler I took my first computer science class and I found it really interesting being able to create a small game or a website that allowed people to check out the ratings of certain movies. This made me even more interested to push my coding knowledge into college and make it into something I want to do for the rest of my life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2004,"For as long as I could remember, I've always wanted to follow my dad's footsteps in becoming a successful Electrical Engineer. The primary reason was because Engineering consisted of my favorite subject which was physics. When I was in high school, I would always get eager to gain more knowledge about physics since it strengthened my critical thinking and problem solving skills which were the core of being a successful electrical engineer. As I matured, I started accompanying my dad to the power plant he worked in. My eyes were always amazed by the flow of electricity and specific organization of complex circuit breakers in the plant. These were real life examples of the physics lessons that I took in school. I always tried to explore my school subjects even more such as Biology and Chemistry; however, my heart always went back to my day one passion: Physics. Kids at school found joy playing games and goofing around but my source of euphoria was always circled around discovering new theorems and studies in physics. It was indeed a no brainer when I started submitting my college applications and decided majoring in Electrical Engineering. If I could repeat it all over again, I would also choose my major in a heartbeat since it all revolves around physics."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2005,"I want to go into the STEM field because I really want to make video games. And in order to make them I need to learn software development. Whether I want to create my own game engine or not. I decided to go for a computer science degree because I feel that it would go hand in hand with software development within the gaming industry. Needing to know hardware, software, programming, and if you're artistic as well 3d modeling, along with animation. I'm not the most artistic person so I more of the person who is interested in programming, more specifically gameplay mechanics. A lot of the video games that come out today seem to have very little unique mechanics, or very many generic mechanics that have been in every other video game that has released already. I don't really have many places I wouldn't want to work for in the industry, (except for Activision) but I wouldn't mind working with a small team making our very own unique game or if I work on a giant team at a AAA development studio. All I really want to do in the field is make fun, exciting, immersive, and enjoyable games that don't try to manipulate their playerbase."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2006,"I like stem major because of the number of opportunities available after graduation. There are many  field of studies and job titles. Also, these jobs are always in high demand. One can work remotely for a company located away or even out of state. That being said, I do not need to be present to work . The job itself can be done remotely. There are many applications where it facilitates to work as group. These applications allowed you to collaborate and share files among a team of developers. For managers, it allows you to manage and assign task to employees.  Mostly, the technology improve every 18 months and one must always maintain peace  by learning the new content. The bad about stem jobs is that what you learned in the past might be absolute  every 2 years. As an example, new programming languages are developed often and one must be kept up to date."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2007,"As the question “Why do I want to go into the STEM field? “arises in my head, I began to really ponder upon this. Personally, so far, I believe my family members helped me decide to take my step into the STEM field. Family members were the ones who initiated it and I am the one who committed to it. The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is because my overall love for computers, I love to work with them, haven’t been bored of it, yet! I want to be the first person out of my whole family to be majoring in a computer field. Be something new and different. I want to be something different and not follow the same path as others, I know it sounds weird, but I am all for it. I am very excited and how this journey will go. Sometimes a different approach is what we need i believe.  				 			 		"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2008,"I want to go into the STEM field because I think that it would help me get a good job in the future. I have also been intrigued in mathematics and science at a young age. One of my other influences would be my father because he works as a programmer, and I also want to become a computer science major like him. I also heard that STEM majors graduates are very successful and have many job opportunities within their field and I would want a stable life and income in the future like them. A goal of mine in the future is to be able to create my own app and I believe that being in the STEM field would help me achieve that. Hopefully being in the STEM field will help me get internships and more opportunities to expand my knowledge. I personally feel like I fit the STEM field because I grew up around technology and I genuinely enjoy being in the community."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,156,"I chose to go into the STEM field because I wanted to do something different amongst my family. I was stuck in between choosing to be an engineer or be involved in the medical field. Majority of my family members are involved in the medical field, so I had hopes in that. But, as I grew up I loved math and that helped me decided what route to take. I chose mechanical engineering because I loved building things and had an interest in cars even when I was a kid. Even in school, I tried to be involved with STEM related activities because it had always interested me. Working with cars specifically made me decide to switch to mechanical engineering and pursue that as a career goal. The STEM field has many opportunities for people to choose from and it wasn't difficult finding what to do. I could've been a nurse instead, but I chose to go into the STEM field because I feel like I can be happy with the end result."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2009,"The reason why I wanted to join the STEM field was that I had a passion for creating things and understanding how things work. When I was in elementary school, I would always play in the sandpit and create dams or structures from the sand. Later in life, they would still be creating things from paper or cardboard and fixing things around the house. My passion for building things has stuck with me as I grew up and this passion aligned with STEM. I decided on majoring in civil engineering because of my passion for creating things and especially working on things like the infrastructure of roads, pipes, bridges, etc. This is because I found the projects that are about infrastructure interesting, especially projects like bridges and dams because these were things that I have always liked to build and read about. These are the reasons why I wanted to be in the STEM field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2010,"I want to go into the STEM field because computers always interested me. Back in middle school and early high school, I didn't know what I wanted to do. I always put that question of ""what I wanted to do with my future?"" aside. As time quickly flew and I was pressured to make the decision I had to look at my interests. Computers always fascinated me as a kid and I was always curious about coding. That's when I decided to explore the world of coding and I enjoyed it a lot. It was cool to make computers do things I wanted them to do by pressing in some commands from my keyboard. While I couldn't make it do complicated things, I liked it and wanted to do more with it. There are so many coding languages to explore and it feels like I can endlessly improve my skills. It's amazing to think that the languages I'm learning to use are the same ones others used to create all these well-known programs and games I use. This just shows that there's so much I could accomplish with time and effort."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2011,"I want to enter the STEM field because I have always had a strong affinity for computers and video games. This leads me to major in computer science. Through this, I've learned that I do enjoy working with computers and writing code. Because of this, I would definitely want to make a career out of the hobbies that I like so much. And another reason why I looked into this field compared to the others is because of the rising demand for people with computer science skills. Through this, I will be able to possibly secure myself a really good job with a good future ahead of me. Money aside, I would want a career that I would enjoy which I would be able to achieve through this major. I could get into a job concerning video games and or working with computers at a company that involves gaming and such."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2012,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field? I never really thought about this question much but I never thought I would go into a major that is considered a part of STEM when entering college. To be completely honest, I came in as a Psychology major and switched into the major I have now been working hard for which is Biology with a concentration in Physiology. My father has always loved Biology, and I think because of him I decided to switch into something that he loved and hopefully being able to complete what he never was able to accomplish himself, but I believe that with a career in Biology I will be able to have a successful future like going into a medical school and working as a doctor or perhaps working in a laboratory. I have a sort of love-hate relationship with the courses I had taken; keep in mind there are a lot of requirements for this major pf course but throughout the years, I have started to like certain things about the classes I have taken. This has been so difficult to follow through and yes, there are times I feel like giving up and going into an easier career but I need to keep in mind that this will come with amazing awards. I still have more to go, but I know I will learn more and maybe my love for this major will grow: it is a lot of hard work to put into this major and it means I haven’t been able to go out with friends, but I believe I will graduate despite the bumpy road ahead, besides, I have a brother who is also the same major as I am so I want to show him that he can do it too because we go to the same campus as well! I want to be there for him and hopefully, he loves what he does in the future!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2013,"I want to go into the STEM field because ever since I was little, I heard from my parents I should learn to become a engineer, and it just happens that engineering was a part of the STEM field. Yeah, that's right, I, along with my parents, didn't know that engineering was a part of the STEM field until a little while later in life. When I was young, I enjoyed math so I learned to my parents when it came to my career, which was in the STEM field. As I got older, I learned that being in STEM field means being a part of a community that is for the purpose of helping other people and bettering society. I want to be a part of something that is bigger than me, that's why I chose to go into the STEM field, I want to improve how everyone lives and helping other people because I want to see people enjoying life, not struggling to get through it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2014,I want to go into the STEM field because I want to earn money for my parents so they can rest easy when they are old. I also like STEM because that will be the future of our generation and many more to come. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2015,"After I graduated high school, I wanted to go to Engineering school at our University back home in Djibouti. But in my country, we only have one University and to get into the Engineering department was very competitive, you must be very sharp at school, unfortunately, I was not that kid. In addition, I did not want to study other majors. So, I didn’t get into Engineering school but that did not stop me. I applied abroad to study and I get accepted to one of the universities in the USA. When, I came to the US, I met an advisor and explained to me what’s computer science and I was so fascinated about computer science because it was something that did not exist in my country. I knew in Djibouti we are very behind when it comes to technology compared to other countries. The reason I’m studying computer science is to go back to my country and share my knowledge with others. I know there are a lot of African talented people in my country but don’t have resources to access so, I want to be the resources, and teach my people about the STEM field. So we can share something in common with the world. That’s my motive to be in the STEM field and I honestly enjoy the journey of learning new chapters in every class. It’s a challenging field but the journey is amazing. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2016,"I am currently majoring in computer engineering.  I decided to major in computer engineering because I am very interested in computers and tech in general.  I enjoy reading about new computer applications and their capabilities.  I also like to read about new tech startups and what they are trying to accomplish.  I was lucky enough to work in a tech startup as a marketing intern last year.  I learned a lot and got to write some really interesting articles.  I am currently in a couple different computer programming classes and am really enjoying them so far.  I also took a few different computer programming classes a few semesters back and enjoyed those as well.  I like that engineers solve problems and build things.  I also like the versatility that comes with being a computer engineer.  After completing my degree, I can try working with software, hardware, or both.  However, I do hope to work in software development after graduating.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2017,I want to go into the STEM field because I want to build and improve the world around me. When I worked in construction I always found it really rewarding to be able to see the different houses I worked on when driving around because its nice to be able to see the the product of your work in a really physical way. I plan to get my degree in civil engineering so that I can help build the buildings around us safe and hopefully do my small bit to decrease the housing shortage that is such a prevalent problem in the bay area. Particularly with the condo collapse in Florida this highlights the need for good civil engineering and what can go wrong when we build massive developments without taking the proper steps to keep buildings safe. Also I really enjoy engineering and I don't want to have to do a job that I hate and waste 40 hours of my life every week.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2018,"The reason I want to go into the STEM field is because through grade school to high school, the subjects I enjoyed were mainly math and engineering. Although I am not too into science, I know it coincides a lot with the career path I want to take which is the path of becoming an electrical engineer. The reason why I dove into this decision was mainly because of my experience in my engineering classes in high school. Since I was already doing fine in math, engineering seemed like such a fun class compared to my other classes. I got to plan projects, design, code, build, and even control robots. I realized that engineering is much more than putting on a uniform and doing as you are told. You are basically the CEO with your own thought process and ideas that can be the next biggest necessity that companies or society will need."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2019,"As I'm starting to reach the upper division classes in the stem field, I keep having to remind myself why I took an interest in this field. While the classes are getting harder, there is a goal in mind. I want to help people, there are so many different ways that people can be helped. The way I'd like to contribute would be through medicine. I want to make medicine more accessible for those who need it most or have a hard time obtaining it. Medicine can be very expensive but for some it is a necessity. For people who need insulin, they can not live without the hormone in their life. As such, we need to find a better way to either reduce the cost of medicine or improve the accessibility of it which will be something that I can strive for as I remind myself why I want to go into the stem field. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2020,"I want to go into the stem field because it is on the path to my dream job. Since I was little I always wanted to work at an amusement park and help design the park and rides. My ultimate goal is to work for Disney as an imagineer. Being an engineer means I need to go into the stem field, another reason for going into the stem field is because I am very good at math and science. Also studies like psychology or lots of writing bore me. At Disney I am hoping to use my engineering skills and creativity to bring new life to the park and stay up to date with what is popular. In the end I would like to join the imagineering hall of fame. As of now I believe their is only about 37 people in the imagineer hall of fame. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2021,"I want to go into the STEM field personally. I always had found new technology fascinating, watching how  things worked was fascinating to me and sometime I would try to recreate it myself. I love having the ability to create something, and is why I chose to follow Computer Science. I believe programming allows me to create something from nothing. Sometimes when I see something interesting I dive into a rabbit hole. I start somewhere and I wind up somewhere else because somehow they all build on each other. I'm pursuing a career in coding because It feels like it's never ending. There is always something new I have yet to see. There also the fact there is never one solution to a problem, I like how many different ways you can approach something and still end up with a solution. There is always something to do, and that’s why i'm pursuing STEM it keeps me busy with something and it doesn't hold me down with the various path I can take. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,175,"I want to go into the STEM field because I have always enjoyed math and physics, and find the material very interesting.  Furthermore, I have always enjoyed working with my hands, specifically with engines.  I was working as a mechanic for a few years and decided to go back to school, and it clicked with my that Mech Engineering would be the best path for me.  The material is right up my alley for what I want to learn and do post graduation.  It also doesn't hurt that engineering jobs pay pretty well compared to other degrees right out of college, and that was another incentive to go into engineering.  I was previously at the Cal Maritime Academy for two semesters, and while the school was not a good fit for me, I got to spend a bunch of time exploring the engine room of the Golden Bear, and immediately knew that Mech Engineering was right for me, as it was a gear-heads dream."
