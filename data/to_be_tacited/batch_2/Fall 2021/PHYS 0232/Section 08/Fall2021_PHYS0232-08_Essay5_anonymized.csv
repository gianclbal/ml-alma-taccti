2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2008,"My greatest take away from this class is that your experiments can turn out much different than you predictions. Doing lab has made me realize that collecting data and actually doing the experiment can be different. Not all experiments turn out perfect so that’s why we do multiple of them so we can get a better understanding. Whenever your experiment fails, it doesn’t mean it is a bad thing, but it could be a learning process and collecting the data to see if it is true. So failure in science doesn’t always mean bad because most of your experiments won’t turn out perfectly. Playing with simulations also helps in finding out your answer because it is great to see a visual representation of what is going on with the magnets, currents, electrons, and magnetic field. The labs with the simulations are usually the best and more fun compared to the other ones.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2014,"I being in this class made me dislike physics more, there is no motivation to any sort of work all I see are Fs in my gradebook that is the worse and most demotivating thing a student attending online classes can feel. I do not ever want to take this again is what made me takeaway from this class. most times I'd rather focus on my other classes instead of this. I just wanted to have classes like this in person so there could be more engagement and exploration with hands on experience which in my opinion is very crucial to the students because we see things like this and know and build from these experiences. sure we had some DIY projects and labs too but those did not feel the same yeah sure we just follow the guideline but there is no actual supervision that can help us with making it and showing us if we are doing something wrong. I just wish classes like this was in person and not online, I wish everything was back to normal so I can actually learn. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2018,"My greatest takeaway from this class was that critical thinking and making predictions on what may happen is a great way to learn. Many of the labs had us try to predict what would happen before beginning the experiment. Depending on whether our predictions were correct, we would then think to ourselves why our predictions were right or wrong. This helped develop a way of thinking that does not just try to lead to the answer but why we got to the answer. In addition, it creates a thought process that is very versatile and can be used in all aspects of my college education or even my daily life. It helps breaking down even what may seem so simple, into a concept more complex and that can be well defined. As a future electrical engineer, I am sure this takeaway will be very useful in my potential future career."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2019,"Before taking this class I think I was very afraid. I was afraid of the concept in general but also the math, formulas, and non contact learning that this class would apply throughout the semester. After more than halfway through the course I can happily say that I am much more confident in the approach that this class took as well as its takeaways which I will be applying to other classes that give me difficulties. The take away which I found most helpful in this class was although equations and formulas might be a very valuable tool to use when they are easily available, if specific equations do not come to mind it should not be something to stress over. I found this helpful because in many cases when I could not remember an equation given to me, I could still solve the problem by using an equation which I did remember and isolating for a variable that might be included in that formula instead. This has helped me to see problems from more than one perspective and use that as a way of solving other problems in the future. This played a role  in our portion of the class where we were expected to use coding programs. By using coding programs which I had never used before, I was still able to apply what I knew in order to translate a language that I had never worked with before.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,175,"I would say that my greatest take away from this class is a genuine understanding about how electricity works.  Electricity had always been a mystery to me, despite doing my fair share of basic wiring around the house.  I understood very vague concepts that I had heard, such as ""electricity flows like water"" and I knew that having a ground was a necessity, but I couldn't explain why.  This class has really helped solidify my knowledge about how electricity works, why it does what it does, and how the majority of the world uses electricity.  Little things like flipping a breaker in our apartment, which happens frequently due to the old wiring, or diagnosing electrical issues with cars makes so much more sense.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2002,"My greatest take away will be that I learned how physics is related to everything. I'm not sure how much physics I will use directly in my furture fields, but this class helped me gain a new perspective on how things work, which will be very helpful when I make things later on. It also gave me a bit of coding experience that will help be further my toolkit of abilities I know how to do."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2013,I think my greatest take away from this class was that the lectures that are in the beginning of the lab are really important and helpful. At the beginning of all the lab there is a mini lecture that summarized the important parts of what we learnt in the lecture or what we should have learnt during the lecture time. These lectures was helpful to getting a better idea of the material we learning by using real life examples and how the theories and ideas of what we're learning can be implied in real life situations. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2006,"My greatest take away from this class is to be able to review the content I learned in the main section class. This class offers more of an experimental hands on and it makes it so much easier to understand it. The class really offers an outside book context and allows me to better conceptualize the material. A con about this class is that adds more work load on top of the main lecture class. Theres so much work to do that it gets very overwhelming. Nonetheless, the class is very manageable and the labs can be done at most in 2 hours.  A good feedback to this class is to make more visual exampled to better conceptualize the material contents. Other than that, this class comes very handy as a lab course for this physics course. The class structure is very similar to the prior physics lab course.Yet, is better than not having a lab class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2011,"I would say that the biggest takeaway from this class is that I should work through problems many times so that I can get a clearer look at them. I say this because sometimes in my lectures some of the information I get goes over my head and I can't seem to grasp the understanding of them. Then from this class, we were able to work through some of the equations mentioned in the lectures. Through that, I was able to learn more about those equations and was able to learn more in that way. The next thing was that most of the labs were hands-on, which also helped a lot. They helped because I was able to see how some of the physics stuff worked by using stuff at my house which was also a really big help. Lastly, the lab sessions I went to would also sometimes go over some of the lecture topics which is a big help because my lectures are all pre-recorded so it's good to see a live lecture regarding those topics."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2012,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that there will always be work to do, especially when trying to be flexible with what schedule people may have academically and their own personal life which can require people to take breaks so as to not be overwhelmed with school. No matter what anyone does, there will be times when breaks will be required since students can become burnt out; while school is very important, it is important to take a break because focusing so much on classes can cause students to feel overwhelmed and can exhaust students, therefore, it's always important to take small breaks when needed. I would also like to take away that even though it is extremely hard for me to stay focused at home and be able to push my assignments out, it’s important to keep in mind why I do this and that people believe in me to finish so I guess this class taught me perseverance, to be flexible and work with whatever situation is presented despite the challenges. I know I could have done better, tried harder but it’s better to move forward and do an even better job next semester than moping around, I guess just rolling with what you got."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2015,"What was my greatest takeaway from this class\ My biggest takeaway from this course was the labs because labs were everything I learned was really applicable to my everyday life. It was not like other classes that I took throughout my years of schooling where I rarely saw any real-life applicable. In addition, this class helped me in my other physic class because it helps me to go deep into the lecture. We use physics daily but a lot of people are not aware of that but this class open my eyes and just think about it sometimes. That is when you know a class is valuable and the knowledge gained is important. I now can see the importance of physics in my daily life. After taking this course, I truly feel like that I can make an experiment outside of the course. Finally, I really enjoyed the course, I thought it was going to be hard labs but they were all fine. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1996,"I learned a lot from this class and in many ways. The experiments we made helped me understand concepts that I never understood in books or pdf’s. Furthermore, I began learning the use of what we take in the lab in our daily lives. It also helped me in the main physics class which was pretty clutch for me personally. Working with simulators was the best part about this class and I don’t think that I could’ve done what I did in this class without those simulators. They were always there to help me understand the concepts more than I usually do. Finally, the professor’s help was a massive reason as to everything I have done in this class and I can’t thank her enough for everything I really appreciate it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2000,This lab/class has been an interesting one but challenging at the same time. There is a lot info to take in. I think what I found the most interesting is how electric and magnetic field works. What surprised me the most was when coil of wire was wrapped around a nail and that nail became magnetic. I think physics is such a hard subject but it is really informative and gives everyone a more understanding thing about physical life and how things works. There are so many concepts and theories in physics and that is amazing but it is hard to get all the information in the long term. I was always interested in magnets as well because there is the force where they do not stick together and just repel off each other. So far from week 1 to present has given me a lot of information and thoughts about how physics can be really useful for life.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2001,"My greatest takeaway from this class has been the way that physics applies to daily life. I always find it difficult to understand Physics or Math concepts because I learn better when I understand HOW and WHY a formula or Physics concepts works rather than just memorizing it. So, to me, it's been very useful to learn about the everyday applications some concepts how.For example, and I know I've talked about it alot, but the way currents and circuits work in a house. You never really think of something like the electricity system in your house, not even when it's broken because you just want it fixed again. YET, it was really cool to learn what kind of circuit system a house uses and why it's the most efficient system to be built in. Being able to apply the knowledge to a real scenario really helped me grasp it, so that's why I see real life applications as my biggest takeaway; because they have helped me learn and enjoy Physics better."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2004,"My relation with Physics has been an awesome journey throughout highschool and continuing on to college. I have been relatively on top of it from day one being able to get assignments done on time and grasping the concept properly. I have always found Physics as a fun and interesting subject for me to learn. I consistently try to further my knowledge by researching more about the topic we’re talking about in class and how it actually works in real life. From past experience with Physics classes teachers usually make us read off the book which is not very useful in my opinion. However, this class has been a whole other experience to me, every assignment that i've completed has actually helped me understand how it works in real life and not only theoretically. In addition, the stimulation given has been of great help as well since it gave us scenarios that make us visualize the concept. As a final thought, this class has developed my physics skills to another level and made me a visual and creative person."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2003,"One of my greatest take aways from this class is being able to use electric currents and how they work with the wiring and batteries. The simulation really helped because I was able to see how the currents are moving in the circuit, and being able to even it out the way it's needed to be. Another one of my take aways is being able to work with group mates. This was really helpful for me because I was able to practice working with other people and getting the right skills for other tasks. This comes really helpful with my job because I work with other employees and sometimes communicating comes in handy to be able to do my work correctly. Finally, this is also helpful for my group projects in my other class because we are able to split up the work evenly with each other and no one is left out."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2017,My greatest takeaway from this class is the material and knowledge that I gained about electromagnetism. This knowledge will help me in the future with engineering and also in non work related things it is useful to know the material in this class particularly with circuits. I will try using knowledge learned in this class to help build an electric skateboard over the winter break. I can see many times in the future where I will use things I learned in this class. Besides that I think online classes also made me a lot more adaptable since doing labs online is less than ideal.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1997,"My greatest take away of this class can be divided into many groups. First of all, this class taught me how to write a good lab report. In fact, I already took a class where I had to do some lab reports but I was not really good at it since It was my first time and I was really scared. Then this class of physics 232 came up and I was then more confident doing lab reports. Secondly, the way our teacher explains the different lab subjects we do is really helpful. In fact, she makes us go through a PowerPoint that has some explanations about the topic we are going to do in the lab before starting the lab itself. That really helps me understand the lab better. Also, the teacher is always willing to come back on a material you do not understand. Finally, the fact that we do the lab in a group is really helpful. Since we do not do in person class, being in a group helps interact with each other."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2007,"My greatest take away from this class is i believe being able to communicate with your fellow classmates and just being able to overall learn more about physics. I come to class every day and I believe that the energy from both student and professor are at the same level. It has taught me to always keep things straight and nothing is possible without proper communication. It also has taught me time management, being able to finish things on time was great, and knowing when things are do was also great. Just overall being able to grow as a person and adult, this class had done it. Being able to connect physics to reality, this class had done it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2005,"The greatest takeaway from this class is that you actually like to teach your material unlike the professor for my main physics course related to the lab. It's getting a little hard to do the material from the regular course because of the lack of actual teaching in my main physics course. Especially the simulation labs because those show the material better than my professor follows along with her 4th-grade level guided notes. Which I can't thank you enough for because literally, this lab makes some topics that my teacher does go over on her guided notes make sense. Otherwise, the regular class goes over topics this lab class does not, and some concepts are significantly harder and more confusing, and without a teacher teaching that makes these concepts even harder to stick and comprehend. In short for this reflection thank you for your hard work as a teacher."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2009,"One of the things that I will take away from this class is the knowledge of physics in electromagnetism. Some examples would be learning how magnets work, currents in wires, and other things related to electromagnetism. Although I won’t be using much of what I learned in this class because it’s not really related to my major, it is still nice to know these things. Another thing that I took away from this class was how to work with others in an online environment. This is important since more work is being done online since the pandemic."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1998,The greatest take away from this class is that I am actually learning more from this class unlike my main course for physics because I am not learning anything from that class. This class teaches about a lot of things and that we actually do simulations that help us understand the topic even more because we are seeing how physics works in our everyday life and how it affects the things around us. The professor actually interacts with us and makes sure that we get our assignments submitted on time unlike our main course physics teacher which I am really grateful to have a good professor like this. This class overall is my most enjoyable because we did a lot of things in class together and to understand the topics at hand which made the class experience better. I learned a lot in this class and it taught me things that I did not understand from the other physics class. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2010,"The greatest takeaway from this class for me is seeing how the concepts I learn in math are being applied in other areas such as physics. I was originally just learning equations and formulas to plug in without understanding what I'm actually calculating/solving. I also learned about how exactly the concepts such as energy and forces work in our world. Physics is something we see every day and the interesting reactions seem normal to me. However, when you take a deeper look into what is actually happening, it can get more complex than it appears to be. For example, seeing how charges attract or repel each other is something we accept because we've seen it many times. However, when you look at how these charges are interacting and how they can be transferred, it is much more mesmerizing to witness. This is especially true when you can make a less common object known for charges such as tape exhibit repulsion and attraion."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2016,"I think this class has given me a greater grasp of the physics concepts I learned from my last physics class and taught me some new physics concepts as well.  I took physics I in the summer and I learned a lot, but I have probably learned more in this class.  This is probably because this class doesn't have a condensed schedule, like the summer class did, so I have a lot more time to absorb the material that I'm learning.  I also took a chemistry class in my first semester, which I learned a lot from too.  This physics lab class along with the lecture portion of this class were great for learning more about physics, something that I am sure will be useful to me later on in my degree and beyond.  I am majoring in Computer Engineering so physics concepts are definitely going to be showing up in my electrical engineering classes that I will be taking in the near future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,2020,I would say everything is an amazing take away from this class. Being able to see the materials I am learning through experimentation is extremely helpful and allows me to understand the material. The biggest take away for me is understanding how current and voltage flows through circuits in series and in parallel. If it weren't for these labs I would have never completely understood how this worked.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,156,"Being in the Phys 230 class that is asynchronous, having this lab is quite helpful because I'm able to learn better than just watching the video lectures. So my greatest take away from this class is the whole class because I was able to understand physics with calculus two through this class. There isn't much to say, but I would say that if I were in a different Phys 232 class, I wouldn't be too sure if I was able to pass Phys 230."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,8,1999,"My greatest takeaway from this class was how beautiful physics actually is! Whenever the question, ""Why do you want to take this course/ Why do you want to learn physics"", gets asked in a high school physics class, physics 1, or even at the beginning of this course, - most students answers are ""Because I want to learn how the universe works"". And that is a valid answer but I mean we learn about gravity and energy transfers most in high school physics and in physics 1- but in this course, we really widen our depth of understanding of physics. When Professor Grigorescu was teaching this course she had said some really beautiful one-liners when connecting what we are learning to the basics of nature. An example would be ""Nature is naturally lazy"". I am not sure anyone else appreciated or caught these one-liners but they were beautiful! And now I am heavily considering minoring in physics specifically because of how beautifully Professor Grigorescu taught this course. "
