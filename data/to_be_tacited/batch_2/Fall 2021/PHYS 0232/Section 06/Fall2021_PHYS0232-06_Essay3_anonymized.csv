2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1966,"""How do opposite charges act when they are in the same enclosed space?""When you place two opposite charges (one being positive and one being negative) in the same enclosed space, they will behave in a certain way. For example, the simulation that we have done in class with short circuits, flux, Gauss's law, and charge have all been prime examples of how two opposite charges behaved when placed in a certain range of one another. In the simulation, when we places two charges in a close enough distance and turned on the vector setting you could clearly see that the two charges would attract one another if oppositely charged. If the two charges were the charged the same ([positive with positive and negative with negative) then the two charges would repel one another shown to use again by the vector pointing in opposite directions of one another. This is beneficial to society as we have been able to construct all sorts of new technology with repulsive forces and attracting ones as well. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1958,"I've noticed that the outlets in my house are wired in series, and when changing out a wall outlet, and when done wrong, many bedrooms lost electricity but not all. Why is that?I suppose the reason behind this was explored in last weeks ""short circuit"" lab. When looking at the fuse box, not every single room has its own dedicated circuit, but rather there was one labeled ""Bedrooms"". So by incorrectly wiring one outlet in the middle of the chain of bedrooms, everything after that circuit was disconnected. The purpose of this is, if one fuse blows due to an electrical surge or other strain on the system, you don't damage all the electronics in the house. Only the ones on that circuit. So by minimizing the amount of rooms on one circuit, you are better protecting the house as a whole by also minimizing damages in the event of a system failure."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1969,"How do we know there are two types of charge?Multiple theories of charge have been tested. Based on experiments testing the attraction and repulsion, charged objects can both attract each other and repel each other depending on whether they're the same or different type of charge. from this, it's clear that there's at least 2 types of charge, positive and negative."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1956,"""What is charge in electricity and why does that matter for everyday life?""Electric charge is a form of electricity that is determined by two states, positive and negative. A state of charge is important to know and study because everything that is electronic is running off of electricity. Engineers and electricians have the power to use the science behind electrical charges to utilize its unique abilities and integrate them into today's technology. Charges of electricity is just the basic foundation behind a bunch of other doors regarding the knowledge of electricity. Knowing charges is crucial due to the fact that it plays a huge role when it comes to learning circuits and actually building one. Just like this laptop that I am typing on or a TV or a battery operated remote has a set of charges behind it as a power supply. Not only does it act as a power supply, but having to know charges is also crucial for keeping a circuit balanced and stabilized so that it may work as efficient as possible."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1973,"After learning about wavelengths, I became interested in learning on how a wavelength impacts our day to day life. The Types of wavelengths that interfere with our day to day lives are phones, radio, microwave etc. These spectra of Em waves travel at the speed of light. After doing my research on phone wavelengths I figured that cellphones are what interfere in several people's lives and wanted to look for more information regarding it. To connect with cell towers, mobile phones employ radio waves with wavelengths of around 10-1000 m, which are much too long to be ionizing. WiFi runs at very specific frequencies, either 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz, which correspond to wavelengths of 12 cm or 6 cm, respectively.  It has been discovered  that All device manufacturers advise that cell phones should be at least 5 millimeters, or about ¼ of an inch away from your body or brain, since they can cause health effects due to the radiation it has. Cell phones emit radiation in the radiofrequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum The human body does absorb energy from devices that emit radiofrequency radiation."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1974,"How important is it for people to know about short circuits? I would say it is really important because short circuits are liable to cause fires and electrical burns. The most dangerous part of a short circuit is that it causes a sudden change in electrical resistance. An electrical system can cause a large amount of resistance and constantly sends electricity to different areas when outlets are being used or home appliances are plugged in. During a short circuit, there is a spontaneous change in the direction that the current is traveling and the resistance will drop to a much lower level than before, causing the electrical flow to increase sharply and carry a massive volume of unrestricted current through an unexpected path. This can cause a bodily harm to those who are using electrical appliances when a short circuit is happening, also, it can cause a structural damage to your home through the fires and burns.Therefore, I believe if people would know about short circuits, they would be able to prevent the short circuits from happening, and any damages that it can bring."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1961,"We talked about Electric Fields in the first few weeks of class and throughout the lectures and lab it seems like a recurring topic. In physics 232 we have seen electric fields pop up in two labs with simulations so far. I guess a question I have is how electric fields act in other places in the universe. For starters, how does an electric field work in a black hole? Is the electric field somehow warped since black holes continue to defy what we know about the universe itself? "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1967,"A concept that I learned in class was about circuits and how they work. A question that I have about circuits that I am still a little confused about is why does the shape of a surface or object affect the circuit that goes through it? Through looking at notes and the lab, the current and resistance directly affect the voltage of a circuit. This can be summed up by Ohm's Law, which is where the current multiplied by the resistance equals the voltage. The current is the rate of flow of charge, the voltage is the potential difference, and the resistance is something that is dependent on the geometry and the material of an object."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1963,"What is the rate of which electrical energy is exhausted when energy is being used to power something in a circuit. This might be applicable to people's lives because it would help create a better understanding of how long the battery should last for something. It is understood that some applications/things take up more power than others, but having a formula or at least understanding how much energy flows out of systems that utilize electrical energy such as batteries. Understanding current and how charges flow through conductors is beneficial to know about, however I know that the longer a battery exhausts, it will eventually run out of juice. I would like to know how depleting and recharging electrical batteries that have charges is calculated to know how long it takes to perform each of the tasks."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1964,"How can we relate Ohm’s law to more intuitive concepts?Ohm’s law says that amperage, voltage, and resistance are all related. As you increase voltage and leave resistance constant for example, you increase the amperage running through the circuit. This is defined by the equation I =V/R where I is amps, V is voltage, and R is resistance. This might feel at first to a student like something that must simply be memorized, but that’s not a very satisfying thought. Something so integral to the systems we interact with every day, and the powered world that surrounds us should not be mysterious. Instead of mystery, it may be helpful to think of Ohm’s law in a metaphorical fashion. Instead of electricity, what if we think about it in terms of liquid moving through a pipe?In our pipe metaphor, amperage becomes the amount of liquid flowing through the pipe, voltage becomes the pressure moving the liquid forward, and resistance can be thought of as the slope up or down of the pipe. Thinking of it this way, one can see why increasing the pressure while leaving the pipe where it is would make more liquid flow through it. This more intuitive metaphor may help students in their studies."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1950,The topic that Im choosing to talk about how important a closed circuit in needed to create a electric current flow. From the experiment with the battery and the aluminum wires we were able to simply learn how create a closed court in order to create power/energy. I believe to learn this is important to peoples lives because it shows to to create power with simple household items. From learning about closed circuits you can experiment with wires and actual real live situations that where if you ever lost energy or power you can create and electric current. The first real life situation that comes to mind is if anyone wanted to jump a car because they lost battery power. The person would need to know that you need to connect the jumper cables to the car a power source in order to create a closed current and the electrical current can flow from the energy source to the car. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1957,"I want to talk about Charges. What do Charges got to do with Electricity?There are many types of Charges. There is positive, negative, and neutral. When two charges are the same, they repel each other. When two charges are different, then they attract each other. In Electricity, when two charges are different, then they would carry an electrical charge. That electrical charge would flow through the wire and make the object work. But if the two charges are the same, then they wouldn't carry an electrical charge. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1959,"Over the course of the past few weeks, there have been relatively intriguing topics covered. While having the choice to choose one of them to discuss, the lab on charges I felt delivered the most impact in terms of relevance to certain experiences I've had, as well as my general understanding. Same charges repel while opposites attract and this was well documented with the Phet lab we completed where we rubbed a balloon on a sweater to withdrawal the electrons from it and all that was left was the protons on the sweater. The balloon and sweater began attracting each other at a strong rate. In terms on neutrons, when is paired with an electron nothing occurs, although when paired with a proton they attract each other. This is applicable on a wider scale because there have been many cases where some object becomes attracted or repelled based on the apparel/contact I have with the object. Another example is when a bool is rubbed on my hair, they are attracted. Magnets are another example. This concept in physics is what I found to be the most gratifying and useful subject to browse through given its application to various circumstances in everyday life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1947,"I am not sure if i am focusing on the right thing but i find the concept of an E Field fascinating. I dont think i really thought about it as a concept before this class and its one thing that i spend a bunch of time thinking about. Its not in the scope of this class to talk about what is the underlying structure of an EField  but i assume its related to a gravitational field in some way. Whereas Gravity is ""fixed"" by mass, it appears that an Efield is determined by charge. This means we can increase the charge and thus the EField strength. Does an electron exert a gravitational force on other particles around it? i know the electric force is much stronger than the gravitational force but is there still one? We use electronics for so many things but is seems like we have just scratch the surface on what it can be utilized for. Gravity seems too cumbersome but the electric force seems much more malleable to our needs.  My questions around Efield is how large can they be? We use maglev but could we use it for spaceships? can we project it out and be able to propel spaceships to the moon? what about a space elevator that used an electric field?"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1953,"In my calculus class, we are currently learning about partial derivatives which have been giving me a hard time and so a question that I have is why they are important and also why we take two types of derivatives. Well after having read about partial derivatives, we have to take 2 or even more types of derivatives depending on how many variables you have in order to differentiate with respect to the variable that you are taking. Something that I was confused on where how we took the the derivative of the other types of variables but that was when my professor clarified and said that when we took with respect to a variable, we had to leave the others ones as a constant which basically gave me a better understanding and from these partial derivatives, we can see them everywhere. For example in physics when we take the gradient of something which requires us to take the derivate with respect to a certain variable and can also be used in everyday examples like heat flow, electrostatics and so forth. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1971,"When we did our experiment on short circuits, I was really confused about how they occurred in the first place, as I thought previously that they would be a problem of simply too much electricity running through the system at once. When we covered how it was more about when circuits don't close correctly due to corrosion of the wire or combustion due to the conductor not being durable enough to handle the amount of power traveling through the system, I began to understand the concept more. I realized that it wasn't necessarily a problem revolving around the amount of power traversing through the system, but rather the material's capability of handling said power. I believe that this kind of knowledge is really helpful to have, as it can be a handy tip for anyone who experiences a failure in their circuit breaker or perhaps a blackout in their house. Last year, my house actually almost caught on fire due to some faulty wiring that, after fifteen years, ended up corroding to the point of almost starting a fire. Had we understood back then about what was wrong with the system we had, that fire could have been prevented more easily. Understanding how circuits work isn't just a matter of passing a physics class, it's a handy tip that could actually save someone's life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1951,"Lately with climate change becoming more pressing, and the constant reminder in my class on ""our endangered planet"", thinking about alternatives to fossil fuels has become more significant in my life. In general learning about how electricity works fundamentally aids in making better decisions about future technologies. Topics relating to batteries, capacitors, and the pros and cons of various kinds of circuits are of great value. Learning about how superconductors, is an area that shows future promise in its applications. With superconductors, its unique ability to hold no resistance to current will undoubtedly be important to developing extremely efficient circuits, and may help in developing various kinds of infrastructure. Japan has plans of using superconductors in its development of a future maglev systems."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1972,"I remember from last weeks lab(circuits) that you should not touch the wires of a circuit together as it can create a shock due to the circuit being a closed path which generates heat. A way this can benefit people is it helps them realize how not to start a fire. If for whatever reason the circuit is placed to flammable objects, the shock from the circuit can start a fire. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1965,What happens when a high volume current flows through an object with low resistance?If a high volume current flowed through a low resistance surface which it was not meant to it can cause a short circuit and damage the power supply and the devices connected to the low resistance surface. This information is generally applicable in everyday life as it is a relatively common occurrence as that is how you can jump a power strip or short a computer. Computers short circuit due to the motherboard touching the metal case which is of low resistance and having a high volume current flow through a surface with low resistance(the PC case) would cause damage to the components connected to the surface.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1962,"How does potential relate to gravity? The reason why it relates so closely to gravity is because of the way potential energy works in classical mechanics. i.e. The higher the height of the object the more potential energy the object has stored. Although, related very related they are not the same. The reason why it is relevant in everyone's everyday life is because we most likely all carry a device with a battery in it. Meaning, we utilize the electric potential energy we have stored in our batteries. This is an important topic because not only do we learn about one of its useful applications but also how it is derived from Ohm's Law. The importance of Ohm's law will be explained later in the book, where we'll be looking at simple circuits and using the idea of current and voltage through simple circuits."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1949,"In everyday life, physics is applied to any situation that occurs in life. People invented calculus as a tool to reinforce the hypothesis that physics has come up with. An example of one of these hypothesis or topics in physics is learning about charge. There are particles that contain different charges either positive, negative, or neutral.     These particles that contain different charges can either push or pull on each other. When particles of similar charges are brought toward one another the particles repel each other. When particles of different charges are brought closer to one another they attract or gravitate toward one another."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1960,"The concept I am selecting is Gauss’ Law. The question is: why is it important to know the nature of object before studying electric flux passing through it?   My answer is it is important to know the nature of object to know its electric flux using Gauss’ Law because of the difference in charge distribution in the objects. In non-conducting objects, the charges are distributed uniformly which indicates the uniform density in that object. In conducting object, the charges sit on the surface of the object which is crucial part when we make Gaussian surface i.e. inside or outside of the surface. Apart of knowing if the object is conducting, non-conducting or semi-conducting, it is also important to know if the make of the object is solid, hollow, or thin sheet.  This information is applicable to people’s live to run every electrical appliances."
