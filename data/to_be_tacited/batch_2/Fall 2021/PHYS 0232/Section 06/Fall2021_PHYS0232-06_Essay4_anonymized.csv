2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1960,"I took a break during Covid year so the only semester this semester, Fall 2021 is the only one I am having online classes. I expected it to be overwhelming, coming back to school after a break and adapting to new learning methods. However, I believe I am not that overwhelmed by this non-traditional learning method. I usually have hard time focusing when I am in-class because I have weak eyes so now, because it is online class, my computer is near me so it helps me understand the material easily. Another fact that the professors post the recorded sessions help me as well because if I missed something in class, I can go back and watch the videos on my own pace to catch up. The concern about the online teaching is I have is the uneasiness of explaining my question to professors. I feel that it is easier for me to express my confusion in person and show which part I am stuck in person rather than virtually.For self-care, I do not know if I am doing something for self-care. I try to manage time so I don't stress myself. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1969,"Online classes have made it harder to keep track of classes and homework because it's all on the computer rather than going to classrooms and interacting with the professor and students. Also, having a bad wifi connection can make logging in more difficult. I try to streamline my schedule by putting my classes in a calendar with zoom links, I check my email and all the ilearn tabs often and review slides to stay updated. I think it can be difficult to stay on track with assignments. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1965,Online classes have impacted my learning by having to get used to watching recorded lectures and attending zoom meetings at certain times. It has also been somewhat more difficult to understand the contents of the course compared to online. Remembering due dates for certain assignments is more important now as you don't get as many reminders about it during the lectures online. For self-care not much has changed as I still do the same things as previously apart from commuting to campus. Some concerns I have about my learning are that it's a bit difficult to pay attention to lectures sometimes and that often leads to missing parts of important information. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1955,"Online classes have been an improvement for me. I enjoy not having to commute 3 hours a day, it leaves a lot of free time for studying, work, and other hobbies. Before online classes, I had no free time at all. Learning has been about the same since I am a computer science major. I don't believe that it is necessary to be in classes for that. I do wish that I could have experienced a few real physics labs though. I don't have too many concerns about my learning or well-being, everything has just improved for me. If I can, I plan on doing my last semesters fully online."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1971,"When online classes began, I noticed that there were two major challenges that I faced: managing my time well in order to get my work done, and my lack of energy due to not being around as many people as I used to be. As we continued forward and realized that the two-week Spring Break we had turned into a two-year stay-at-home order, I realized that I would have to adapt in order to survive. In terms of time management, I began to keep track of my calendar and even listed events or tasks that I had to get done that day in order to keep track of what I'm doing and where my priorities should lie. While it was a change from my typical ""go-with-the-flow"" nature, I realized that it was good to get some more discipline in. With the loneliness factor, I coped for a while by spending time with friends over Zoom and Discord and even began to socialize with my classmates over Discord. It helped me to get more involved in the Computer Science community, thus helping me make more friends with those who share majors with me. Eventually, the world began to open up again, and I now spend a lot of time helping with my church, as it's something that I'm passionate about. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1956,"The way online classes have been going for the past year I want to say that it helped me stay focused rather than in person classes. I used to struggle waking up early in the morning to get to school and attend lectures. Once COVID started and the transition between in person classes switched to online classes I found that as an opportunity to better myself since I had less things to worry about. Being able to wake up and attend lectures from my own room has significantly helped my educational career in terms of focus, grades, and work ethic. I think it's part of me remaining in my comfort zone to get things done which I find it easier. For self care I do my normal morning routine of eating breakfast and freshening up which then leads me to attend online lectures. My only concern is that I may be distracted once in awhile at home, but that won't stop me from getting my work done on time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1954,Online classes has been difficult for me especially keeping track with all my homeworks and and lectures. I've been trying to check ilearn everyday but sometimes I still miss a couple of homeworks. Focusing has also been difficult because of distractions that affect me especially by just being at home. After doing online classes for about 2 semesters now I learned the importance of paying attention and having a proper schedule for learning.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1961,"Before this fall semester, online classes were a detrimental impact to my learning. Since I wanted to take my engineering labs in person I started taking GE classes and went cold turkey on all my computer engineering classes. I'm glad I got all my writing classes out of the way but it was hard to feel connected since most of my classes were asynchronous and only met once a week. The spring of 2020 was the 1st time I had online classes and transitioning was horrible. It was my second time taking Math 228 and I thought I was going to fail again because I had no idea how to use Zoom efficiently. I tried getting tutored but it felt like a waste of time besides my tutor for my English class at the time. During summer and fall semesters of 2020 I took a lot of Asian American classes which helped me keep my writing skills over covid. I had a schedule where I would go to my grandma's house and take my classes since I had 1-2 synchronous classes. However, I hated asking my grandpa to turn off his music because he would play it so loud. Plus, at my grandma's house I share a room with my cousin so we would have to take turns on who would use the room. All my classes this semester are online but for the most part I have gone to the library to take them so I can concentrate. However, I am not sure what I am going to do when it gets cold because we can't eat in doors on campus and when I ate at the cafe outside I already got hit by a fruit falling on my right hand but thankfully I am left handed so it did not impact my day that badly. Getting the social benefits from going to the library on campus has helped my well-being. Even though I am an introvert being around other students motivates me to stay focused on my academics. My mental health is recovering slowly from what covid has done to the majority of us."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1959,"Online classes haven't negatively impacted my learning likely by any stretch of the imagination. If anything, I've started to become more productive and adaptive to various tasks that I wasn't usually comfortable with before. Self care is not my largest priority but I am starting to assign more attention towards it. I've learned that mental health is an important feature for successfully completing school at this level and expectation. What works for me is adequately pacing myself and directing and following a schedule I set forth. I am just gonna keep pioneering through the next three semesters until I am able to get my degree and move forward."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1967,"After basically being in online classes for almost two years worth of school now, I feel that there are advantages and drawbacks to how online classes help with our learning. How it helps is that we are able to learn a little bit more at our own pace since we some of us take our classes at home so we can more easily schedule our work time for classes and schoolwork. With most of my classes being recorded and the notes being posted online, it lets me look back at the notes so I can better understand the concepts if I still did not understand the first time around. However, drawbacks to online classes is that everyone has a different situation, which can include professors not being able to attend class and therefore we miss opportunities to learn a topic in a less rushed manner. In addition, since some are still at home, life can get in the way of our learning more easily, which can limit some of our learning. For this semester, I am taking a lot of classes, which has taken up most of my time. Throughout the semester, I have had many feelings of being overwhelmed, but now I know for the future to be mindful of how many classes I take so that it does not take a toll on my well-being."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1973,"This year has been extremely hard for myself, I started taking most of my major courses and it often gets hard with the material we are studying on, although professors try to be as in contact with students it is not the same as learning the material in person. in particular I struggle at times when I cannot figure out a formula which takes me hours on a single problem and I cannot do anything about it until my next zoom class, also some of my professors don't have a set time for office hours which makes it hard. my major concern is that I will not pass my classes or learn the material, which will put me behind and not allow me to succeed in other courses. something I am doing for my well being is taking time for myself and going out for walks allowing me to clear my mind and have motivation to continue my work. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1964,"Online learning has been tremendously difficult for me, and has significantly impacted my education overall. I find myself having many mental health problems, likely related to the fact that I have a hard time getting outside or seeing people. These problems make it much harder to keep up with my assignments, keep track of deadlines, and find the willpower to study. In order to combat these things, I’ve been making greater effort to take care of my health by exercising and eating right. Unfortunately in many ways these problems feel like quicksand, and the solutions to them become increasingly difficult as the problems persist. At the moment I’m very concerned about the impact this will have, or is having, on my education. I’m significantly behind in several classes at the moment and am truly uncertain on the best way to proceed so that I may accomplish my goals."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1947,"I have mixed feelings about the online classes. IF it wasnt for the covid lockdown and the move to online learning i never would have completed my degree. I never finished my courses in the 90's and have just worked, all the time wishing to finish. I have taken seven classes during the lockdown while still working from home so it has been good for that. Combining this with working from home has meant a lot of time alone and on zoom which has been tough. It is stressful being a software engineering manager and leading several teams from the comfort of one's home. I have recently gone back to playing soccer several times a week and that has really helped in getting me to interact in with people in a real, analog setting, not to mention that my sleep has been better as well. I also get worried that students will want to continue with remote learning when i feel in person learning is a much richer experience. It may be a generational thing, but it seems that younger people today are generally more comfortable hanging out with their friends online."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1953,"Online classes have been a bit difficult this year and overall I feel that it has progressively only gotten harder as the classes seem to get tougher. At first I felt that it was pretty easy as we were going over the most basic stuff like chemistry and calculus and english. The part that caught me off guard was just how hard some of these classes have now gotten as for example in calculus 3, we are learning triple integrals and so it's very hard showing us what the graphs of them look like as it's hard to express those ideas virtually. I do have some concerns for my upcoming classes as I know that they will get more difficult so I would love to have only in person classes so that I can move to San Francisco and actually learn in person. I actually really miss this as it's been 3 years since I last went to an in person class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1957,"Online classes have impacted my learning as everything is virtual and classes are taken at home. For self-care, I'm looking after my body by doing workouts every day. I don't have any concerns for my learning and my well-being. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1972,"Online classes have not negatively affected me this semester. I like it because I can rewatch recorded lectures in case there was information I might have missed. I don't have any concerns for my learning at the moment and don't think I will have any this semester unless a tragic event presents itself. For self care, I've just been making sure I get enough sleep every night, eat as healthy as I can and meditate for 5 minutes daily. I feel that our mental health is the most important aspect in life.I make sure I socialize with my group of friends daily because although I enjoy being alone, being with people can uplift my mood."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1950,"To be honest online learning has impacted my learning tremendously. Before when I was in school is was easier to stay focused on the material and actually learn it because since it’s in person it feels so much more personal and real. Now having to online learn I’ve had to set aside time to teach myself all the material and fully understand it so I can then do the homework and do well on exams. Although it has been difficult I’ve sorta of learned to adapt to it, I don’t get much sleep or time a day to do anything for myself but every once in a while I make sure to always take a full Saturday off. Sometimes I have to sacrifice myself by having to do more work on a day but I make sure I have saturdays off so I can full detach myself from school and focused on myself and family. Some concerns I have right now is that I will burnout. I’m trying to learn how to juggle my work more efficiently and studying so I don’t always feel so exhausted but it’s hard as things get harder but it’s all about that time management and motivation."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1949,I enjoy online classes. Online classes have given me the opportunity to get more sleep. There is much less commute time and with this also less stress worrying about being able to commute to school. At the same time it frees up more time to take care of myself. Some concerns that I have when online learning is the accessibility of professors. I believe that it is easier for us students to talk to our professors in person rather than online.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1962,I have taken the time to schedule my life so I can make sure I have time to have a social life as well as make sure I have enough sleep to make sure I am having a healthy sleeping schedule. This also ensures that I will have an easier time focusing in class because I have to wake up very early in the morning to commute to college for my in-person class. I also believe it is important to recognize the importance of retaining our knowledge by having spaced learning to ensure we can more easily study for our classes online. I believe we can receive help in class if we're given problems that short problems that test what we've learned in lecture. In order to help us learn in our class.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1952,"online classes have both pros and cons. It is different than an in-person environment because of multiple reasons. Not being in a classroom setting means that I don't have to get out of my house for class, I don't have to get ready in the mornings. I also don't have the help of other classmates. My teachers don't know what I look like. Overall I would rather be in class. The quality of my education has definitely slipped. For self-care, I just hit the gym everyday, that's my excuse to leave the house. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1963,"This year, online classes has impacted my learning a lot compared to my previous years in person. Firstly, online learning made it hard for me to stay awake during some classes. However, I feel like assignments were easier to do if taught correctly how to do them. Sometimes, I feel like some of the material being taught in some classes is hard to learn being online. However, this class has been very easy going for me and I feel like the simulations and labs are well adjusted to online learning rather than in person. For self-care, I feel like I am better at taking care of myself when it comes to staying hydrated and getting well rested. I am able to eat during some lectures and I don't have to wait for an in person class to get out in order for me to eat for example. I don't have many concerns regarding my learning and well-being besides the fact that I need to get more sleep. I want to get onto a better sleep schedule as we are getting into hard parts of the semester academically."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1948,"Online classes have had a positive and negative impact on me. As someone who has been diagnosed with ptsd and suffers from extreme anxiety, I've found that taking online classes has alleviated some of the anxiety I've had in traditional classrooms. When I take online classes, I realize that I am more organized and get my homework done sooner rather than later. This has given me more free time to pursue other interests and spend time with friends. However, in certain classes, being online makes it more difficult to comprehend the content since I learn better from having someone educate me rather to just reading a book. As a result, I'll have to dig deeper into the issues than normal to grasp them.  Overall, I enjoy having online classes as my mental health and well being has been increasingly better than when we had in person classes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1974,"Since I actually fell in love with online classes, I cannot say it impacted my lifestyle negatively. It is actually helping me to get better grades because I have more time to spend on my homework, and I am using the time I usually wasted on the road to go to the university back and forth on my study. I realized that when it is fully online, I feel no rush and pressure. To speak of self-care, it is still a bit worrying for me to be surrounded by a bunch of people inside the building, so studying from home is the best for me as of now. Because I never got sick after the pandemic, and I believe it is because I spent time at home more than outside. Since this is my first semester fully online, I was concerned about online learning at first because I did not want to become a virtual zombie, but the zoom makes everything simpler. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1966,"Online classes have impacted me by making college more accessible. Last year I was hospilized for almost three months and continued to take my classes online whole I was redriving treatment for my chronic condition. A few months later I was hospiltized again and I was still able3 to complete my classes and obtain more units towards my degree. I think that having college as an online option has been very beneficial to me. For self-care, I have been reading as well as taking up new hobbies such a gaming and creating a podcast with my best friend. I think concerns for my learning are that I have to hold myself responsible for my learning which is a big responsibility. But so far I seem to be doing okay with that responsibility. "
