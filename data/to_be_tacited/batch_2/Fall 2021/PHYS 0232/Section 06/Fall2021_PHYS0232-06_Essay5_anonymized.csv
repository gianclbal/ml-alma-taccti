2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1971,"My greatest takeaway from this class is the reassurance that physics is applicable in several areas of life and not just the science lab. I think that it's really easy to just translate anything academic into purely a school setting, however learning isn't contained to the confines of university education. I've found that the times I learn best are when I'm actually applying my learning to a real-life experience. As a computer science major and a musician, I've learned that practice is what makes perfect for me. I like working with my hands, I like seeing someone do something and replicating it, and analyzing what I did wrong or what I can do to improve from what someone else did. I believe that my best work is done when I have someone who guides me through the basics, so that I may improve upon whatever foundation I've been given. Ultimately, this class has reminded me that I love learning when I can apply my skills into the real world. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1973,"trough the semester I have truly enjoyed this class, the professor is extremely nice and understanding and actually helped us trough the labs even If we were conducting the laboratory trough zoom due to covid. all the labs allowed us and helped me understand what we were learning, and actually kept us engaged throughout the zoom class which are going to allow me to succeed in my future laboratories, ive taken away how to communicate when I am not understanding something, how to engage with my classmates, especially this semester discord was a great communication app we had to share questions and help for our labs! Another thing is that we have to be consistent turning in our labs because if not our grades will go down which I have experienced and it may be hard to get your grade up throughout time since the labs consist of participation engagement and turning it on time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1947,"Before the class i was not sure on why i had to take the class for CS after the mechanics class (220). yes, i get it that computers are electronic devices and all that but still. I do see now that learning this stuff is fundamental to being an engineer. I wasnt sure why it came after 220 but from what i have learnt you need the fundamentals from 220 as they still apply to the world of electrons and protons. I have heard about people trying to unify all the different theories of gravity and electromagnetics, and from seeing how they still all appear to operate in the same way, it has made be a lot more curious about that as well.It seems obvious to me (now that i am a highly trained physicist) that there are some other fundamental laws that underpin all these things. I will keep an eye out for developments as i am genuinely interested. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1974,"This is my first ever lab that is online. And the greatest takeaway for me was the experience of online lab.  It was very fun working in a zoom breakout room. I actually never thought that any kind of lab can be done online. The interactive websites made the whole lab procedures easy and understandable. Also, I noticed the online lab seemed easier compared to in-class lab because from my nature I am a shy person and struggle to speak to people. But via the zoom it was more comfortable for me to engage with my groupmates in the discussions."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1965,My greatest takeaway from this class was that some labs are difficult to do online. This is my greatest takeaway from this class because I didn't really think about how difficult it would be to do a lab in class w/o some of the materials required and the examples sometimes being harder to see the details of.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1954,"Probably one takeaway that I learned from this class is how circuits work. Knowing that technology is around us and that all of them are have circuits in them it is very interesting to me to see how they work and such. Learning about magnets and magnetism in general is pretty cool too because I learned more stuff beyond the idea of attraction and repel of magnets that I may be able to use in my day to day. But of course the biggest takeaway is that even if the laboratory this time is done online, I was still able to learn all this things and be able to understand through the discussions as well as the activities. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1955,"My greatest take away from this class would be the understanding of all the equations. In my regular physics class, I don't really understand the concepts until the lab. I just know how to plug in equations properly given the information. But I wouldn't know how to explain why it all works. The hands-on labs and the simulations give me a great idea of how everything works. The concepts that helped the most was the electromagnets lab. It gave me a great understanding of the right hand rule as well as how the currents flow through the object. I also learned why some objects are poor conductors of current."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1966,"My greatest take away from this class was the collaboration and learning from my peers. In break out groups, my peers and I were able to really help each other out and were able to answer most of question with some discussion and critical thinking. If we were still unable to get the correct answers or fail to completely understand a certain topic, we would ask for help from the instructor. But typically, with collaboration we were able to answers our own questions which I found really powerful mainly because it felt like real world scenario rather than a classroom setting.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1956,"My greatest take away from this class is the idea behind physics. Not only did I learn new handful of concepts, but I have came to the conclusion that this class has opened opportunities for me to really think about if I chose the right major for myself. I have discovered by doing all the work and taking midterms has proved to me that I believe I am in the right place for myself. This class has shown me that I am more than capable of doing things that I doubt myself with. I also had the opportunity to work with others that I probably will be taking future classes with due to the fact that we all share similar majors which is nice. I guess to sum it up this specific class has been good to myself and some of my concerns as an engineering college student. My progress so far has been okay, but I definitely think that I can do better from here on out until the end so hopefully I make the most out of this class and secure a high standard grade."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1960,"The biggest takeaway from this class is this class is informational and self-reflective. I have this class in between my class lecture. My class lecture is on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The fact that this class is on Wednesdays helps a lot. The reason it is helpful is because the professor goes over the topic again, provides the slides. This helps me to understand the concept more or sometimes in simpler way. Therefore, this class is informational.   The next takeaway is self-reflective. This class is the best place to have hands-on experience with the knowledge we learn in the lecture periods. The class is self-reflective in my opinion because we can apply our understanding in practice and acknowledge where we stand in matter of our understanding, like how much have we truly understood the topic and how confident are we in applying our understanding in practice. Another point to be noted how this class helps in using our knowledge in use is the post lab assignment where we must answer one application of the experiments performed in the lab in our daily lives. The assignments encourage us to think outside of the box and at the same time get in touch with reality as of how all those learnings are helpful in daily life.  So, I would say the takeaways are informational, self-reflective, encouraging."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1972,"A takeaway from this class is to stay disciplined and finish what you started. Considering this class is 3 hours long, it is very easy to get distracted and not finish the assignments but as the weeks went on I noticed that it's better to finish tasks as soon as you can and have rest times when you finish what needs to be done. Delayed gratification to sum it up."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1948,"When asked what my greatest take away from this class, I can't think of one specific thing, my greatest takeaway is a more general thing.  After taking this class, I continued to learned a lot about our world and how physics contributes to it.  Before this physics, I really wasn't a person that enjoyed or knew much about any science.  The physics lecture and lab really opened up my brain to see all these new topics.  Before physics, I had very little understanding of the topics i've learned, but now I am confident in each topic and now understand the effects these topics have on everyday things in life.  Overall, my greatest takeaway from this class is there is science and math, especially physics, in almost everything in our everyday life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1964,"I’ve never been a student that found labs helpful, as odd as that might sound. I always felt like the info I needed could be gleaned from the lecture, and lab was just an extra hoop I had to jump through for my grade. This semester, in this physics course, I found the lab extremely helpful. I found my lecture to not be very useful to me, through a combination of distaste for the professors lecturing style, homework that didn’t feel comprehensive enough, and of course the difficulty of material, I wasn’t getting much out of it. Coming to the lab was an amazing way for me to approach these concepts from a different direction and really “get” things that I would otherwise be lost on. So I would say my biggest takeaway from this class is how important and helpful labs can be to students."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1963,"My greatest take away from this class is incorporating and applying my knowledge of physics into my everyday applications of life. I find it very interesting and interactive to be able to query areas of interest I have regarding scientific observations in everyday life to then experiment and discover discrete answers to my curiosities. For example, being a computer science major, I found it nice to be able to code in the lab and see how physics applications can be used in the workshops we have done in sage. I liked experimenting with electrical currents the most. Using the lab simulations were helpful and easy to understand."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1951,"This class over the course of the semester has shown me how the application of physics is applicable to day-to-day life. While not all concepts are equally useful, understanding how circuits work is great in any event that we deal with electrical work. Understanding how magnets fit into the greater picture helps demystify them to a great extent. From troubleshooting broken electronics to diagnosing problems with a car, this class gives better insight into the requirements for these systems to work, maybe even help ourselves from getting scammed. This class also helped me make sense of the math used in the lecture and exactly where these numbers come from. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1953,"My greatest takeaway from this class is learning the fundamental ideas behind each lab, which I guess can be considered knowledge. I have learned many interesting things such as voltage,currents, electric fields, flux, and many other ideas that were essential throughout the class. Another great takeaway is the use of peers and asking questions whenever something was said that I didn't understand. I got to meet many wonderful people throughout the class and hopefully soon in person. All because I turned my mic on whenever I didn't understand something which greatly helped me as I was able to get a better understanding as well as easily progress through the lab through teamwork."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1967,"One of my greatest take aways from this lab class is that physics in all around us in our everyday lives and in our world. When looking back on the labs and lectures that we have done in both classes, it is evident why physics is something that is important to learn and to be knowledgable in. All of our electronics, including the computers that we are using to be in zoom classes to the phones that we use everyday, From electric fields to the magnets that are used in our world, all of these aspects can be explained through physics and are not just some weird phenomena, "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1950,"My greatest take away from this class has been learning how to produce a current to get electricity in something. When we did the lab with the wire and the battery I felt like I learned a basic lesson on how to create a wire, even with aluminum foil. I enjoyed doing hands on labs because it gave us an opportunity to really learn the material. Another take away I took from this class was I learned how to code. I had never ever done coding before this class but i had always heard of it. In coding I learned how helpful a coder can be, being a calculator that can help me solve integrals or indefinite integrals or even draw graphs.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1958,My biggest take away from this class is just how pertinent physics is to the world of technology. Simple technologies such as the wiring in a household has vastly intricate designs and reasons for the way they are done. Even the way ethernet wires are twisted can effect it due to how powered wire creates a magnetic field
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1961,My greatest takeaway from this class is that next semester I want to work with circuits hands on. I remember I was able to learn the basics of circuits in my 1st year before covid-19 hit but since this class has reintroduced circuits I want to take my ENGR 205 and ENGR 206 courses in person for the Spring 2022 semester. Another takeaway I will have from this class is to pick professors who are straightforward when they speak since I have gotten more from the mini lectures in this class than the main lecture. Since this is the 3rd time I have take a class with you as the instructor I know that if I ever get stuck in other classes that I can come to you for help since you are saved on my school email. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1962,I enjoy the approach the staff at SFSU do their physics lab during covid compared to my previous college. I feel that this class is much more engaging when it is on a different day than lecture so I don't feel as fatigued about the class. My greatest take away from this class is that I have learned a lot more by working with my classmates than I did doing independently working on the lab. I also learned the most when we did a single lab group classes or when my classmates where interested in the laboratory.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1959,"My greatest takeway from this class was the concept of management and participation. Whenever I attended the lectures and labs every week, I learned something new which them allowed me to break off and complete the assignments within a fair amount of time. Different charges and how to they produce and interact with each other was interesting to learn, especially through the PHET simulation labs in which we had to reimagine and align the experiments ourselves. Circuitry and insulation was my favorite lab in this class thus far. Taking these physics and calculus classes since the Spring has helped aid my development as a student all year round and I feel competent enough in the subject to move forward and apply those skills in my everyday experiences. I hope to encounter something similar to this again in the future, whether it be in academia or as a hobby."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1957,My greatest take away is learning about Electric Circuits. It was great learning about how the charges have an impact on the Electric Circuits.
