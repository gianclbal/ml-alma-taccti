2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1946,"I want to go into a stem field because it interests me a lot. The impact that any stem field makes on the world is huge and the variety of fields in STEM field is huge as well. There is a large amount of cutting edge research going on in every subfield of a STEM field and I would like to be one of the person to contribute to these fields. Working in a stem field is very satisfying, you feel very confident that you have used your skills to help the world in some way."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1947,"I guess I have already gone into STEM! :) I am a returning student of nearly 3 decades as a professional software engineer. I have always enjoyed science and find it very interesting. learning how and why things function the way they do is incredibly fascinating. Being a software engineer i also have loved to build things. As my career progressed i have been able to build bigger and bigger systems and encounter new hurdles to overcome. the combination of problem solving, learning and building has been more than i could have ever hoped for in a career. I am lucky that what i want to do , people are prepared to pay good money for and i think that is the case for many STEM careers, so that does help as well. If i didnt' go into software engineering i think i would have liked to do something around physics as i have really enjoyed learning the concepts ( even though i find the math hard sometimes)"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1948,There isn't really a single event that got me interested in the STEM field.  I remember seeing my highschool offering computer science classes and I decided to join the basic introductory class.  I fell in love with the material I learned thanks to the great teacher I had.  I continued to take the next couple of classes and from there I just sorta decided that Computer science would be my major as its something I actually enjoy to learn and work on.  In high school I even joined the Girls Who Code club to learn that there are very few women in computer science and I wanted to work and be part of changing this male dominated field into a more equal one.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1949,"I chose to become a STEM major because I find technology to be very interesting. I am pursuing a BA in Computer Science in hopes of becoming a software developer. The first career that I was interested in before deciding to become a software developer was actually to be a video game creator. I thought that was really cool because it connected both my passion for gaming and my interest in technology. But I soon realized that, in my opinion, it does not contribute to the advancement of our society. I wanted to code something that would contribute to making society a better place or an easier place for people. And at the same time I can see that technology is becoming what is most prominent in society. Many things today require technology, and without software developers technology may even be obsolete. Technology is only as good as the software that is made of even the physical components that the device consists of. And again, because if the advancement in science, we are able to make better technology and do things that were not possible in the past. I want to be able to contribute to this as well in the future. I want to see a software that I helped develop being used in everyday life and say, that was me that coded that part of the software that does so and so. It will be a great feeling that one day I have someone to tell that to and I can be proud of it. Or maybe someone us using the software I developed in public and I can say, did you know that I helped make that software become a reality. It’s just crazy to me how much the world relies on technology now a days, even for the classes that I am taking right now. If it weren’t for the ability to chat online, it would make taking classes during the pandemic horrible, and may even cause the pandemic to become even worse if we were to have in person classes during this pandemic."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1950,"The reason for which I want to go into the stem field is to help others. Ever since a young age i've dealt with skin problems: acne and rosacea. Because of my skin it has lead me to find a love and interest in the skin and how it functions. I've always been extremely self conscious about my skin and the issues I have with it so I want to go into the stem field, dermatology specifically to help people with the same issues and problems I've had. Being in the stem field you have to go into it being selfless and ready to learn and absorb from your understandings and I feel ready to do. The stem field greatly contributes the world innovations and I wanna be apart of it!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1951,"STEM fields have always held my interest, especially science. Growing up I always loved watching the discovery channel for all the cool things they would explore. While I always loved how attractive science can be, I wasn't IN love with it. No, I just liked what science allowed us to appreciate. I've come to realize, nothing so beautiful comes that easy. Something about math and hard sciences always made more sense than the ambiguity of language and history. Growing up glued to a computer screen, gave me the inspiration to pursue technology. Learning about how lucrative it all was made the choice a lot simpler. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1952,"I want to go into the stem field because I want to make a real difference in the world. I want to understand the earths physical components and use that knowledge to guide me to my success. Whether I'm trying to test something or make a new discovery, the stem field will help me get to where I want to go. I like the material that we learn in this field. I'm not one to read or write too much so math, physics, and any other stem class comes more naturally to me. The stuff we learn is also awesome and not boring. The possibilities in the stem field are endless. Ultimately, I would want to be an astronaut because I was always taught to shoot for the moon. But even if I don't become an astronaut in my life, I'll land somewhere amongst the stars. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1953,I've always had a passion for stem in specific mathematics as I've always shared this love-hate relationship where I hated how some problems got super hard but I also loved working through the problem and obtaining the answer and just the sheer relief of getting an answer. This is something I haven't felt in any other subject which is why I chose to go into this stem field. Over the past months I have grown to love Calculus in general as it has taught me fundamentals which are essential in everyday life like physics as well but the only thing is that I find physics really hard to grasp mainly because of the equations and trig that is involved but I hope to one day develop a love with physics as well as it is essential in engineering. The other reason I chose to go into a STEM field is because it is essential in our everyday life and is fundamental in understanding how the universe works.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1954,The reason I want to go in the STEM field is that Science and Technology improves our lives and I want to be a part of that. Especially nowadays where Technology is ubiquitous around us. I think being involved into STEM makes me better suited and prepared for the future. I'm also interested in learning about the world around me and be able to explain everyday occurrences. Being in the STEM field would also help me train myself and become more analytical not just with STEM related topics but also in other fields. I've always been interested about Science and Technology ever since I was little and being able to contribute or be a part of it would be very exciting. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1955,"I want to go into the STEM field because I have always had an interest in how the world works. I always liked doing science fair projects as a kid and going to tech museums during school field trips. I also always loved computers and wanted to learn programming. Later on, I plan on going into software development. This field also generally has good pay and that was also a big part of my decision on what I was going to do. It helps that I actually enjoy these classes. If I'm going to spend half my life doing something, I want to be able to enjoy it. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1956,"Why do I want to get into the STEM field? As a young kid I grew up within a family of technicians, and I have always been drawn to machines, but more specifically into cars. There was always that feeling of excitement and curiosity that I’ve had every time I would hear or see a car with aftermarket modifications on it. As years went by I knew I wanted my career to revolve around the things that brought me satisfaction and excitement, cars. My goal after high school was to become a mechanic just like my dad and grandpa, but my counselors found an even better alternative for me. That alternative was for me to major in mechanical or electrical engineering. With a bachelor’s in either field of study would help solidify a career within the automotive industry. Being the in the STEM field not only helps me get a career that I want, but it helps me test my knowledge, skills, and my critical thinking. It has been a challenge so far, but I think I’m starting to get the hang of things which makes me feel like I’m on the right path with my major."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1957,I want to go into the STEM field because I'm interested in Engineering and Science. I want to know what Science and Engineering is like in the STEM field and how it has an impact in life. I feel that being in the STEM field would be good for me as I'll be able to learn more about Science and Engineering. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1958,"My fascination with computers really started back when I was in middle school. My mom worked at the school that I attended, and the school was upgrading their computer systems. Since they had no need for the old, antiquated computers, they gave away the old ones to some of the staff that wanted them. When my mom brought home the computer, and I watched it boot up, I was instantly awestruck. This was a really old computer. One of those ones that had lines of code flashing on the screen while it started up. I used to pretend I was a hacker while the lines of code went by. As I grew older, that memory really stuck with me, and I inevitably began to dabble with python 2.0 as my first language. I’m someone who loves different kinds of puzzles, and software development is really just one really big puzzle. So naturally I fell in love with it, and I have been deadest on making a career of it ever since."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1959,"I want to go into the stem field for a multitude of reasons. Some of them are practical, some of them fall in line with my direct interest as a tech hobbyist. I am a major in computer science with an acquired taste for IT and software. My dad was very interested as a computer science major back in the 90's but was never able to finish his degree due to various extenuating circumstances that removed him from college. Now I feel as though I am able to finish what he had started and become a software engineer. I enjoy the process of creating code and breaking down complex problems into simple and effective solutions. I try to apply my philosophy degree to the field of software by thinking intellectually about what I need to do and create. I always enjoyed physics and would rather take this class over any other stem class available, especially with the professor I have right now."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1960,"""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?""When someone asks me this question, I do not know what to answer because my interest in STEM field has not been constant. As far as I remember, I liked solving math problems and when I know I am doing my best and I am in control, I felt satisfied and enjoyed solving problems. Then, slowly I started to deviate my attention towards computer field. I liked spending time using computer, learning new things about computers. This was in middle school. Then, the technology became more advanced. I am fascinated and I feel lucky at the same time to witness the progress of technology, to be where we are at the moment. I am intrigued by the possibility of me being the part of those developments, advancement. However, just being amazed by the possibility is not enough; to do anything, we must put our work, energy, time into it. There have been times I’ve been demotivated and questioned myself if I am in the right field. But thought of joining other majors, just did not excite me as much nor could I see my future working in other fields. Hence, now I am continuing in STEM field with positive attitude and growth mindset. Therefore, I think that is the reason why I am in the STEM field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1961,I first thought about going into the STEM field in high school. For 2-3 years I was in the computer club and we learned about simple ways to code. My whole life I never learned how to play a musical instrument or could learn another language; in fact I dropped out of Spanish in high school after two years to double up on math for the last 2 years of high school. I thought working with robots would be very cool but my high school only started doing that after I graduated. I know I wanted to work with computers but I didn't want to do graphic design or be a comp/sci major because I thought it wasn't as broad as engineering. So I decided to combine the two and study as a computer engineer. I was also weighing the options of the other engineering degrees and this one seems to be the least messy possible. I say this was mechanical and electric engineering seems very out of my comfort zone. I didn't get a 3 or higher on my AP Calc AB course but I felt confident enough in the material to want to pursue higher learning in calc.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1962,"The reason I went into a STEM major was because I initially envisioned myself being a music major. However, I realized quickly that I was interested more in the digital aspect of sound design rather than playing it myself. I was also around a father who loved tinkering with electronics projects. So, I had a really good idea of what I wanted to do in the future, knowing I loved electronics and music. I decided to become a electrical engineering major to make hardware based devices for music production. I went into an engineering community that was really supportive of my goals and there I understood that I wanted to pursue the STEM field. I am so happy that I decided to join because it has helped me become a more extroverted individual in my life and it has taught the importance of communicating with my peers."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1963,I went into the STEM field because I am a very hands-on type of person when it comes to doing work. I like learning about how and why things work and happen. I like figuring out puzzles and learning about the world. Taking STEM classes are very fun for me because I like doing experiments and projects that we are able to interact with physically such as dealing with chemicals or anything natural. I look forward to what this class has to offer!
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1964,"I’d like to go into STEM because I enjoy figuring out and learning how things work. When I’m involved in an engineering project I find myself consumed by finding elegant solutions or learning about what people before me solving similar problems have done. The feeling of finishing a project in a way that you’re happy with is similar to that of performing some great athletic feat, an engineer’s running high. I find myself drawn to STEM not only because I feel that way, but because I feel that I’m good at it. I often feel like no matter what type of project I start on, as long as I stay dedicated, I can always complete it in a way that gives me that sense of satisfaction. As I continue my journey into the field I feel this way more and more. In other efforts in life, I feel more resistance as time goes on, but in STEM I feel the opposite. As I progress it becomes easier to move forward."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1965,The reason I wanted to go into the STEM field was due to me being somewhat interested in computers. I had wanted to find out more about how programs worked the way they did. I was also drawn to STEM due to the flexibility of the field. The main reason that I went into STEM was my interest in computer programs and games.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1966,I want to go into the STEM field for a variety of reasons. I really enjoy finding new things and discovering new ways of doing things. I wan tot be able to create new technology in order to benefit the lives of people with mental and physical disabilities. This is mainly why I want to go into the STEM field but this a pretty wide area of research. I feel in our society the the disabled community is not often helped with new technilioty and I feel if I can obtain knowledge and a degree int he STEM field I can better assist this issue. The STEM feudal has the power to help and raise awareness for this with disabilities. Being apart of a STEM organization that help disabled persons had been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1967,"I want to go into the STEM field because I have always been interested in science. Currently, I am majoring in Civil Engineering, which I chose because I have had an interest in engineering before college. I have always been fascinated with science like physics, and have done projects that have been related to civil engineering, which lead to me choosing civil engineering as my major. Engineering and science can be used to improve the everyday lives of everyone, and that is something that I want to do for other people. There is also so much to learn from science, as there are many different topics and there are always new discoveries being made."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1968,"I want to go into the STEM field because I feel that science is not given the same respect that it used to have in society and it deserves the upmost respect. Science is the foundation of facts. Yet facts are no longer regarded as laws. The saying ""its a matter of fact"" doesn't even mean the same thing anymore. I feel that majority of America, no matter their income or political stance, has fallen ill to an elitist type of thinking which is toxic for society as a whole. As humans, we thrive in communities and our communities thrive when we as individuals are capable of thinking of everyone's greater good; not just our own. Our planet is dying and dying quickly. We are basically beyond salvation and its everyone's fault because we ALL allowed this to happen. While we have been busy trying to discern who is at fault and if it is even true that our planet is dying, we have allowed critical time to pass. We can't fix it anymore, but we can find and cultivate a new home if we move swiftly. Humanity's entire future lies somewhere amongst the stars and the only way to get there is by putting our everything into STEM. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1969,"I want to go into STEM because I've always liked solving problems using science. As a kid, I watched shows like Mythbusters and Bill Nye and saw how many useful applications science and math have. I especially like making things and being creative, so I chose mechanical engineering since it’s all about designing new things to solve problems. STEM fields can also be really important in modern life with technology, so being a part of that is exciting. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1970,"Being a part of the STEM Field has been an interesting ride for me. Specifically, I have shown interest in Math since a very young age and is still a subject that I am passionate learning about. The more challenges I faced when it came to learning new information in the STEM subjects, the more I got invested in gaining more knowledge. I find it very fun to be  challenged and to be able fix or solve a problem using the tools I have. As well as a first generation student and as a women of color, I feel like being in STEM field is a privilege and has been a dream of mine since I can remember. Since getting involved in this career field I feel like there hasn't been that much representation of people who look like me, so if I can inspire people from my community to attempt to do there dream jobs just by sticking to doing what I liove, then I think that is enough for me. I want to be that person who can support and give to others to complete whatever dreams or goals that they have for themselves. I want to be there for others and help guide them, sometimes I wished I had that. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1971,"From a young age, I knew that I had a passion for activities like art, design, music, and more. I was fascinated by the idea of being able to create something that I could call my own. However, as I got older, I began to see the complexities and intricacies of the world. For me, I'm a Christian, and I stand by the belief that God created the universe. When I look at the complexities of the universe, whether it be the engineering behind the human body, to physics, chemistry, and math especially, I am marveled at what can be created. This was part of what inspired me to pursue the STEM field and eventually choose the field of Computer Science. It's incredible to me what people can accomplish with the limited knowledge that we have and that knowledge is continuing to grow as we discover more and more of the universe we live in. Creation is something that has always fascinated me, and between my curiosity and my faith, I realized that STEM is the right field for me to pursue. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1972,The reason I chose a major in the STEM field is because of the money. I initially wanted to stay away from the STEM field because of math but after a while I decided to choose computer science as it is the only field that seems fun and high paying as well. I wanted to choose a major that would help me get a job that has a high starting salary because I plan on paying student loans as soon as possible.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1973,"A reason I am interested in a STEM field is due to its development around the world, I do know that there is a lot of opportunities in stem fields. This field allows you to grow and develop, and most of the times have secure job opportunities, you are also able to pursue different career paths after graduation.  I chose Civil engineering, this career plays a role in creating designs for a city, such as building roads bridges etc, which makes me pretty excited. Also due to my analysis it is rare for women to go into this career path, which excites me a lot!, and Ive seen in several of my classes that there I only about 3 women students including myself and the rest of the class are male. I am encouraged to learn trough my courses , which will allow me to be successful in my career path."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1974,"I want to go into STEM field mainly because I am from a country called Uzbekistan where we lack in science badly. I believe that studying in STEM and working with the knowledge you gained in this field teaches you to look at the world around you differently, also it encourages you to be innovative when it comes to finding solutions for real-world challenges. And I also believe that it plays the major role for the country's developments. Therefore, I wanna gain as much as knowledge and bring it back to my country. Because, that's how we can teach the upcoming young generation for critical thinking, solving, being creative and having collaborative skills."
