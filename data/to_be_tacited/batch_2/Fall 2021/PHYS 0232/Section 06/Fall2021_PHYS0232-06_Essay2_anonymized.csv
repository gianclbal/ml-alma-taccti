2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1964,"My primary educational goals are of course to get my degree, but also to expand my understanding of topics like math and physics which interest me. This class will obviously give me units and fulfill an important requirement for my degree, but it’s also the meat of what interests me most about physics. Understanding the increasingly complicated and involved ways in which we interact with electricity and magnetism has always been a goal of mine. Learning about topics like electric fields and how charges interact so far has already started to fulfill some of that desire, and I really look forward to learning more about these topics as we go forward. Another goal which this class will help me accomplish is my career goals. I’d like to be an engineer and work on microchip development. A firm grasp on how charges interact, move, and in general function sounds incredibly important for understanding physical design in that field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1969,"My goals are to be able to finish my major and get a job in engineering. I took the lecture portion of this lab about a year ago and am only doing the lab now due to an advising mix-up. This lab is still required for my major so it's really important for me to finish before graduating. Doing this lab, among my other classes during the pandemic has reminded me to be proactive with my classes and make sure I'm making the most of it for myself.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1971,"My goals are simply to earn my degree and to learn whatever skills I can earn that I can apply towards my career. With physics, I didn't really understand why we as Computer Science majors are required to take it, but I began to understand more when my friend explained to me how physics encourages dynamic thinking. So, my goal is to learn how to get better at dynamic problem solving and utilize it for my other classes and projects. I plan on making a point to see what kinds of processes I utilize for the sake of solving problems in order to get better at developing my software programs. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1962,"My goal is to get a better understanding of E&M and to be able to come to my regular lecture each week more prepared. I feel that this class is already helping me by doing the lab explorations. However, I feel that I need to spend more time understanding the material in each chapter so I can come to class with more questions."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1967,"Right now, I am still unsure of what my goals are for the future. At the moment, I plan on going to the next physics class after physics 230/232, and I am planning on working on my major for civil engineering. Other than just taking classes, I am not keen on what my goals are for my future. For now, I want to try to understand the the topics that are in these physics classes. Some of the topics I am comfortable with, but overall I still need to review the topics more so I can understand them in a more fundamental way. The physics lab class can help me achieve that goal through getting a better understanding of the material we learned in class and applying it in experiments and simulations."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1951,"My goals currently include maintaining my mental health, academic success, and creating a better school-life balance. Each of these are tied together, influencing what is important at any time. This class will help me with my goals because succeeding in this class also supports the lecture side of physics. Understanding the physical relationship between the math of lecture and the experimental evidence seen in class gives me something to visualize. I should make more goals. This class is currently making me think about my goals that I haven't thought about in a concrete way, this must be helping my mental health."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1961,My goal in this class is honestly to better understand the material that I am learning in the lecture. I like putting into practice what I am learning in the labs and collaborating with other classmates. Of course my main goal is to get a good grade because this class is a requirement for my computer engineering degree. I enjoy the post lab parts too because it's like an extra practice problem as well as gets me thinking of real life applications. I think this class can also help me make better models and diagrams that are clearer and easy to read. I learn more about why we use formulas such as Gauss's Law in this class too. I hope throughout this class I can explain my thought process when answering questions better. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1965,"My goals are to get a good grade in this class, graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer science and get a job in that field after that. Another goal would be to make enough money to live comfortably. This class can help me achieve my goals as it is one of the requirements that needs to be fulfilled in order to get a bachelor's degree in computer science. It is one of the many steps towards my goals."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1955,"My only real goals with college are to graduate and get a well-paying job. This class will help me understand the concepts in physics 230 and help me better understand the world around me. Though I will likely not use too much of this physics in my career, I believe physics is great for problem-solving skills. Physics has helped me with not just being able to mimic solutions I have seen. It has helped me fully understand concepts and apply what I have learned to solve problems. In computer programming, this skill is essential to becoming successful."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1958,"My goals in life are to be successful enough in my career so my family does not have to worry about finances. I want to work hard at a FAANG company, and this class is a prerequisite to other computer science classes that will help me get there. I plan to focus hard on computer science and as always be the best at what I do. I have always found my way in to a management level position everywhere I have worked. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1949,"My goal is to become a software engineer for a company of my choosing. And I believe that this class can help me achieve this because there are concepts in computer science that uses physics as well. And this being a lab helps me understand the concepts with hands on experiences. Physics helps understand how the world works and provides another outlook on nature that is necessary for computer scientists. It helps create or modify our thought process helping computer scientists think of different solutions to a certain problem. And depending on the type of work that is required, whether it be a video game or a simulation of earth, physics will be required to make the program as realistic as possible to get proper results."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1950,"My goal right now is to become a chemist for the future and a way I think this class will help me is by helping me understand the way things work outside of chemicals so maybe in the future I can use both. Another part of this class that I think helps me is to work on my calculus more and get more practice, since that is a big part of chemistry. Using real life situations and objects and their function with physics makes the calculus become more understandable and relatable, therefore i'm able to learn it better. My goals overall is to do something that makes a contribution to society in some way. I want to hep people. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1974,"The goal of mine taking this physics class is mainly because it is required for my major, but not limited to it. Because, I think that this class provides me with a broad understanding of the physical principles of the universe, that helps to develop critical thinking and quantitative reasoning skills, to empower to think creatively and critically about scientific problems and experiments. Because, these skills that are gained from this class will be needed for me as a software engineer."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1966,"My goal is to become and engineer. I want to help build and design to better benefit our community. This class will help me to achieve this goal in a few different ways. One, being that it is requirement class to obtain a degree in engineering. But not only is is t a requirement, this class will better help to develop my thinking and processing skills which is essational for becoming and engineer. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1956,"What are my goals? My goal is to achieve a Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and use that to find myself a nice and steady career to set me up for life. Right now I want to say that I am about halfway there or just a little over halfway. My college career so far has been quite an experience. Finding the perfect balance between school, work, and family and friends has been really tough and I haven't gotten the hang of things just yet. My goal is to finish college within the next two years making any absolute sacrifices if needed be. This class is helping reach my goal as it is a requirement just like any other class is. Learning and understanding the material that is taught has always been helpful for me. Most of the time I forget concepts over one semester which makes things really difficult to help reach towards my goal. Hopefully this semester is going to be different and I will successfully retain all the information and be able to carry it over to the upcoming semesters I have yet to finish."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1973,"My Goal in this class is to be able to gain knowledge and help me understand in order for me to be able to pass both my lab class and my Physics lecture class. One thing I do need to change as of now is dedicate a day to my lab class and work on the homework ahead of its due date. I underestimated the time it would take me to complete the homework, now that I know how long it takes me I believe I should dedicate a full day into the class. Another goal I have for the class, is to review my lab zoom lectures, at the moment I am currently working full time but due to my pregnancy I cannot afford to request several days of work since I am my only source of income, which is why i join the class but cannot truly engage while I am at work. Looking over the videos at home and before I am reviewing the lab allows me to understand and review the topic over."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1952,"My ultimate goal is to create a revolutionary engineering invention that will benefit society greatly. Learning about physics or math or any other engineering class just means I am closer to creating my invention. I look upto tycoons like jeff bezos and elon musk. They're successful because of their hard work. If I can keep doing everything in all of my classes, I can start applying all of this knowledge to something that really matters."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1970,"I want to create this goal more focused on this specific semester. I realized that I have been having some problems with creating a good work life balance. Just need to focus on more of my time management and how to space my time to work on things I need to or want to work on. So my main goal is to work on my time management skills and use it to schedule my everyday life. Not only schedule when to do work and studying, but as well I need to learn how to schedule some fun things or hobbies to do.I think that this class can help this goal of mine  based on how this class is structure allow us to do some work during the class time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1953,"I have many goals in life but the closest ones that I have and possible are being able to graduate in civil engineering as well as being able to find a stable job. There is many ways this class is going to help me as physics is embedded in any typical engineering major. This class will also help me gain more knowledge into the typical physics practicalities that are outside in the real world and by taking this class, I will gain more knowledge of the functionalities as well as the practical uses. This class will also reinforce my understanding in physics as it has always been a tough course for me so by taking these courses, I am able to get better at understanding and be also to gain a sense of how physics plays a role in our everyday lives which fits perfect to this course as we do labs. These labs give us minimal insight but help reinforce the physics topics that are present which has been really great in help."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1959,"My goals is to help me become more diverse and well rounded in learning and efficiency with my time. This class has helped me prioritize and break down the necessary work needed to be responsible. This was also true in the spring semester when I completed the first class with Professor Tennant, the labs force us to become more effectively time managed, which then helps us as students. My goals are indirectly influenced by the amount of time and effort I spend on completing assignments in this class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1947,"my goals for this class are pretty straightforward, really. I am a software engineer who never graduated in the 90s. Covid has allowed me to go back to school and finish up the degree which i have thought about for a long time! My goal is to get my degree. I want that piece of paper :) I do enjoy Physics a lot however. Maybe in a different life i would have pursued it more. I have been intrigued about how software develop physics engines and the like for games and other simulations. That sounds like a lot of fun.I think the reason this class is required for computer science is because we need to know the fundamentals around computer hardware if we choose to go in that direction. I haven't chosen that career path but the class is interesting to me. I have always felt that all knowledge is relevant (usually in ways we dont imagine) "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1960,"My goal is to pursue Computer Science Studies and finish my college within next 2 years. Then, I want to apply for the job related to my major.   This class can help me achieve these goals by first this class is a prerequisite for my major. Therefore, taking this class will help me fulfill my major requirement. Second, I feel that the logics and calculations in Physics help keeps the mind sharp, at least for me to some extent.  I also believe this class or the Physics course in general, will help me achieve my goals by reflecting the importance of organizing and time management because Physics is a demanding subject for me. Hence, by managing time and keeping up with Physics class along with other classes reflects the importance of being attentive and managing myself which I think is a significant quality not only for my goal but my life as well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1963,My goals are to stay focused during this school year and achieve good grades. This class as well as my other physics class are some of my toughest classes. This lab class serves to remind me of how focused I have to be to achieve my goals because of how rigorous is it. It takes time and effort to do well and understand the content this class requires to do well. I allow myself to put myself in an environment where I can not be distracted and where I can be fully attentive to the material being taught. Physics is applied in a lot of real world situations and I find learning the topics very interesting.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1948,"My goals for this class is to really take my time and work with my lab group in order to understand each lab and its material.  This class gives me an opportunity to make my own predictions and check through the simulations, lab group, and possible in person observations to see if I understand the material and came to the right conclusion.  Having a group is helpful in getting any help or answers for any questions.  Having a group also gives me a chance to see how others view the concepts and how they solve problems.  It is very helpful to see how the same questions are solved from different people.  Overall, I believe this class will further my understanding of physics and the concepts involved."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1957,"My goals are to learn about Science and Engineering. This class can help me achieve these goals as it is part of my major which is Computer Engineering, and it can be used in the real world as well. This class also teaches me how the concepts in Physics are used in our daily life. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,6,1972,My academic goal is to get a bachelors degree in computer science and this class will help me achieve that goal by reducing the requirements I need when I pass this class. Physics is not one of my strongest subjects but I hope to check this class and the physics 230 course off my checklist by the end of this semester. My other goal is to play soccer professionally but I'm not sure how this class can help me. Maybe as time passes I will get ideas on how this class helps me
