2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1886,This class has helped me way more than I thought it would. This class helped expand on topics that the lecture portion wasn’t very clear on. The lab portion gave me a visual and a hands-on feeling on some of the things we studied. My greatest take away from this class is that sometimes working in a group and handing a visual aid can make physics a thousand times easier than without it. Also I realized that a lot of the times in this class the topics were easier than I set them out to be. I had simply just made it harder on myself. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1877,"My greatest takeaway from this class is how you can both build on top of topics that you have previously learned as well as make novel conclusions just from 1 specific topic. For example, if you just learned about magnetism and electromagnets and that's all you learned (i.e you didn't learn about short circuit, voltage, current etc) you can still use understand how electromagnets work. This is unlike a subject like calculus where if you try and learn integrals before you learn how to do derivatives you are going to have a very difficult time. Because of this it allowed me to keep up when I didn't 100% understand concepts like flux however because you CAN also build upon past knowledge it understanding charges and electric fields in week 2 and 3 helped my foundation for understanding magnets in week 11. Overall what I take away from this is that you shouldn't slow down or stop just because you don't 100% understand something and some times learning other concepts can help with learning previous ones."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,598,"Teamwork, One of the most interesteding and important things I learned from this class was learning to work with other people from diffrent homes. This will hopefully be the last semseter online. It was ok but definatley not the best way for me to learn. I have greatley apreciated Hon the TA who has been really helpful. Definatley a great person. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1887,The greatest take away that I got from this class is that the things we learn in class can be seen in our everyday life. A lot of the things we do and things that we use implement some of the things that we learned during this course. For example the computers that we use almost every day implement the idea of magnetism due to the circuits that are found in them. And the breakers for the houses that we live in use the idea of parallel and in series circuits. There are a lot more examples of this that could be brought up which is why I believe that the things we learn in this class are everywhere.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1881,"My greatest take away from this class is that I need to be more observant with some of my daily life activities. What I mean by this is that this class really showed me that I can connect physics concept to everything almost every day. Most of these lab has shown me to connect physics concepts to everyday activities. Some activities are the usage of magnets and other electrical applications. The use of magnets in making certain machines and other electrical machines work and the use of circuits, this class has taught me how those ideas and concept work in a real-life scenario. I now know how magnets affect the inner workings of machines and what kind of work or energy is received from the magnets. I also now have a better idea of how to lay out an efficient circuit.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1889,"What was my greatest takeaway from this class?I have learned a lot from the courses this semester. To begin with, I love the course content of the CSS. I got to know more about the use of GitHub and creating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript pages in Visual Studio. The 2nd course on my list is Violent Earth. I personally loved this course as it has a lot of information about the disaster and a detailed explanation of its formation and causes.  The Internation Relations course is also my favorite. I got to know more about the political views of the County and their effect on the citizen. I got to know about Communism and Capatalist. One of the best lessons of my academic career was Calculus and Practical. I have a lot of takeaways from these two courses. First, the concept of the electromagnet, magnetic field, capacitors, and a lot of others, which were my favorite from high school was made clear through these courses. The practicals were very informative and interesting as well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1892,"My greatest takeaway from this class has to be the circuits portion of the course. Personally I found the circuits lectures and activities super fun to do. While it's not something I see myself doing in the future as a career, I can definitely see it become some sort of a hobby or pastime. I can't say the rest of the course aside from circuits is super interesting me as of now. I just see it as another thing I just need to learn in order to get closer to my degree."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1894,"This physics class is very hard in my opinion. I am not saying that I will fail this course, I will pass. I am just saying that the quizzes in this course are very hard and we barely get any time to do them. I think that we need more time to do the in class quizzes because we only get thirty minutes and it takes me like about five minutes to turn my quiz in so in reality we are only getting twenty five minutes to do the quiz. I want to pass this class because I have to finish it so I can graduate. This is the final hard class I have to take and I cannot wait to pass it. After this, I will only have to take a couple of upper division computer science classes and I will graduate. I am not a physics person so to be honest I do not like this class due to the fact that I absolutely hate physics. I just cannot wait to pass this course so I can be relieved. This course has a lot of material to do and study and it is taking most of my time. This is probably the toughest class I have taken this year."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,588,the greatest take away from this class is how important team work is in a group setting because of how we can all contribute in Different ways. Working by yourself can be tough sometimes because ther smith the stuff you dont know and need some help. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1890,"In this class, my greatest take away is I know how to perform an experiment. In this course, there are too many long pages describe and questions in our class material. But seeing them carefully and we will find the steps to help us to explore result. First, the simulator or prepared material is important. The simulator is help us progressing our experiment if we are not convenient to prepare materials. Like in magnetic field, voltage, these experiments are all need simulators. We need to control variable, change data to see the phenomenon then record down the results. And second, we need to try each factor and every different situation. Control the variable and keep only one variable is important, this can increase the accuracy of the results. In the end, recording results, be careful the units. And repeat experiment steps again to increase the accuracy of the results."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1896,"My greatest take away from this Physics class was the formation of expanding my knowledge within the Physics field. As a young student with my personal experience I can say that I learned much more about physics than I did in my pass grades, I understand that know we have to adapt to remote learning, or it might be the way the teacher teaches the class, I really like how the activities labs were presented and how each concepts had a mini representation of how to incorporate it into a new topic. I believe that with this class I expanded my learning much more to a level were I can go to a family member and explain to them something or a concept related to physics. The lab were relatively easy to complete, but the interesting part of the labs were the simulations because there are situations were I am visual learner and the simulations help me understand the topic and the concept and or equations used to solve a problem "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1891,my greatest take away from this class is that physics happens everywhere no matter where I look. What I mean by that is that whether you see it or not forces and a bunch of other hidden physics engines happen throughout the world. Physics is a magical discovery that lead the human race to build and design multiple building and apartments for people to work or to have a home.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1885,"I have many great take aways from this class. First, I loved learning about forces that act upon objects. I really did not know how many forces can act on just one moving or non-moving object. For example, there can be a normal force, gravitational force, friction force, kinetic force, etc. acting on a moving or a non-moving object. It was very fascinating to know all of this. I also loved learning about charges and how they attract and repel one another. That was my favorite topic in this class because it was very simple and straightforward. I now know that like charges repel and opposites attract, which is very useful in my life. I now question everything that I see in life and question how they really work scientifically. I am so grateful that I took this class and it just makes me more motivated and excited about learning more scientific theories and experiments in my own free time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1882,"From this class I can take away many applications of physics. I've learned how to apply physics concepts to my everyday life. I  also learned how to work with others on the labs, how to divide and conquer, as well as listening to different opinions. I  also learned the importance of putting information into practice. The lecture kind of goes in one ear out the other from the joint class. Actually seeing the concepts applied, working through specific questions, and seeing physical/animated simulations is very helpful in making the material stick. This class reminded me that to really learn a concept one must put it into practice."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1888,"Overall, this was a pretty good semester even though it was online. I believe my professors were easily accessible when I needed them."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1878,"The greatest takeaway from the course would be learning the fundamental aspects of current and electromagnetism. It gave me an idea about how power works based on magnetism. I find it interesting because our entire galaxy is also like a magnet. I also enjoyed working with simulations that resembled circuits that require a capacitor, resistance, and current. Working with those topics reminded me of digital electronics back in high school. I had to deal with currents, resistance along with the types of currents. Working with the types of resistance is also a factor, so it results in a different outcome. The lesser the current flow, the higher the resistance. Damaged conductors due to burning or corrosion might be one probable cause if the voltage is too high. That is because all conductors emit some heat. Overheating is a problem that is frequently related to resistance. I see resistance as an essential part of circuitry and outcomes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1895,"I would say that my biggest take away from this class is the fact that I do not enjoy learning physics. At least all the mathematical parts of it. Other than that, not much else."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1880,"From this class, my greatest takeaway from this class is about physics. After taking this class, I never realized how important physics is to this world. Physics is one of the most important topics of science to understand and learn. Life cannot exist without that conceptual knowledge of physics. Well of course, there are other sciences that are just as important and contribute to life such as: Chemistry, Biology, Geology, etc... But, you get what I mean. Physics explains how the laws of gravity and motion work around you. Physics also explains how electricity and magnetism works which you have been using your whole life. We know how to do lots of things because of physics. We can build constructions, circuits, houses, circuits, cars, and many more. None of the things I mentioned and many more can be made possible without the knowledge of physics. This is why understanding and exploring the beauty of physics is my takeaway. This class can lead me to exploring and unlocking how to appreciate the beauty of physics it can be to us living in this world."
