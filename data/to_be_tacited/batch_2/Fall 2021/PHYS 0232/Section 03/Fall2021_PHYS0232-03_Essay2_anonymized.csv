2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,588,"my goals for this semester is to try to stay on top of homework and try to be more outspoken in class, some things I can do in this class to help me is to speak up more during the lecture and ask more questions so I can be more comfortable speaking, I believe doing that will help me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1888,"My goal as far as my education is to get my BS in Computer Science. So in order to get that degree, I need to complete and pass this physics class. So far in this class, I don't know any specifics that I would be using in my career but this class is very informative for day-to-day life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1892,"I don't have any major goals at the moment, but I do aim to do well in all my current and future courses that I plan to take. What I am currently doing is making sure I keep any written record of my homework and when it's due. I save any files I write or download into a separate folder for the class it was for. So far, this class has helped me make sure I do any work I need to before I leave class which is a great habit to get into. While finishing all your homework before class ends might not be something I will always be able to do, it is something I can do if i have the time. I am slacking a little on homework than I should be but I always do my best to turn my work in on time. So far, I haven't had any major road blocks this semester but I'm prepared for one if it does come to pass."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1890,"In this class, we can learn many things not only the physic knowledge but there many thing in social. We need to communicate with others, we need to do the experiment together, we need to learn how to use our knowledge best. They are all important. My goals is master my knowledge, and become more adapt to communicate with other people. So, in this class, we have many chance to communicate, and we can master the knowledge by doing experiments which can help me remember the knowledge better. After I get a job, I also need use these skill in cooperation. Maybe I'm so shy to talk to stranger, I hope I can change it. Maybe I'm not very master our knowledge, but this course, can help me remember them. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1895,My goal at the moment is to finish getting my degree in Computer Science. I'm not quite too sure if this class will help with my goals since the topics aren't used in computer science. I suppose what this class will help me with is working on problems with real life application. So that might be useful later on.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1883,"My goal is to get my computer science degree so naturally I have to do well in this class and get a good grade so that I can graduate. With that being said, it has actually been such a delight to take this course because I love physics and learning about electromagnetism is fascinating. One thing that has always been on my mind is whether there could be an element out there that can conduct electricity that is biodegradable. Now I know the chances of that happening are very slim as everything we know to this point is very set in stone and we’ve kind of finished up the periodic table and we know what metals are and are not conductive but it’s something I’ve always pondered on. There has to be a better way to make computers without the use of metals. I’m very fascinated by bio alternatives that are biodegradable to replace most of the technology we have today. I’m fascinated by the intersection of computer science, engineering, physics, and environmental science to advance the world to a more sustainable future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1878,"My goal is to improve my data structures skills to be successful and confident when I get interviewed for a software engineering job. I need to spend my time learning the core of data structures then getting deeper into it. I will spend my free time practicing as much as I can as long as I don’t give up. A way this class can help me achieve my goal would possibly be when I maybe get into the game development side of computer science. I’m not interested in game development, but I have an option as I go through this journey. I know I can implement the material I’ve learned in physics and put it into certain aspects, like creating a website about physics or calculating something based on an algorithm. However, my main goal would be to improve my software engineering skills to land an internship over the summer and have a bright future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1882,"This class is a part of the requirements for my degree, along with maths like calculus and linear algebra. Besides just being a mandatory requirement, I  think this class will help me gain problem solving skills that will be useful in coding as a software engineer. The majority of our work is thinking about and solving problems. In physics all the problems are pretty unique but the equations, in a way, serve as relative algorithms. When it comes to coding problems most of them follow a certain pattern, like there is a certain logical model you can follow that can be used for codes over and over again. This is the same for physics. Although each problem is different, there are still equations you can mold to help solve the questions. I like how physics is super concrete and based. I think computer science is the same way. Both sciences are pretty black and white, either something works or it doesn't. In coding, although there are many ways to solve a problem, most of the time there is only one way that will fit into the rest of the code. Each method is like a piece of the puzzle and they all have to fit just right. We also have to consider the fastest algorithm, the most readable, and least verbose/ repetitive. Otherwise there will be bugs and issues when others code review or come in to modify sections of your code. Because Physics is so cut and dry it will help build the necessary skills to weed out unnecessary steps."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1894,"My main goal is to get my degree in computer science. This class will help me get my degree because it is one of the pre requisite for my major. Not only I am taking this class to complete my major, but I am taking this course because it is very important and it teaches a lot of useful information. To be honest, this class is one of the harder classes I have taken so far but it will teach me very important skills and information. After I pass this class, I will only have computer science classes to take which are just coding. I am very excited to pass this class because I will be one step closer to finishing my major and graduate from San Francisco State. I really believe that after I finish with this course, my understanding of life will become stronger and I will be more aware of the things around me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1884,RAHIMA KAKARPHYS 232-03What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?My goal for this class is to be able to pass it for my prerequisites. physics class has not been as hard for me as the labs for some reason. i hope i am able to pass this the first time since it will be more harder than my physics one lab since this is online and the subject seems harder. its hard for me to learn through a zoom class especially if its something hands on like a lab but i am able to get it done with the help of my group assigned for the labs and i know that i can always also get help from the professor through email and also from my classmates on discord.   
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1886,My goal is to get my bachelors in mechanical engineering and work for a major automotive company. One way that this class can help me by finishing this pre req to move on further to the next classes and another way this class can help is by teaching me new topics allowing me to expand my way of doing something and thinking. Probably the main reason for this class is to teach me the needed equations for physics so that in higher level classes i will fully understand the questions. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1877,"My main goal in attending SFSU is to expand my knowledge outside of what I already know. I am a computer science major however I have already been coding for 6 years and own a small web development agency. What I think this class will help me a lot with is understanding hardware, I know a lot about code but when it comes to electricity I'm not an expert yet. I have done some small hardware projects like building drones, and working with raspberry pis and arduinos but it would really help if I had a much deeper understanding of it. Also something that would be interesting to me down the road is quantum computing which I feel like this class would be a good stepping stone to that level however I'm pretty far away from that at this point. Overall my goal is to expand my knowledge past just software development and see how I can apply these new found skills to different coding projects and such."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,598,My goal this semester is to pass all my classes. By doing that I will pay close atention to all the lectures and assignments they give me. Hopefully this will be my last year online and can't wait to get back to campus. I do feel that this is a class that works a lot better in person. And if I need any help i would go to the office hours that are available or email if I have any questions about the material. This class will help me reach my goal by learning about what i will need for the next class that ill take whic i belive is circuits. I plan to get an A or at least a B for the whole physics section. I will have to study and read more on what i am missing from the class. It's a hard class but i know i will be able to pass it. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1889,"I didn't have any specific goals until my secondary level education. I used to enjoy all the subject matter, from Complex universe formation to English Literature. I used to thoroughly go through all the classes and try to gain as much knowledge as possible. Doing this for 2 years, I realized that the subject matter that has most intrigued me is Physics and Computer. I took extra classes at the Secondary level to gain more knowledge about Programming and its application. In doing so, I, unknowingly, got so interested in Computer Science that I could never take that out of my mind.  After starting my undergrad in Computer Science, I have a clear vision that I will continuously put my 100% effort into this field. Through these classes, I strongly believe that I will be able to gain a lot of knowledge in the Field of Computer Science. These classes will help me to provide a clear path for my goal. I want to become a Software Engineer in the future. Also, I want to apply this knowledge of Physics. I also have a strong inclination towards Astronomy. So, these classes are best for my goals."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1058,"One of my goals is to finish up college and this class can help me achieve this goal, by passing me to get the credits necessary to graduate. My major is Computer Engineering and using physics is something that is very important to know and use in engineering. I want to end up being a Software Engineer, but having knowledge of physics with help me with the electrical circuit classes I will have to take in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1880,"My goals are many things. One of my main goals is to graduate from this college at San Francisco State University and get a Bachelor's degree of Computer Engineering. Another one of my main goals is to pass this class with a grade of an A or B. A third main goal I have is to learn a lot more about the topics and concepts of physics and apply not only in class, but in my life outside of school. A fourth main goal I have is to simply try and fun in this class. I want to be able to enjoy myself and happy as I work and do experiments in this class. Of course, I also want to try to work and get along with with other classmates and the instructor. It's good to learn and be able to work with other people because in future jobs, you might be required to work with other employees and bosses to get the job done."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,189,"My goal this year is to persevere through my academics. It’s becoming harder and harder to for me to really do school right now. Life has started to stack up obstacles that have been hindering me lately and I amin my last legs of school. It’s harder to be motivated and with these obstacles popping up, I feel like my best option is to fall out. This year, if I am able to make it through academically, I would be so shocked and ecstatic. This class honestly will just be used as a stepping stone for me in order to graduate. My area of focus doesn’t really pertain to physics however, it has been a requirement for a lot of stem courses. I feel as though labs have the ability to really help me understand the material that is being taught by my physics professor. I like how engaging this course is, it also really forces me to get out of my comfort zone in order to work with other people. Normally, I would finish my labs on my own, but this class encourages team work and and duality. It is a  little annoying at times but slowly I have been accommodating myself with the procedure. I just really want to be able to finish this school semester strong. We’ll see what comes from that desire."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1879,"This class has a lot to teach me and although it is difficult, working with a team and having to stay longer to complete the lab exploration has benefited me. My main goal is to pass, of course, but also understand the concepts of physics as we see it in the real world. The way you can help me achieve this is basically doing the same thing you have done since the beginning. I see that the way this class is going, I will be able to achieve my goal."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1881,"One of my goals in life is to become a successful computer scientist. There will be times where a computer scientists will be tasked to make a program that involves real life scenarios. The way that this class will help me is by helping understand when and how to use physics skills in programs I will make. Trying to make programs that takes real life scenarios and figure out data from it or even change how a normal scenario to something completely different, I will need to have some sort of knowledge in physics to make a program like that possible. So seeing these physic lab simulation will show me what it could look like in real life or see an actual in person reaction, does teach me how these physic concepts actually works. This understanding will let me a better and precise program that shows off proper and correct physics data or simulation."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1885,"I have many goals that I need to achieve. When I graduated from high school, I decided to go to college and receive a bachelor degree. I went to Foothill college and decided that I want to transfer to a 4 year college after 2 years. After 2 years, I applied to transfer to many Universities and I got in to most of them. After thinking about where I wanted to go, I decided to go to San Francisco State University and study to receive a bachelor degree in science, computer science. My current goal is to graduate from San Francisco State University and get a job after that pays well and makes my family and I happy. To achieve this goal, I need to take many upper division classes and GEs. One of my required classes is physics. This is why I need to take this class to graduate and achieve my goal."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1893,My goal is to get a bachelors in Computer Science and have a better understanding on how to code and improve on my problem solving skills. This class is required which is why I am taking it but I do enjoy learning about how physics is applied in the real world and the concepts behind the way certain things work. I've been struggling a little bit so far but it is definitely something I can work on to improve in my learning.
