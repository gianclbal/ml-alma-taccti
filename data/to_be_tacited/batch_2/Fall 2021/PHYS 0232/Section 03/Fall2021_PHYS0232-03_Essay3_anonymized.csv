2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1895,"What's the use of learning short circuit? After learning about it, I can understand how it works and what it's used for. It needs to be in a closed loop for it to flow. There are two different types of of circuits such as series and parallel. These are used in our everyday lives. For example, the houses we live in uses a series circuit and only series circuits. This is the case if there is a short circuit, a fuse can stop the flow for everything while a parallel series wouldn't."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,598,"One question that i had was in regards to things like efields. How do efields work and what kind of benefits do they have in real world applications. We learned that efileds go away from the positive charges when shown to sensors, so the closer the sensor is to a positive efield the strong away the efields will show. And thus, in a negative charge, the efields would go towards the charge itself. As we tested in our efiled lab, we looked to see if multiple sensors also react differently to a positive or negative charge. Knowing about efields, will help us understand a bit more in the upcoming sections such as currents."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1886,One of the most useful concepts we have learned so far is circuits. This is because circuits are used in every technology we use or even the home we live in there are circuits all over. From a simple design as to how we turn a light bulb on or do a more complicated idea such as the laptops/tablets most people use. Circuits are an important idea to learn specially as stem majors because understanding the basic function of how electricity works will help when developing new ideas.  Understanding the idea of how a positive and negative charge and resistors work help in understanding just some of many small engineering basics. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1890,"I select concept is about the short circuit. What's the reason to lead short circuit and what it causes.  In our real life, the power may goes-off sometime, one of the main reasons is the fuse is too heat until it won’t work, in my points of views, the fuse is like a resistor, If the current is getting stronger by each time, the fuse will increase the resistance to protect the whole circuit. There is a way to find is it short circuit. If it in parallel connection, except the short circuit line is not work, other line can work. If in series, the whole line can't work. Many electirc appliance use it. When the temper is higher than it limit, fuse will increase the resistance to protect that make it stoped. But some fire disasters also because of it. It's so danger."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1880,"A topic that caught my attention on my mind is the lab experiment we did about last week ago which was about short circuits. This lab experiment required making a basic circuit out of batteries, tape, and aluminum foil. This lab was the introduction to learning about electric circuits. Learning about the things from this lab is one of most important topics not just in physics, but in life as well because electricity is being used by everything and everywhere we go. Electric circuits are installed almost in every building you go to. Especially at your house, apartment, or wherever you live, you use the lights at your home mostly at night time. If electrical circuits was not taught or did not exist, then everyone would have to live everyday without lights or power. It is hard to see in the dark. This is why lights and electrical circuits was invented and one of the main reasons why electricity was discovered. The main question I have for this lab experiment topic is about fuses. What are fuses and how do they work. I learned all the answers to these question through this lab I am talking about. Fuses are an electrical safety device that provides current protection to electrical circuits. Fuses can stop or disrupt the changing pattern of current flowing. Almost every house or building had a fuse box that must require to be in a series circuit. The reason for this is because if fuses are put in parallel circuits, it can cause your house or building to explode or set on fire since the current is flowing in different paths. But when fuses are designed into series circuits, it will stop current flowing all over your house or building which prevent fires and explosions. This is why this lab experiment is important to me and why fuses are important to learn. You would not want the wires and current in your house to set on fire and explode which is very dangerous!     "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1888,"A topic that we have covered recently was circuits. An electric current is what flows through the wire. There an open, closed, parallel, and series circuits. Open Circuits won't light a light bulb because the wire isn't closed.  A closed-circuit is able to light a light bulb. In a series circuit, if one fuse or bulb gets fuse, then the rest of the bulbs will not get a power supply and will not glow. In a parallel circuit, if one load or bulb gets fuse, then the rest of the bulbs will still get a power supply and will glow. I believe this is important to know because electricity is something we use every day."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1881,"How good will a wire be made out of a metalloid?     The answer to this question is that it will be somewhere in between a wire made of metal and a nonmetal. This is because metalloids are materials that are not entirely made out of metallic elements and are have similar properties as a metal. The more the material becomes more of a metal, the resistivity of the material goes up. A higher resistivity results in a wire that conducts very poorly. The opposite is similar as well. When the material becomes more nonmetal, the resistivity goes down. The lower the resistivity, the flow makes a really good conducting wire. So a metalloid wire is a good way to have some resistance to slow down the current of electricity but still maintain a good speed so current can flow fairly fast. This information helps by trying to figure out what material should be used to make circuits. When making circuits, trying to figure out what material should be used to maintain good flow, price of material, quantity needed, and many other questions to help determine what goes into making a good circuit. Knowing what material to use will determine how good the circuit is and how well the current will flow."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1885,"Why does a neutral charged object always attracts a positive or a negative charged object?Any charged object, whether positively charged or negatively charged, will have an attractive interaction with a neutral object. Positively charged objects and neutral objects attract each other, and negatively charged objects and neutral objects attract each other. The protons or positive charges are always bound to the nucleus of the atom and cannot move freely. When a conductor is brought close to a negative charge, the electrons that are free to move will move away from the charge as far as they can.  A positively charged object will repel another positive charged object and will attract a negative or a neutral charged object. A negative charged object will repel a negative charged object and will attract a positive and neutral charged object.This is very useful to our society. We mostly use the charges in a battery or magnets. In magnets for example, the positive charged end of the magnet will attract a negative charged end of another magnet which will result in the magnets to come closer to each other; and vice versa. I love using magnets mostly on my refrigerator. Magnets stick to refrigerators because the fridge is opposite charge of the magnet."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1894,"Will a positive charge attract vectors? There is a magnitude for every electric field vector and it is calculated as the force per charge on any given test charge located within the electric field. The force on the test charge could be directed either towards the source charge or directly away from it. The precise direction of the force is dependent upon whether the test charge and the source charge have the same type of charge or the opposite type of charge. A positive source charge would create an electric field that would exert a repulsive effect upon a positive test charge. So, the electric field vector would always be directed away from positively charged objects. On the other hand, a positive test charge would be attracted to a negative source charge. Therefore, electric field vectors are always directed towards negatively charged objects. Multiple test charges can cause a stronger and larger effect on the vectors. For example, if there is two charges right next to each others and there is a vector one step to the left and another one two steps to the left, the closer the Electric field is the larger and stronger the charge effect will have therefore the one that is one step to the left will have a larger vector that is pointing to the left."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1896,"What is the difference between electric potential and electric potential difference?  Electric potential is the work done per unit charge in order to bring that charge from infinity to a point in the electrostatic field against the field force. Comparison with potential difference is… Potential difference is the energy possessed by Electric charges is known as electrical energy. A charge with higher potential will have more potential energy and the charge with lesser potential will have less potential energy. The current always moves from higher potential to lower potential. The difference in these energies per unit charge is known as the electric potential difference. This is applicable in our life because in circuit a charge will be moving through the wires of the circuit and will encounter changes in electric potential as it traverses the circuit. Within the electrochemical cells of the battery, there is an electric field established between the two terminals, directed from the positive terminal towards the negative terminal. As such, the movement of a positive test charge through the cells from the negative terminal to the positive terminal would require work, thus increasing the potential energy of every Coulomb of charge that moves along this path. This corresponds to a movement of positive charge against the electric field. It is for this reason that the positive terminal is described as the high potential terminal. Similar reasoning would lead one to conclude that the movement of positive charge through the wires from the positive terminal to the negative terminal would occur naturally."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1883,"Why is an Electric Field similar to gravity and why are their similarities relevant? Well, an electric field is a force with attracts or repeals charges and is stronger the closer the distance between the two charges. Similarly, gravity is a force that attracts objects together and is stronger the closer the distance is between the two objects. The interesting part is gravity only has an attractive force while electric fields can attract or repel depending on the type of charge. I feel like this information benefits society because it shows how there may be a missing link between the theories of physics and points to how there may be one unifying theory. For example, if humans were to find a way to make gravity repel objects, then it could be a huge help for society to apply this type of physics to the natural world. I don’t know, that’s probably a stretch. But it really makes me wonder. Wouldn’t it be cool if the reason the universe is expanding at a faster and faster rate is because it’s experiencing something similar to anti gravity? If human’s could find a unifying equation for all things in physics, we could finally truly understand how the world works to the best of our abilities."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1891,How circuits flow.In lab I learned that circuits flow from the highest to the lowest volt. How we can prove it is by adding two light bulbs and the light that is first to the battery will be brighter than the light bulb after. this is because the light absorbs most of the volts.  The circuit must always be a closed circuit in order for the light bulb to light up. if its open the light will never be turned on. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1877,"I think short circuits are a very interesting topic and applicable in a very unique way. it's a concept where it's something that you try and avoid, no one wants their electronics to short circuit and there are a lot of techniques that are used to prevent short circuits. i'd like to imagine when the first lightbulb was being invented a ""short circuit"" was used as a sign of failure. Becuase lightbulbs work by passing electricity through a resistive wire when the wire didn't resist enough that would result in a short circuit which in turn would signal failure. There are not many concepts like this usually you are trying to achieve something and you know its working when that things happens, i.e if you are trying to light an LED you know it works when it lights, but short circuits are something you can use to also tell if something is working. If an electronic device is not short circuiting that is a really good indication that its working (at least to an extent). I just find it very interesting that we need to do a lot of research in what not do to in order to figure out how stuff works."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1892,"The information from lab that I can relate and use daily is the Short Circuit lab. I say this because we're surrounded by circuits. Whether its the electricity in your house or the motherboards in our phones, they're everywhere. One thing that I recently learned from this lab is why fuse boxes are set up in a series. This would be to prevent from any other fuses from blowing up when it trips. Initially I used to think so it's easier on the eyes or so it would fit in the box but it actually serves a purpose. Its not a great idea to assume anything regarding technology is easy on the eyes, it's more for efficiency."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1893,What is the importance of understanding circuits?It is important to learn how to use circuits and be safe with them because they could potentially be dangerous. During the previous lab when we connected the two pieces it created a spark. Circuits are pretty important as they are used in most electronics and technology and electronics are important parts of our lives in this age of the world. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1878,"Based on this course, I would say the current topic is one factor that would be implemented in our lives. When I think of the current, I think of so many things, yet there is currently around us under our own home. The outlet, fuse box, computers, and in general electricity are so practical in our daily lives. There is a current when charging a phone. The power that gets absorbed from a capacitor through a wire depends on many factors and or things. Current can vary based on the amount of energy, current, and many other things. Every room I go to has current. An outlet that powers some sort of machine or device. When going in-depth about these things, I realize that every current has a resistor, depending on the wire resistivity. When the fuse turns off, I’ve always wondered why that would happen, but now with the ongoing course. I can determine what the probable cause would be.  When a capacitor (battery) has to power specific sources, it all depends on the volts. The number of volts determines how much current will pass through and how many sources it can power. This is what I mean by having multiple devices that require power."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1879,"Last week we discussed circuits and how energy is transferred through a silver strip. We took into account how it transfers and took and even more in depth look at how to draw an actual circuit. This experiment correlates to real life because we use fuse boxes as an essential form of living. We use fuses to power our homes and drive our cars. Fuse boxes will advance I hope in the future and we will be able to have fuses boxes that wont break. Overall, learning about circuits was essential to see how volts work and energy transfer."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1882,"I'm not really sure how most of the concepts we have gone over can be applied in a daily life type of way. In a broader sense, the understanding of these concepts help fuel engineers and scientists as they make advancements, technologically and medically. From that it does eventually get back to people's daily lives in things like electro shock therapy, that I  have to do for my carpel tunnel. One interesting thing that stood out from last week's lab was the importance of a fuse, from my time in a few third world countries, they are not as widely used or mandated, leading to a lot of electrical accidents. However, here in the states we have fuses on all sorts of things to take electrical surges rather than having sparks fly every which way.Another question I have would be about the applications of flux. It seems like a pretty theoretical concept that helps us to visualize things. Through my lecture class, I found it a bit difficult to grasp the concept until i saw it in action through our labs. One real life example that really helped me visualize this was by imagining the flux surface as a coffee filter and the coffee as the electric field lines. It flows through the filter, leaving the surface itself neutral."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,588,"one thing I can connect to real life is circuits. You need a positive and a negative charge for it to work because same charges will only mess up the circuits, you can look at lights for an example, in order for it to work you need a positive and negative charge"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1889,"The most intriguing question that I came across was on the topic of Superconductor. I found the concept quite interesting and applicable. The question would be How Superconductor would be helpful in our life?To begin with, superconductor has amazing properties at very low temperature. At around 10 K it has amazing properties that conduct electricity without any resistance. It can be applicable in our daily life. We could save a lot from that. But the problem remains. It is hard to keep the wire at a very very low temperature for a very long time. It might seem very useful in daily life, but because of these temperature restrictions, it has become very expensive. I have also found that the concept of superconductors is used in the Maglev train. The superconductor does not let the magnetic lines of force pass through it. In recent times, the study of superconductors at room temperature is extensively done. Many scientists are searching for some materials or alloy that can behave as a superconductor even at room temperature. This would remove the temperature restrictions and the application of the superconductor would increase rapidly. It would save a lot of energy wastage."
