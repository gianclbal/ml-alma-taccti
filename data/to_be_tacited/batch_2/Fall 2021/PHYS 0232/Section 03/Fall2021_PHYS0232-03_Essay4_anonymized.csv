2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1894,Online classes have been good and not good at the same time. It is good because you get to do all the work that needs to be done at home which is really relaxing. It is not good because there is no connection in school anymore. Talking with teachers and interacting with other students is not here anymore. I like the online classes because they tend to be understanding towards us which means that they don' tend to be that hard.  The one thing I miss about going to in school learning is the interactions with students and teachers. Also going to the library to study and to the cafeteria to eat. It was such a nice experience and I really do miss it. Another thing is doing science labs in person is way more fun than doing them online. I would love to go back to in school learning and I hope it returns soon.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1890,"I don’t like online course, especially, I don't have chance to see my professor, my classmate.  And in class, although our professor will help us, we still can't do a real experiment. I just use my spirit to support me. The online class makes low efficiency. I really like asynchronously courses; I can take them in daytime. I register some asynchronously classes that I can take them like normal. I can have enough time to sleep. The online class need I find another time to find professor if I have question. And in order to learn good, I need review notebook, before I do my homework. I really like professor will record class in the video. I can skip to where I’m confused and watch it again. There are only a thing is good, the online course can protect us from epidemic.   "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1891,online classes have impacted my learning because for all of my labs that I am doing it all just watching videos of other people doing the experiment. It gets frustrating because I am a hands on type of learner where I have to experiment and toy with a couple of things in order to find the answer. It is unfortunate that it has to be this way but I am glad that online learning is ending soon.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,588,"doing online Classe so far has been good, its still stressful as going to class In real life but the fact I dont have to worry about making it to class on time is a good feeling. One thing that concerns me is sometimes Its hard to stay focus because we are online, overall this is a good learning experience "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1880,"For me personally, online classes have been a mixed of positives and negatives for my learning experience. The positives of taking online classes are that I am able to to homework and class assignments for school in my own comfortable personal space. I do not have to worry about others and keep everything to myself personally. I also do not have wake up early to take the bus to get to class in order to be physically present. All I have to do is turn on my laptop or computer and log into the SFSU website to be present. It is easy to get to class on time for attendance with a click of a button. The negative side of online classes is that it is more difficult to get help if you are struggling with homework or class assignments. I know we have online resources, but sometimes, getting person-to-person help seems better with certain classes because it is more taken seriously. I am trying to do well and pass my classes. My concerns are whether I am going to pass the physics class or not."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1896,"To my personal experience I don’t believe my learning as been affected by the online classes but I am going to say its a bit difficult to adapt to classes being at home because its more difficult to communicate with the professor through a computer. Is not as having the opportunity to ask the professor something in person for it to be well explained. Another this that I think online learning as affected in general is the cluster of classes where there is no time for any physical activity. For my self care I am putting in place to manage how many hours I sleep each day. I am also putting in practice some meditation to relieve some stress. I feel these two processes have really help with my heath care, and adding to that I am practicing to box in my free time since boxing is an interesting sport"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1058,"I feel about 50/50 toward online learning; there are some benefits and there are some downsides to online learning. When we first got into online learning, I felt as if it was very hard to retain information when learning online, but now how I feel about it is that there are some instructors that excel at getting their points across, while others can't virtually. Like the previous 2 semesters, I've lost motivation to learn as it was hard to understand certain concepts. But this semester, I've had instructors that really want to help their students learn and take the time to slowly explain concepts so that their students could understand it as if it were in-person classes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1893,I feel that with online classes I am not as productive as I should be because I have so many things disposable to me at home and a loud environment as I live with my family that it is hard to concentrate and turn in work on time. I feel that with my learning online I won't have received as much information as I would have liked to about certain topics. I try my best to be focused and on time with my assignments but sometimes it is hard to control my urges. I think so far however I have been handling it somewhat better compared to the previous semester. For self-care I have been playing video games and spending time with friends and family to take my mind off of school and other stressful situations currently.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1879,"Online classes have both helped and not helped. I feel when it comes to group work or actually getting adequate help form classmates, it is hard. The reason it has helped is due to me saving money on transportation and giving me the ability to still attend class even though I am not home at times. Overall, I hope we can have hybrid classes. But only with a vaccine mandate on campus."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1877,"Personally, I love online classes it makes planning stuff soo much easier. What I like the most about it is that you don't need to waste a whole bunch of time getting ready, walking to class, sitting in class, and walking back to your apartment. It makes life so much more efficient. Overall I think my mental health is good however I am trying to start a business and do school at the same time which can be tough at times. If I ever get too stressed I will just take a break for a day and get high which helps a lot. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1882,"Online class is completely awful. Majority of teachers have no regard for anyones lives at all. They assign hours on hours of homework and do not understand that students have work and other responsibilities. They assume we are only doing one class and assign an insurmountable amount of homework. Often times I have two or more assignments due for the same course at the same time. The exams are also given not at designated class times just at the professors leisure. There is no separation between home and school, thus students have to be studying and doing homework all hours of the day it never ends. I have two jobs one part time one full time and i go to school full time there is absolutely no time for me at all only a never ending work flow. Teachers need to get a grip and realize if they teach properly then there is no need for hours of homework. They should be available for questions and not be avoiding emails and questions. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,189,"Online classes have proved to be difficult in some ranges. For certain classes, I feel that being face to face causes a better understanding of the material. I do like it in some aspects though, but it feels as if some professors are requiring way to much work. I have a professor that assigns four assignments a week and it’s like very detrimental because i can only spread myself so thin. I know I’m in Stem but sometimes it’s like the workload is so unreal and with work and everything, I don’t even know How I’m surviving.  I will end up reporting that professor though, and leaving a mildly negative review on rate my profesor though. I feel like as a physics professor, if you aren’t even allowing late work from students then that is unrealistsic. You can’t assign work like we’re your only class then get mad when it’s hard to keep up, like please pick a struggle. Anyways I’m doing fine in most of my classes so yay."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1892,"Online classes have more so impacted my sleep schedule in terms of my self-care. I usually end up sleeping around 4am-5am and depending on the day I wake up between 10am-12pm. The only times I am able to sleep a full 8 hours is the days I work. I work at 3pm and I wake up around 1:45pm. From time to time, I do sleep well on a school night but usually I end up sleeping less due to my work schedule being tailored to my sleep schedule rather than the other way around. It's not concerning to me, if anything it'll impact me later on in life. It's more of an annoyance but I might end up quitting my job soon due to the work environment. Long story short, management is not making good decisions and is impacting every employee except management which is not my cup of tea."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1889,"Describe how online classes have impacted your learning and what you  are doing for self-care. What concerns do you have for your learning and  your well-being?After the completion of high school, I have always wanted to try something different. Be it in terms of course or way of learning.  I love reading in a traditional class setting. In this type of class, I could learn more, and also it's a great way of socializing. But apart from this, I wanted to try online learning. This could be a completely new experience for me. The most important part of taking an online course is that you could take it at the place of your convenience. I could be at my bed while learning to code, or I could be outside in a park and solve physics numericals. Along with some advantages, online learning has some disadvantages as well. One must not forget that they are constantly looking at the screen. There are some harmful rays coming out of the screen, Blue-ray, which could damage our eyesight. So, to take care of this I take small breaks in between my classes. I get some fresh air and start the next session. I also do regular exercise to keep my body fit. As I am sitting most of the time, so exercise is important for me. I suggest everyone, who is taking an online course, to focus on exercise and take small breaks in between the classes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1886,Going from in person to online classes has to be one of the most difficult things I have done. The reason being that online classes feel much harder as I can't really ask for help. Also online classes require so much more work than an in person class. With this huge change I feel like I have been cornered into this 24/7 cycle of always studying or doing hw. What I’ve been doing since the beginning of online classes is trying to finish all my assignments as soon as they are handed and also I try to give myself some time off of screens and do some physical activity just to relax and distract myself from school. The only thing that concerns me is how going back to in person classes will create another dramatic change and how I would have to adapt to that again. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1895,"For me, online classes feel a lot better. One of the main reasons is not needing to travel to campus everyday which saves me so much more time. However, I also walked everyday when going to school which meant my daily physical exercise was now gone. So now I'm working out at home instead just to keep my body active."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1881,"I believe that online classes foe me has not really made learning any more difficult or easier. I still feel that I would still learn at my normal rate as if I was in a normal and in person class setting. The only difference that probably changed was my drive to do my homework. Since I am at home already, I usually do not have a strong desire to do it and get it done. I still do get my homework done and a reasonable rate, but there are definitely some moments where it was either rushed or I have given myself not a lot of time. Outside of school responsibilities, the only issue I have is that I definitely do not have a stringer desire to go out and exercise. The weight gain is noticeable. However, once online learning is over, hopefully I can fix these school and health issues."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1888,Personally for me I like to physically be in class and sit in the front roll to help me grasp the material I am learning. When we first started online classes I did not like it. It was easy to procrastinate and It I couldn't go to my professors physically if I had questions. But now that it has been a while doing online classes I have learned how to adapt and find a style that works for me when it comes to my classes and the way that I learn.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,598,"Online classes have not been the best. The labs have been ok, but i have missed out on working on hands on labs not just in this one, but in other labs that i have taken for my major. I'm sure this will be the last semester like this, at least for me. As for the self care, its ok I guess. It just gets frustrating sometimes. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1885,"Before covid 19 had an impact on the world, I was really stressing about how I would commute to San Francisco State University. I live in Mountain View, so if I were to commute to school everyday, I would have had a really hard time managing my time. Then Schools closed and all classes became online. This made my school work become much more easier and more manageable. I did not have to commute to classes every day and all my classes were online. At first, I thought that online classes were going to be more difficult because it would be more difficult to contact the professors if I had any questions about anything. Though, I was very wrong and I learned that online classes were much more easier than regular in person classes. I started to receive much more better grades than when I had in person classes which made SFSU accept me. I hope that online classes will continue for longer time because I find them much easier than regular classes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1878,"Online classes made me more dependent on my learning rather than asking other people questions most of the time. I learned to solve a problem on my own and teach myself by iterating through my notes. It gave me a skill that I didn't have, and it allowed me to become more confident in the upcoming materials I needed to learn. However, it's crucial to balance out social life as looking at the screen most of the time can get wearying. It isn't healthy for a person to be looking at a pixelated screen most of the time as it'll alter your eyesight. My major consist of staring at the screen all day, so it doesn't make it any better. Online classes can be scary when you don't know what you're doing since there isn't any remote help, but I guess that's what office hours are used for. I need to take advantage of office hours as they may be beneficial to grasp. In all honesty, I prefer online classes as it is more convenient for me instead of commuting and all that mess."
