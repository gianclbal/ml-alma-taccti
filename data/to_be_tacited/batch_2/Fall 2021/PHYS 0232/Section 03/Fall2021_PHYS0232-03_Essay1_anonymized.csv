2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1877,"I never really chose to go into the stem field, it was more of an accident. Most of the things that I was interested in were stem-related I started out playing video games and was just curious about how they worked and I found that I liked the analytical problems that coding provided. From there I used to code in order to make solutions for my self such as a scheduling app that I made for SFSU that auto-picks which classes are the best. It's fun to be able to solve problems in a better way than anyone else and give yourself an advantage because you can do it better. Back in 2016, I started my own software development company which helped propel me into a lot more stem concepts outside of school because I was always expanding my business."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1878,"I am part of the STEM field because I major in computer science. It is one of the majors that interest me out of everything. Sometimes it may not be easy, but it can be fun to work with on several occasions. Sometimes, it can be a puzzle, making you lose track of time when you are attached to a particular topic or concept. Usually, a STEM major is where the money is, so I’m guessing that’s another factor why everybody else would be in the STEM field. Going into the STEM field makes me feel acknowledgeable and empowered to work on something new and vital for society. As we all know by now, computer science is what will shape our future. From artificial intelligence to machinery and much more. As Elon musk says, “for an AI, there will be no death — it would live forever.” That stands out for me, and it stands out in the whole STEM field as well. It just proves that the STEM field is essential."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1879,"When I first started my college career, I actually was interested in biology. Though after a few classes I didn’t think it was for me. I then asked a few friends about their majors and one of them told me it was computer science. I remember he showed me some of his work and even though it was difficult I liked the challenge. I began to study it on my own and once I began to take courses that will lead me to a computer science degree, I liked it too much. The challenge and the group work really got me excited to keep going. I never really enjoyed math, but when it tied so much into computer science I had to to force myself to learn. Overall, I hope that it can give me a career that will help others."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1880,"I want to go into the STEM field for many reasons. As a Computer Engineer major, I am interested into learning about computers and technology in general. More specifically, I am into learning about the external and internal parts about computers. I am also interested in learning about the computer software and a little but of computer programming.Before going into college and getting accepted into San Francisco State, I joined a computer coding club and tried to do computer programming in high school. I also built a a PC with my uncle which was a lot of building, creativity, and a lot of fun. I was always interested in building and working with computers. I can imagine myself working for Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, or any tech. company. My uncle sort of works for an IT/tech. company which I guess you can say is part of the reason why I am interested in going into the STEM field. Not to mention, the pay is pretty well when it comes to career paths/jobs in the STEM field. Computers may be hard to understand and is frustrating at times, but I believe that I can make it by putting the right amount of hard effort. This is why I want to go into the STEM field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1881,"I went into the STEM field because of my interest in computer application. When I learned that coding is essentially in almost in most everyday technology we use on a day to day basis, seeing all the uses of what a computer can do just made me want to become a computer scientist even more. I wanted to be part of the something, by myself, with a group, or with an organization, I wanted to help contribute in making a product that a computer scientist works on. Whether its from scratch and from the ground up or working on something that is already established, I want to be part of that working force to keep making project that requires a computer scientist."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1882,"If I'm being completely honest the only reason I'm majoring in CS is because the $$$, but also the amazing work/life balance. I know that the actual hours aren't to bad and the ability to work from anywhere is a big thing in my book. When I  was choosing a major it was basically ""which job will not take over my life and allow me to support myself and travel"". CS was the only thing that ticked all the boxes. I would be lying if I said I wasn't interested in coding because I definitely am. It's a great bonus that the subject is so interesting, I enjoy creating working codes. Through work I develop web components and implement them which is super interesting. The worst part about stem is honestly the school work, it's constantly dragging me down with minimal learning. The majority of my courses have been math and science, I'm hoping after this physics course my classes will consist primarily of coding and developing software. The thought of creating the next big application, like facebook or uber is a big driver for me. As a woman in stem I  always feel the need to be 10x better than everyone to be seen on the same playing field. I don't really feel like I have to prove myself, I just want to be. The compensation definitely helps. As a gifted burnt out kid, there's also an element of 'i have to do something smart because people always tell me that my life would be wasted otherwise' which sucks lol. I wish I set lower expectations for myself, that way the pressure wouldn't be weighing in right now but its too late. Oh well, I can cry on my yacht."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,189,"I’ve been asked this question so many times while in college and it’s always the same repetitive answer. If I am to be honest, money plays an enormous factor in my decision of completing a degree within the stem field. Why I am saying this is due to the fact that I am an immigrant and growing up In America wasn’t easy. Of course my family’s situation has improved immensely since then, however as a result of my past, I have made it a duty of mine to be settled in a high paying career. Being in stem is a foundation for me to fall on. However, being in Stem wouldn’t have been my first choice. I would’ve wanted to be in the arts but financially that’s an improper mindset to have so I am just persevering at this point. Its sad that this is the world we live in but I’d rather be sad and rich than to be broke and happy or ‘content’ with life. I am in my fourth year of college and I will be taking one more year to graduate. I will be graduating in fall of 2022 so i guess I can say that so far I’ve been keeping up, and once I am able to go into my field of study; the first pay check I have will be used to help my parents out financially because they’ve been such a blessing in my life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1883,"I want to go into the STEM field because I’m very nerdy and I love learning about the world in a formulaic way. I was never very good at Liberal Arts fields like writing and such (even though I have major respect for those in those fields). I don’t know, I’ve always clicked with Math, Science, and similar courses. I’m particularly studying Computer Science which I am loving so far! Coding is extremely fun and I love problem solving. Learning about how one can break any problem down into an algorithm for a computer to solve is extremely interesting to me and often on my free time, I like thinking about tedious things we do every day that could be done more efficiently by a computer program. It’s weird because I’m a women of color so I know I’m going to be the minority in my field of work but hopefully things will get more equal when it comes to representation soon."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1884,"Rahima Kakar  Phys 232-03  Reflection # 1  “Why do I want to go into the STEM field?”  In school when we had to take general ed classes like English, math, history and science I noticed that I look more forward to my math and science class rather than my English and history classes. I was always more comfortable in my math and science rather than my English classes because I understood math and science better because there if was very straight forward it didn’t require creativity or personal opinions like English and history did. I also didn’t like the about of reading and writing that was involved in English and history even though I enjoy read I don’t enjoy writing as much because there are a lot of rules to writing. Which is why when I got the chance to pick my major in college, I was very confident that I wanted to do something in the STEM field to avoid writing and enjoy solving problems."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1885,"I have always wanted to be a computer engineer, since I was in high school. This is because in our generation moving forward, mostly everything will be electrical and will work based on computers. This means that I have many opportunities to work anywhere I go. I started taking Java classes in high school so I get myself familiarized with the field that I want to be in for the rest of my life. In high school, I found this field quite difficult for me to understand, though I did not give up and started watching youtube videos and tutorials until I became more comfortable with it. Also, most of my cousins who live around me also have a degree in computer science and are working for amazing companies, so I have a high chance of them helping me find a job fast right after I graduate and get my degree. I hope that I get even better taking upper division classes in SFSU and become a master at coding!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1886,"I want to go into the STEM field because being an engineer has been one of my childhood goals, my goal is to graduate and become an engineer for an automotive car manufacturer and improve on current automotive designs and/or create new models, with this I mean improve on gas powered cars and electric as well. Being in the stem field is lots of work but well worth it to accomplish my goal. As a stem major I think that this is one of the toughest areas to be in but also one of the most rewarding too. for example as an engineer there is lots to learn but once we are Able to turn one of our sketches into a reality it is so rewarding to see it working how we imagined it too. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1887,"I want to go into the STEM field because I have never seen myself going into any other field. I have always been good at math and science and enjoyed it as well. I never did bad in English or art or anything but I have always felt more at home doing STEM related courses. I have found that I like the stimulation I get from finding solutions to math, science, and coding problems. I have a passion for coding and I want to do things I like for the rest of my life which is why I have decided to go into the STEM field. I have also seen people in my family who work in the STEM field be pretty well off and that is also a motivation for me to go into the STEM field, not one of my main reasons but a very good reason nonetheless."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1888,"I reason for me picking a STEM major was because I felt this is where I had the most success and it was more interesting and fun to learn. As a kid, my dad wanted to make sure I wasn't scared of math and science so he pushed me to excel in especially in these classes. Also, I have always had a love for technology, I caught on very quickly to the newest updates. When family or friends would have issues with their computer or any technology devices I was always the one they would find their way to. This was why I chose computer science as my major."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1889,"Reflection #1Ever since I looked up in the sky, I pondered the vastness of the universe. As I started my higher education, I realized that my all question regarding the complexity of the life and universe has one answer, which is Science. I took a science major in High School just to be able to answer my questions myself. I figured out that STEM is the one and the only field I would be pursuing for my undergraduate and thereafter. My main purpose in coming into this field is very simple -  to understand nature. Science and Technology have given me a deep-seated interest in understanding and learning the basics of life and how they perform.  Through this STEM field, I could complete my dream of becoming a successful academic person and Work hard enough to achieve more. In the future, I would continue this field and I believe STEM will help me achieve my goals."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1890,"I want to go into the STEM field is becuase: First, it need learn many things and need update technology with time. This makes it have law of jungle, if you don't learn, you will be eliminated.  Second, it don't have many literature need to see and recite. I don't like liberal subject. I don't like recite history. And my writeing skills are poor. Third, I really like computer science. I can use a computer to do many things. I can develop a web which is belong myself. I can develop a new apps with others. I like use my brain and think. STEM field give me a comfortable environment. Some people maybe says, girls are not suit in STEM field. They can't do good in calculate. But I want to prove that girls can do these things. My dream is join a web develop company. I hope my work can be used in everyone's telephone or computer."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1891,I want to go into the stem field because in the future I want to work for LA Water and Power as a project manager managing construction sites and making sure things are fine. It also helps that there are a wide variety of jobs in the STEM field to experiment and experience which job gives me the most satisfaction. The salary of engineers are very high which helps because my hobby of playing Blackjack and Poker gets expensive depending on the day.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,588,I want to be in the stem field because I generally like science and math and applying it to real life scenarios. you are also getting a lot of money being in the stem
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1892,"I want to go into the STEM field because I find computer technology fascinating. Ever since I was young, computers have been always apart of my life whether it was through school computer lab or using a handheld device, I always found a way to use one. By the time I was in middle school I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do, I just knew I wanted computers to be apart of it. In my freshmen year of high school, I took a class which had me learn to use a computer keyboard without looking while I typed. Two years later, I took a basic computer coding class and I settled on wanting to pursue a career in Computer Science specifically with web penetration or hacking. To this day, I want to major in Computer Science and do something in CyberSecurity."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,598,"I got into the stem field because i like the title of engineer. Where i'm from, almost nobody has that title of a so and so engineer. There are good jobs out there that are in this field. I like the challange that it brings. It is also something that has interested me since high school. While most friends that I knew wanted to be policemen/military men and not much engineers. Its not an easy path, but i was always aware that the challanges would be tough. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1893,Why do I want to go into the STEM field?When I was young I would play a lot of video games and was really into electronics but didn't know how they worked and didn't really think about how they worked either. As I grew older i began to get more of an interest for technology and didn't just use them but began to wonder how they worked. In High School is when my interests really peaked. For my senior year of high school we had to choose a senior project and I decided that I was going to learn how to code as I became interested in coding after hearing about it from one of my teachers in High School. For my senior year I decided to watch a lot of youtube videos and read a lot of online books about the basics of coding. My objective was to learn how to create a simple game of a person controlling the car using the arrow keys and avoiding the obstacles coming at them. I didn't really know how difficult it was going to be and thought it was going to be somewhat simple before I had started. I was very wrong however and even though they game in concept was simple the code behind the game itself was going to be very difficult. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1894,"I want to go into the STEM field due to the fact that it is a great opportunity to do well in life. I have two uncles and I compare them because one is an engineer and the other is not. The engineer has a house but the one that is not has an apartment. It is a fact that the STEM field will make me comfortable in the future. I am into computers so my major is Computer Science. I am planning on getting my masters in CS and I want to work for google. This is why I am going into the STEM field. The STEM field is a very smart choice in majors because whatever I decide to do, I know I will succeed and will be happy. I am very excited to complete my major because I have so many goals I want to accomplish after college."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1895,"I didn't actually desire to go into the stem field. I just prefer the subject of math over literature. Pair that with me being on my computer all day and the main choice would be majoring in Computer Science. So far, it hasn't been a bad choice. I feel like it does fit me. It's a lot of logical thinking and building which is pretty fun. Otherwise, that's about it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,3,1058,"I wanted to go into the stem field because growing up I was usually at the top of my class in math as it was very interesting to me. There also was a program for engineering at my high school and it was a basic introduction to many different fields available in the engineering field; there we were taught the basics in CAD (we used Creo) to design a scaled-down balsa wood bridge, a nose for a model rocket, and a mechanical toy/game that we 3D printed. We were also taught how (very basic) python code to navigate a robot through various mazes. Bringing back the model rocket, we were taught very simple rocket science; basically figuring out how high our rockets flew in the sky and how long it stayed in the air."
