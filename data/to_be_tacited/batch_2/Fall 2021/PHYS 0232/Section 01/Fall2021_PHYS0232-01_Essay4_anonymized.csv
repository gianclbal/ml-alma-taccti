2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1845,"Online classes have surely impacted my learning and self-care in a lot of ways. First of all, the focus. It is harder to concentrate when online, you have a lot of distraction around you because you are not in class but at the same time, it's like a challenge for us to straighten our focus when we are alone by ourself. I'm taking care of myself on finding ways to better focus through online class. However, online classes give a flexible time since we are staying at home. I would say that asynchronous would be better in a case, we might not be available during those synchronous online class. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,653,"Online classes have really impacted my way of learning in both a good and bad way. In a good way because I can rewatch the lectures if I didn't understand them on the first watch or I can pause the lecture when ever to take my notes. Also I can do the work for each class when ever I find the time. Here is where the bad comes in, with all that liberty comes procrastination. I procrastinate so much that I end up leaving everything to last minute or sometimes I just don't end up doing it. Another negative about online is that it is very easy to get distracted from class especially having siblings around you all the time, and electronics. One way I have been practicing self care is to at least leave the weekend for myself. Since I work full time and go to school full time it is really difficult to find some me time, nut I have found that the weekends work out in my favor. So during the week I work really hard doing all the work for all my classes, so I can go out with friends or family. There are times when I also go out during the week but I have to sacrifice a Saturday. Somethings that I'm concern about my well being is that there are times when I don't really sleep that much because of school work and work that I  wake up with massive headaches. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1844,"Online learning has definetly been a mixed blessing. For the most part it's come at the right time, because of covid I lost my job at a restaurant and those months were rough. However, because I lost that job I was able to find a higher paying job where I work longer hours but sometimes I can get homework done at work. With no commute time to school, online learning has saved me a lot of time. Yet, I am not the most social person so I do miss the interactions that happen in person or the hustle and bustle of being on campus. I guess the best self-care I do at the moment is try my best to stay on time with every assignment(no matter how minimal that may seem), to not have to deal with that procrastination anxiety."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,146,"Ever since online classes started back in mid-2020, it has been a pretty ok experience. There were both upsides and downsides of being in an online environment where the upsides were that I didn’t have to take any kind of transportation for classes and can simply wake up closer to the class time than waking up 2 hours before classes starts and prepare everything. It also means I have more time to study since I am near my computer more, but since I am near my computer more, I do have distractions that can stop me from focusing sometimes. Also, if I am staying on my computer more, I have been taking more vitamins, specifically D3, because I am not getting enough sunlight. I have also tried working out here and there, but I was never able to keep a consistent schedule. The only concern I have for online learning is my lack of motivation, but I don’t think this has to do with online learning."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1829,"I think for me, I love the online classes, it gives me time to study while I wait for my next class. I like that I am not missing anything because I can get online tutor sessions which is also great. I think the only thing that is affected is the time when I do my homework, I have many things to distract me. I have been able to learn a little more about time management at home which is something I want to do since I want to work from home when I go out in the field of work. This has given me a great view of how it will be and what it is that I need to do or change in my environment. The way I do self-care is I will make time to hang out with my family or friends. I will try to finish all my homework, or work ahead so I can have 1 day to hang out and destress from looking at my computer all day. I will also take naps whenever I am too stressed or tired so I can come back with a clear mind and “new eyes” to work on my issue I am having."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1846,"Online classes cannot substitute an in-person lecture for me. I have always found being in a classroom was a more helpful environment for me to learn versus being at home. I am concerned that i may not be learning as efficiently, but I'm taking in the new experience the best i can.My overall self-care have improved. I have more time to eat breakfast, and I am getting more sleep."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1834,"Online learning has definitely impacted my learning experience. It makes it harder to engage with the teachers and other students. I am a student who talks and participates during class when it's face-to-face but the online environment makes it hard for me to participate as it doesn't feel personal. For self-care, I am hanging out with friends in the city, watching movies, and playing video games. Being able to interact with a lot of people helps my mental state and keeps me going as I know that I have plans and activities to do. For my learning, I am worried that my study and homework habits are being changed. I used to call people for homework help when I got stuck but because of the pandemic and not meeting anyone in class, I haven't gotten to know my classmates, which means that I have to do the homework by myself, which takes longer and frustrates me more."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1842,"Honestly one of the things Im definitely scared of when it comes to online classes is retention. It's kind of a joke a going around that everyone graduating in 1-3 years is going to be horrible at their job, but I could hoenstly see that happening. It's really hard to remember things when the days kinda just pass and all you do is just stare into a computer screen day in and day out. I take care of myself too, I workout and I make sure to take some time off to give my brain some rest but It;s definitely a nagging anxiety for sure."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1847,"Honestly, with the online learning that we have to adapt, it has been a good way for me to become more independent in pacing myself to complete assignments, and also to study to keep up with my schedule to understand the material. Online learning for me is not ideal due to the lack of interaction with professors and students that makes it a bit harder to keep up and not have a sense of urgency of what is going on in the classroom to be honest. Hopefully, by Spring 2022, mostly or all classes will be given in person for engineering majors and others to perform better academically, because not everyone is used to this kind of learning environment since some people have part time jobs and others have to take care of their loved ones due to any illnesses due to the COVID 19 condition if they were to receive it . So far it is going okay, but not the best since I have tons of assignments to complete day after day. That way I have to schedule a to do list of what I am going to complete in the process."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1833,"After doing a year's worth of online classes, I believe that it reduced the quality of my learning experience. I greatly appreciate how most of the exams are take home exams because it takes off that pressure and anxiety. I sometimes find myself missing the idea of going to a lecture hall to listen to lectures and to take notes - but I also like how all of our lectures are recorded. In addition to this, I also like how some of the labs are online mainly because I personally don't have the best attention span nor the best discipline so I like getting my assignments done early.In terms of self care, I think that online learning has really taught me that I need to plan out my schedule carefully. There are times where I sleep pretty late into the night, making it hard for me to get up in the mornings for class. But then again, I'd rather have these classes in the morning so I can have the rest of the day to myself. The only concern that I have about my learning is that professors will change the way some of their things are set up. For example, I have a teacher who moved their homework from Gradescope to a quiz form. It's a little difficult mainly because now I have the pressure of doing something in a timed fashion when it's usually not timed at all."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1828,"Online classes have impacted my learning in two ways. First my online classes made it difficult to learn sometimes. Especially labs, although I do enjoy doing the online interactive labs and quiz style labs. Second as a commuter student from the east bay it made it easier to not have to go all the way out to San Francisco State's campus every day for class. It also saves me a lot of money on gas and miles on my car. What has stressed me out most this semester was finding a balance between school, work and social life. I lowered my social time alot to now I just do it once a week or so. That way when I am not at work I have time to finish my school work. I found to have more free time to destress and rest."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1827,"I think online classes have heavily impacted my learning in a negative way, I feel like I am caring less and less about my grades and failing classes. I am doing homework very late. For self-care, I am not doing much but playing video games, as it helps a little bit but recently it hasn't been the best. My concerns for learning and well-being are that I may fail more than one of my classes this semester and my parents will find out. This will affect my well-being since I have almost hadn't cared about my grades. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1065,"Since I am not used to not being in person, I believe that online classes had a significant impact on my learning. It made me sad at first because I had such a great time in San Francisco! Being able to do it in person made it a lot easier, particularly because resources were much more accessible and convenient! Right now, I try to light a candle, open the window, listen to music, and just relax for self-care. I still use face masks for self-care on occasion, and I would do something that makes me happy. For example, after a long day of studying for an exam, I could treat myself to my favorite food or take a long walk with my dog - both of which are well deserved! I'm worried about my learning and well-being, so I'll continue to prioritize education, but make sure I don't have a clouded mind so I can retain information."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1841,Online classes have been interesting way to learn. I kind of enjoy online classes since we are able to take classes anywhere we want. We are also able to look back and review with the recorded lectures so it makes it easier to go back and check our work or important information we missed. However it can be a little challenging learning some of the material since getting help is a bit more difficult but overall I enjoy it this way. For self care I have started going to the gym and getting some exercise to keep my mind and body healthy and moving. Since I live in a small town with a low population the COVID restriction are a little more lenient. I also live near the mountain so ill be able to go ski soon since snow has started to fall. I'm enjoy this way of teaching more since we are a little more free to enjoy our days. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1835,"While there are undoubtedly good things that came out with online classes, there are also bad things or some obstacles that came with virtual learning. I have a mixed impact in the sense that virtual learning allowed me to be at home and not have to wake up early to commute. Wake up 5 minutes before class and be able to attend on time. On the other hand, I find it hard to approach people as once zoom/class is over I am alone. It was recently that I stepped out of my comfort zone and realized that I needed to reach out to my professors. While it was a small step, I found it impactful on me and helped me identify what I need to do to try and catch up."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1831,"Online class has been very hard for me. I chose online class because I'm from India and staying in India for another semester didn't seem so bad but it turns out it isn't that great. I don't socialise at all and attending classes became a burden. I started feeling lost and my motivation was at an all time low. I started binge watching shows and playing games but it didn't make me content. Pretty soon I stopped that too. Now, I have started to get back to good ways. I did miss a lot but as it is online it is all readily available and I can still catch up. For self care I'm trying to find the motivation to enjoy doing things again and not just while away my time. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1840,"Online classes have made me learn slower. I know that when I am in an in-person class I can focus on the material and retain what I learned in class. When I am at home it is easy to get distracted by my parents or some notification on my computer. It is also much easier to zone out or fall asleep during class.I have scoliosis so the pandemic gave me and my parents enough time to do all my exercises. I am not worried that my spine will get worse. It seems that my spine is stable as long as I keep exercising. My largest curve is around 16 degrees. As long as I keep this curve under 25 degrees until I am 26 I should not have to worry about my condition getting worse.I am not worried that I will get sick with COVID-19. I am vaccinated. However, I am worried that the vaccine will become ineffective to a different strain of COVID-19, which means that the world will have to go into lockdown again, which means more online classes. I do not know how I am going to learn effectively if I keep having online classes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1838,"I have found that online class has made me feel unmotivated when it comes to learning. I feel the assignments are slightly harder and trying to pay attention in class becomes increasingly more difficult with each passing semester. I used to be a student who was very motivated and always going the extra mile to make my school work truly shine, now, however, I no longer feel that same drive. I felt like in-person classes allowed me to excel in an academic space and I truly hope we can go back to in-person classes sometime in the very near future. As for self-care, I try my best to go to the park or just take a walk outside for small breaks. I am the type of person who would stay inside all day if they could, so taking small breaks outside has helped me a lot in terms of mental health. my concerns lie solely on my academics, they are suffering the most from these online courses and while I have learned to adapt to this new environment to the best of my abilities, it is still very difficult to try and keep up with the work that is presented to me each week.    "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1836,Online has impacted my learning by making me be really unmotivating. I find online classes boring and I feel like I just dose off in the middle of class. I also miss campus and just being in front of people and a professor live and in person. I also find that I do not really learn through online learning. I work better in groups and I feel like the best way to do that is to be in an actual class live. It is also really stressful covid has really tested my mental health being a civil engineering major plus having to do this online has really stressed me out and the way I have been coping with it is through working out and going to the gym for an hour each day and just trying to stay busy. I just do believe that the best learning is done in an actual class setting.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1830,"Honestly online learning has had the most negative and toxic impact on my learning. Ive felt more depressed than I have in my entire life and not being in a classroom environment with people my age has added to that so so much. I would not wish this type of learning on any student in the future. I am incredibly excited to engage in a classroom setting once again in the coming future. It has taught me a lot about myself however, I do feel that I would not have been able to come up with resourceful answers without being put in this very specific situation. For self care I am forcing myself to go to the library on wednesdays in order to properly fullfill all due assignments because procrastination has really taken over, especially this semester. I think I am just over the whole facetime sorry excuse of teaching and I am excited to be present in a room where I will learn something im interested in."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1826,"During this semester online classes have been quite stressful, but I am working and exercising which gives me some time away from classes. It's quite a nice break because I get to talk to other people. It has been challenging learning online, but getting out of the house helps me stay more focused when doing assignment. I also like to listen to music when working on homework. Music helps me relax. I learn better when I can talk to people in person, so online has been a real struggle. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1832,I had to adjust to having everything online. It's harder to stay focused in class sometimes. I try to exercise everyday and maybe take a hike every week.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1837,Online classes are very hard on me overall. Online school means that school and my self care place are the same. The place I could have to escape so much stress and work is now the same space I have that stress. I have no place to escape all that school stress and work. I used to have a system down where I have school and try to get as much homework done at school and I had a designated place at home for schoolwork. My room was me time. That time we could go out and have more time for ourselves. With the pandemic my brother started working from home and my mom asked him to move back in with us. He agreed and now my space for schoolwork is his office. Now all I have is my room. I have no space of my own because I have to be in my room doing a lot of school and schoolwork. I can't go out because of the pandemic and that used to be my self care. I also can't have any thoughts of self care in my room because that is my workspace. It is very hard to learn online and the only concerning things is how long it will last. For my well being I started taking walks and that has helped.
