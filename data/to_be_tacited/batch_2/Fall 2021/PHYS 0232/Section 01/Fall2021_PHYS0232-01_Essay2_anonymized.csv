2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1842,"Taking this class will undoubtedly help me with my future endeavors in school, especially since when it comes to practically every subsect of engineering. When building pretty much anything that I will be building or planning to do so, it will involve metals which interact with magnetic fields in ways that could totally mess my building up. Imagine if someone neglected that maybe a piece of metal within a composite material could undergo flux and heat up a bunch and then start a fire or something. I feel like there are so many principle applications that get taught in this class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1844,"As a student our goal is to graduate or get whatever degree we are after, but that type of mentality hasn't always helped me in the past. I would say my goal now is to be more balanced, I want to work hard but not to the point where I get burnt out like I have in the past. I want to do ""the work"" but not lose myself along the way. I think courses or even this class help us transition to the real world because we have to be able to organize our student obligations, work, and take care of our personal lives. It's different for everyone, but I want to be able to not just choose whether I am the ""good student"", "" good employee"", or ""good daughter"". I want to be able to balance them all and not put pressure on myself to be great at one thing, whilst neglecting the other."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1829,"My primary goal for my education career, is to be the first one in my family to receive a Bachelor’s Degree, I hope to make my family proud with this achievement. I hope to one day help my family financially and one day be able to repay them for all they have given me during this journey. My second biggest goal is to one day help third world countries, I hope to bring education or opportunities that will help our world develop. I hope this class helps me gain enough knowledge, so I can succeed in all my future Computer Science classes. This will get me one step closer to getting my degree, and achieving my dreams. I am also hoping to improve my physics skills for upcoming classes. I believe the lab part of the class will also provide that for me. I thrive with visual learning, so taking the labs as a part of the class is very important to me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,146,"The short-term goal I have this semester is to keep my mental state in check. My long-term goals for my school year are to make sure I don't fail or withdraw from any of my classes and to get my bachelor's in computer science. My mental state over the spring and summer semesters hasn't been considered good because I did fail the same class twice over the span of two semesters. I guess I didn't try hard enough or wasn't motivated when I failed the first time and I hope that it doesn't happen again as I am going to try again next spring semester. My mental state during the time was probably in a depressed state, I wasn't sure where I was but it wasn't anything too dangerous as I just felt like I was wasting my time and life. I know I am not on schedule to graduate by next year as I did change my degree at the start of my first year and me failing one class twice over two semesters will put me back a semester, but I hope that I will take my time and go at my pace. I am completing all my science classes thanking so to classes like physics 232."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1833,"My short term goal is to graduate on time with a degree in Chemistry. This can class can help me achieve my goal because it's a prerequisite for my upper division courses. Finishing and passing this class will allow me to move onto the next classes that I need for my degree.My long term goal is to get into the CLS program here at San Francisco or at the program in UC Davis. One of the requirements of this program is to have some sort of experience with physics on a classroom level. The physics class must include the principles that surround light and electricity. Knowing that passing this lab with a high grade, hopefully an A, means that I'll be done with a year's worth of physics, this can also be applied to my path towards applying to medical school. My ultimate long term goal is to become a successful and knowledgeable anesthesiologist. Prior to applying to medical school, I obviously have to take the MCAT. This test requires a year's worth of physics so here I am, achieving two goals at once - one for my degree and the other for my future career."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1840,"My goal is to pass this class. This class can help me with the lecture section of physics 230. Having a lecture during the lab helps reinforce what I will learn in the lecture section. I feel ready to accept the concepts more deeply. Also, get well soon. Asynchronous classes feel like a giant homework assignment. The lecture and assignments merge into one assignment. It is much easier to pay attention during a live zoom meeting as opposed to a recording. During a live meeting, I can ask questions and get an immediate response. For an asynchronous class, I have to email the professor and wait for a response. Waiting could stop me from completing the most recent assignment. I wish you a speedy recovery. Also it will help my performance in this class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1838,"My ultimate goal has always been the same since I was about eight years old. I grew up always going to different amusement parks, curious about how they were able to make the rides. That curiosity has been carried into my adult life as I now major in Mechanical Engineering in order to work for amusement parks such as Disneyland one day. I think this class will help me achieve my goals by providing a better understanding of how different equations can be used and applied to real-life situations involving electricity and charges. these skills can be useful in creating animatronics for different attractions. I hope that I can learn more from this course and eventually use it as a tool to further my journey into my career.     "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1065,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?- My goal for this class is to have an in depth understanding of electricity and magnetism. I am a biology major, and I truly believe that science is extremely interconnected, and electricity and magnetism is also playing a major role in conducting biological experiments too. For example: - if we want to break the cells, then we can pass a certain amount of electricity which will degenerate the cell walls and we will be easily able to extract the nucleus for our genomic experimentation. Moreover, I like physics a lot, because being science person, I am inclined towards understanding the logic and reasoning behind various phenomenon occurring around us. I like how I can understand the flow of electrons through a circuit and how voltage and resistance works. This understanding of how big machines work of these small electrical laws surprises me and want to learn more about it. I can achieve these goals by diligently following the material provided in class. Practice as many problems as I can because practice makes us perfect, Therefore I am keen on learning new concepts and solving interesting problems. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1831,I want to learn how to code. This class isn't a direct requirement but it was somehow needed. I find it difficult to understand physics but I'm trying my best. So I guess this class is like a roadblock which I have to overcome to get to my destination. It's difficult and different but I think I can do it.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1827,"Shahriz Malek Physics 23209/24/2021Reflection #2 What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?My goals are to graduate from high school in four years and get a computer science degree. I don’t know if I like computer science yet because right now it’s a lot of math, and I personally despise math. I have stirred away from computer science because of math. I picked up computer science in highschool and really enjoyed it from the first few years. Started taking major math courses and physics and I don’t know anymore. My parents are dead set on me being a computer science major and I don’t want to disappoint them, but I have been looking into day trading on the stock market and have really enjoyed it but my parents don’t really believe in that, say it's not smart. This class can only help me achieve my computer science goal by helping me in my future physics classes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1828,My goals are to one day work as a software programmer or start my own company. Then using the money from either of those jobs I would like to own a mechanic shop that specializes on Japanese sports cars. This class is helping me by showing me a new understanding on life through physics. I feel that ever since I started exposing myself to more difficult concepts my perspective on life changes. This lab is helping me see electricity and magnetism in a way I never thought I would but not only that it is also exposing me to concepts which are hard to understand. Computer science is full of difficult concepts and so this class is helping in that way as well.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1839,"My goals for this class is to learn and understand topics that I will enjoy and use in everyday life. Some of those topics are short circuits, voltage, current, magnets, and RC circuits. If I every need to change light switches or create add a new light from scratch, I will be able to understand how the circuit works. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1826,"My goals in life is too become an Olympic cyclist as well as becoming a Mechanical Engineer. This class is helping me become an engineer by providing me with the knowledge I need to know for future classes. Everything that we learnt gets built upon, so the material I am learning now is going to be useful for me later on when I get a job in the engineering field. Whenever I'm doing a task for school or for something outside of school I always try my best and make sure that the work that I am producing is the best. This is a key thing in life. It shows how devoted someone is to that task and that they care about what they are doing. I think its important to do your best wherever you are."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1837,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals. Well my goal is to graduate with a bachelors degree in computer science. For that to happen one of the requirements if to take this class. In a way passing this class will help me achieve one of my biggest goal. This class and science in general is very important because of the way you have to think when you are in a science class. One of my other smaller goals would be to grow as a person and this class will help a lot with that. Not only will I learn more things, new things as well as a new way of thinking. The lab itself will help with my main class. We will explore a little more into the subjects and do a lab where we go much deeper or even hands on. Those are my main goals that haven't changed and will not change in the near future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,653,"I have multiple goals at the moment but my goal for this semester is to pass this lab along with the class. Physics has always been a difficult subject for me. I haven't ben able to take other classes that go towards my major because of this class. In order to take other classes I need to pass one more math class, but I still need one or two more physics classes along with the lab. This class will help me achieve those goals if I pass it. I will pass it by trying to attend all the labs and also doing all the work that comes with it. I know this is not related to class but my personal goal before this year ends it to at least get my drivers permit. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1832,My goals are two complete my CS degree and to eventually find a good job and something I enjoy doing. Physics is required for CS major.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1845,"My goals are to be able to get my degree here at SFSU. For it, I have a couple of  steps to reach here via the class required to take and so on. This class is a requirement  for my major but, I have to give the maximum to be successful since Physics class will  help keep my brain and reflection constantly working. Since my major is Computer  Science, it surely be an advantage for me to learn and progress through the physics  class. Via the reflection, and acquiring more knowledge. What is more, physics is one of  the main subject to know all around the world, so it will always benefit me to have the  minimum of knowledge about it. In order to be successful, I have to study hard, review  the materials, and benefit my professor help if necessary. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1841,My goal for this class is to pass. I have been doing poorly in turning in work and post labs. Since I have another class right after my lab it makes it a little difficult to turn my post labs in after class. I plan to turn in the work after my last class which ends at 7. I have been enjoying this class and all the information I have been gathering about physics. Class has started to get more difficult on the material but I am enjoying diving deeper into some of the concepts. My classmates have been a big help in explaining some of their thought processes in the lab and makes it easier to understand the concepts. I just now need to turn in my work and do my part in remembering. I also keep joining class a few minutes late so I can also improve by getting there on time. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1836,"My goals are to become a civil engineer and one day I hope to build my own bridge that will be a tourist attraction. I know if people like my work as an engineer I know that I am doing a great job and I'm good at what I do. I do believe physics can help me achieve this goal because it takes a lot of physics to build a bridge and to know the strength on a bridge. Physics is a subject that I am decent at and getting to collaborate with my class mates helps me learn a lot. My class mates help me achieve my goals by answering questions that I am not sure of. This class shows me how to work in a team which is very important when working on a project as a civil engineer because you'r working with other engineers, sub contractors, contractors and inspectors and many more people."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1830,"My goals are to complete college with a successful amount of experience and receive a wide variety of knowledge that is not just focused for my major(computer science). Although physics does tie in with a few elements of coding, i believe it still provides another outlook on problem solving and understanding concepts behind everyday concepts and activities. As for my wanted experience, I hope that this lab helps me get a hands on feel of what it is truly like to understand the inner workings of the formulas covered in PHYS 230 lecture. Although I enjoy hearing and learning about the given formulas and concepts, a LAB offers something special where most classes dont. I am grateful as well for the group work because it forces me to come out of my shell and converse with peers my own age, although that may sound like something typical of a student my age, during this day and age, social interaction with people of similar ages is not as common as you think (with the pandemic going on). In conclusion, I am eager to be apart of this LAB and receive a new form of knowledge that i wouldn't get elsewhere."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1834,"This class will help me develop the foundation that I need for my future career. As i want to be a mechanical engineer, knowing the physics of the materials and objects that I will be working with is very important not only for the safety of myself and others, but also to build things that last. This class will help me achieve my goals by creating this strong foundation and giving me the knowledge and know how to build what I want to build."
