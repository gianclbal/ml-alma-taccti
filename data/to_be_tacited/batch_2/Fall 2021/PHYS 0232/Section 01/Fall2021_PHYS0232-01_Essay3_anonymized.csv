2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1837,"When you have two of the charges they repel while if you have opposite charges they attract. We did a lab in class where, I found that a negative and a positive attract, a negative and a neutral also attract. But they don’t attract if they have the same sign. When they are neutral it is because all matter is made of atoms which contain positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons, most materials have both. When they have equal numbers of + and - charges then the charges cancel each other out and the objects are neutral. I choose this subject because we can see this in everyday life a lot. The most famous are magnets. When you try to get two that are the same sign they repel which if you get the opposite signs they attract. When talking about charges and forces Forces always come in pairs, because a force is an interaction between objects. If we look back at Newton's Third Law which states that the forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: FAB = - FBA. Which we can see in the everyday life everyday and at least every minute. For example if I push on a book, it’s pushing on me. And same goes for everything."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1835,"A Concept that was covered in class in the past few weeks that I will discuss is Free-Body Diagram, FBD. This concept is wildly used in my current classes to distinguish forces that are acted upon on a singular object. This is usually aided by a sketch that consists of forces. these forces are labeled as arrows which are pointed to specific areas to represent direction. I believe this generally can be applied to any physical activity that can be observed and maybe even help identify issues that one may not know. While in some cases, sometimes written on paper may be proceeded differently when applying to real-world problems. Using a free body diagram may take longer than using a different method of solving a conflict, I think the concept of just knowing how it works can help someone understand a specific situation that may be affected by forces."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1844,"why do the charges of things matter?This semester we have covered charges and how conductors can easily exchange electrons and gain electrons. These types of interactions can lead to charges of positive or negative value. Depending on the charges of items, we get different interactions. We can see these interactions all around us. If something has opposite charges then it attracts, if something has the same charge then it repels. We can see this in small things and big things. A small thing: you're washing clothes then your sock and sweater get stuck together. or you literally have two small magnets of the same charge and you can't put them together because they repel. A bigger thing: basically electricity and technology. Some of the major building blocks of todays society.Of course this topic greatly has to do with other things we have learned this semester because it's one of the building blocks. Electric fields, electric current, flux, and more. Its one of the first things we went over because it is such a core subject to help us learn about the rest of the tangible things we see in everyday life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,653,"A concept that is fresh and I think I have knowledge of is short circuits. Short circuit is an electrical circuit that allows current to flow through to a source. If the voltage of that circuit is bigger than what it can handle then it can cause a lot of damage to the circuit and can cause a fire, or something more dangerous. This is important in daily lives because we use power everyday. We use it to charge or electrical devices and when we turn on lights around the house. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1833,"Question: What is the basic idea of how a circuit works?A circuit requires a closed loop between the voltage source (battery) and the resistor (the light bulb) in order for it to work. The reason for this closed loop is that energy can flow through the negative terminal and out the positive terminal. Keeping it closed ensures that the charge energy is flowing and providing power to the resistor.This can be applied to someone's life and society when they're in a problem. When I say this, I mean these people gotta think of their problems as circuits. What can they do to solve it and what exactly do these people need in order to close the gap that's preventing something from working. This specific information is important important to the real world because it can be used as a direct example or either it can be used as an analogy. For my example, I used an analogy. Having spaces in a loop will obviously not make it work. So, being able to create a circuit, whether it be an actual one or a metaphorical one, is quite important since it allows life to go on and brings quality to life by answering some unknown questions."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1841,"I want to learn on this weeks topic, week 7 circuits. From the lab exploration I know that parallel circuits are much more beneficial and better than a series circuits. However what is the point of still using them in these day and age when parallel circuits are better? The only reason I could see series circuits being used is as a fail safe system or because it can be cheaply made. In a parallel circuit there is more wire used to transfer voltage through out the item but in a series circuits there is less wire since the voltage travels to the same wire all across. However the voltage becomes weaker in a series circuit since it’s traveling through multiple items to power up.I could see multiple items such as a flashlight or fridge being used as a series but why not just change them to a parallel circuit? It would save on material and be more useful. Most appliances are in a series since they only do one thing but as soon as something breaks it doesn’t work anymore so why not put another backup series?So my question is what are series circuits used for now and is there any beneficial reason to still use them besides being cheaper to make?"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1826,"During the week that we covered electric fields I had problems with the post lab. In particular the understanding of how distance affects the strength of the electric field. I now know that as you get further away from the center of the point charge the field decreases in strength. The simulation helped me understand this topic. The shorter vectors for the electric field meant that the strength of the field was weak, on the other hand if the vectors were larger then the field would be stronger. The lab exploration and the post lab really helped me get a grip on the material. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1842,"Electric potential is created when there is a unbalance of charge in something or the electrons and neutrons aren't evenly spread out within the material. Essentially what it means is that there is a space where something with unbalanced charge or something that has unbalanced charge, gains the ability to experience force within that area. For instance, since a lot of metals have metallic bonds that allow the electrons within the metal to flow freely, they often times created fields that have electric potential. It is measured in joules per coulomb also know as Volts."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1832,"How does the resistance for copper and silicon change with temperature and why are the behaviors of these two materials different?For copper resistance increase with increase in temperature, resistance for silicon decreases with increase in temperature. Copper is metal and a good conductor, silicon is a semiconductor.This is useful for construction and technology design."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1831,We learned about charge some time back. I learned that there were postive and negative charges and objects which were neutral. Like charges would repel and unlike charges would attract (both charges would be attracted to a neutral object). As a kid I used to go near the TV even though my dad would get upset and I noticed I felt fuzzy when I put my fingers near the screen. I now know that this is due to charge and electrostatic force between charged dust particles and polarized air.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1839,"A topic that everyone should know about is electricity and how short circuits are created. Any at given point in the world, people turn on switches, car batteries run out of energy, cooking occurs, and more. At any of those given moments, an overload can occur or a circuit can blow. A short circuit occurs when positive and negatives wires come into contact or there is a surge in electricity usage causing an overload on the system. This is common in household, but can happen on a city or state level. When your car battery runs out of energy and you need to jump start, you add positive and negative wires on the respected sides and connect the ends to another battery to transfer energy. If you place them together then sparks fly because electricity is given a path of less resistance than the circuit is designed to handle. A circuit can also blow when you are cooking and cleaning and you have all your appliances running along with additional devices. This knowledge is beneficial to everyone so everyone understand the dangers of having live wires placed next to each other. This is a reason as to why you should use a surge protector when you have multiple wires instead of using temporary extension cables and adapters. It is also good to use a 3 prong wire and not 2 prong. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1834,"What type of circuit is better for a house? What type of circuit is better for a lamp?A parallel circuit would be better for a house and the series circuit would be better for a lamp. The parallel circuit has a the sources of power not in series, but rather on parallel planes with each other, resulting in seperate, autonomous sources of energy. Because these sources of energy are separate from each other, if one part of the circuit is overrun with too much current or voltage, that part of the circuit's fuse is tripped, resulting in only part of the circuit being ""fried"" while the rest of the circuit can function at normal capacity. The series circuit would be better for the lamp as the lamp is a much more simple circuit. The energy source goes to the lamp, through the bulb, and back to the lamp. In this case, there is only one power source, thus only needing a circuit in series."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1840,"How does electric difference relate to electric fields? Are they proportional or inversely proportional? The electric difference is the negative electric potential energy over the charge. The potential energy is Coulomb's constant times q1 times q2 over the distance between the two point charges. This means that the electric difference is q2 times Coulomb's constant or the distance. Electric difference is proportional to the distance, but the field is inversely proportional.Even though I know this it is still hard to visualize it in a graph. There is a question in the lecture homework that tells you to convert the graph that has the difference on the y-axis and the distance 'r' on the x-axis into a graph with the electric field on the y-axis and the distance on the x-axis."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1836,"After conducting the lab I noticed that in our everyday lifes we use current because we use electricity every day whether it is at home or at work or if we drive an electric car. Current is an important part to why we have electricity. I learned that the way our electric wires are connected to light bulbs can determine if one bulb will be brighter than the other. And can also determine which bulb will last a lot longer. This is important because if one bulb is not fully connected to the wires then it will decrease the light it let's go through and opposite foir the one that is fully connected. We need electricity to live so knowing about how it works and how we actually get electricity is an important part on how to know if your light bulb is working to its full capacity, as it is our only form of light inside our house when it is dark out. Wherever you go there is going to be electrical currents especially more when you go out to a store the current is a lot stronger due to all the electricity they use and how long they use it."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1845,"Reflection #3  My question: How does the electric field is applicable in the case of a uniform field?   Via the topic of electric field, I learn a couple of things such as that electric field is an electric force which is related to the coulomb’s law via the following formula:   Electric field formulaCoulomb’s Law  However, in the uniform field case (no variation, with field lines parallel). This can be seen between two plates (see belowIn this case, we would have E constant so the Force here would be: F = m x a    This case can be used and benefit in the radio field such as Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO, used to observe the change of an electrical signal over time) where the placing of positive charge on one horizontal plate and negative charge on the other creates an electric field between the plates and allows the beam to be steered from side to side. This will allow Radio Stations to be able to observe the transmitting & receiving properties of signals. This is very relevant because we can analyze waveform, transient, everything that has something to do with radio frequencies."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1845,
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1843,A concept that we covered in the past few weeks was short circuits and electricity. I was already a little familiar with this but was having a hard time connecting it with real life examples other than those provided. This past weekend however I was able to put my knowledge into use and apply it into a real life situation which was awesome! My friends car had died and need a jump start so it was my first time jump starting a car with jumper cables. Jumper cables just like in a short circuit create a current from one battery to another to charge the dead battery. This allows for the dead car to and hopefully run a little bit longer until the battery dies again. Another example that I was able to apply this knowledge with was at a nursery I went to. This flower nursery had solar panels and decided to take it off grid meaning they were storing their electricity into batteries instead of into the electric grid of their area. They had multiple parallel circuits with tons of batteries. They said they can gather over 1000 watts to 4000 watts per month and they only use up about  900 watts per month. The left over is why they use batteries to store it in case of blackouts or any other needs. This was a surprisingly something I did not seek out to do but came into my life allowed me to connect classroom knowledge to a real world situation. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1829,"What is a circuit and how does it work? A circuit is individual electronic components, like resistors, transistors, and capacitors connected by conductive wires. We use this in our daily lives even if we don’t realized it. We can see it in our home or even in our cars. We can see this from our main source of battery, from a house we see it from the power lines, to our house to all out power ports in our house which powers all our electronics. It starts from a power that is at its most powerful but if we have a house that has a constant flow the light will be as powerful. When we have a bigger house and more rooms involve, then we can see a parallel circuit and the parallel rooms get less power than the first room. When we see this in a car we can only see a continues circuit, the car doesn’t have as many pugs or connections, but it does power many things within the car. The moving charge particles are mostly negative electrons that are present in the battery, wire, and all things used as a transfer of that energy as the battery pushes them."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1065,"Among the concepts covered in the lecture and laboratory class, the concept which I personally find interesting is the 3-D dimension. The reason I find the 3-D vector dimension important is that in recent times I have seen many movies and various fields using the concept of 3-D vector. But, despite being interested in the topic, I hardly had any knowledge about the back-end implementation of this technique. I was keen to understand the in-depth process of its implementation.  Apart from this, I have tried to research this topic on the internet, but I was unable to find the process in an easily understandable manner. All of them were a little difficult to understand.  In the Physics class when the professor started explaining this topic, I was so amazed by the precise explanation of my professor. There was a problem I saw while studying this concept and the question was:- In a local bar, a customer slides an empty beer mug down the counter for a refill. The height of the counter is 1.24 m. The mug slides off the counter and strikes the floor 0.20 m from the base of the counter. And the question was to find out the velocity and direction, therefore for the 1st time, it seemed hard to me to find out how we can calculate the velocity with just the height and base of the object. Later, while going through the notes I found that we can use the question of h= 1/2gt^2This made sense to me because we have the gravity acting here and we can find the time and put it in the equation of velocity. Thus, everything started making sense to me after going through this concept of 3-D vector. Many factors including magnitude and direction which contribute to the working of the 3-D dimension vector."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1830,"Question : How will I be able to cook food without a fire?  With the science of induction, where strong electric  fields can create heat. Induction cooktops are used to heat food without  any flames or direct heat, cooking more efficiently than their gas or  conventional electric counterparts. And this lack of direct heat makes them  safer, too: you can even put paper between an induction cooktop and a  pan, and it won't catch light. Induction cooktops are also more  efficient than other types of cooking methods. Because the heat is  generated inside the base of the pan, they use less electricity than  conventional electric cooktops, and can heat things quicker. They are also quicker to control and more  precise, again because the heat is generated inside the cookware, and so  react quicker when you turn the dial up or down. Induction cooktops use electromagnetism: if you  put certain materials into a rapidly alternating magnetic field, the  material absorbs the energy and heats up. That's because the field  creates electrical currents inside the material, and the resistance of  the material converts this electrical energy into heat, which is  transferred to the food inside the pan."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1838,"Why is it better to create a circuit in parallel rather than in series? - When a circuit is created in series, the current that is flowing through the circuit is equal throughout it. this means the more lightbulbs you were to connect in series, the less bright the bulbs become as more are added. this means that each light bulb is sharing the same charge throughout the circuit. this differs from a parallel circuit in which the brightness does not change the more bulbs that are added. This is because the current is evenly split between the bulbs, with each having its own mini circuit. this is also why if a single bulb goes out in a series, the rest will follow suit as all bulbs are reliant on the currents flow through the series. While in a parallel circuit, if a single bulb were to go out there would be no effect on the other bulbs as the current flows through each bulb individually. this is why many homes are wired to be in parallel as each room is not reliant on the other if they were to go out. this is why a bulb in the kitchen may be out, while the bulbs in the living room remain on. if they were to be wired in series, however, one room may have bulbs that are brighter than another.  "
