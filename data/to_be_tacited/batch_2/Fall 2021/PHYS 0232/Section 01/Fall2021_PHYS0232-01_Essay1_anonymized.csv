Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1826,"I wanted to go into the STEM field because in high school I loved my physics, chemistry and math courses and chose a major that involved all of these subjects. I chose Mechanical Engineering. I also took some engineering courses in high school which led me to majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I like to build and develop things. I like to come up with ways of improving things in the world. I think that is a good skill to have for an Engineer.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1827,"My major at the moment is computer science. I picked computer science and the STEM field because I enjoy science in general. Most of the science classes I have taken in high school and college were interesting. Classes like physics, chemistry, and astronomy, I enjoyed but every time I either move away from the basics of the subject or get to the point where the subject involves math, I don’t enjoy it. My math skills, in my opinion, are not the best so I usually steer away from computer science, I enjoy it a bunch. When I am working on something computer science-related I can sometimes sit there for hours trying to figure out the problem I am having with my code. My parents are also very enthusiastic when it comes to computer science because my dad was a computer engineer and he kinda feels like I went to his line of work. My dad quit his degree and passion to move to the US and I feel like I owe it to him, but I also enjoy the subject."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1828,"I want to go in to the STEM field because it is the most interesting subject I found at SFSU. Computer Science ended up being my major and I think it is the best career for me because it seems very interesting and it also has a lot of pros like short work weeks and high pay. I also really enjoy being able to listen to music while doing schoolwork and I cannot do that when writing essays or reading textbooks, but I can do it while working on math or code."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1829,"I want to go into STEM field, because it is something I like to do. I like the feeling of having worked on something for so long and have it work at the end. I also like that this is a career that you never know what you’re going to work on that day, it may change depending on your career. Also, this is a well-paid career, and I want to one day buy a 3 house where I can live with my sisters so we can be neighbors, and have a little apartment at one of the houses so we can take care of my parents. I would also like to work with third world countries and be able to provide them with the same opportunities we have here. I have a believe that the cure to cancer, diabetes, and many other diseases is out there, but we have not been able to find it because the person who knows it doesn't have the education to be able to find it, or tell us what it is."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1830,"I want to go into  STEM  because I believe that the field has numerous opportunities. I am still unsure of what exactly I want to do when I am older so being able to have that option to choose whatever after i get my degree comforts me. Not only that but I want to stay up to date with current technology trends and be able to comprehend what exactly is going to happen in the future. My specific field of study is Computer Science so I am excited to be able to navigate the ins and outs of upcoming discoveries and advancements in technology. I hope that Computer Science offers me a life of excitement and thrill while still managing to instill passion and handwork into my day to day life. I also enjoy mathematics and seeing how intense equations are applied to my everyday life thrills me, similar to physics."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1065,"From a very early age, I got interested into science because it would answer all my questions about the surrounding. Science fascinates me as it gives me the power of rational thinking and not letting emotional trauma overpowering my logical senses. It has helped me in my personal life as well. Being a part of the STEM field means a lot to me because I have grown with science, and I want to continue building it for the rest of my life. Another reason why I want to pursue STEM is to bring innovation in healthcare. As we have seen during covid pandemic, none of us knew what steps to take or how should we resolve this issue, but I want our future to like where any disease can be cured within minutes. With such high amounts of data and research techniques that we are using today, I want to be learning more and applying it to the future of healthcare technologies in order to yield a better life for everyone."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1831,"I don't know what to do in life. I don't know who I am, what I like or anything for that matter. I just picked a field which seemed to be interesting. My brother is also in this field so it influenced my decision. I don't know whether I'll like this field but I'm giving it a shot anyways. But it seems pretty interesting so far and I don't dislike it :)"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1832,"I am majoring in computer science. It's something I'm interested in and a career path that allows me to do what I want, I feel like that provides a good future for myself."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1833,"I wanted to go into the STEM field mainly because of my parents. Personally for me, I come from a family of immigrants. Both of my parents came from the Philippines - a third world country. Since I'm the first in my immediate family to go to college, my parents have always been encouraging and pushing me to go into the STEM field. They've always believed that going into this field will help me gain respect and enter a better life because for them, they didn't really have that. Additionally, I don't blame them for pushing me to get into the STEM field because it's true that this field is a door to better opportunities. We see that in our lives today that the world is constantly changing and we're advancing so much in terms of technology now. Other than that, I joined the STEM field because the only classes that interested me were the science classes. The topics of these classes somewhat came easier to me than other things. The subjects within this field are much more stimulating for my mind and it's great to always be thinking about things, even though it can get hard and stressful from time to time. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,653,"I want to be in the STEM program because there is a lot a great opportunities out in the world, one of them being an engineer. I am also in the STEM program because I like a challenge.  Also when I was young there were not that many female engineers that I saw, I would always see men working in these type of jobs. Since I was young I really enjoyed doing math and I always saw math some how in my future. Also since I was young there were times when my father would take my to his work site at a construction site, I would stay in the car for safety reasons, but I would with him work. Something about a house being built was very fascinating to me.That is why I decided to go in to civil engineering. My dream one day is to make my parents their forever home, a place that they can call theirs. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1834,"I wanted to go into the STEM field because of my love for roller coasters and animatronics. Every since I was a little kid, who grew up in LA surrounded by 4 amazing amusement parks, I was in awe of the design of the parks, roller coasters, and the animatronics around the parks that gave each one its own special flare. This love started when I was a little kid walking into Disneyland for the first time and continues to this day as I walk into any amusement park I go into. The intricacies of the rollercoasters, the layout of the parks, and the complexities of the animatronics that bring the rides to life. I want the same happiness that ""no-names"" had created for me when I was a kid, and today, and create those same emotions and memories of pure joy for new people. Mechanical engineering was the path that would lead into both of these fields."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1835,"I chose to be in the STEM field because I love the idea of working with my hands. What got me into this path was an elective class, Auto Shop, that I took at George Washington high school. This class mainly covered the basics of maintenance of a vehicle. In class there was a decent variety of gas and hybrid vehicles that we got to work on.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1836,"I want to go in to the STEM field because it is the future. When in Stem I know that I will have job security. I also wanted to go into STEM because I want to be a civil engineer I want to design and create. Especially roads, bridges and dams. Engineering Changes the future and it is a big part on what makes the world run, I want to change peoples lives for the better and I want to make transportation for people a lot easier than it is right now. I also want to work in a field where team work is needed because I feel that I work better with a group of people than alone, Also more people equals more ideas. I've always liked construction and how works so being a construction engineer would be my go to in the civil engineering field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1837,I have always been very good at math and science. And I have also done well in all my English and history classes but never excelled in them. I just felt more alive and all my math and science classes in my history or English classes. Since I was in elementary school they have been doing a lot of trips and campaigns to get girls into the STEM field. I was part of the girls that participated in the campaign or took the trips and that’s how I got very interested in the STEM field. Since middle school I have been interested in the STEM field specially because that’s what I’m good at but also because that's what I love. When I got to high school was when I had to actually decide what I wanted to do and without hesitation I knew I wanted to go into the STEM field. I just love STEM and being a girl is a plus because I get to get more representation of girls into the STEM field.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1838,"I want to go into the STEM field because I find engineering fun. Since fifth grade, I have wanted to be an engineer, working for Disney as one of their 'Imagineers'. This dream still holds true to this day as I am now a mechanical engineering major, hoping to eventually work for Dinsey Parks. Although my dream requires that I be an engineer, I greatly enjoy learning in the STEM field as I have always found it interesting and exciting. Math especially has always been a subject that I enjoyed as I look at it as a giant puzzle. I hope my love for STEM and interest in engineering does not differ down the road and hope to eventually land my dream job as an Imagineer. I hope that the skills I learn from the classes I take will help me in my professional life as well as my everyday life. I can already tell that many of the math skills I have obtained have helped me with finances and understanding things such as loans and interest. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1839,"I want to go into the STEM field because I enjoy building things and working with my hands. As a kid, I use to buy Legos and then follow the instructions to build the object. That has carried me through my life through DIY projects and working in laboratory settings. As I have matured, the amount of money that can be made in the industry has also increased which has become my second reasoning to pursue a degree in the STEM field. The journey of getting an engineering degree is extremely difficult with the amount of physics involved, but the reward at the end will be cherished throughout my future. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1840,"I want to go into STEM because I find it interesting. Solving problems in STEM is like a giant puzzle with some math. In STEM you are taught methods and tricks to solve problems not a bunch of static formulas. I find that more fun than writing an essay. I am a computer science major, and every problem in computer science is a logic puzzle. Also, it will be helpful to know how to fix my computer if something goes wrong. I can also ask my dad for help if I need to."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1841,"During my high school years I wasn't very interested in writing or history. During my science and math classes I would notice myself giving more attention to these classes because they were more interesting and enjoyable than any of my other classes. I don't like sitting and writing but I do like using my hands. Legos were an enjoyable activity I did as a kid and as I got older I went and got a job in construction, basically building big Legos. I went and looked for careers for college and found civil engineering. Its just what I like doing growing up, building things with my hands. Math and science are my strongest subjects but just like anyone else learning can be a bit difficult at times."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1842,"The reason I'm in the STEM field is relatively simple. I am very creative but I am really bad at art. For as long as I remember I have never been able to do any art form other then digital modeling so I could never find a good outlet for my creativity. The thing was that I've always been good at math so when I learned that there was some creative math stuff I could do in the engineering field I was pretty jazzed. I looked into it and chose to do civil engineering since most of the work you do in there leaves a long lasting stamp on the world. Entire blocks of road design don't often get replaced and neither does the other stuff I have the possibility of building. I think that being able to design these massive things are also just really cool in general. Like, when you really think about how much work and craft went into just the buildings we walk past every day, it's kinda crazy."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,146,"I initially wanted to join the STEM field to create and develop video games because I have been playing video games since I was about 3-4 years old. I knew that being a video game developer needed to learn how to code and that’s when I started looking into it and started my journey as a programmer. I got started with a game development course in high school that was taught by a very good teacher that I learned a lot from. I then joined a programming program called MYEEP back in the day but I believe they changed their name now. They offered hackathons or hack days, wherein a day, you or a in team solves coding problems or creates programs based on the theme. I learned when I was in my senior year of high school that a great amount of math and physics was needed in game development, like having gravity in games and vertices. Later, while in college, I realized that working in the gaming industry wasn’t for me and chose to just get a Computer Science degree because I did enjoy programming in HTML, Java, and CSS to create websites and other programs while learning the 3 languages."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1843,"STEM subjects have always been my favorite growing up. Math, Science, anything in the STEM field just seemed so much fun and interesting during school for me. From the experimentation to the numbers it just clicked in my brain whereas English and other subjects didn't have that same effect. This was one of the driving forces of pursuing a STEM major but one of the biggest reasons was my grandma. She was an Engineer for Disney and would always pique my interest in the STEM field. From doing labs as a kid to looking at construction designs and seeing things be built was so thrilling for me. I remember I used to play with legos and dream about building a giant skyscraper that stretched to the stars or building a bridge to an unknown island. STEM has just felt like home for me. Sometimes though a little tedious and stressful, it has been a lifelong aspiration to continue to live up to what my grandma would expect from me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1844,"I think wanting to be in the stem field has a lot to do with an innate curiosity mixed with something else. For me, that something else is creation. Both of these things are the main driving forces that put me into the stem field, I love learning about the ways things work, and I love the rush I get from having created or made something. Even after learning more about coding, I still like to think of coding as painting. We have a canvas to ""paint"" anything we want and the code is the paint. Ofc course coding isn't always visual but I use to paint a lot when I was younger, and I've always been able to equate the two feelings I get from coding and doing something artistic. And all the cool stuff I learn on the way, is a bonus or another brush in the bucket."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1845,"""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?"" Studying in the STEM field can give me many advantages. Indeed, STEAM can be defined as the way we are learning about all the innovative idea/solution to the real-world problem. Studying the STEM field can give me the knowledge on how to deal with those situations. Having this experience can help in order to grow further development for ourself and give us the opportunity to have an impact on the world as well. We will have the change to embrace the latest innovation our world made and add our parts to this innovation.  What’s more STEAM job are very required in our everyday-life so it’s essential for us humans. I would be glad to be useful to my other fellow comrade all around the world."
