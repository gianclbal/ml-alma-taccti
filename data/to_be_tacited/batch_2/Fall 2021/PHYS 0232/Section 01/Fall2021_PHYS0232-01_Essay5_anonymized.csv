2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1847,"One of my biggest takeaways from this class is learning how to do things hands on when we coded using the SAGE application evaluating derivatives, and integrals along with plotting graphs with different kinds of lines. Learning how to code for me will be crucial for my engineering career to know how to collect data structures that will include various aspects of human civilization such as the environment, society, space, and estimation of what Civil Engineers design and plan for the governemnt. Also on week #10 Learning how to calculate a charged battery and when its a discharge was important for me as well as learning how to evaluate a device with voltage. Finally, on week #9, with the magnetic field and electric field experiment, I learned how to distinguish which materials may be attracted to magnets, and which metals may create an electric field, when we learned how to create an electromagnetic device with coil wrapped around the battery connected to aluminum metals. Therefore, this is a practical idea of how an electric field can work. Overall, electricity and magnetism is great to know for my field even though we do not use it often in the industry."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1839,"I am not sure what the greatest take away from the class is. There was so much information covered in this lab course that one specific take away would not be a reasonable answer. I can answer what I like best which was magnets and electric circuits, but I cannot answer as to what I took away from the class. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1830,My greatest take away from this class is the importance of teamwork. I have had labs for other classes but i have never had to do group lab explorations after lecture. It was a bit of an adjustment at first but after the first few weeks i found an appreciation for it. You are required to learn how to communicate with the class and different people over the coarse of the semester. I also found it interesting how to bounce ideas off of one another in order to come to the proper conclusion and succeed in the class as a team. After this Lab I later implemented the aspects of teamwork into my other classes whenever we had group discussion or group projects. I used to dread group projects but now I find ways to make it doable for everyone and this way everyone is able to succeed. Hopefully I continue to use these methods throughout my lifetime.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1831,"My greatest take away would be: to not take more online classes and appreciate the value of offline learning sessions. This lockdown really showed me the importance of physical interaction and the joy of actually going outside and just roaming around, talking to random people and asking and clearing doubts. Online was fun but its not the same. I enjoyed the class even though I struggled with my mental health. Hopefully when I'm back in the US next semester, I will feel better. Thank you"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1826,I have learnt how to solve circuits. For example I know how to find the total resistance and find the total current flowing through the circuit. From that I can find the potential difference at each resistor and find how much current is going through each resistor. The key to doing this is to be draw a picture for every single step. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1840,"My greatest takeaway from this class will be a deeper appreciation of electronics and other devices that would not be possible without the concepts present in this class. When I took Physics 1 I felt a similar way. I felt like I understood more of the world and things were clearer. However, computer hardware is much more complicated than a simple circuit with a few resistors. Understanding exactly how a computer works on almost every level would give me a deep appreciation of the world. How does a bit work exactly? When there is current through a bit is it on? How does every bit compile into what is shown on my monitor? From a high level. The monitor is receiving information from the computer about what to display, but how does the computer decipher every detail? What do the details even look like?"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1834,"The biggest takeaway from this class will be how much I enjoyed the class and the labs that we did. Not only were the labs super interesting and on topic with the lectures that were in class, but also they were very enjoyable to do and interact with. The ability to do the labs as a class has been the best thing that happened to this class and it has allowed us to interact with our professor and other students in a more intimate manner. I thoroughly enjoyed this class and I think that this class was the best-formatted class I have taken online. It was perfect in my opinion."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1827,"My greatest takeaway from this class applying physics to everyday life. For example, using batteries, resistors, and wires for everyday uses and observations that happen in my life. When I turn on my light to my room, drive a car, or use a phone, physics is involved. Physics is important to learn what is happening in the universe. Most of the innovations we see nowadays are thanks to physics, I feel like, without understanding physics, we wouldn’t know much. A few things we don’t realize are where physics is action, alarm clock; it wakes you because of the sound waves. When we see an apple fall from a tree, or a car going down the hill, all applications of physics. Anything and everything is related to physics. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1835,"The greatest takeaway from this class is how important is to work with peers. I was trying, in the beginning, to do the lab by myself but found it difficult while if I made time to work with my peers I somewhat understand the material better. While the class is not in-person it still helps to have someone to ask questions. While this does not apply to all most people need to ask for help from a peer then have to use google to find an answer. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1832,Learning some useful everyday things about general physics. It's always good to know more.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1829,"My greatest take from this class was the Labs, they were easy to understand and it made the lectures more understandable. I was able to understand Physics in another level I did not understand before. Some of the thing I did go over in the pass but we did more than in the pass and I was able to understand it and learn more from what I had learn. Over all this was a great class, I had fun doing the Labs, and we had a great teacher! It made it feel like the semester when by so fast since it was a fun class. I will take everything I have learn and used it in my future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1842,"I think one of my greatest takeaways from this class lies not in the content itself but more along the lines of myself as a student. I need to embrace challenges more. This class was very challenging and I really wish I had put more effort into actually understanding the course work instead of just relying on cramming and the like. I might have realy messed myself up for the future physics course but I really hope not.I also think that another takeaway from this class should be that I really need a professor who has handwriting I can read, because Im not gonna lie, I literally cannot read Chens handwriting sometimes and it is extremely discouraging when I try to come to class and i just get hit by a wall of illegible lectures."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1844,"While there were a lot of takeaways in terms of physics being in the real world, I still think my greatest takeaway was more student or real life oriented. I think this semester I've learned that it's ok to reach out to others for help, especially when it comes to school. We are all really trying to learn and get through the semester. It shouldn't just be about completing the work, but also understanding it and trying not to be left behind. Occasionally, asking for help can help us as students to stay on top of the content and not get lost on specific part of the lessons or assignments. I use to be the very stubborn type that would narrowly think "" I have to understand this alone, or I won't actually understand it!"" However, that can very obviously be a self-sabotaging line of thought and I am glad to have gained allies this semester that have helped prove to me that I can get help and still learn."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1833,"My biggest take away from this class is that time management is important. Knowing how to manage your time will definitely solve a lot of problems. Its not easy doing this because its easy to become distracted - especially when you're just doing online learning. Of course it has its pros because doing things online means more flexibility. Anyway, this lab has taught me that staying on top of my work and the deadlines are the two things that will lead me to being successful in a class like this. Another thing that I can take away from this class is that finding a good group of people to work with will help you understand the material better. In addition, its just comforting knowing that you're not exactly alone in this class.I hope I can apply these skills to the upcoming in person classes but I know that it will be tough since I've learned how to apply myself to online courses, not so much with in person things."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1843,I think one of the greatest or most impactful things from this class was seeing Professor Grigorescu overcome health difficulties but still provide every effort for the class to be great and helpful for her students. We never saw her not give her 100% effort towards her students and allow us to succeed in her class. I think that is something that really reached me especially because I am currently in a class where my professor is not setting up his students for success and almost half the class is failing due to his negligence. With that being said this class has been one of the most meaningful classes.Other than that another takeaway is the feedback and summaries for each lab. I think it is very helpful to use real-life examples for each of the labs to help students better understand the topic which is what has helped me. Though some are a little bit harder to understand it definitely does help with comprehension.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1841,"This physics class this year was very enjoyable and fun to attend. One of the greatest take away from this class is to be able to talk to your classmates for a better understanding and have good time management. At the beginning of the semester I would often forget to turn in my homework and didnt have a good understanding of the material. As the semester kept going I learned alot from my classmates since sometimes you can get a better understandment from someone in your age group. With more time I was also able to make more time for each of my classes. I had a good time with my classmates, as the semester kept going I also noticed that many students were not attending class anymore and that was a bit discouraging as most of us started to make good conections. Overall this semester has been very enjoyable and fun to attend."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,653,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that physics can also be fun if you make it fun. For example the lab when we did the circuit and also when we were coding. When we did the circuit I felt like a little kid, when there were sparks. Although the coding was a little challenging for me I still found it very fun. Another things that is not really related to this class is that I was able to attend most of the classes because during this pandemic I haven't been doing much and attending this semester mist of my classes was a goal. Last semester I hardly showed up to any of my classes and I failed mostly all of them. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1836,My biggest take away from this class would have to be working with class mates through zoom. It was different to do it this way. But I still learned a lot this semester. It would have been better to do it in person but I still enjoyed the class. Another thing i could take from this class was actually taking the time to reflect on the labs because i learned more that way because I would write down what I remembered from the lab and what I learned. What I hope to take a away after this semester is to understand 100 percent what I learned and take it to the next physics. That way I understand it a lot more. I want my knowledge to make the next phsyics easier. Zoom was a challenge but I’m glad I was able to experience something new. I hope to take the next physics in person
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1837,"This class was overall very helpful for my physics 230 class. It is very hard to understand my professor for 230 because she makes us watch her lectures instead of doing live lectures. In this class, the professor does a lecture before the lab and that honestly really helps. The class has taught me so much. I didn't learn anything in my normal class for about the first two weeks and this class really helped with filling in the gaps. The professor in this class is really nice and great professor. She teaches in a style that I can understand as well as always is there to help. I really like how she made this class. When needed to be in groups she was always checking in and when it was learn ""quiz"" style she gave us options and was always helping out when needed and asked for. And in this class I learned to always keep striving and you will succeed!!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,1845,"From this class, my greatest takeaway was adaptation. Being an international student is not easy especially since pandemic. But I had to learn from this class how t adapt myself to this class with the new system of learning which is online. Despite the fact that lab is better in person, I got to adapt myself in a new way of learning physic - lab via the proper explanation of the professor and the help she provides. I'm not forgetting to mention my classmate with who it's essential to work together. Team work through online learning has been one of my greatest takeaway, "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0232,--,1,146,"The greatest takeaway I learned from this class is how much group work we do and how important contribute to the group. Most of my classes in college have been more focused on the individual, but physics lab classes have been helping me learn more about group work, how important it is, and how much faster we can finish an assignment with more than one person. With collaborative learning, we can easily ask questions to other students if we are stuck on a problem or do not understand a certain topic. I am usually very nervous and anxious, so I feel a heavy pressure on me if I try to ask during class, but in groups, I would usually ask my groupmates if I have a question. If they do not have an answer, then I would try to email my teacher or just type in class while sweating a lot. Another takeaway I learned from this class is how much better it is to have paperless assignments, I remember the stack of paper I would have at home which I would usually never look at again after the semester. So having the options to have it as a google doc or a pdf is very awesome and great."
