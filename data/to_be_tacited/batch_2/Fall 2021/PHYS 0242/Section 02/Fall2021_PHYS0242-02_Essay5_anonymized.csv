2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,1945,My biggest take away from this class was applying to what I learned in physics class and seeing real simulations. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2027,"My greatest takeaway was just methods in research and experimentation relating to the various concepts we learned; heat, buoyancy, sound, lenses, etc. I'm also taking Phys 230 and the lab so I've gotten a lot of lab time this semester and I think I've definitely gained some knowledge on experiments, although they were all virtual. No problem. I think this is the last lab I'll have to take relating to physics, I'm not entirely sure. I think my favorite part of the class was heat and thermodynamics. I'm not sure why but I like the simple formula but genuinely sometimes difficult to put together ""puzzle"" of work and heat and different machines, etc."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2089,"My greatest takeaway from this class is to never give up and always persevere, even when you have little motivation to do so, you need to unlock that part of your brain and spirit to just keep pushing yourself and learn. This was really hard to do from my personal experience because online classes have become boring and just uninteresting for the most part. However, it is important to keep your goals in mind and to understand that there are brighter times ahead, and that we may have in person classes again someday. I took this away from this class this semester, seeing as though physics 3 is a very daunting class that is of a very high degree of difficulty, which has necessary information that will pertain to other courses such as fluids and thermo.""If you believe in yourself you can achieve anything"" -Johnny Karate"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,167,"My greatest take away from this class was that finding a group to work through the labs with is really important for learning and improving on physics skills/knowledge. In previous online labs, I worked by myself because I found it to be more efficient, but this lab made me realize that working in a group definitely makes the material more fun and engaging. Although it may be slower to work in a group, giving and receiving help from others is satisfying and ultimately helps everyone's understanding of the material."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2086,"My biggest takeaway from this class was the reassurance in the topics we were learning. If I am to be specific the work we did as group in the lab as well the in depth explanations the professor provided each time before we began was extremely helpful when it came to reflection and refraction which was the lab for week 10. Sometimes certain topics and mindset that I learned from this course became helpful when taking the exams for the lecture portion. This class gave me the biggest takeaway by being more connected to the teaching style that works best for me, slides and explanations and taking notes from such slides is my best way to stay on track therefore this lab course was helpful in all topics and reinforced me in all that I needed to learn. Things I was simply not grasping from reading chapters and chapters each week. So this new method to leaning and the very helpful group I had made this the best takeaways from this class. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2087,"The greatest takeaway from this class is that I primarily enjoy working solo in an online environment. I remembering enjoying work with other people when I was in person, but now I really do not like working with others. In this class, it seems that me by myself gets the work done at the same speed as a large group. Also it really seems like a hassle to not have the same text as your group members. Just don't have any group members, that way your text is your own from the start. Also drawing for labs is miserable, so annoying. I understand drawing for labs is a requirement for all labs, but drawing on a pdf with a mouse is so bad. Drawing in person and uploading it is also annoying. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2090,"Physics overall was a challenging course to overcome, I have been able to grasp just the minimum as physics to me is perhaps the hardest thing to truly understand. I will say that the greatest takeaway from this class is perhaps the ability to apply and see knowledge in our daily lives. I have began to see things in an entirely new way after taking the last three physics courses and can develop an understanding of why things work the way they do. Unfortunately I will not be applying it so much as I am discontinuing my engineering degree, after some long and very stressful thinking i have decided to switch my major. I have lost my passion for engineering over the course of the pandemic, missing out on the hands on experience as well as interacting with other engineering students has made it hard to want to pursue this degree. As of the next term I will be going into business, engineering has been challenging and I whish the best of luck to the others who are continuing.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2088,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that physics is everywhere and can be applied to just about anything. Physics is involved in so much more than I could have ever imagined. This lab has changed my perspective on how I see the world and identify physics in real life applications. I question things a lot more now as well. Instead of just accepting something, I question why, and how. Sometimes I don't always know the answer, but it definitely gets me thinking and pushes my understanding of physics. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2094,"My greatest take away from this class was being able to better understand the learning process and analysis that scientists in general take to better understand and articulate the world around them. By learning the concepts of Thermodynamics with the utilization of experiments from the lab, I was able to understand the behaviors and properties of temperature, reflection/diffraction of waves, as well light and sound waves themselves. The experiments have definitely helped me better understand how these concepts came to be articulated in physics. Knowing these concepts from the ground up, it was almost like I was learning along with physicists who originally conducted these experiments, which helped me not only understand the formulas associated with the concepts, but why they exist and why they work in a certain, specified manner. Receiving visual learning was very helpful in this regard as well because it's a form of learning that I find to prefer when it comes to understanding a concept, which was what made this laboratory imperative to my learning in the lecture for Thermodynamics."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,168,"My greatest take away from this class was how I was able to learn physics and enjoy majority of the labs we have done from my own home and not being physically in lab. Learning online was not difficult this time around and I'm able to take away the many topics we were taught and learned in this lab course, specifically the first law of thermodynamics we learned. My biggest take from that section was the temperature change and how it applies in the real world such as a stove when it then converts/transformed to heat. I learned a lot from the little time we spent on that material but it was great! Other than that the whole semester was a blast and wasn't difficult for being an online lab course. I hope you have a great winter break and a wonderful Christmas, thank you. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2093,My greatest takeaway from this class was applying what we were learning in class into a group environment to help create a greater understanding with discussion. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2092,My greatest takeaway from this class has been the differences and challenges of online labs and classes in general. I thought the material of the class was very interesting and fit very nicely with the lecture material. I really struggled with not having in person labs but I think Professor Genessa has done a great job keeping things interesting and making the labs as hands-on as possible with cool situations. It has been hard for me to keep myself on top of everything here as much as other classes and it has made me fall behind in some areas unfortunately with having a very closely scheduled csm class around the same time on wednesdays. The physics course  has been one of my favorites this semester and I regret not giving as much time to the lab as I was able to put into the lecture where I think I did rather well. I hope I can learn some lessons from this and improve this in the future. This has been a rather tough semester for me with life going on and I feel for other students and even more for the dedicated professors and instructors. Overall I think I learned a lot and hope I can take some lessons and learnings on to future semesters.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2095,"I think my main takeaway from this class has not even really had to do with physics as it has with my work ethic and the environments I succeed in. I already knew prior to this class that I do infinitely better with in person courses than I ever really do with fully online, but I have always had a special relationship with physics, in that I have always done really poorly. I always attributed this to just the instructors I had in the past not being the greatest instructors I have taken, but regardless of why, physics has always come across to me as this impossible subject and that the idea of me doing well in a physics course was unattainable. Now I admittedly did not put quite as much time into this class specifically per week as I should have, but when I did, I was always surprised by how much the ideas began to click when I just poured some time into them, even when they at first seemed incomprehensible, I was consistently delighted to see just how much sense I could make of things even with just the little time I would dedicate, not that I mastered the concepts or even fully grasped any of them as much as I should have, but for the first time in as long as I can remember, it felt like I actually could do well in the subject of physics if I just put some more time in. That has been my main takeaway from this class."
