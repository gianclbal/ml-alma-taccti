2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2094,"They've impacted my learning in having the focus of my courses. It is more difficult to be able to focus and have the mind space where I can be immersed with the concept that I'm learning when I'm at the same place that isn't a classroom. Although, it does help me be able to go back on what I learned when instructors record their lectures and post other learning resources, which really help enhance my depth of understanding in the concepts of my courses. It gets stressful, so I usually spend my free time going outside of my home and going traveling. I also read books during breaks and during my free time. Sometimes, I meditate as well for self-care. I worry about not being prepared enough for future courses or for my career, and I worry about just the level of stress that I may accumulate later in college. I'm also worried about accumulating a higher amount of anxiety as well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2095,"Honestly, as a whole I would have to say that online learning has been pretty detrimental to my overall school experience and mental health. I am the type of person who needs that physical interaction and instruction to really excel, I actually attended my junior and senior years of high school entirely online and it was not a fun time then either. I notice that I have a tendency to not take the material as seriously and procrastinate quite a bit more than I normally would in an in-person course, which causes a lot of stress when it comes to important assignments or exams. It’s also a bit more discouraging to actually ask for help, I find, since it feels a lot more ideal for me to just prepare whatever questions I have and ask my professors either after class or during office hours but when I am much less likely to actually email my professor and set up a Zoom appointment to ask questions. It is also a bit harder to ask and answer questions in the STEM field through an online medium as there can often be complicated graphs and whatnot."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,168,"Classes being online again this semester did not impact my learning since this isn't the first time I'm doing online courses. Unfortunately it did make my learning experience slightly more difficult and less entertaining. What I mean by this, is due to classes being online I've been on the same set schedule for majority of my classes and the learning doesn't really feel like learning its more like doing busy work just to get a grade. The classroom interaction isn't there since we are on zoom calls and that's where that feeling of not being entertaining is coming from. Regarding my well being, I'm doing well its just frustrating trying to juggle four different classes that are all online since there are a wide variety  of due dates which is where the stress comes from. I'm always needing to double check if the assignment I turned in went through all the way or what assignments are due a certain day etc."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2090,"Online learning has affected me a lot over the past few semesters. I was excited to being learning about engineering without really knowing what I was getting into, my experience when I first attended the school in person was all great. I was learning new material at a very linear pace, nothing was too hard to the point where I would start pulling the hair off my head. Once the transition to online learning was set is where it began to go downhill. Lab portions for many of the classes I took where done online over videos and then moved onto simulations just recently. This took out a lot of the hands on experience that I would have enjoyed to be a part of. Eventually as time passed I began to lose my passion for engineering as it was/is pretty hard to learn via Zoom. Its not something I have adjusted too with the difficult courses I have to fulfill. Also the lack of human interaction has been a downer, not seeing being going about their days really changed how I interact with other now. To cope with the pandemic and all I tried doing at home exercises to keep in shape as well as talk amongst my friends using discord. It helped for some time but it does get boring talking to the same people every single day especially when we were not able to meet in person. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2089,"Online classes have more than likely had a negative overall impact on my learning and socializing. I feel as though engineering and mathematical concepts are harder to grasp on a computer screen than in person. The volume of work for the majority of my courses has been increased to compensate for the lack of in person instruction; which also makes things more difficult. In all honesty, I really haven't been doing anything for self care. I really should be though, because I certainly don't feel healthy during this time, I have dropped (again) from 150 pounds to 130, and I am only 5' 9"" tall. I am concerned about that, my diet, and my grades. l feel like we have been doing online learning forever now, and sometimes I feel like I am missing out on a lot of education and experience that other people at different universities get to have. It also gets old not seeing other people anymore, I pretty much remain isolated."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2088,"Online classes have been kind of time. The hardest thing is just trying to develop a routine and really feel like I’m in school, rather than just sitting in my room on the computer all day. I do think online classes is the best option for me currently because I don’t have to commute to school from San Jose every day. I also had a son during this time, so being home makes it easier to spend time with him and watch him grow. For self care I have my son really. He can get me through anything and is definitely the best part of everyday. I also get to spend time with my girlfriend and dog, while trying to enjoy some hobbies like reading and video games. Having sports on also helps for sure. My only concern with online learning is that I feel I may not be fully understanding the material, and simply just trying to get pass the class. I know that it will affect my ability as an engineer in the future, and put me a little behind possibly. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,167,"Overall, classes switching to an online format made it more difficult to stay motivated and to have the same degree of concentration on school work as I used to have before covid. However, after being in this position for several months now, I have learned that the best way to counteract the above issues is to make a routine and stick with it. By this I mean have a consistent sleep schedule, eating schedule, and dedicated portions of each day to work on assignments. Personally, I have been on a similar routine to the one I had when classes were in-person and I lived on campus which has helped to prevent bad habits and falling behind on school work. Lastly, in my opinion, online classes usually are not that bad and pretty bearable, so I'm not very concerned about my learning, but I'm definitely looking forward to things going back to normal."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2093,"Online classes are better for me, I think. It gave me the opportunity to move back home while still achieving my goal of working towards my degree. While the social aspect has dwindled, I find my classes significantly easier to manage, saving costs on commuting, and I'm able to be with my friends back in LA. My only concerns are classes that are in person, as I'll need to attend colleges around my area that give equivalent or at least the same classes so to not move back for just one class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2086,Initially Online classes where a huge shift to what I had originally had ever known but it was a quick getting used to. I will say I have not done anything for my mental health since I have felt like Online classes have made me more to teach myself as the courses itself are either asynchronous or just overall lectures are meant to be more taught through homework. Self care has not really been a thing for me since I have felt that the less time in class has actually felt like the more time online studying or watching the videos given to us. I am concerned that I know my ability to teach myself is enough for a passing grade but nowhere near enough what Im supposed to know. It has felt as if I read and study but forget right after since overall online has been memorization and deadlines rather than a in depth approach. Overall im not concerned online has its flaws but definitely its benefits as well. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2092,It has definitely been challenging having classes fully online for this extended period of time. It absolutely takes a toll on mental health and staying motivated for online learning. I try to balance this with family and friends and give myself some time to do some self care. I feel for professors and instructors as it is probably even harder for them right now. Ive been using a little breathing meditation routine that does help and I have tried to follow some good online study habits. There is plenty more that I probably should do to improve my online class habits.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2087,"It's somewhat harder to learn online since when you're in person, you are forced to take notes. It's the presence of being in a room with the other students and professor that makes you act in line. Online classes however, no one can see what you're doing so I typically wake up, join the zoom, and lay in bed primarily only listening in the zoom. It's hard to motivate myself to wake up and start taking notes. I adopted a lazy lifestyle from all the online learning, it's only this semester where I motivated myself to turn assignments on time and stay on a strict schedule. As bad as all this seems, I don't think I can go back to in person classes. Almost my entire college career has been online learning, I'm too used to the lifestyle. It will be difficult adjusting back. Online learning has it's benefits such as recordings of the lectures. For self care, I only really play video games in my free time, that's about it. Otherwise I'm just watching videos. I've recently ran out of things for both, so not looking too good. I don't think online learning should be viewed as the ""ultimate"" evil, I think some classes work and some don't. Lecture classes are good translations most of the time, while labs aren't that good most of the time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,1945,"Learning online has been overall very challenging for me. Learning physics online was very difficult because I felt as through I was not able to fully understand the concepts and it impacted my grades in most of my classes. Online learning has also effected my learning because I really can focas and learn best when I am in a classroom. For self care, I make sure I exsercise, eat healthy, get enough sleep, meditate, and spend as much time outside as I can. The concern I have for my learning is when online, I tend to loose motivation but I still do my best."
