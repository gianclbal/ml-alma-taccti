2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2089,"The concept I wanted to know more about is oscillations of a guitar string. I wonder if it is at all possible to experiment with the string oscillations and find a way to make an infinite one (keeps moving), thus producing sound infinitely without dissipation. After reading my notes, I realize that there are certain frictions in our universe that won't be override, such as air resistance. Clearly, friction from ambient air has something to do with stopping the guitar string."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2086,"Throughout the weeks a major topic that was taught and expanded upon was heat. During week 5 we talked about ways to find thermal equilibrium  as well how to reach an overall final temperature. Since the weather here in San Francisco this started to make me think, we are reaching a point that people will use heaters as a source to keep temperatures warm and have that way of producing heat. Now this got me thinking on how this relates to this weeks lab. We have talked about sound waves and a connection this has to heat is the fact that heat also has its own waves, heat waves. Heat waves is also another important topic in physics. An example I would be able to think of is the waves emitted  when trying to defog a cars winshdhield . Using the ideas of final temperature and heat involved as we have a clash of temperatures either fogging a cars windshield or doing the opposite and taking the fogginess away. Overall thats also an example of a heat wave. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,167,"A concept covered in class recently that I found interesting was simple harmonic motion. Although most oscillations in the real world are damped, simple harmonic motion is a relatively simple way to mathematically describe the behavior of many different things in the universe. An important property of a wave in SHM in motion is the wave velocity. How is a wave's velocity dependent upon the properties of the wave? Velocity can be expressed in two ways; angular frequency divided by the wave number, or by the simplified version, wavelength times frequency. The velocity of a wave is important to know in order to determine the time it takes a wave to travel from one point to another. For example, a broadcasting company might need to know how long it will take a radio signal to travel from a radio tower to a customer's home."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,168,"A concept that was covered in the past few weeks which I thought was interesting is the second law of thermodynamics. It states that a heat engine is impossible to reach 100% efficiency, why is that? Its impossible for a heat engine to reach 100% efficiency because its impossible to have an engine during a heat cycle because when the engine takes energy from a hot reservoir it cant equal the same amount of work since some of the energy escapes into the environment. This is applicable in our lives daily, because many companies that produce vehicles with engines in them look to be the most efficient but these engines are way below 100% efficiency ranging from 20-40% efficiency depending on if its gasoline or diesel. This is why many companies and our society our switching to electric motors instead of heat engines is because they are far more efficient and better for our environment. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,1945,"So far the lab that involved sound stood out to me because I thought is was the most interesting. For a while before I learned more about physics, I have always wondered about sound and what it acually was. My question is, why does sound travel slower in water than it does in air?  I learned that sound speed is effected by the medium that the sound travels through. For example, sound travels faster through air than it does when traveling through water. Water is a denser medium than air so the sound waves will have a harder time traveling through. This topic benefits society because he hear sounds everyday; from people talking, to listening to music.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2087,"How come we cannot hear higher frequency noises? My thoughts are that the higher frequency is traveling through our ears so fast that they don't vibrate the eardrums or that the vibration is so fast that there's no movement/displacement. I'm not sure if this is truly a ""benefit"" to society, but it's an example of high frequency sound we can't hear, that being a dog whistle. Otherwise, I don't think high frequency noises we cannot hear benefit society, in fact it's more of a threat. I believe they can still damage your ears despite not being hearable. It's a danger we can't detect, one we can't hear coming. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2090,"Something I learned in the past few weeks of lecture that I had some questions was on the topic of simple harmonics oscillators. We covered something in dampened oscillations but couldn't really catch on to how it really worked. Looking back at a real life application I discovered during class that week was how shock absorbers work especially in cars. I believe shocks is what they were called in vehicles simply put, an old car with worn out shocks will have little to no dampening which would lead it to bounce a lot more when the vehicle comes across any sort of bump. If they were to be replaced then the amount of bouncing will be reduced drastically.     "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2095,"One topic that we covered which I can see immediate applications for in everyday life and in my particular field of interest, engineering, was the section dedicated to heat. A question that I commonly ask myself throughout these labs is will I actually be utilizing these specific ideas in my field or if this is just something that I am required to take for engineering but will never actually see it once I wind up in my desired career? I believe that the heat section had the most obvious answer. I connected a lot of the information to material that I learned in my engineering materials class which delved into the actual chemical makeup of various materials and their properties. One chapter was dedicated to the effects that heat, or the lack of it, has and how it drastically impacts the manner in which we construct buildings and whatnot. We discussed how certain metals will hit a threshold temperature and will begin to experience expansion or shrinkage, and this could have huge consequences if say the supports of the building were screwed or bolted into place and those bolts or screws found themselves under cold enough temperatures that they would actually decrease in size. And I felt that the discussions of how the mass and specific heat capacities and temperature changes all interacted had the most obvious correlation to this very important concept in the engineering world and everyday life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2091,"How do sound waves possibly affect the human body and how have scientists and doctors used sound waves to non-intrusively learn more about a person’s physical condition?                 Sound waves, in principle, travel through gas, water, bones, and muscle within the body in the form of vibrations.  Doctors will use a tool like a stethoscope to measure the beats of the heart and the expansion of the lungs. The stethoscope picks up on these slight vibrations created by the heart and lungs and a doctor with prior experience can tell if their patient’s heart has a murmur or an irregular heartbeat."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2093,"How can people utilize buoyancy in liquids in their daily lives? Thinking back, the displacement of liquid due to an object submerging could be helpful to think about when we think of liquid. In that lab, the volume of water displaced was equal to the volume of the block. If we keep that sort of displacement in mind, whenever we put objects into liquid, we should keep in mind the amount of liquid is in a container and the volume of the object submerging. If it causes an overflow and liquid starts to creep out, draining the container of some liquid would be helpful. This can be applied to mixing a cup full of coffee with spoons, entering a completely filled bath tub, and inserting a straw to a drink that's to the top. Keeping in mind the volume of an object, we can have an idea of how much liquid we should have at max in order to not overfill and spill our container's liquid."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2088,"How does work and energy relate to a car’s combustion engine?Work is required to move an engines piston up and down. This motion allows the crankshaft to rotate, which delivers power to the wheels and is what ultimately makes the car move. Energy is involved because the engine converts energy from the heat caused by burning gas to create work to move the piston. While thinking about this, I noticed that many more aspects from our lab could be applied to a car engine, like ideal gasses, and thermodynamics."
