2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2085,"I wnat to join the STEM field because I like science the most out of all the subjects that I have learned. I like this field because it is about problem solving and learning how to answer questions using our own knowledge and experience. To me, STEM is appealing because it is information about the real world, especially physics. Whenever I am able to see what we are learning in the classroom in the real world, my mind goes crazy I also chose STEM because it is a field that is growing, and I feel like a degree in STEM would open up a lot of options for me in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2086,My goal to join the STEM field is because within stem we have civil engineering and specifically construction management engineering. That branch in STEM is what will allow me to join a career  that involves things that I’m interested in with a solid and strong degree. Also being honest I plan to stay in San Francisco so the whole Bay Area is very technological therefore going in the STEM field is also a good job opportunity in this area. Also I would want to go into the STEM field because In reality having a job in this field will help me out financially. The more I study and challenge myself in STEM the better I will be able to succeed in life. Overall what truly helped me decide was my back injury when I was younger and I knew that my back would not be able to keep up with construction work physically so studying and using my brain for construction rather than my body will help me have both construction and engineering in my career path. Overall I feel as if STEM is a field open to exploration that will help me better myself in. many different aspects moving forward possibly changing my life as a whole. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,168,"I ask myself about once a week why I'm doing this, when I find myself struggling on courses that are required for my major. I’m doing civil engineering with a focus on transportation, and my reasoning for being in the stem field is in hopes of achieving financial success  and due to my fondness of engineering in general. Like most students who are in college the big goal of earning a degree is for the opportunity to advance in society in contributing to what they are studying and to give themselves the chance for a better paying job. For me, a big part of being in the stem field is for the financial opportunities that I would be opening for myself because the harsh reality of everything is money plays a big part in our lives whether we like it or not. When I was young bridges, structures and the way things were made struck my interest into engineering growing up and when it came time to decide my major and focus I went with transportation in hopes of solving the terrible bay area traffic that I experience on a day to day basis. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2087,"I don't have a particular reason for entering the STEM field currently, I'm just here because I said ""electrical engineering sounds cool"" which led me here. If I really think about my whole life leading up to it, it's probably because as a kid I saw Iron Man and thought ""yeah, that's pretty cool."" Anyways I'm here now and a little uncertain of what my future will be, a lot of decisions have been on a whim. What I hope to get out of an electrical engineering degree is a stable job and a stable life. Perhaps I can also fulfill my childhood dream of an Iron Man suit, maybe. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2088,"I’ve always wanted to join the stem field because I have always been interested in those classes. Science courses have always been my favorite going all the way back to 4th grade science class. Stem classes always sparked my interest and that’s when I knew I wanted to go into the stem field. I started out as a marine bio major, but soon changed to mechanical engineering because I liked knowing how things work and I wanted to help people in some sort of way. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2089,"I would like to go into the stem field because my parents really want me to and I do not want to disappoint them, by now I have made it to my third year in engineering school, and I hope to be able to finish."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2090,"I have lost a good amount of the passion I had over this last year when it comes to becoming an engineer. I haven’t been as excited or encouraged to work as hard because I wasn’t in a very good learning environment, the sudden transition on to online learning was difficult, working from home was just not efficient. Nonetheless, the reason why I want to become an engineer is so that I can acquire the skills to create and restore. I have been very interested in aircrafts and how fast they are able to fly. I’ve done research on commercial jets that flew at the speed of sound with up to 100 passengers on board which was impressive but it had its flaws. Recently this form of travel has resurfaced and engineers have redesigned and found solutions to the previous models flaws and it will perhaps return in the near future and it’s where I want to be apart of."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,1945,"I want to go into stem because I have always had an interest in astronomy. When I was younger, I would always read about space and loved educating myself on the solar system. I am currently majoring in astronomy and I really enjoy it.  I also feel it is important for more women to get involved in stem and I feel that it is good that I am part of this community."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2091,"I want to go into the STEM field because I believe in the importance each field has to society as a whole. STEM majors tend to be rewarding for those who have a passion and drive to complete them. I also like a little bit of a challenge and engineering definitely brings just that. Even as a child, I have always been into sci-fi and action movies that incorporate science and technology. I would hopefully like to go into the automotive industry as my first choice and participate in engine or frame/chassis design. My second choice would be the clean energy industry, more specifically solar, where I would work on solar panel design and function. They also generally pay very well which will help with my student loans as well as other financial endeavors in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2027,"I want to go into a STEM field really because it's what I love doing. I'm studying Astrophysics but I love to code and do math so STEM is the obvious choice. Also, we're at a point in history where STEM jobs are becoming more and more prevalent, so I (hopefully) won't have a very hard time finding a job after college, whether it be in Astrophysics, or it's a software job that uses my knowledge in Physics and Python. STEM is a field that very directly changes the world. STEM is slowly creeping its way into every other field, too. Take biology for example; we can learn a lot about biology using microrobots or something similar. There are lots of ways STEM will help."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2092,"I have always been attracted to STEM subjects and especially engineering related topics ever since I was little. I have always loved physically designing and building things and have gravitated towards things to do with science and technology. I’ve always loved the creative process that comes with fully diving into a real and tangible problem and working to create the best possible solution. I have passion for engaging projects that let me put my creative and collaborative problem solving skills to work. I have found that I can be quite good at conceptualizing and designing a solution if a project sparks my imagination. When it does there’s no pulling me away and I become fixated, so even things like my main classwork or studying can suffer from my highly selective attention. I tend to really enjoy and do well in things like design competitions or other engineering based challenges. However, I can often struggle with pure theory and engineering topics I can’t immediately apply intuitively or interact with in any kind of hands-on way. It is probably my greatest weakness as a student and I’ve come to believe I'd be better at being an actual engineer than I am at being an engineering student. It’s just a matter of getting there. I don’t think I could see myself doing something that tapped into my interest in STEM and creative problem solving."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,446,"The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is because I am naturally scientifically inclined. I recall being in love with natural sciences as far back as elementary school. I received countless science department always up until high school. When I graduated in 2019, I was awarded the Science Department award for my excellency in Physics. I think that I just have a true passion for physics which grown over time and has led me to major in it. Additionally, I am pursuing a minor in mathematics because I also love all the complex mathematics that is involved with physics. Currently, I am in my third year and I feel like I have made the right decision. I feel at home in the STEM field and I would not do anything different. I feel excited and await the challenges ahead me with irons fists and an iron will. I LOVE PHYSICS! "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2093,"I like the sciences a lot. I feel like these fields are world changers in terms of results, and I think I want to be a part of that. I also like space, so why not do something with that."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,167,"My major is mechanical engineering and the reasons I chose that major and to be in the STEM field ultimately come down to what I learned to like and dislike in my time in high school. When I started high school, I had no plan for education after high school and beyond. Originally, I did not think I would be in the STEM field because I hated math and science in middle school, but after a series of inspiring teachers in high school that taught me to think about things from a different perspective, I learned to enjoy math. Eventually, I learned that math is a powerful tool to solve problems based on numerical logic derived from simpler problems. In other words, I enjoy math because it is usually logic-based and relatively intuitive which is exactly why I learned to dislike the other fields like arts and humanities. The reason I chose mechanical engineering specifically is a combination of my enjoyment for building things and my passion for math and science. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,58,I want to go into steam because I feel like steam is more hands on. I want a job where I feel like I'm doing something. I want a job where I feel productive. I also feel like there is going to be a lot of growth in field.I mostly choose stem because it seemed cool. Like the science fiction got me hooked into it.Ive stayed in it because I like the people in it they all seem very chill.The community of stem majors is nice every one is lost but on track its a nice environment.All my friends are in stem its a nice think we all complain about the math but enjoy our major we like the science in it.I guess stem is just a nice community where you complain of the work but also enjoy ding it.But I got into stem because it hand on and science fiction.
