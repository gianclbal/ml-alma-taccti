2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2090,"This reflection was a bit hard to write about, I am currently having second thoughts about becoming an engineer. For the past few weeks I have taken some time to look for other paths I can pursue since this major isn't exactly what I want anymore. So I guess a goal I have by the end of this semester is to really figure out what I want to do for these next few years in terms of school and really just life. The way this class has helped in some kind of way is how to manage my time more efficiently. Its something that a lot of other classes have been helping a lot with too but its not something I can adjust to very quickly, so I'm taking the small steps to becoming more efficient. I'm sure this class has helped in other ways I cannot come up with at the moment but I know that in order to make these changes I will have to take it seriously and give it a lot of though in order to move on. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2087,"I don't have a particular goal for my future at the moment. I'm just here just because. Choosing my major of electrical engineering didn't really have any special reasoning behind it, so the most I can say for my goals is to succeed in the future. I'm mostly just filling out my roadmap for my major, and this classes is one of the checkpoints. I suppose this class is one of the more major ones as it is the third of it's kind, Physics 3, and I believe it will be the last physics class before I need to take engineering classes. The final road stop before I get heavily involved in my major and see if it's what I want to be involved with for my future. I suppose the best I have right now is to pass this class, a bit boring. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2027,"I'm not really fully sure what my goals are but they definitely involve having a degree in Astrophysics and more than likely a degree in computer science... I hope to work for a company dealing with rockets, space exploration in general, or astronomy research. But I'm not really set on anything... maybe a job in computer science wouldn't be too bad afterall. This class helps me extremely directly 'cause I'm a physics major and this will give me a basis for electricity which is important down the line, even with computer science."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2089,"My goal is to receive from this course a level of understanding of physics that I will need academically for my degree, and for this understanding to be at such a level thaT I can apply to to an engineering job that I will have in the future. This class can help me do this by giving me building blocks of engineering and concepts that I will need to tap into to hold a job doing engineering design after I graduate. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2093,"I think my goals are just being able to pass and understand my classes. I've got a lot on my plate in terms of classes and personal things going on, so just passing my classes would be enough for me. This class helps me understand how some things in physics look when applied, so it isn't just conceptual in my head."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2085,"My only goal in life at the moment is to graduate from school. This class will help me get there by giving me the eneral education requirements that I need. I don't have many goals in life at the moment other than graduating. I'm just tryna survive and take things one step at a time. I mean I have thoughts of going into biotech in the future, but other than that I don't really have goals that I have set for myself. I guess another goal I have in life is getting good at the guitar, but this class doesn't really help with that."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,167,"Overall, my current goal is to complete my undergraduate education and to eventually learn the information that will help me succeed in graduate school if I choose to do that and in what I hope will be my future career as a mechanical engineer. My goal for just this semester is to succeed in my classes and prepare myself for the more challenging classes that I’m planning on taking in the coming semesters. In terms of how this class brings me closer toward completing these goals, my major has a lot to do with almost all aspects and categories of Physics and other branches of science as well as math. Specifically, Physics labs seem to go into more detail about real-world/practical applications of the concepts that are taught in Physics lectures. In other words, this class encourages further exploration into these concepts in the hopes that it will reinforce students’ knowledge and understanding."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2088,I have many goals I wish to accomplish within my lifetime. This class can definitely help with some of them for sure. One of those goals is graduating with my degree and finding a job. This class will propel me towards completing my degree and the knowledge I gain from this course will be useful in future internships and jobs. This class will help me be the best engineer I can be because the material in this course lays a foundation for future material and is something I will always rely on. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,168,My goals in life are to start a family and to start my career in engineering which can lead me to starting a family and this class is a step towards that goal. I am currently a junior shooting for a bachelors degree in civil engineering. This class will help me with that goal because I would be learning the fundamentals of many physic topics such as fluids and thermodynamics and how they apply to the real world. By passing this class it would be bringing me a step closer to achieving that goal since it is a prerequisite for my degree choice and would apply to my job and without it I wont be able to graduate.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,58,My goal is just to get a degree. I have no clue what I'm doing with my life. I just want to be able to get by I'm not too sure what my objective is here I just want to finish college .This class will help me by filling in my requirements. This class also seems to give me a level of knowledge to what is happening in the universe around me so it possibly help me find my objective in life. I guess my goal is to find my self. Im not too sure yet I feel the same way I felt once I left high school no clue on what to do with my life. I guess this class can help me by just helping me understand the universe around me and how it works or just by helping me look at new perspectives. But I just need this class for a grade
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2094,"My goals are to better understand the way that thermodynamics affects variables concerning in the field of engineering, particularly in my field of interest in Automotive Engineering. This class certainly helps me achieve the goal of understanding with the use of experimentation through each concepts. It's really thorough in a practical and visual approach, which actually helps me learn in the lecture course as well. It has worked for me in the Classical Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism Physics courses, and it will be part of what will help me reach that goal with this class. Especially with the lab about learning how heat works and how it is independent from temperature in that heat is a transfer of energy and temperature is a mere indicator of the transfer with the use of a simulation and a physical experimentation during the Lab was effective for me. It really enhanced my understanding of the formula for heat itself and its real-world applications. That in turn has helped with the PHYS 240 course in using heat and how to understand how to use it to solve specific problems of heat."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,2,2086,My goals are to reach a point in  my life where I will have a solid job in my engineering career. First and most immediate goal is to work hard and progress through school in order to get the degree that will help me reach my overall goal in engineering. At some point I hope to reach a job in construction management engineering either here in the bay or in Los Angeles. This class will help me reach that goal by teaching me the material necessary which eventually will be used in my career. Also will give me the boost to knowing things necessary within my field. Overall I hope to learn from this class and school in general to later on learn from internships and working in the field.
