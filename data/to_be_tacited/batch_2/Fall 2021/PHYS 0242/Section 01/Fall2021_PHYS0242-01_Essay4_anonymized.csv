2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,130,"Online learning has still taken its toll on me as well as a number of other students that I am aware of. It seems like we have lost our community as students and we are all on our own. Of course, online learning has its benefits but in my case, I do not believe that they have helped me overall; I would much rather be on campus and in person. Self-care also tends to be an issue for me. I do not really take too great of care since there is so much on my plate. Trying to keep up with school, work, and everything day-to-day life brings me as a 4th-year college student is very difficult and definitely does not help my mental health. I try to make sure to not let things stack up; this is a major help for me to make sure I stay on top of everything I can. Organization is also key to making sure nothing is forgotten; making sure I have everything set up for classes is crucial to doing well in those classes. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2079,Online classes have added more stress in my life. I learn better in person as there is immediate direct feedback from the instructor. The classroom environment also help me focus on the lecture. The concern I have is the grades. Some of the home works would have been easier if the laboratory was taken in the laboratory with the immediate help from instructor. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,159,"Coming into this year I thought the learning experience was going to be a little similar to the spring semester, in terms of how my teachers impact my learning and the level of work we were supposed to do, but I feel like there has been way more work and they expect us to work harder because we are at home. In my opinion, they should have kept the same workload as the previous semester because we are all still adjusting to working on zoom, so unfortunately it has had a negative effect on my mental health. What I have been doing to keep my mind clear and proactively keep a good mindset was by writing out all my tasks on my calendar and making sure that I take breaks between classes. In the future, I pray that the workload will get shorter, but we all know it's going to get more challenging from here."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,173,"Online learning has been really tough for me. I feel like I have definitely become too comfortable at home that I have to discipline myself to get stuff done. I have to study more and find a way to keep focus in class. Constantly looking at screen for classes makes it hard for me to focus and now I play music in the background to get by during lectures. As for self-care I relax and play some games with friends to destress from classes. Sometimes I'll do some work and reward myself with some free time to read or play a game or two. The main concern I have for my learning is how I will adjust to in-person classes after this semester. I honestly don't think I'll do so well and it will take time to become used to it again. For my well-being, I hope I don't become as stressed as I've been during online classes. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2076,"Having a majority of online classes my entire college experiences has definitely changed the way I learn. Since I graduated high school in 2020, I was robbed of a ""real"" college experience for my freshman year. It is hard for me to focus during online lectures because I get distracted by the objects around me, mostly being my phone. It is also very discouraging because my home environment is very comfortable and does not feel like a learning environment at all. However, I still managed to maintain good grades my entire first year and I will definitely maintain good grades for my second year here as well. I have many concerns regarding this upcoming school year. Since I am a STEM major in the CoSE of SFSU, I was just wondering if any more STEM classes are going to offered in person or not. I ask this because I only have one in-person class this semester and it is a class that I could have easily taken online. However, my two harder classes are fully online and it is a little difficult for me to grasp concepts because of that. Overall, I just feel like instead of basing class environments on grade level we should base them off of the level of difficulty it is to learn online and in person. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2072,"Some of my online classes have been more manageable because they are online. Although some of my online classes are more difficult because it's just harder to understand the material and some professors have a habit of over assigning work because they assume since we are doing school at home that we some how have more time to do all this extra work, and when multiple professors do this the work load ends up being too much. In term of self-care I have been too busy to honestly think about it and I haven't really been able to do anything in that area of my life. I hope to figure out how to make a change to this soon but it depends on how much work I have to do. Doing classes as hybrid would be a lot better and create the right amount of versatility in learning that will hit home a lot better. I have been through much tougher times with more work put on me to do and I was able to make it out of that so I know that this is a time that will be triumphed. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1919,"Online classes have tremendously increased my capacity for learning.  Although it does have its own set of challenges, the benefits have far out weighed those difficulties for me.  Online learning has allowed me have a much larger part in my daughters life while still pursuing my degree in mechanical engineering.  Having to commute to the city every day would absolutely make this immensely more difficult.  Furthermore, I am able to simply walk my daughter to her school in the morning and then get on my laptop for my classes all within the span of 5 minutes.  Having to commute would be much more time consuming, financially burdening, and negatively impact my relationship with my daughter and my family. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2077,"Online classes are much harder than the in-persons were, as for self-care nothing I guess, I don't really know what that means. The only concerns I have is how much of what I am leaning will I really retain?"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2078,"Online Classes have their cons and pros. Cons are it's hard to ask questions privately for some professors because they do not read the chat, internet problem because most of the time professors require you to pass something after class, but slow or unstable internet can cause problems. Also, even more, procrastination since you can lay on your bed and not listen to the professor. Pros are that it is convenient to attend class at home or anywhere if there is internet available and a safe place. What I do, if I can, is too do the work, get some help from others if you are stuck, and it is nice to see professors are more lenient to their deadline for passing homework."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2083,"I've observed both benefits and drawbacks from the transition to online learning.Some of the benefits have been convenience and having more resources at the ready. I used to commute to school every day, now I can attend class from home and not spend time driving, parking, and commuting to class. I attend class at my desk and can immediately begin working on assignments in the same setting. Mentally, this is great because there is no transition involved between class and assignments. I can work more seamlessly without having to reset. I've also been using my iPad for all homework and notes, and this has helped me keep everything organized. I have folders for all of my documents and notes and I don't lose anything.Some of the drawbacks to online learning are that it's more difficult to connect with other students and with my professors. In a virtual learning environment, I feel less connected than I would like, and it is tough to form connections and friendships with students studying the same material.For self-care, I have been making sure to take regular walks outside to keep my body engaged. I open the windows to make sure I'm getting enough light throughout the day, and I turn off all lights and screens as I'm preparing to go to sleep."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2075,"At first, online classes seemed like a good idea because it felt like we were taking a long break from school. However, it got pretty boring pretty fast, and I found that I was having trouble focusing on most of my online classes. After spending all this time doing online classes, I've learned that some classes are better in person. Asynchronous classes are better online. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1920,"It has impacted me in some really difficult ways. It is so hard to learn a civil engineering degree online, almost impossible, professors are so hard to understand especially when you are a visual learner. I have no motivation to go to class, I have no friends which have never been a problem before, the only good thing about them is that I can go home to visit my family. This online learning makes me feel like I am going insane. All I can do for self care is step away from school and my computer. I just don’t know what else to do other than just leave. It is so hard, and I just really really cannot wait for school to be back in person again. I miss the professors. I miss leaning. I miss caring. I just really don't like this. I know some people are loving this, but I feel like my life was just ripped out from under me. I feel scared to go back to school, like I won’t be able to do it anymore. I was not prepared for this type of learning and you can tell no one else was including the school which is why it made it so difficult."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2084,"Online classes have made life both more difficult and easier in different aspects. For money wise it has helped a lot bc now I'm back home with my parents and saving money while working. Education wise has been a bit stressful on the other hand. I have a short attention span and with multiple electronics around me I get easily distracted. Same with muting myself and turning my video off it causes me not to interact in class and then slowly fade out of the lecture. I've also become more lazy being online where i just want to sleep in and skip classes. However, I'm working on waking up earlier and going for morning runs in order to get the brain going. I've also been working on my well being by cutting of dark sodas and energy drinks. I'm trying to be more active while eating and drinking healthier things like tea, water, and salads."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2071,"Online classes have been the bane of my existence they have only been increasingly harder to go through especially as i move through harder classes for my major. It is also a set back when i can't do the in person labs. However, i feel like i have been able to adapt and learn from the first semseter in online learning to now. I just hope internships don't view me different due to my online learning period compared to others. What i do to practice self care is bake, workout, walk my dogs, and sleep. I try to take a step back from my never ending uphill battle with school and work and try to relax."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,478,"Since we started online classes almost 2 years ago now I feel it definitely has affected by learning not in a positive way. When you learn in person you get one on one attention, interaction with the teachers and students. As well as your more comfortable asking questions and participating in the class. I feel that since Ive been online I don't take my classes as serious and some of the teachers don't take the classes as serious either. Some teachers make it extremely easy to pass their classes because I think they don't want the extra work. That is not to say that all teachers have taken this route, but some have. I know for me as a student if Im being truthfully honest it is much more tempting to cheat my way through certain classes because of the difficulty of learning online and the accessibility to the internet while in class. I think for most student this is the same, some students will say they like it online thats just because their cheating their way through classes and its easier for them because they barley have to put in any work. On top of all of this, it affects peoples socials skills. Which for teens in high school or middle school I can see this having.a huge impact on their learning curves as they grow. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1070,I have started very rough but I am going through the labs now so I am getting better in doing these labs. I started going for groups and it helps me understand the topic better
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1932,"Online classes have been a two sided coin for me. On one hand, I have more freedom and seem to get good grades, but I also seem to learn a bit less because of the lack of physical presence. It is easy to just log into zoom and only listen to certain parts while doing other tasks at home. However, I do like them because I have been able to continue my education in a safe and healthy way. "
