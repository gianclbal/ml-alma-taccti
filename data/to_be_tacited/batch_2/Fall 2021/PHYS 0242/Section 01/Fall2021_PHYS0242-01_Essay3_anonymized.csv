2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2074,Out of all the topics that we covered so far the one that stands out for me was buoyancy. It is a very interesting subject. My initial question to this particular topic was in the beginning of the semester was that how things' volume and density affect their buoyancy.It turns out that the volume of the objects affects its buoyancy properties.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,478,"In my opinion everything we've worked on so far has been extremely interesting. One that stands out to me the most is the heat lab. In this lab we found the difference between heat and hot. Hot is related to temperature while heat is the activity of making something's temperature rise. We also did experiments on water. It was interesting to see that waters that have differences in temperature when combined they meet somewhere in the middle.If this water is affected by ice cubes, or hot metal. We see the change in temperature happen quicker for the object as to the water. This is relevant to everyday life because we put ice into water or sodas all the time.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2076,"I really liked the simple harmonic motion lab because I was already familiar with the concepts because I had previously learned it in a previous physics class. It can be applicable in every day life because when having to create suspension bridges. In lecture, Professor Liguori gave resources to learn about the downfall of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. The bridge had no room for airflow and that is why it collapsed. I think this is a good example as to how physics works in every day life because we literally use bridges everyday like I literally have to cross a bridge every time I go back home to Vallejo and even to go to school in the city. If the Tacoma Narrows Bridge had more area holes for air flow, then it would not have collapsed. However, the engineers at the time did not realize that and made a very public downfall. Overall, physics is very important because it is always being used in every day life. Without it, a lot of these concepts would not have been able to reach the human mind. Engineering is very important in this world because it is what determines what will be built in our communities and not. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,130,"The favorite lab we have done so far is the first law of thermodynamics lab. The lab and what was entailed in the lab are used in the automotive world very regularly, especially when it comes to pistons. There are pistons in engines as well as the suspension for cars meaning it is not only limited to gas or diesel-powered vehicles. The heat and dissipation of heat within these systems is incredibly important even more so in the racing world than it is in a regular car. To tune the engine and suspension for the correct application, many factors must be taken into consideration such as heat and pressure. That is basically how suspension and engines work. Engines create pressure and pump that pressure out, converting it to rotational energy, going through different gear changes and differentials to eventually power the wheels which move the car forward and back. The suspension system follows a very similar route but it turns the energy absorbed up from the ground into the tire and wheel assembly then eventually into the strut which turns that energy into pressure and heat through a valved piston contained in a cylinder filled with fluid which allows for the maximum contact patch of the tire to the pavement, giving the tire the most friction with the ground and the greatest traction overall. Understanding the law of thermodynamics and how this 1st law applies to specific functions such as automotive engines, we can better understand how to properly equip a car for a certain task. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2075,"One concept that we covered in this course was sound waves and frequency. We learned that sounds are vibrations or pressure waves moving through a medium, the most common one being air. The higher the frequency of the sound, the higher the pitch. Different frequencies can be thought of as different notes. When I think of notes, I think of music, and playing notes in an instrument. When you combine multiple notes, that is called a chord, and the frequencies of those notes merge together to make a pleasant sound to our ears. If any of these notes are out of key, or at a different frequency, then we might perceive this as an unpleasant sound."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1920,One thing that I know is applicable in people’s lives is the idea of hot and cold together. In one lab we studied the idea of what hot and cold temperatures did to each other and I found it interesting that we actually tested one part of the lab with our own hands and not a simulation or a devise. This is interesting because this shows that these kinds of idea already come naturally to us and that we actually already have a basic understanding of these ideas. We have to learn about these ideas subconsciously to be able to survive which show that all concepts of physics are just naturally in our lives and we observe them without even realizing it most of the time.    
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2077,"Does simple harmonic motion formulas and ideas work for all harmonic motions.The answer is no, the problem is similar to why you can't use sin cos and tan on non-right triangles, it simply does not apply. We can use the formulas and ideas from simple harmonic motion to formulate a way to solve complex harmonic motions."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1919,"I'm not sure why, but every since learning about buoyancy, I've been thinking about that iconic scene from the titanic where jack and rose are in the ocean and rose is laying on the door while jack is still in the water freezing to death.  There's a big controversy as to whether Jack would have been able to fit on the the door with rose. However, I'm not sure if they are asking the right question,  I think the question that should be asked is if there would be a buoyant force would have been sufficient enough to keep the door afloat with both of them on it.  I believe that Jack would have been able to fit on the door, but I do not believe that the weight of the displaced water would have been greater than the combined weight of the door, jack and rose. This is relevant because I'm tired of hearing people debate this and everyone has seen the movie so it would be nice to end that controversy once and for all. Furthermore, this would be a great attention getter for explaining buoyancy "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2072,"The concept of the heat engine and heat pump is one that is very central to modern life. Something we can look at is to try and formulate how to make heat pumps and heat engines better? Having improved heat engines can make for better cars that are used day to day but also we use a fridge and freezer everyday. Having better ones will improve lives and efficiency even more from how things work right now. Having a higher efficiency can save energy, will improve the distance vehicles will travel, will make it so less maintenance will have to be done and also will make other aspects of life better given that there will be less things to worry about for those who drive. Vehicle currently run at about 30% efficiency but as each small percentage improves this will make for better cars that process heat better."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2083,"Question: How does an internal combustion engine work?An internal combustion engine functions by initiating explosions inside of a cylinder which create force against a piston. Pistons work in sequence to produce force, driving a crankshaft and converting the torque at the axle(s). The conditions for an efficient explosion cycle are carefully engineered. A combination of pressure and fuel concentration at the time of ignition can reliably produce consistent force at the desired RPM.The human interacts with this system by controlling the gas pedal in the cabin of the vehicle. There is a mechanical connection from the gas pedal to the throttle, which controls how much air and/or fuel is allowed to enter the cylinder. Because the cylinder is a constant volume, increased pressure in this space results in a greater force against the piston when the air/fuel mixture is ignited."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,159,"The concept that I want to talk about in this reflection is probably from Lab 5 where we worked on how to determine the velocity of certain particles depending on mass in a closed system. I guess a question that I have is how can I use these principles of maxwell Boltzmann distributions in my daily life and how relevant it is to me as a physics student. Well looking back at this lab I think I originally said that these principles can be used in my everyday life to find the difference in how small and large particles react with each other in a closed system, but I feel like I could apply so much more with what I learned here. And I guess what i'm trying to say is that air particles in a closed system can be applied anywhere in my daily life and there isn't really a limit to what they can't represent. And I would also say that these relationships it has with velocity and energy are super relevant to me as a physics student because one can apply so many concepts to it, like calculus concepts of derivatives and integrals. After completing the lab I realized that a real-life example of this could be, blowing up a balloon with both our breath and helium. When we blow up a balloon our breath the particles are much slower than the helium particles and when we open the balloon for a short amount of time, more helium particles will leave the system than C02 particles simply because they are lighter."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1932,"Looking back on my notes, a question I may have is how do lenses affect certain optics? My answer would be that it varies depending on the lens. If it is a window, only light may be slightly distorted while the rest of the objects remain the same. If it is water, it can distort shapes as well as light."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1070,Buyoancy. I think that this topic is important because eventually sometime in the future I might be on a cruise ship and if anything happens I am able to think about where the safest place is and it might be the difference between if I survive or not
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2078,"""How fast the sound travel in certain temperature?"" Sound travel faster in higher temperature according to the equation v = 311*sqrt(1+(Tc/273)), also slower in lower temperature. I guess in real life applications, we can compare the same sound in different temperature for its speed. Also, frequency increase when the sound gets closer to you like a siren towards you and passing by (The Doppler effect)."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2079,"For most people, the density of our body is less than the density of the water. So when we are in the water, our body should float because the the buoyant which is given by the formula F=-pgV will be greater than the weight of our body. Since the buoyant force is opposite to the weight of our body in the water and the buoyant force is greater, we should float as long as we do not panic in the water."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2080,"Looking at spring motion, there is a frontier of mechanical physics that has been unlocked that can benefit all of humanity. The first coiled springs were only created 300 years ago. Ever since then people have been creating machinery that help in all aspects of their life. Springs make up the suspensions of cars, the softness of a mattress, the repetitive motions of printers, the buttons of all kinds of control systems. But these springs may have more potential in their use, as they have only been used for hundreds of years. Meanwhile, architectural principles are thousands of years old, stonecutting and woodworking even more millennia. To make the springs do what is desired, they must have a certain spring constants, the objects at certain masses so that the motions are repeated at the desired time. Many kinds of machines rely on precise timings, and the springs are what enable that. For many years machinery was manually operated, but now as machines operate machines so do their timings need to be machinated. Coiled springs are different from flat springs and other kinds of springs in that they travel in one axis. This has many implications that can go even beyond what has been invented so far. One infamous use for the coiled spring is its use in automatic weapons such as the AK47 and the AR15 rifles. Those are applications in which a system is delivering a desired product to a desired destination, although these desires are those of bloodshed. But this has could have a use in logistics instead. How convenient would it be if an amazon package was simply shot out of a cannon straight to your door, provided its landing velocity was retarded by a parachute. Artillery is so developed for warfare while it has so many civilian uses."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2071,a concept that is generally applicable in people's lives is the adiabtic process. it is when you have no heat transfer in the system. this is important in our lives because it is used in some very important processes. for example it used in coolent systems in yoiur cars. in order to get the coolent to its destination with minimal change to the properties of the coolent there has to be minimal to zero heat transfer. they accomplish that by having the tube as insulated as possible to minimize heat transfer and have the coolent moving fast to minimize the chance of a heat transfer. They can move coolent fast by having the tube expand decreasing the volume on the inside inscreasing the pressure of the coolent making the coolent reach its destination faster
