2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,478,My greatest take away from this class is the importance of labs and hands on work. Yes I've learned a lot about the topics of physics and I have had tremendous growth in those areas. I think its important to attribute that growth to this class because with out the hands on work Im not sure I would have such a great understanding of this course overall. This lab has allowed me to work with others and do the real life problem solving together. Understanding the difference be conceptually solving a problem and mathematically solving a problem. I definitely am grateful of my experience in this class.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2076,"I had many great takeaways from this class. I actually really feel like I learned a lot from this class. I enjoyed the simulations even thought I am sad that we were not able to do any real experiments. I feel like if we were given the opportunity to perform real experiments then I would have definitely have a better understanding of the class. However, I would say that I know the material pretty well. I like the group that I work with. They are very nice and cool. They help me whenever I need it and I help them whenever they need it as well. The lecture I am in is asynchronous so the lectures he teaches really help me understand the concepts. I am glad that I am able to collaborate with others in this space. It makes learning a lot more fun and easier. I am glad that this class did not make me hate physics."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2071,My greatest takeaway from this class was the refraction part of the semester. that really stuck to me and is something i found super interesting during this semester. I feel like the simulations of this lab was also a great take away from me since it was a way for me to see an experment from homw without having all the equipment from lab
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2075,"My greatest takeaway from this class must be how to work with different people on an assignment. It really depends on who you're working with when you want to determine how productive you can be. I think that the best way to increase productivity is to work with people who you know you can bounce ideas off of, and who are not afraid to give critical feedback when necessary. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1932,"I learned how to work in groups over online platforms. I also learned how to be more comfortable with engaging in new topics every week for the labs. It has really helped me to prepare for future fast paced classes. Hence, I am very thankful and looking forward to continuing my education with my new lessons learned."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2083,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that the fundamental concepts behind everyday occurrences can be extremely complex. Light, sound, and heat are how we perceive our world, but it took thousands of years and the aid of technology for us to be able to understand them.Some people are ignorant of science, and I would love to be able to share with them the processes and methods for understanding how the world works. The beauty of the scientific method is the reason for all of these advances, and beyond discovering the laws that govern our universe, these principles can be applied to everyday life, and even social sciences like politic and anthropology. Critical thinking is more important than ever.Doing the experiments in this class was a good insight into how physicists help us understand our world. So many of the advancements and technology and civilization have come from the significant discoveries scientists make about our universe."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,159,"This class was very informative and fun while it lasted, but I wish it were in person because I learn better that way. After taking this class I would say my greatest takeaway from it would be all the lab interfaces and how important it was for my understanding of these physics topics, without I would definitely be doomed because I need some hands-on or visual representation to help me learn. I would also say that the lab for week 5 was my favorite and really showed me why I liked physics because it was simple to understand and you could use common sense to solve most of the problems. Lastly, another takeaway I had for this year, in general, is that it's good to plan out your assignments for the week so that you stay on top of it otherwise the work will start to pile up, and then things will start to get harder."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2079,"The greatest take away from this class is some of the physics concepts that I learned through the laboratory classes. Even though I did not understand all of the concepts covered in the class, I am very glad that I have at least faint idea of all the topics covered. And so for me the greatest takeaway from this lab is the various concepts I learned a few of which is related to my civil engineering major. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1070,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that I should work towards more for myself and to do things on time. I have been a major mess this semester. I take away how interesting a lot of aspects of life are connected to each other through physics and sometimes they are things that I haven't thought of at all. Thank you to my professor for being understanding through my ups and downs this semester. I would like to say that I appreciate you a lot. Also, I believe I took you for 3 semesters almost and during that time I learned a lot and would like to thank you for the opportunity of learning under you."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2084,My greatest take away from this class was how to thing logically through physics scenarios created through online computer programed labs. We never really got to experience hands on so we got to learn how to think more critically. Without the use of hands on we relied more on programs and learned how to navigate and produce labs through programs. It's very useful in future jobs in theoretical physics if we are on a budget and can reproduce our theories through programs.  
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2072,"One of the greatest take aways from this class is that by understanding how light travels and how there are different ways light can be manipulated. Using refraction we are able to create fiber optic cables that have revolutionized networking and communication technology. By controlling the light and using the properties of the material, we are able to send different signals along the lines. As these things improve so does communications and networking as a whole. We can also manipulate light in order to have different effects for movies, shows, and tv. Changing lighting changes moods, feelings, time, and all the different things that are trying to be invoked to the viewer. This tech is what makes today's entertainment so good and successful. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1920,"My biggest takeaway from this class? Well, I would have to say that it would have to be that no matter how hard the subject is or if a concept is just really hard for you to learn, it all comes down to the professor on if you are going to be able to learn something or not. The lecture class that I am taking with this is asynchronous and I was having a super hard time learning the material, but I was able to actually understand the material in the class all because of my professor for this lab. He just cared so much about the class and his students and even when I got super behind on my classes because of personal reasons, he was willing to sit with me for hours and communicate with me on labs over zoom and email. He made class fun and worth showing up to because he told stories about his life and asked about ours. I really do appreciate all he has done for this class and me. Online learning is really messed up especially if you have adhd but to have someone who cares about you just makes a world of difference. That is my biggest takeaway from this class.    "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,173,I really enjoyed this class and the way the lectures were structured. My greatest take away from this class is to always ask for help from my peers and if I feel like I don't understand something I can always asked the professor for help. I will say that the online structure of the lab thorough a quiz format was much more easy to understand and to complete than it is for the pdf format. It also helped because when it asked us question we could check to make sure we are right as we were learning it. I hope to well adjust to in-person labs again for my next lab class. It will definitely take time. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2077,My greatest take-away from this class I think will not only be the stuff I have learning but the critical thinking skills I have acquired while taking this course
