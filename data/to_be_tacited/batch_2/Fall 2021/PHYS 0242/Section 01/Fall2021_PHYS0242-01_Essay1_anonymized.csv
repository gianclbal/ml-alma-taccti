Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1070,I want to go into the STEM field because of the opportunities that it will provide me. Once I get decent at my job I believe that I would be able to secure a job and not have trouble looking for other jobs if I was ever laid off. Also there are not a lot of electrical engineers out there than it should be. A lot of these developed and developing countries need engineers and an electrical engineer is one of them.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2071,the reason why i want to go into the stem field is because i feel like i can do more for the world then any other field. I want to do more good for the world by using my knowledge to make life easier. I also feel like the reason i want to go into the stem field is to help my family out. Besides i dont think i will do as well in any other field other than STEM. That is why i would want to go into the STEM field.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2072,"I want to go into the stem field in order to become a mechanical engineer and get into automotive engineering. I want to build and design cars, but to have a focus on sustainable designs along with environmentally friendly fuel sources. I hope to be apart of the automotive revolution and to be apart of a larger positive impact. I would also like to use the money i make and the knowledge  gain from designing and manufacturing to possibly apply to fashion and either owning a company, buying into one, or being a designer of working on a design team. Fashion is a deep passion of mine along with engineering so I hope to be able to work into them. Having sustainable methods is everything in today's climate and finding forms of expression and lifestyle goes hand in hand with that."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2073,"I first started at SFSU as a Computer Science Major, but a semester later wasn't provided any help with any advisors or professors. I was doing it for the money for obvious reasons I didn't really have much passion for coding other than it looked cool. I learn to code without any help from professors and I didn't really enjoy that. So I searched for a new major, one that would bring me some content feeling and accomplishment. My first reason going into STEM was for the money but I found out that wasn't going to help or fulfill me continue my journey as a Computer Science major. I chose Civil Engineering because I want to become the first Engineer in my family and break the cycle as the first College grad as well. Choosing Civil Engineering helps me push myself not only to become a better person but also excites me of what I can accomplish/build as the years progress in my Professional Career. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1932,"I want to go from into the STEM field (Civil Engineering) because math and science have always been interesting to me, especially in items that we can see. Civil engineering also gives me the ability to help people and design structures that will keep people safe. I really like how CE weaves physics and math into everyday life and how society runs. You can point to a structure and say that it was designed by a civil engineer. Furthermore, the nature of design work allows for some creativity and team based problem solving. I thrive in group projects (when everyone else is also contributing). Thus, when I am able to discuss projects with other individuals, it helps with the design portion of a project. Design work on the computer also allows for some technology to be used which also peaks my interest. Therefore, these are my mine reasons for going into a STEM field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2074,"The number 1 reason that I went to study STEM is that it never gets boring. Personally whatever I’m doing I get bored easily. STEM manages to occupy my mind all the time. Especially since my major is engineering it is always advancing so it never gets old. Not only working in STEM but even studying it is very challenging. It challenges you to think creatively and critically, think out of the box way come up with solutions and understand hard concepts. STEM also improves our lives as well. And I would like to be part of the community where I would be able to make positive changes in the future. Also I do feel huge satisfaction whenever I can understand things that can be challenging and hard to grasp."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1919,"I wanted to join the stem field for several reasons.  The first of which was my fascination with legos as a child.  Particularly the lego pieces that moved such as the axels, gears and motors.  Second, during my time in the Marine Corps I met many of the engineers that developed our equipment for us and they were very intelligent and also seemed to be make a lot of money doing something that they enjoyed.  I also enjoy doing math and Physics equations as well. I may not be the best but i do enjoy trying to solve them and learning new concepts, principles and laws that essentially govern the universe."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2075,"The main reason why I chose civil engineering as my major was because I wanted to be able to design and to build affordable environmental friendly homes. I initially had my mind set on this in high school because I was pretty confident in my math skills from trig and precalc, not so much with my physics and science skills though. But when it came time to decide what course to take for college, I thought I'll just have to deal with all the physics and science that came with engineering. It turns out that college level math and physics are far more challenging than I expected, and so it has been a tough few years trying to keep up with the material we are given in class. I hope all this time staying up late to get my assignments done before their deadline should prove to be worth the stable job I'll hopefully get in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2076,"I want to go into the STEM field because science has always been fun to me. Growing up, Physics class was always my favorite. I always had really good teachers that made the concepts easy to understand. Not only has it always been fun to me, I like how there always something more to learn/discover. There are still many parts of the world and universe that has yet to be discovered by humans, I would like to be one of the first people to discover something that major. Although I mainly want to go towards the healthcare path, I still want to be majorly involved in the STEM field. Working in a lab in the hospital or even just a regional lab for a hospital would be very pleasing to me. I really just want to help people, but I do not want to deal with patients. So I think the STEM field would be perfect for me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2077,"I want to go into stem because it seems like a fun career choice and that I  also enjoy doing hands-on stuff, I feel that stem is the best choice for  that. I got into STEM when I was in high school and participated in a robotics  lab/club and I really enjoyed what we where doing and decided to pursue a degree in engineering. I also want to go into STEM because of the people that I  want to meet that have the same passion as my own and have professor that know  the struggle and understand students that are pursuing their dreams. I also  want to go into STEM because I want to be a mechanical engineer that through the  STEM program is a master of the material and is ready for hands on  experience. Another reason why I want to into STEM is because it is the future of technology that I would be working with and its exciting to  think about, that my design could further progress."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1920,"Why do I want to go into a stem field... well it is because I love math. I was a theater major before and I got to the point where I was only doing Theater Major classes and it started to feel like I was just going to school to play games all the time, which was fun but I did not want to do  this my whole life and for my job. The thing that I noticed I missed the most was math and I could not stand to live without it. I actually wanted to be an engineer before when I was in high school because my whole life I spent inventing little gadgets. But last minute I changed that and decided to do theater. So now I am here, back and a civil engineer because buildings have always meant a lot to me and when I think back into my memories the first thing that comes up are the places and buildings the memories were in."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2078,"I want to go STEM field because electric circuits and physics caught my interest even though I am not good with math so I am majoring in electrical engineering. At first, I was computer science major since I was interested in computers but coding was not for me because of the professor give lecture way too long and too fast. I feel like I am slow learner and a visual learner. So hands on work is really fun even some of work is a lot. I might work on power distributions or making small devices what ever seems interesting and STEM is not easy but it is worth to try. Also, engineering might have a good income for my family."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2079,"I want to go to STEM field because I like the scientific approach and the rigor of it. And for my major, I am pursuing Civil Engineering and the ultimate goal is to start my own engineering firm. I have changed my major from mathematics to computer science and finally to civil engineering and in every one of those class, I like the rigor and its scientific approach. Also I think that to have a degree in any of the STEM field gives us a huge opportunity in terms of job and pay. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2080,"I want to go into the STEM field because I feel like it is more important than other fields in the answering of the population question. Wealth has to be created in proportion to population growth and the usage of natural resources is the most efficient form of creating wealth. STEM is discovering new ways to get resources efficiently, from asteroid mining to recycled materials to renewable energy. Countries have the same political systems and cultures for hundreds of years so rapid reform in the face of exponential population increase is unreasonable to ask for. Instead, technology should increase instead, because technology can change faster than political, cultural, philosophical, and societal change. I have in me some ideas that would help in the change of technology, and also bring fat stacks of cash as well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,478,"At first I wanted to be a civil engineer only because of the income they make. I never truly wanted to go to college. So when i decided to go, i said to myself “well if i'm going to put 4-5 years into something i don't want to do, i want to get out of college making at least 100k a year.” As I've gone through the civil engineering major I have found an interest in it. I also find it extremely rewarding. I loved calc 2 and 3 doing math problems I never imagined myself being able to do. I also love it because I run a business and when I tell people I meet that I'm a civil engineer it brings credibility to me. They seem to be more open minded in listening to me because civil engineers are “smart’. So I never wanted to go to school or study civil engineering specifically but it has grown on me and now I very much enjoy it. Super excited to get my degree and see where it takes me !"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2081,"I think I just fell into this STEM field (Mechanical Engineering) because I didn’t know what else to do. I had been good at math growing up, so I just assumed I was going to end up in some part of STEM. I decided to pick this field because when I started college, all of my friends had majors picked out and knew what they wanted to do in their lives, so I kind of panicked and decided to go into this field. I’m certainly interested by certain concepts in math and physics, especially when I can learn how those concepts can explain the things going on around me in the world. At this point in my life, I really don’t know what specific part of mechanical engineering I want to specialize in, but I hope something piques my interest so I know what I want to do."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,173,"I have always loved science. I grew up wanting to learn about engineering, chemistry and biology. It wasn't until high school that I had become interested into astronomy and from there I decided to continue learning about it. I do still want to learn more about the other fields in STEM like chemistry, biology and engineering."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2082,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field? That's a good question. I would say I don't want to go into the STEM field so much as I want to go into a field of discovery. I am a very curious person and I ask a lot of questions. A lot of those questions can be addressed within the field of STEM. My understanding is that one can continue asking questions until arriving at the larger existential questions. Questions like ""what is it?"", ""how can it be?"", ""where did it come from?"", and so many others litter this category of existential questions. The only path outside of religion that I see that can realistically answer these questions is the path of physics and science. Through math, science, and STEM, I hope to realize an imagined lifelong pursuit or knowledge and truth. At the end of the day, that is how I see my life being spent. Through examinations of the fundamental aspects of life, I will come closer to the answers of life's big questions."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2083,"I'm interested in technology and how people interact with it, specifically lighting and lighting controls. Lighting impacts how we perceive the spaces around us in a big way. Because of this I am happy to be involved in lighting design and lighting materials supply. The possible routes I could take to be involved in this field are either business or engineering. My conclusion is that it's possible to work in business without a business degree, but there are few opportunities to do engineering without and engineering degree, so I choose engineering. Many business skills and knowledge are industry specific and in my opinion are best learned through experience, but developing technical problem solving skills and communicating ideas of a technical nature is something that can really only be mastered in an academic setting. So my approach is to develop soft skills and business experience outside of school and work on my technical skills in school. In my experience, its best to combine a unique combination of skills and experience."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,159,"Deciding to be an engineer was something that I have always struggled with. Originally I wanted to be a computer scientist/ coder and I kind of wanted to learn how to hack, but after realizing that coding wasn’t for me I drifted apart from that idea because it ended up not working for me. During the summer of 2018, I began to have some interest in being an engineer. During that summer I participated in multiple engineering internships where we learned how to build, design, and create little projects that used Arduino's. That was when I figured out that I wanted to be an engineer. I learned that engineering mostly focussed on problem-solving and creating products and tools to help solve those problems. I have been doing this ever since I was young; building, creating and mapping out ideas of invention models on paper. This aspect of engineering has been in my life at an early age without me even knowing it, and I naturally drifted to that desired discipline subconsciously."
