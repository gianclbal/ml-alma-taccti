2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2079,"My ultimate goal is to get professional engineering license in civil engineering and also learn as much as possible other engineering disciplines that are closely related to the civil engineering. To achieve that, I need to get a bachelor's degree to be eligible. And with this class, it allows me to complete my degree. Also I believe that the concepts that I learn from this class are related to my my major classes and also help me understand some of the concepts in engineering classes as well. I believe that the physics and the engineering are very much intertwined and related to each other. I know that this class is one of the pre-requisites for my major, but I genuinely believe that some of the concepts in this class are very much related to my major classes and in real life as well. I really look forward to learning more in this class. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2074,My goal is to become an aerospace engineer for that I have to get through many obstacles and get couple of degrees the main reason why I'm taking this class is that physics is an essential part of engineering. without it engineering simply wouldn't work. another reason why I'm taking this class specifically is that it is required by the university to get my degree. Im hoping that this class will teach me a lot since I'm not strong in physics yet.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2071,"My goals are pretty simple but require very long and complicated paths to achieve it. My goals are to graduatte college and land a job in my field that i ahve studied for. However, this is easier said then done because my major isnt the easiest major out there making it very hard to graduate for some. Also landing a job in this field is even harder with it being so competitive and needing like years of experience right out of college, also needing connections. This class will help me achieve my goals by helping me understand the building blocks of many problems i will face in the future in engineering. This class is something i also need to graduate so this is another step forward i need to take in order to achieve my goals"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1070,"While this is late by alot, my goals in life have changed in this semester. I always tried not to be myself and not follow my dreams. There are a lot of things I love about physics, but I am slowly starting to realize while I love the subject as a hobby, I would not like to do anything with it for the rest of my life. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2083,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?My goal is to graduate with an electrical engineering degree and work in the field of lighting doing lighting design and lighting controls engineering. I'm interested in how light affects people and their perception of spaces. The exact thing I want to do is somewhere between engineering, architecture, and interior design. In any case, it will involve taking measurements, recording data, and optimizing parameters of a lighting installation and/or control system to achieve the desired result. This class can help me prepare for that by looking at different types of simulations and data. In this class I can look at how physics principles come into play when designing or implementing hardware in the field. What happens when I change certain settings or hardware characteristics? How does this affect how an installation is perceived? These are the questions I will be answering in my work."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2080,"My goal is to master knowledge of physics. All of engineering is based on physics. The movement of the stars to the movement of particles is all contained in the field of physics because it relies on principles through which we have empirical knowledge. Though empirical knowledge does not contain all knowledge, it has shown to be by all observers to be reliable in the field. Our bridges stand adamant against the wave energies exerted by the wind in order to not collapse, our engines cycle in harmony to provide constant and increasing torque to wheels, our own medicine relies on the quiet, small chemical reactions coursing through our cells. Conscious thought precedes conscious action. To make impact in this three-dimensional space, we must know how physics works in this space. For myself, I want to create things no man has created before. To place machinery and devices in this eternal space with my name on it, through patents and manufacturer's stampings, to let all know that I am the ENGINEER with impunity is my goal. To better the lives of everyone in this space, to inject wealth into the economy for all to enjoy, that is what I want to do with my mechanical engineering degree. Though physics in three dimensional space, which is physics in three dimensional mathematics, will my dreams come true."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2078,"My goal is to learn what I can and apply it whenever I can. To achieve these goals, I have to actively participate in activities, labs, and discussions whenever I can. After the lab or lectures, I try to understand what the activity is for, like its purpose, and how I can apply it to my major or life. There's a lot to learn and discover when doing labs. Labs are beneficial for understanding further what the concept is teaching, even though some are too long or too much to do. Thermodynamics might help me in the future in electrical engineering"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2075,"My goals are to graduate with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering, and to find a stable job in that field. I want to be able to use what I learn from school to get me to where I need to be in the future, whether these be soft skills like communicating with others, or hard skills like using tools that might be required for a certain job. I believe this class gives me the opportunity to do all of this, and is a valuable way to gain experience. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,173,"Growing up I have always loved science and I became very curious about the universe. It wasn’t into high school that I really decided I wanted to go into the STEM field. When I was a kid, I wanted to be an engineer and create amazing things. This mainly came from my love of the movies Iron Man and Transformers. I loved my chemistry class in middle school, and this was one of the reasons I became passionate about astronomy and wanting to learn more about the cosmos. Before, I wanted to study art and became an animator, but I grew to love astronomy and wanted to pursue a career in that field. I love space and I enjoy learning more about it and physics. I can’t wait to take more astronomy classes and learn more about physics. Hopefully, when Covid is over and everything is open I could work part-time at an observatory or planetarium."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1932,"My goals are to become a structural engineer. I would eventually like to own a firm that designs building and bridges. In order to do this I need to graduate, get my FE, get my PE, and gain enough experience and knowledge to start a company. However, before any of that, I must fulfill requirements in order to graduate. This class is one of those requirements. Although the content is not directly related to my major, it may help in critical thinking skills, communication, and a general understanding of how things work around me. Thus, I need to do work in order to pass this class and then move onto courses more directly related to my major and future career. This class is mainly a stepping stone in order to get to upper division engineering courses that will help me gain knowledge for my future aspirations. I am hoping that this class will go smoothly and thrust me into my future and help achieve those previously mentioned goals. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2082,"My goals remain large and unapparent. I want to get my bachelors in physics, but time and time again, it feels as though I am constantly being set back. My grades in this class are really poor and this is something that has to change. This class is one of a series of many other physics class I will take in the very near future. This class is the next step for me. What it should be, then, is another opportunity to grow perhaps? I am not sure. All I know is things need to get done. This is my second time taking physics III, so I should be pretty good at it by now. It just kind of could be better, I think. II am faced with a paradox. I was taught to do what I need to to get school done. Which makes sense and is very utilitarian. I would like to do what I need to to get the class done and get the credit. Often times, however, I would like to slow down and smell the flowers. Physics is a beautiful subject with many, many different aspects of things. I just wish I could steep in the topics. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2076,"My goal for this class is just to pass. This will be the last physics class I have to take to fulfill my requirements and I cannot wait. I feel very overwhelmed because I thought it would be a good idea to take three science classes at the exact same time (it was not a good idea and I have my regrets). However, I am making sure that I am getting my stuff done. This is just one of the many challenges I will be facing in my life and I am really just tying to prepare myself for the future. One of my main goals in life is to become a Clinical Laboratory Scientist. This class can help me achieve this goal because this class is required for me to complete my undergrad. Also, in order to get into the CLS program at SFSU, at least one year of Physics is required in order to enroll. I already took a semester of Physics so this is just making sure I get all the knowledge I need."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,159,"My goals in life and I guess for my college career is to, first get my degree, and secondly get a job where I can use my degree and thirdly, become engineer. With these goals, it is definitely going to take a long time, but I have to persevere, and if this is a goal I really want to pursue (which it is) I'm not going to quit. Now how can this class help me achieve these three simple but lengthy goals? First, by passing this class will put me one step closer to completing my college degree, and all the information I learn in this class will be important in the critical thinking skills that I may need for a job in the future. One thing I like about physics is that you don't really need to know all the equations and rules to succeed if you can think of the issue in physics practically and with common sense, everything will make sense, and when you use common sense to solve these problems in physics, its basically problem-solving at a basic level and that's all I want to do for a job. Lastly to become an engineer I'm going to have to learn an abundance of physics concepts and since this is the second class of the set, this class will be the stepping stone to all my goals that I want to achieve."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1919,"My goals are to have highly marketable jobs skills and a thorough knowledge of common physics used in engineering.  I feel this class will set me up for success by giving me just that, a solid understanding of the physics need to be a success full engineer.  Also, I feel like this class will help me in my later studies in college.  For example, I had to use what I learned in Calc 1 for my physics 220 class. Lastly, I would like to have a job that makes good money and in my experience those jobs require specialized skills and knowledge. Understanding physics is necessary skill to possess, especially if I want to pursue a career in engineering."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,1920,"What are my goals? well I would say to learn to grow and be happy really, I  think that is all people can really ask for. And this class is just one  step of the large goal I have in mind. I took a class with this  professor before and when I got asked this question I thought it was  kind of stupid, I always thought... ""this class... I am taking it  because I have to, how could it help me really.."" but after taking it I  started to look at the world a little different. I started to see how  this class really did help my understanding of the world. I would be  sitting in the car and think ""wow this is happening right now because of  this this and this which i learned from my phys class."" And to be  honest it kind of makes me angry (not really angry of course) because  like... I did not sign up for this, I am only taking this course to be  able to take the next class on the list. But really I am learning and it  makes me so happy and that .. That is my goal."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2077,My goals are to graduate and become a mechanical engineer and this class  will help me do so in teaching me the basics of engineering. This class  will also help my goals in that it is a graduation requirement as well  as a prerequisite to other classes. I hope what I get out of this class  is knowledge of the subject and the relationships that hopefully will be  made throughout this course to help me achieve my goals in life.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,130,"One of my biggest goals right now is to graduate and continue school to receive my master's degree in mechanical engineering. After that, I hope to score an internship and job in the automotive industry engineering parts for cars. Physics is basically the building block for anything mechanical engineering field. Without physics, there is no understanding statics, circuits, etc. This class has given me tools along with my previous physics classes to build this nice foundation that I can continue to build off of for my career. The deeper I get into physics, the more I realize I don't know and the more curious I get about smaller and smaller details about the way the world works. I hope to continue this curiosity throughout my life so I can truly understand how the nature of things are and how they all interact with each other as one. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,1,2072,"To begin, I plan on becoming an auto engineer after receiving my degree in mechanical engineering. My career choice is based on my love for cars and my need to help improve the world's environment and atmosphere. This class will teach me some things and give me some tools to help build the necessary building blocks in order to achieve this good. I also want to design clothes possible and so understanding materials, machines, the ways things are made, and how to design will be important and come from my degree as well. Learning about thermodynamics and different forces involved with particle and machines will be major when it comes to designing cars and getting them to be top performing. This class is also very helpful with understanding all the theory from the lecture and give me daily life uses that are fairly simple and that are all around us. All the simulations that we do make it simple and easy to understand in terms of what's going on in the equations that we need to use."
