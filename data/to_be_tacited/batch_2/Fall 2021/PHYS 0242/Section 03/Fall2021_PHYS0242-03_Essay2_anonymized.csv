2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,497,My goals are to graduate and finish school because no one in my immediate   family has a college/university degree. I have younger siblings that look up to me and what I do so I would like to set a great example for them because I never really had that growing up. This class can help me achieve that by allowing room for error and still being able to get the help I need to pass. It's also a good place to collaborate with peers that are taking very similar classes to me. Also with developing great communication skills and people skills that I will need in the near future after graduation to obtain a stable career. In the end I just want to live a comfortable life with no financial hardships that I saw my parents go through. I want to be able to make sure they have a secure retirement.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2105,"Well my goals specifically in this class is to pass. Since this is a lab class, it will be easier than lecture. But in order to achieve this goal is to not miss any deadlines and turn in all the required work, completed. Also, another side goal is to learn/understand as much as I can from the lectures. Because all the conceptual content is really important. My goals overall in college is to graduate with the major of civil engineering. It will be tough but it will be manageable. Just overall, need to be on top of it. Get the best grades from quizzes and turn in every homework at the highest percent, etc. But currently right now, its midterm season, the hardest part of the semester, since every professor is giving out quizzes and test around all at once. It is stressful. Fun fact: I have a midterm after this class, so I have a packed schedule and no time to study before class. This class ends at 3:15 and my next class starts at 3:30, literally no time to study. But it is what it is I cannot really change my schedule. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2103,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?  My end goal career-wise is to become a veterinarian because I wasn’t sure early on in my college journey and a bookkeeping error I was placed as a physics major. However now with 2 majors in 2 different schools of thought, I look more impressive to potential vet schools, and I can also just throw around the double major. A class like this is beneficial for me because I get to build more of a solid physics foundation and have a stronger standing. As well as an understanding of things like soundwaves, optics and engines are just a cool bonus that may come in handy someday. Learning about the way particles are carried through a wave is extremely interesting. Plus, if the whole vet thing doesn’t work out, I got another option to lean into."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2111,"my goal is very simple, graduate and go to work. Although this class might not be as helpful as I hope it should be, but the more I learn the more knowledge I gain. So it is a win win situation plus this class is required to graduate. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2102,My goal is to pass this class. what physics 242 can do to help me pass is to keep making the material clear on what will be graded and how the grading structure will be. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2096,"My goal is just simply to understand physics better so I can apply these knowledge with ease in the future. This class can help me achieve this goal simply by being a lab class. In labs, by doing experiments, no matter it was simulated or not, seeing the results with my own eyes makes concepts easier to understand and remember. The reason being that I am no longer just remember some cold dry facts, I am remembering something I have done myself."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,180,"My goal in life is to be a successful electrical engineer. I am hoping that in this class I will learn concepts that will help me better understand the physics behind electricity/energy and how it reacts. After finishing this class, I felt that the most important section to remember is optics and reflection/ refraction and waves. I am not sure what section of electrical engineer I want to pursue in the future, but that section might be useful for me in the future if I want to go into communications. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2107,"My goals are to get my mechanical engineering degree and figure out what exactly what field I want to go into. As of right now, my top 3 would be aerospace, racing, and hydromechanical engineering. As for this class are obviously to get a good grade, but also to learn as much as I can about the subjects of this class to help me in the future, and see if anything interests me. Ordinarily, labs help me to understand concepts because they are more hands on, but we'll do what we can while we're still online."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2110,"My goal is to be an Electrical Engineer and work for the betterment of human civilization. Physics is the foundation of Electrical engineering and this class is extremely important for my major. The concept of heat and electricity is one of the core parts of Electrical Engineering. The concepts learned in this class will be very helpful for my career and future. We also do group activities and in-class collaboration.  I think those are very essential in developing group work and communication skills. I want to be an Electrical Engineer and specialize in power engineering. After I finish my education, I plan to work here for some years and I want to go back to Nepal where I was born and work on hydro-power projects to help my nation. Nepal has tremendous potential for hydroelectricity and it is not being used properly at the moment. I plan to solve that issue,"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2106,"My goals are to graduate with a degree in electrical engineering and to get a career in engineering. These are my goals because I am interested in the field of engineering and technology. This class can help me achieve these goal of graduating with a degree in electrical engineering because it is a pre-requisite for some of the classes that are required for this major. This class can also help me learn new things, develop some new understandings, and prepare me for the classes that are more difficult than this class. This class can also help me by letting me practice using what I have learned in the past. This class can help me achieve the goal of getting a career in engineering because I can learn more things in this class. I can use what I learn to prepare myself for having a job where I might need to use things from this class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2099,"My main goal is to finish my Bachelor's degree. From there I will either decide to do research and continue on to grad school, or to find a well-paying job in astronomy. I would really like to work for NASA or the Space Telescope Science Institute. I really want to do hands-on science work in a way that contributes to a major science goal involving space. This class will help me because I need to understand the topics covered in this class in order to move on to higher-level physics courses. If I don't understand the basics in this course, I will not go on to be a successful physicist. It will also help me to understand different areas of physics. Some of these may tie in with my main interest, astronomy, but some of it might just be interesting and lead me to a different area of physics. It's also important to just get problem-solving experience through this class; this will help me in my career no matter where I end up. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2097,"This may sound corny, but I want to have a deeper understanding of the universe, so this course will definitely help me reach that goal.  Already my understanding has improved, especially because of chapter 14 on Fluids.  Bernoulli's equations makes me think about why I feel the pressure rise in my ears when I'm on a subway. The elevation is flat, so why do I feel a difference in pressure?  Maybe it is because the air outside of my ear is moving slower than the air inside my ear.  Hear me out!  The air inside my ear is moving at the rate of the train, while the air outside of the train is getting pushed to the back of the train when it accelerates, like water moving to the back of a bottle when you accelerate it.  This difference in velocity results in the feeling of pressure in my ears.  I'm probably wrong, but hey, because of this class I get to think about things like this when I should just be feeling bored because I'm on a one hour train ride.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2101,"My goals in this class are to pass, to learn about physics concepts that will help me in the future, and to create some connections in this class that I will be able to take into the next few years of schooling. This class allows me to achieve all three as long as I am willing and able to put in the effort. From the guided laboratory activities, I am able to take in and learn these high level topics in a much more relatable and easygoing space that favors understanding. My lab partners are helpful people willing to assist me in understanding some concepts when I cant quite wrap my head around them. And so long as I do the work and find understanding, I will be able to pass this class. Hopefully I can perform to the best of my ability and overall find a good group of peers from this Lab experience."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2104,"In terms of my academic goals, this class will help me get my degree since its required for my major. Physics in general, especially thermodynamics is important in mechanical engineering so the info from this class will definitely be useful.. In terms of my personal/work related goals, this class can help me gain a better understanding of different technologies so I can apply this knowledge to my personal projects and expand the types of projects I can do at work. I work at a makerspace as a technician and I’m limited to operating machines and doing wood/plastic work so some topics from this class like gas properties can't really be applied but understanding thermodynamics and buoyancy is useful for fun projects. Hopefully this class will help me at least better understand the equipment I’m working with and help me feel more comfortable with exploring machines."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2108,"One of my major goals is to become a civil engineer and this class will help me achieve my goals in several ways, just to mention a few, Civil Engineers have to know a lot of physics, especially structural engineers. Physics is an integral part of structural engineering, Using the concept of moment and force balance, bending moment and shear stress is determined for every structural member. The way to make sure the thing you're building will work properly is to analyze it using the laws of physics. The laws of physics can tell you about forces, tension, harmonic vibrations and oscillations, tensile strength, elasticity, and all kinds of other concepts that you can use to make calculations about your bridge. eventually, all the knowledge I gained from physics will help me in becoming an all-rounded engineer."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2109,"All my life I have not been specific about my goals. I always wanted to be ""like my dad"". For which I chose the major of Civil Engineering. But since the last semester, I have been more into what I really want to do. I want to finish my undergrad and apply to a private engineering firm for internships and gain knowledge and then after a year or two, I would like to go to Graduate school and learn more about Civil Engineering. This class will be helping to build better knowledge which is very important for my future engineering classes. Physics is always very important for the basics of engineering so learning how everything works this lab is class is a very important class. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2098,"Overall I have two main goals. The first goal of mine is to fully research three topics of interest. I have an interest in biotech and would love to contribute to a solution for loss of eyesight, and/or a solution to type one diabetes (optimizing the artificial pancreas). The second goal of mine would be to explore the most that I can in biotech via my career path. This class can help to achieve my goals by being a gateway to further understanding the physics portion of my major of interest."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2100,"My goals right now are to graduate and to get good grades in my classes. This class can help me achieve my goal to graduate because It is part of  my major. What I learn in this class will help me in the future with other classes so i can understand them and know what the professor is talking about. This class will also help me get good grades because this class is helping me understand the topics of phys 240. I feel that without this class I would be lost in phys 240. This class serves as a way to continue on my journey of becoming n electrical engineer, what I learn here will stick with me all throughout college."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2112,"My goal in this class is to get a good final grade, the way i can do this is always trying my best during the labs, as well as paying attention during the lecture portion. I can do the homework required by the lecture portions to help further my understanding of the material, as well as follow along in the lecture section of the lab portion."
