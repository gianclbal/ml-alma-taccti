2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2100,"My greatest takeaway from this class would have to be how waves behave. Reading about waves really isn't fun especially since I'm more of a visual learner and get distracted easily when reading. With the simulations we used in this class I was able to understand better how waves work and behave. I could see how it is they act in different situations such as sound waves, light waves, and water waves. What I found interesting the most out of waves is how waves behave when they encounter each other, we have constructive interference and destructive interference. When waves collide they form lines which are called nodal lines. Besides nodal lines we have antipodal lines which are examples of constructive interference."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2106,"My greatest take away from this class is that there are many things from the labs that can be applied to everyday life. For example, the information from the buoyancy lab can be applied to ships and boats and from the lenses lab, the information can applied to glasses and magnifying glasses. There are also many situations in everyday life where the information from the labs are being used. For example in the first law of thermodynamics lab, the information from this lab can be seen and experienced when cooking or putting on clothing to keep warm. Also, in the buoyancy lab, the information can also be seen if objects are seen floating in bodies of water."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2107,"One take away from this class is that in online classes, I have to stay on top of my assignments because it is very easy to fall behind, especially for these once-a-week type classes. I hope to never have to take a lab online again. From a physics standpoint, I learned a lot about light and how it refracts and reflects, which I had always been a little bit curious about, particularly from when I fish and the fishing line appears to bend when it enters the water. We also learned about waves and thermodynamics which were the other most interesting subjects for me in this class, and I hope that it will help me going forward when I take the engineering thermodynamics class soon. The labs, despite being online, were actually good at showing the concepts in a practical way for me and helped me out in the lecture section of this class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2109,"during this class, I got to interact more and know better about my lectures in class. It made my concept better due to the great simulations that we used in class. We got to work as a group and unlike other lab classes, the groups actually interacted and helped each other. The instructor was very helpful throughout the class which also helped me during this time since I missed a lot of assignments due to the time difference."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2110,"The greatest takeaway from this lab has been some physics concepts like reflection, refraction, diffraction, concepts of sound waves that can be applied in real-life situations which actually help us understand what is actually happening around us and why is it happening. Similarly, this class has improved my group work skill which is positive for me in so many ways."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,180,"The greatest takeaway I got from this class is the things I have learned in this class. I came into this class not knowing what I might need for my electrical engineering major. From the syllabul, it does not seem to be that much important because simple harmonic motion and gas properties did not seem to match what I was needing, which was about energy and electricity. But gradually, I found out how this class was related to my major in the section about waves, optics, interference and refraction/reflection. This class has been a real eye opener for me not to just assume that a class is useless just because the things I learned is not exactly related to my studies."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2101,"My greatest takeaway from this class is the knowledge that I gained through my participation. I was able to apply this knowledge outside of class on a few occasions. In my work, I was able to assist in the maintenance and installation of new analytical instruments, and I understood some of the steps that we took using some of the concepts from the course and others, like the optical emission spectroscopy which uses light and plasma, and gas chromotography. I was also able to take the knowledge from this course and apply it to other courses in chemistry and physics. Lastly, I took away connections with my peers that helped me succeed during finals week, and allowed me to discuss various things like future activities and career paths. Thankfully I will continue to see some of them in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,497,My greatest take away from this class is that some of the labs can actually still be interesting and interactive even though it is completely online. Getting to get the sam interpretation and also be able to mess with the lab a little more then we would in physical class was also a great take away. Another was being able to try to work as a group on an online lab. Also that it is good to reflect on a lab by considering what you did like about it and what you didn't. I also took away some self discipline for being on time with the submission deadlines. Another great take away is that this is my last physics course I need to take so it was bitter sweet. I am glad to completely move to engineering classes but physics classes and labs have been helpful in some aspects of my engineering course. I hope to take this knowledge with me to my future courses.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2103,"This lab class has taught me a lot and has been better than some of my other covid labs. However, the largest take away is that a covid lab has the potential to effectively demonstrate lab work. I have basically taken all my labs at home and there are 2 kinds of lab instructors those who didn’t adapt to online and those who did. There were only 2 labs to do this well my general chemistry 1 lab and this lab. It has given me hope that I can walk into a lab and do what would be asked of me and I won’t be at a total loss. This lab class has taught me that not all online labs are the pits."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2111,"the more i learn the better i get, so my take away from this class probably learning as much as I possibly can and maybe apply to my major that could potentially help me in the future. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2096,"My greatest take away from this class is not a specific experiment but the experience overall. It taught me that many things, if you tried to understand it or learn it, the best way to do it is with actually seeing and doing it yourself. As a lot of knowledge, not just from this class, but many other classes from before, the ones that I learned and understood the best are the ones that I actually have some hands on experience on. Even though we are currently doing online classes and cannot realistically do experiments hands on, doing the online simulations and playing with it myself helped learning whatever the concept is a lot. As through simulations or experiments, the concept is no longer just a vague concept you learned from words alone, it is something you saw happening yourself, the process leading up to the result and the result itself. This experience is my biggest take away, it taught me to learn not just be reading but also by doing or seeing."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,665,"My Greatest takeaway from this class was learning and advancing my knowledge of physics on topics I previously had very limited knowledge of. One of my favorite topics of the class was learning about lenses being that I have worn glasses since I was about 14 years it was really interesting learning more on how they work. I know it did not only just relate to glasses people wear but more importantly for microscopes that aid in in scientific research, because in studying certain things that are minuscule that the naked eye can not see it is necessary for us to have lenses that are powerful enough to see such things. But it is also another stepping stone in aiding me getting closer to achieving my engineering degree. Also it is not just aiding my own knowledge it also helped me learn about topics that I might be working with in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2098,"The greatest take away from this class would have to be learning practical applications of the material that was gone over. Despite the hurdles of  classes being online, I was able to imagine how what I learned could be used in different scenarios in life. Although in the lecture course sometime practical applications were mentioned, the lab really helped to solidify that notion. Being able to make a relation of what I'm learning and applying it to everyday processes really helps to retain the material that I learned."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2108,My biggest takeaway from this class is being more comfortable with working with my peers. Having the ability to interact with all students despite their varying range of abilities is a huge plus.  also adapting to online learning. I also learned how to relate physics experiments to real life which makes it fascinating to understand why things act out a certain way. overall this class made me fall more in love with physics. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2099,"My greatest take away from this class is everything I learned about optics - which is a lot! I'm studying to become an astronomer, and this was the first physics class where I finally felt like the topic was relevant to my interests. I love learning about reflection and refraction, and how these physical laws are used to build telescopes. I loved learning about diffraction patterns and wave interference, especially as it relates to astronomy. I'm currently helping an astronomer with research on binary star systems, and many of the things we learned were useful to me in the research project! Especially resolving two stars close together, and how the airy patterns affect observations. I also got to do an observing run using Keck in October, and since then we've learned so much about things that I was using:  infrared, adaptive optics, etc. The simulations we used in our labs were very helpful as well. Overall I will remember and use most of what we learned. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2097,"From this class I learned that lab can be held online, and it won't be terrible.  Up until this semester I assumed that lab classes couldn't be done online because the experiments had to be done in person for the students to get the most out of it.  After taking this class I saw that some of the online simulations that we used were really useful and easy to work with.  In fact, it might be easier than in person labs because the set-up time is basically zero, and human error reduced so the results are more accurate."
