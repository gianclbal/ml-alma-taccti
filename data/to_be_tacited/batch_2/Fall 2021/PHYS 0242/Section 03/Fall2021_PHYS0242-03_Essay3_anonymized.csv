2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2109,the topic of sound waves that was covered in class was very interesting. The topic was very fun and interesting because of the simulations that we did in class. The simulations helped me understand about frequency and wavelength. It was very fascinating to me
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2104,"What is temperature and thermal expansion?Temperature is a quantitative value that indicates if heat transfer will occur between objects that are in thermal contact. If objects are in thermal contact that means it is possible for energy transfer by heat to occur. Generally, if there is a difference in temperature between objects, then energy will transfer between them by heat. Temperature is measured on three different scales: the Celsius scale (deg C), the Fahrenheit scale (deg F), and the Absolute temperature scale (K). Thermal expansion is a phenomenon where as the temperature of something increases, its volume increases (remember that the temperature of something increases if there is a difference in temperature with it and its environment). This occurs because as the temperature of an object, and thus its atoms, increases, the atoms gain more energy and the frequency at which they vibrate increases. This change in the atom’s movement causes the average separation/spacing between them to increase. The increasing space between atoms causes the object to expand.Understanding temperature and thermal expansion is essential for the functioning of our society because it occurs everywhere and affects everything around us. Engineers especially need to understand thermal expansion when designing and building systems because they have to account for the dimensional changes of the materials when their temperature changes. If these changes are not accounted for then the system can be damaged or less effective."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2111,"how do the cargo ships stay afloat? The Cargo ship was able to stay floating because of the buoyant force, buoyant force depends on the volume of the object and the density of the fluid. The air that is inside a ship is much less dense than water. That's what keeps it floating! As a ship is set in water, it pushes down and displaces an amount of water equal to its weight"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2105,"Sound Waves Question: Can noise cancellation be implemented to rooms and cancel out outside noise?Discuss: To cancel outside noise, people generally put up noise paddings to absorb unwanted noise from outside the room. Commonly used in music production recording studios. But what about noise canceling technology? As we know noise cancelling is used in modern day headphones to cancel out outside noise so we can enjoy our favorite songs or podcasts. Noise cancelling uses generated waves that are the opposite from those in environment noise. So combining a generated wave and ambient noise together cancels out most of the frequencies, close to a flat soundwave (no sound). And a thought I had is that; what if we use those in rooms to cancel out noise coming from outside the house or outside the room inside of the house? For those who live inside the city, would benefit from this alot. Not everyone's apartment/house is well insulated even though their windows are closed, they can still hear environmental noise. Noises such as passing cars, construction, rain, people walking and talking, planes, etc. This also applies inside the house, What if we can cancel out noises of people  cooking, cleaning, and talking. Or even cancel out sounds of loud pets, laundry, or people playing loud music in the same household itself. But why would we cancel noise? Maybe because people need a free space to study, read, or relax and sleep."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2103,"Why is it that when we think of thermodynamics we only think of really cool rockets and futuristic science?  A concept that we discussed was thermodynamics, it is very important to society because we use it in almost everyday life. The Thermodynamics of the reaction of boiling water for everyone’s morning cup of coffee and the thermodynamics of gas combusting in everyone's car during their commute to work is the everyday version we see it but never how we think of it. We never think of the thermodynamic equation where heat is added, and work is done. When new engines are developed, they are expected to produce heat and power outputs more efficiently, the better the engine the better the car or plane and better society."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2106,"A concept that from this class that might be generally applicable to people’s lives is heat transfer. How is heat applicable in the daily lives of people? It is applicable to people’s lives because it happens in many places like sweating to lower the temperature of the body and boiling water where heat from the fire is transferred to the container of the water. The heat will later transfer to the water to boil it. This information is relevant because it is involved in many things. For example, it is involved in making warm water because it is where heat is transferred from the higher temperature water to the lower temperature water. This will result in water with a temperature that is in between the high and low temperature. Another example is putting ice in water to cool it down. The heat will transfer from the water to the ice which will result in melting the ice and cooling the water. This information can be used to benefit society because it can be used for survival and food. For survival, it can be the sweating to lower the body temperature. For food, it can be used to transfer heat to boil water or to heat up food."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,180,"One question that really baffled me for this class was a question on one of the homework. It asked something like how would the water level of the pond change if you took a rock from your boat and threw it into the pond below. The answer that I submitted was that the water level would decrease and that was wrong. On the internet, it says that the water level will not change after the rock has been placed in the water. I am not sure if I agree with this result because even if the amount of water displaced is really small, there is still water being displaced and the water level will change. I am not sure what the right answer is, but I think the water displaced depends on the size of the rock and the buoyant force of the boat. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2108,My biggest takeaway from this class is being more comfortable with working with my peers. Having the ability to interact with all students despite their varying range of abilities is a huge plus.  also adapting to online learning. I also learned how to relate physics experiments to real life which makes it fascinating to understand why things act out a certain way. overall this class made me fall more in love with physics. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2098,"A concept that was covered in class that I would like to choose for this reflection would have to be buoyancy. What makes an item fall into the category as buoyant would be when an item is placed in some sort of fluid, and the amount of displacement of a fluid would be the same weight of the buoyant force.   Buoyancy can be used in many different applications, but one of the applications that I think is very useful would have to be life jackets. As long as the weight of the object that is being used in conjunction with a life jacket is less than the max load of what a life jacket can carry, then the buoyancy of the life jacket can be extremely beneficial when in a fluid."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2110,"We learned the Doppler effect a week ago and I think this is a very important concept. When some source producing sound approaches towards us, we hear an increase in pitch, and as it moves away from us, the pitch drops. This phenomenon of change in the frequency of sound waves is called the Doppler effect. One of the common uses of it in daily life is police radars to detect the speed of the incoming drivers on the highway. As the source of sound approaches the observer, the pitch increases because of the increase in frequency and it gradually drops as the source moves away from the observer.  It can also be used in the health sector by doctors to diagnose heart problems. It is also used by meteorologists to track storms and study weather.  Besides this, there are various other applications in different sectors. Scientists also use this concept to study outer planets in our solar system."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2097,"I want to talk about the topic of pressure.  This can be seen everywhere around us, and is extremely useful in seeing how things work and why things happen.  For instance, in the first James Bond movie, a plane flew right over a car and the car flew upwards.  The plane caused the velocity of air particles above the car to move much faster than the air particles below the car.  If you understand Bernoulli's equations, you know that velocity is inversely proportional to pressure, meaning that the pressure below the car was so much higher than the pressure above that it caused the car to shoot up.  If I hadn't taken this class, I would have seen that scene and just thought, ""Woah cool"", but because I know the physics behind it, I appreciate the scene even more."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2096,"The concept that I want to talk about is heat. This is a concept that we use in our everyday life almost every day actually. Whether it is heating up water or cooking food, we are using heat and energy. One of the major concepts that I want to talking about is that internal energy change depends on temperature change and the amount of work being put in. This information be used to benefit the society as it had improved our society many years ago already, when the first human used heat to cook food or heat up water, it is by applying this concept. For example, to cook food, you want to increase the internal energy of that food, but how would you do it? By increasing the temperature around the food. Even though our ancestors did not recognize what they had done then, it is this concept that allowed us humans to be different than other animals and become what we are today. The use of heat is one of the fundamental concepts that make us human."
