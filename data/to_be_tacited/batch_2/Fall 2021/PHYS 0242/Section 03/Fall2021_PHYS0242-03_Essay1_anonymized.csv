Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2096,"There are many reasons as to why I wanted to go into the STEM field, but I want to talk about the very first, the simplest one, the one that got me interested in engineering. It all started out when I first got in touch with Legos. When I was little, I could spend hours and hours completing a build, and I will feel a big accomplishment every time I finish one, but as times goes by and I go older, following directions and finishing builds cannot satisfice me anymore, so I turned to something else. Creating builds myself using blocks that you could purchase at Lego Stores. This period of time lasted a while also, until I got bored again and went looking again, this was around my high school times. This is when I discovered the world of engineering. I found out all those time I spent creating new Lego builds could be classified into engineering as well, although very simple but its the same basic concept. So I started building things using materials other than Legos. From building a small bridge that can withheld lots of weight using toothpicks, to building a working model plane using foam boards and motors. Now looking back, the feeling of creating something new using my own hands and seeing it work is the reason why I love engineering, and its the reason why I want to go into the STEM field as I would love to keep building and creating new things as I get older."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2097,"If I were to go with my heart I would have majored in Literature, but I don't want to go through the struggle of finding a job with an unmarketable degree.  I was pretty good at math throughout highschool when I put my mind to it, so I thought that Physics would be a good major for me.  My family later convinced me to switch to Mechanical Engineering because it would be easier to get a job that way.  While it isn't my first choice, I believe this major has a good mix of my interests (because I love Physics), marketability, and with what I'd be good at.  While it may be silly, I think I would be good as an engineer because both of my parents were engineers, and did very well in their respective schools.  Knowing that it is a field I would likely excel in made it easier for me to choose ME as a major.  I really want to find a job where I can dedicate myself fully and see clearly the benefits of what I'm doing.  I want to see myself in my own work.  A drawback is that sometimes I have to force myself to pay attention or keep up with my classes, whereas if I were in an English related field I assume I would be more eager to focus and complete my assignment.  Problems in physics, engineering and mathematics stress me out, while writing essays for English classes is fun for me.  Ok Hamzah is calling me back, gotta go."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2098,"I would want to go into the stem field because I would like to make a positive contribution of some sort to one of the many unresolved issues in relation to the biotech field. I feel as though the field of biotech is relatively new, and there is so much potential for innovation and growth. I specifically take an interest in the sciences, but I also really like physics and math as well. Biotech is something that I am very much interested in and I would love to learn as much as I can on the subject."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2099,"I want to go into the STEM field for a number of reasons. Most practically, I want to be in a field with higher earning potential. I come from a working-class family and I'm a first-generation college student, so I'm essentially trying to move up into a new socioeconomic class with a STEM degree. I want to be able to comfortably raise a family with a stable income. It's not just about the money, though. I really like science and specifically want to study astronomy. I care about understanding the laws of nature and contributing to scientific inquiry. My dream is to work for NASA on future space missions in some capacity; it would be incredible to be part of the efforts to bring humans to Mars or search for life in the outer solar system. I'm also interested in research and trying to get experience with that now as an undergrad. I'm not sure if I want to continue on to grad school, and if so which advanced degree to get, but hopefully getting research experience early on will help me make that decision. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2100,I wan to go into the stem field because I feel its where I belong. every since I was little I was interested on the construction and function of things such as technology and machines. Till this day I have the urge to learn more and possibly in the future construct my own devices or aid in the construction of others. Besides being one of my interests I hope going into the stem field will be a great investment fo my future. I wish to obtain a good job in which I will earn a good salary to pay bills and any other thing I have to pay. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2101,"I want to pursue a degree and career in STEM because it is a field which plays to my strengths. I have never been one to excel at writing, and math and science has always clicked a bit easier than some abstract concepts. I also want to help discover and create with the science and math skills that I develop in university. STEM is like the new frontier, from space initiatives to environmental discovery to medicine and engineering, so there are many reasons to get involved with it, as well as many opportunities to get involved. Personally, I've had a fascination with science fiction and futurist novels and stories that exposed me to what can be possible with technology, and what the future might have in store for us. STEM is directly related to those ideals that we see in movies and shows, and allows us to pursue that. Thankfully, I can find enjoyment from learning about new concepts and attending this school to go into STEM"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2102,"I would like to work in stem specifically in mechanical engineering. I have always been interested in how things like cars, computers, planes, and anything mechanical works. Mechanical engineering was just the most obvious career field to jump into to learn more. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2103,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field?  I would like to go into the stem field because there is so much room for growth. In STEM there is not one area in specific that isn't constantly growing, a new discovery made in a field like history is just re-reading the past, a new book usually has another literary root or fits in a genre, but in STEM a new discovery isn’t a new way to look at something old but building upon something old and making it better. I am double majoring in physics and biology, 2 fields that are not in this same but are huge enough to have subsets within themselves. In physics, I am in the under general Physics B.S. and in Biology, I am specifically under the subset of zoology. I don't know exactly what I’m going to do with the physics B.S., and I only know that with that Bio-Zoology I would like to get into Vet School. I am entering two ever-growing fields and there is not a moment where neither isn’t expanding."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2104,"When I was younger I thought I wanted to be an artist and make things like sculptures or paintings, stuff like that. As I got older I got into and experimented with many different art forms (painting, sculpting, traditional art, photography, etc.) and while I enjoyed everything I never stuck with each form consistently. In high school I had the opportunity to work in a maker space and I took an interest in building and manufacturing things. I found that I really enjoy operating machines and working with all the different software. I already knew I liked working with my hands but I never really made things that were functional and that had a purpose. I also found that I had a lot of fun in my physics and chemistry classes. Math also came to me relatively easily. My mind kind of switched from abstract creativity to analytic, creative problem solving. Slowly my career dreams shifted from artist to architect to engineer. I’m not necessarily passionate about mechanical engineering but I know I can do well in this field. Adults around me also played a big part in shifting my interest to more “practical” and “stable” fields. Ultimately, I’m ok with where I ended up (in STEM) but I could have seen my life going well whether I chose STEM or art."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,497,"I want to go into the STEM field because I've always enjoyed my STEM classes to be interesting and exciting to attend. I felt it was easier to learn a skill and practice it over and problem solve versus memorizing texts. The STEM field can make new discoveries and even change the world and I would proudly like to be part of that. If I can make a even a small difference in this massive world, by using STEM, I would be satisfied and feel accomplished."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,180,"I want to go into the STEM field because I want to work in a job that will have an impact on the world. When I growing up, our generation has been exposed to people telling our generation is to undo climate change. In the future, I want to find a job in renewable energy or develop a battery that is more efficient and produces less waste."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2105,"Well, I want to go into the STEM field because I am currently a Civil Engineering Major. I know that STEM major classes are difficult but there is no other way but to try. And I really like to be an engineer in the future. Not sure what specific pathway/career I want after college, but it has to be revolving around structural/environmental engineering. Examples like; working on houses/housing, environmental stuff, small buildings, etc. Just the smaller projects in urban environments. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,665,"I want to go into the STEM field because I want to become an engineer. A mechanical engineer to be specific however I do not feel like I'm joining the STEM field I just view it as studying to become an engineer. The reason being that I chose to study this as my major is because growing up my father would always tell me to be school and study to become now as a kid it kinda just flew over my head. I never really gave it much thought even when I applied to college and declared engineering as my major, it really did not hit me until after I finished all my general education classes and started taking the beginning engineering courses. I realized that I really enjoyed what I decided to study. I'm really happy I decided to chose to go into the STEM field because it is fulls of challenging and exciting things to learn and create to better our future in this world."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2106,"I want to go into the STEM field because I am interested in engineering and want to have a career in this field. I want to learn more about it and use what I learn to make the lives of the people around me easier by helping them do things that would normally require some knowledge in this field. I want to have a career in this field because I am interested in engineering and technology and how they can make difficult tasks easier. I also want to go into this field because I want to be more useful to the people around me. This is because for most situations involving this field, there is usually only one person in my family that the people around me would ask for help. I want to make things easier for this person so they do not have to do all of the work or if this person is busy with something else, I can do the work for this person."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2107,"Although I wasn't sure of exactly what I wanted to do, I've always kind of known that I would want to go into the STEM field in some way because I was always most interested and good at math and science classes in school. I chose mechanical engineering because a lot things that I find interesting and have considered pursuing involve mechanical engineering, like cars/racing and aerospace. Another reason is my dad is an electrical engineer and I think we have a similar way of thinking, so I felt like I could be a good engineer too. Overall, I feel like STEM is the present and future so going into engineering will provide security knowing that there money to be made and it won't become obsolete."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2108,"Going into the stem field has always been a no-brainer for me, growing up my parents were both in the stem field and I soo much admired how challenging the field was for them, That alone kinda fueled my motivation to go into the stem field. I have always been a hands-on type of student, I prefer labs and working with heavy equipments. During my senior year of high school, I was opportune to get an internship with pg&e which sealed the deal for me, I was convinced that civil engineering will be the path for me since I was the daily activity of those already in that field"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2109,"My father is in the stem field, he is a civil engineer and that is where I got the inspiration to pursue a civil engineering major. I think the STEM field has many opportunities and it has a variety of work. The field is interesting compared to other fields since it is flexible. It has always been very interesting to me since I genuinely enjoy knowing more and I normally have a lot of questions about how everything works in life. Studying in the stem field has answered many questions so I believe actually working in the stem field will help me with my curiosity. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2110,"I have always been curious about science. New technologies and inventions amaze me. So, my dream is to be a good engineer and invent products that help human beings in real life. I want to be an Electrical Engineer and develop gadgets that would be very efficient and would save lots of time in health institutions. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2111,"why do i want to go into stem field? i dont know i know for a fact that i always been doing construction work, i renovate my house alot, doing my family backyard at the moment as well, and because i have been renovating my house to make it look better every year, it kinda put me in a mindset of like pushing me to be civil engineering. and i like it :)"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2112,"I want to go into the STEM field because I want to be able to contribute to society and make an impact on people's lives with engineering, whatever it may be. I just want to be able to use engineering to make a positive impact on people's lives."
