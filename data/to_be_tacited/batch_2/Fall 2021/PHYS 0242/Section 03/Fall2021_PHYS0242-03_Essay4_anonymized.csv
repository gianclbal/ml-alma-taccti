2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2107,"Personally, online classes suck for me. I find it way more difficult to give online classes my 100% especially in the zoom lectures. It also just sucks being so isolated from the teacher and classmates. It feels more that I'm doing it myself. I try to give myself days off from school when I can, and grind out assignments on other days. I just worry that for prerequisite classes that even if I pass, I won't have the knowledge that I need to do well in the next class, when I might've gotten that knowledge if the class was in person. Especially online, I appreciate when classes have regular due dates and give plenty of time to do assignments, like this class, and not random assignments due a day later."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2100,"online classes have made it slightly harder to learn topics in class. At times while in lectures online I feel like I am watching a video and get distracted much easier. it can also be hard to learn things on my own since I don't know if the way I understand a subject is right or wrong. online learning can also get tiring at time from looking at the computer all day and from sitting in the same position for hours. To help maintain my sanity I give myself breaks to do something relaxing to get my mind off things and feel refreshed. I sometimes listen to music while working since music helps keeps me calm and focused. When I am feeling mentally drained I take short naps and wake up feeling ready to work some more. Some concerns I have for my learning are to know when I've done enough work for the day. there are days where I continue to do work nonstop day and night, by the end of the day I am feeling tired and just wanting to sleep. I wonder if too much work ca affect me negatively."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2112,"Online classes have either been a hit or miss honestly. Some classes go pretty well, and sometimes even better if it were in person. However, there are some classes (usually my core classes) that are a nightmare when taught online. Sometimes the difficulty lies in the subject, but most of the time (in my experience) it's been how the teacher handles the online class. Which in my case, normally complicates the class further and makes learning more difficult. As for self care i haven't been doing much as i'd like to honestly, I would like to go on runs/walks, or explore the city more but i just don't have the time. My main concern is that i might have to drop a class because the way the teacher is handling the class is outrageous."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2110,"Online classes have made me lazier than ever. When I had in personal class, I used to have a fixed routine. But online learning has messed up my schedule. Most of the classes don't require us to turn on our videos so, that makes me not want to wake up from bed. Learning online is hard because many labs require hands-on activities and we can't do it online. When you are in class, you get stuck on something, you can immediately ask your Professor or your friends and they can help you but it doesn't happen online. You have to either find information online, study your book or wait until Professor replies to your email. So, learning online has been tough.I am just concerned about learning. I am an Electrical Engineering major and I am just concerned that I might graduate online which I don't want. I want to go to class in person and learn in person. I regularly exercise and walk for a few minutes in the evening as I stay home all day. I try to eat healthily and drink lots of water to keep myself hydrated. This is how I am taking care of myself."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2099,"I like online classes and have generally been successful in them. However, this semester has been challenging due to the fact that my classes are all set up very differently with varying expectations. I have two in-person classes and three online classes. It takes a lot of time and energy to ride the bus to campus just for one class, and I wish I could be using that time/energy differently. I would prefer to have all online or all in-person classes, so I can keep a consistent schedule. One online class is difficult for me because there are almost no rigid deadlines; almost everything is due at the end of the semester. While I appreciate the flexibility, this actually does more harm than good because I've left most of the work to the last minute. Another online class requires us to be on camera, which at first I thought was unreasonable, but I have come to appreciate that we have to be focused and engaged during class. It's so easy to zone out and not pay attention while your camera is off, even if you don't mean to. I have learned the most from that class and appreciate the rigid yet predictable structure. It's totally changed my viewpoint, and now I feel that more instructors should require students to be on camera (at least at the college level). I am not doing a lot for self-care other than trying to let myself take naps or TV breaks when I need them. I try to go for walks when I can, but there's not always time, especially now that sunset is so early. I think my main concern is that instructors might not take into account that this was a hard semester for all of us, and not everyone is functioning at 100%. My grades won't be very good this semester in some classes, because it's been hard for me to settle into a routine and stay organized. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2106,"Online classes have impacted my learning by preventing me from getting the experience of going to classrooms for the lecture and labs because I feel that for some classes, it is better to be in person like the labs. Another way that online classes have impacted me is if there are internet issues, then it would make learning more difficult because it would take up time if there was a disconnection on the teacher’s end or my end. A concern that I have for my learning is for some classes, I am fine with it being online and for others, I feel that it would be better for it to be in person. For example, for labs and group activities, I feel that it would better in person and for other things, I think online classes are fine. For my well-being, online classes are better option than in person classes because of the pandemic."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2108,"Precisely in these circumstances, there are two important issues that I appreciate. Firstly, the continuity in academic teaching, and secondly, having a few hours covered with an obligation, whether it’s studying, working on group projects, or completing individual assignments. I believe that such obligations help us distract ourselves from these days that are starting to become never-ending. Online classes have made learning very fast-paced and continuous. for self-care, I just normally detach myself from the internet and engage in my favorite activities like playing soccer and road trips. I personally do not have any concerns about online classes "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2103,"Online classes due to COVID have very much impacted my learning in a negative way. My first lab class was for spring 2020 and in Los Angeles, the lockdown and stay-at-home order happened after my second lab, after the instructional lab. Within both of my majors physics and biology with a concentration in zoology, I have had last than three hours in any form of lab environment. Some of the things I have been doing as self-care during this pandemic education is that I have basically nosedived into video games and technology. I have very much spent time playing video games more than I had before because I need some form of break from Internet learning. Earlier this semester I even questioned dropping physics as a whole and my math professor encourage me to stick with it because I haven't gotten to experience the fun part of labs. And now I have hope for the next semesters to reach the fun part of physics."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,497,"Unfortunately, online classes have been challenging for me.  I don't feel like I'm receiving 100% of the course in every class. It is very frustrating to have a day with many classes which are all completely online. Staring at a screen and sitting in the same desk for most of my days is quite depressing in a way. For self care I am going to the gym and weight lifting. I started weight lifting about 10 months ago and it's been a great way to get out of the house and away from my desk. For self care I also go hiking to some small yet nice trails in my area. It's great to reach the top and have a nice view and just admire nature. One concern I have are just becoming highly unmotivated. It's a lot of discipline being fully online for school because it's so easy to just shut your laptop vs being in a physical classroom with peers you can see."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2097,"At first it was very difficult to adapt to online school, but I got used to it this semester.  It is hard to concentrate when you're learning through a screen, but it is also easier in some ways because I don't have to leave my room to do my classes.  As for self care, I have been exercising at least four times every week.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2109,Online classes have been very stressful for me due to the fact that I am an international student. The time difference has been really tough. It made me demotivated which resulted in a bad GPA. One thing I did is try to take fewer classes so that my sleeping pattern wont be as bad. Looking into a screen for lectures after lectures has been difficult. There were days when I skipped classes just due to do lack of motivation.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2104,"I think online learning has made it more difficult for me to retain and understand classroom content effectively. Learning through videos and textbooks is not as engaging as in person classes. While school is easier for me online, mainly since teachers have made assignments easier and are more lenient with deadlines, I’m worried if the knowledge I do retain will be enough to be successful in the future when we go back to in person classes. Essentially, online learning isn’t as rigorous or challenging. I'm glad that I have some in person classes this semester - those are going well and I felt like I was actually learning for the first 3/4 of the semester (getting burnout right now). In terms of self care, online learning, and school in general is pretty monotonous. While assignments aren’t too difficult, I tend to spend hours on my computer doing all these assignments, watching lectures, or studying."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2105,"Describe how online classes have impacted your learning and what you are doing for self-care. What concerns do you have for your learning and your well-being?Online classes for me has been a hit or miss. I learn some information but sometimes I dont. But also depends on the professors and how they coordinate thier classes. Some professors are more fitted into online teachings than others. Whether they have proper technology or just good teaching digitally. Because some professors sometimes dont have the proper tech and they make slides that are too much or even you can't even understand thier presentations when they write. Ive had a good mix of professors, some good and some horrible. Some professors also give many workloads just because its remote learning, its stressful. It takes over the time I have for other classwork. For self care, I do my hobbies. Working out, video games, and produce music. Concerns I have is not passing a class and taking the same horrible professor who is not fit into teaching remotely. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2096,"Online classes have actually impacted in a lot of ways, both good and bad. On the good side, I can manage my time now better since I do not have to waste time walking to classes and walk back, scheduling everything perfectly, as now I have some spare time to work with. On the other side, online classes had made classes a fair bit harder, with professors concerned about cheating so they shorten quiz/test times, adding more challenging question.... It has also made professors more out of reach, as although they still have office hours, some professors are not willing to put much time into them, as well as the way they teach classes online, it might partly be they are still not used to online teaching, but some are not very effective with it. I am concerned that with these bad lessons/teaching, and hard quizzes and tests, it might cause me to fail classes that I otherwise would not if it was in person."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,3,2098,"Online classes have impacted my learning quite a bit. The primary impact has been related to self-discipline. Before the pandemic, I thought I had a pretty decent grasp on self-discipline but not being in person tremendously affected me in that way. This is because my self-discipline was centered around the structure of being in classes. It was challenging to force myself to adopt to the changes, but it was doable.The ways in which I manage self care is to spend time with family. This solidifies my sense of community and makes me feel good. The only concern that I have for my well being is related to being social. Having to stay inside for the entire start of the pandemic with having limited contact with other individuals other than my immediate family has had a tremendous effect on my socialization/social life. I'm still assimilating back into what was a normal life for me, but I do wonder what the long term effects are in relation to lengthy isolation."
