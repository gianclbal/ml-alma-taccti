2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2114,"Online classes have both made it easier and difficult to learn. While less commuting has given me more time to study and work outside of class, It has also become more difficult to stay consistent with assignment. What I have done for self-care is 3D print miscellaneous Items. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2122,"Online classes had made me self teach myself more than in person class, some classes are really difficult to get a good understanding of through a screen alone. In particular, lab classes since I learn best when doing hands-on activities. Simulations help but are not as effective as in person labs to make sure I fully understand what's going on. Few lecture classes are also difficult as well so that is where I would rely on self teaching. As for self-care, making sure my mental health is positive is top priority then my physical health to make sure I'm in an okay shape. Mental health has definitely been a challenge since covid started as there were many unfortunate events for myself that happened last year, so making sure I'm okay mentally is helping me take care of myself better. Thankfully I'm surrounded by wonderful friends and family to help keep that up."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1983,"Since switching to online learning I feel that it has made it where I need to rely on the notes I take and make sure that I understand what we are looking at because every week we are moving onto different concepts. on the other hand, it has allowed me to focus more time on really understanding each problem as well as giving me more time to get all my work done because I don't need to commute. With that, I also feel like I have more time to keep myself occupied such as working out and doing other activities  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1997,"An online class is a course conducted over the Internet. They are generally conducted through a learning management system, in which students can view their course syllabus and academic progress, as well as communicate with fellow students and their course instructor.Back in 2019 I was afraid of taking online classes, since I have always been taught in person. In 2020 when I decided to take one of my classes online to see the experiment, everything shifted online because of the pandemic that we were facing. At first I thought I would not be able to focus, since it is a different environment. My questions were will I be able to pay attention during lecture? What if someone in the house is making some noises, how can I listen to the lecture? What if  Instead of focusing on the lecture I spend time on my phone? There were so many questions. But, Finally I got used to online classes and I am planning on taking more classes online even if we get back to normal classes. You spend less money with online classes since you do not need to go on campus and pay for parking spots;  better you do not need to look for one for hours which saves time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,588,"online classes has been ok so far, the only thing is with online learning is when my internet goes off I have to rely on the recordings because it takes a while to get back on. Online learning has made me very organized and has made me more responsible"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2125,"Online classes have impacted my learning greatly. This is because to be honest, I haven’t learned as much as should have. This may be my preference , but I prefer learning in person. I appreciate what my professors have done for us as students as they tried their best to make sure I learn the material. Also, what I miss about in person is interacting with people and making new friends. For self care, I have been taking walks in parks to pass time and hanging out with friends. I also picked up more hours at work than I could now because I no longer have to commute so it gives me more to save. Another way I began to self-care is that I have been training on the mountains to improve my driving ability for when I eventually compete in time attack trials. As for my well being, I am fine. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1826,"Online classes are going pretty well. I am exercising each morning before class which makes me feel more awake before class starts. I am doing my best to learn in this environment. It has been tough these past few weeks, but things are going slightly better now. At this stage I have adapted to this learning environment. I do miss being able to communicate with people in a class room. I am a visual learner so it helps to see thinks in a class room as opposed to looking at a computer screen.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2115,"Online classes have definitely taken a toll on me. I feel like my mental health has taken a hit, and I have found it substantially harder to stay focused in all of my classes. Being stuck at home all day and having work being piled up on my to-do list every single day has affected my time management skills and awareness of what actually needs to get done. To try and help adverse these feelings, what I do for myself is go to work. And by that, I mean physically, because it allows me to leave the house and feel like 'getting away', even if it is just for a few hours at a time. I also enjoy riding my bike through the neighborhood, as well as go sightseeing in the city with a close friend. We are both busy all the time so it's nice to have another person who relates to you and understands what you're going through.Next semester, I am concerned that I will undergo the same worrisome cycle of feeling behind in all my classes and not being able to learn the material in a timely manner, all while having extracurriculars and work to do."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2130,"Online has been so hard for me to stay on top of everything, and motivation for school has changed a lot. As a person with a learning disability and undiagnosed with adhd, it is extremely hard to learn under the circumstances and I always seem to put a lot on my plate. This semester I am taking 20 units, so 9 classes on top of research, and I am drowning in work. I am trying so hard to stay on top of it, and I hope my professors can understand, I may need more time, but I know I will get it all done. Many have lots of expectations of me and it’s hard to carry that weight. I feel like I can’t really take a break because then the opportunities won’t come back. The first step I am taking to self care is going to therapy. I can’t do much after that because I have to continue with school even it’s really stressful. That’s what I signed up for when I decided that I wanted to be an engineer. Such it up for now and just wait for a break later, it will be worth it in the long run."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2119,Online classes have had a huge impact on the way i learn because it is so much easier to be distracted. I am also a civil engineering major which requires some extensive classes and should be hands on. Im hoping that in person classes can resume very soon. Some things i do for self care is put myself in a good learning enviornment which is quiet where i can be focused and away from most distractions.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1838,"Online learning has slightly hindered me as I find it hard to pay attention in class when not in a classroom setting. However, I have found that I am performing much better than last semester in staying on top of most of my work. As for self-care, I've found it is hard to make time for self-care as I work thirty hours a week Friday through Monday and have several classes throughout the week. I will start trying to go running as I have found that running alleviates a lot of stress and puts me in a better mood. I am hoping in these coming weeks I can start running and catch up on some assignments. I hope that this next semester will be a little lighter in terms of classes and workload to make a bit more time for self-care. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2117,"Online classes have challenged me in ways i didn't know they could, besides doing online learning life has continued. Its hard to do things for self-care when there are so many different things going on. Im scared that when I go back to in person classes, I wont be able to learn or understand the material they are teaching or taking away from because I didn't learn that part. This is a hard time for students everywhere academically but also in their personal lives. We are in the time of covid where it's affecting everyone personally or through the grape vine. Some way or another everyone has been affected and continues to be affected."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2116,"Online classes have impacted my learning in a positive way. I learned a lot about myself in terms of how I learn best. I found having the resource of a recorded lecture to review and study from has really helped me improve in class performance. I'm a little sad that online classes are ending but I'm confident now that I'm aware of this learning weakness I can handle it the right way when classes are back to being in person. On the other hand, I do miss the social interaction with other students and I do miss the routine of going on campus. I know I say this now because maybe it's just that point in the semester where I'm feeling fatigued, but I do recognize being able to physically be on campus is an experience that I miss. As far as self care goes, I'm actively making sure I get enough sleep, have a balanced diet, and exercise 2-3 times a week which has really helped balance my workload better."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,176,"Online classes have honestly been pretty tough. I think what I struggle with the most is staying engaged in a class when it's online. For me, being in a class room sort of forces me to stay engaged since there are very little outside distractions. But some of the good aspects are the flexibility that it allows for since I can take some of my classes while at work on a lunch break. It's also nice to just be at home doing this not having to go out. I honestly haven't really done anything specific for self-care as of lately. My schedule is pretty packed full of classes and work and homework. I try to keep my weekends mostly free to just do whatever and not have to stick to a strict schedule but I still end up having to do homework. As for concerns, I think this year was especially tough for me since I also took summer classes and have been working the whole time so it sort of has been feeling like non-stop doing things which is great for productivity, but I can start to feel the burn out. So I am ready for this semester to be over for an actual break. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2113,"Online classes have occupied my learning as well as has made it more costly. Ways that I have dealt with my web based learning is getting coordinated, adhering to a timetable, tracking down a most loved working environment, wipe out work area, posing inquiries. Partake effectively in online conversations, deciphering and rehashing what you've realized. Apply new material to recently scholarly data. Apply new ideas as a team with different understudies, at work, or in different parts of your life. Take written by hand notes to assist you with holding key data. Like we referenced before, online classes expect you to show more drive. You're more liable for your own learning, and you'll escape the class what you put into it. Keep that Facebook tab shut while you're finishing coursework on your PC. On the off chance that you know your online media restraint is restricted. Take a stab at placing your telephone in an alternate room, far away in a bureau compartment, or in your vehicle during your assigned classwork/study blocks. In the event that periodic telephone checks are totally fundamental, you can permit yourself five minutes to look at writings and warnings for at regular intervals to one hour of considering."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,147,"Since the online classes are not interactive, it makes it really hard to network. It can be fruatrating at times when networking is really important in the field you are trying to go into. I feel like in a sense online classes are harder than in person. Or maybe its been so long that i have forgotten how it is to be in person."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2124,"The online classes that I have been taking were beneficial for topics and activities outside of school but I do not think they have benefitted me on a school level.  I am a pretty hands on person and learner as a whole so I would say that they have hurt my learning.  I thought that there was no way that they would even offer the science labs online but sure enough, the only way to fit the classes into my baseball schedule was to take them online.  This was specifically difficult for my circuits lab as I was not only highly looking froward to that class but it was also going to be the best chance for me to learn the material.  That class has still yet to teach anything that has to do with circuits lab equipment or components as it has been purely math based which is basically like taking a second circuits lecture class.  This is the reason for it not benefitting my learning of that topic.  It has forced me to basically teach the whole course to myself using internet videos and projects that involve those materials. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,145,Online classes have impacted my learning by limiting my materials. I am more a hands on type of learner and I am also a person that needs other people around to learn better. When we have online classes we do not have this type of learning. It feels different when we are seeing people through a compute screen then when we are in person. It is also a bit more challenging to stay focus when I am in the confort of my own home. When we are in school we have the classroom and the environment of learning. This helps me stay more focused and know to switch on my learning mode. I have been getting more rest since I do not have tom take public transportation.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,150,"Online classes have definitely been something that has gotten a bit challenging. At first, it was really hard to focus at home because there were so many distractions, but as time went on I've found myself more able to focus because it's just become such a routine. I do believe I'd probably be learning more if I were actually in a classroom, however it's been okay getting used to the online thing. For self care when I feel myself getting stressed out, I just decide to step away from the computer for a bit and go for a walk or do something to clear my mind. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2129,"Online classes have definitely taught me to humble myself about my schooling situation. Prior to the pandemic and online learning, I really dreaded going to school. I even fell into a depression because just a year beforehand, I was having the time of my life in high school as a senior, and just had so much fun working on my little project car, taking it to and from high school and just messing around. However, all of that changed in Fall 2019, when I started at SFSU. All of my friends went their own ways, I could no longer take my little car down the street to high school and mess around, instead, I commuted on bart everyday at 6am. I had almost no free time where I wasn't exhausted from the commute. But once online classes began, I was humbled by being at home and getting into core engineering classes, where it got difficult, and I craved in person labs & learning. Now that I am halfway back on campus, I love being there and I live my best life as an engineering student!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2126,"Online learning has impacted my learning in a way that I struggle to pay attention. It’s easier to sit back and relax than to pay attention. It’s also easier to turn off the camera and relax but I try to listen. I do try but looking at the professor through the camera is not the same as looking at them in person. The connection is not the same and being inside all day with your computer gets tiring mentally and physically. I know I am not the only person and there were some pros to it. For example, we saved up in gas, train, and bus money. Probably the only pro I could think of. The concern that I have is that if I will be able to remember all the information I learned and apply it in the future. Another concern is that making connections with my classmates or with the professors would be a bit difficult because like I said before it was easier to turn of the camera and mic. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2128,I think the biggest impact that online classes had on me is the feeling of learning everything alone and it is new and harder because we were not trained to learn alone or even prepared for it during our K-12 experience. It as definitely tougher during the first semester that we had to do online but students and professors learned how to navigate through it. I think if there is anything that online learning has taught me is time management and discipline. It is a lot harder to manage your time and not procrastinate when you are stuck in a room but that is where discipline comes to play. I am thankful that having discipline has motivated me to work out and that is the way for me to deal with stress.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,165,"Online classes have impacted my learning in a negative way because now that I am starting my upper-division engineering courses and I feel that I am not getting the proper instruction that I should be getting for the amount I am paying for tuition. In reality, online courses are much simpler because they are in the comfort of our own home and we do not get anxiety from being in a classroom of 30+ students. For self-care, I am making sure to maintain a social life with friends that I can hang out with on a regular basis. Some concerns I have are that I should be learning and doing more hands-on work. As for my well-being, it helps to be in the comfort of my own home as I said before and not have to commute to school."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2118,"Online classes have affected me, especially because I am striving to be a Civil Engineer and without the practices with the machines in my engineering lab, I am unable to get hands-on experience and understand how to use certain tools rather than visualize how to use the tools in watching a youtube video on zoom. I have been frustrated that the pandemic has pushed everybody backward as many of us want to go back to school and learn regularly and do the laboratories in class. Self-care-wise would be going to the gym and releasing my stress from the online learning course and it helps me stay active even through this pandemic. I am concerned about going back to school because as of now, many states have been reopening and the new guidelines have been restricted and which can cause mayhem for certain groups. With this happening, we may not be able to go back to school. As well, as of now, it's unsure if we'll go back for the Sping semester as there isn’t as many infected but anything can happen."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2121,"Online learning has its challenges. For one, I found that learning online can be a bit more difficult since there are more distractions as home than if I were on campus. At home I do everything from my personal desktop and often I am tempted to browse the web or do other unrelated things during class. Online learning through zoom also has its challenges, not being able to be face to face with the instructors or students disconnects me from building bonds and relationships and make it harder to communicate in class. I generally feel less motivated during a zoom call and I wish I could see my fellow peers and classmates. Pre recorded lectures are also a hassle and I am very unmotivated to watch through them especially if they are hours long. Being at home while doing school has been “easier” since I see my grades gave done better, but it is definitely harder to stay motivated and actively learn. I am trying to balance my school and live and generally I don’t think I am burnt out, just missing life back on campus."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2127,"Online classes have impacted my learning by not being interactive with my classmates for example in lab people would rather message than actually talk and I felt that I would rather work by myself due to the fact that it felt tiring talking to myself.  Another impact online classes have done on my learning is my note-taking has decreased as opposed to when I was in person I think this happen because classes are online and we simply just watch the recording. For self-care what I have been doing is going to the gym about 4-5 times a week the gym helps to relieve stress. As of right now, I am not really all too concerned with my learning and well-being because I know I am trying my best."
