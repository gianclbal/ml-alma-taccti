Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2113,"I can make a change and impact.I can explore more about engineering. I can learn more about technology. I can explore my curiosity. I can pursue my passion. I will always have job security and stable money. EA STEM degree can give you the hard abilities you need to get recruited, in addition to the adaptability to adjust and seek after what makes a difference to you most. Chipping away at the forefront of advancement, PC and data research researchers grow new advances and ways to deal with facilitating the field of software engineering. They make new programming dialects, create imaginative apparatuses, or work to tackle existing issues with new strategies. California, Virginia, Maryland, Texas, and Washington have the most elevated centralizations of work for these experts and I cannot wait to be a part of it. Researchers and specialists are, at their centers, issue solvers. Their responsibility is to break down a circumstance, reach a determination, and build up an answer. While mechanization is assuming control over humble positions like information the board and other once-solid vocation ways, robots and programming bundles actually can't top the human mind with regards to basic reasoning. These are abilities that are difficult to instruct, however the interdisciplinary idea of STEM fields implies that you'll have a lot of work on sharpening your basic reasoning capacities. Prior to the coming of Facebook and Twitter, nobody predicted the day that there would be a requirement for analysts to turn their abilities to examining the abundance of information created via web-based media stages. Consistently, new advances make occupations that have never existed. Technology is a universal language. Indeed, the ability to have an effect in the existence of others is one of the significant reasons why people are picking STEM fields for their callings. From making customer air travel quicker, less expensive, and more agreeable to arranging the main missions to Mars, you'll discover moves on from a portion of America's best advanced plane design universities teaming up with material researchers, programming architects, and other STEM experts from everywhere the world. While callings in certain fields don't make an interpretation of well to other people, the abilities you'll master by achieving a STEM degree are quickly appropriate around the world, regardless of whether you don't communicate in the nearby language!."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2114,I want to go into the STEM field because I enjoy learning about how things work. Another reason I went into STEM was because I like to be able to work with things like robotics and be able to design them.    
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,150,"Since elementary school, my favorite subject has always been math. I never really liked reading and writing, although they are necessary skills in the STEM field as well. Numbers have always been my strong suit, so therefore when I got to high school and started to apply for colleges, I knew that I wanted to do something that involved math. My family also contributed a lot to this decision. I have about 4 Civil Engineers in my family, so they introduced me to what their work life was like. I also visited a lot of project sites with my dad who works as an Engineer in Napa County, and just thought it was really cool to see projects he had worked on whether it be bridges or parking lot structures, transformed into helping out communities. Therefore, I decided to choose Civil Engineering as my major here at SF State and I'm enjoying it so far. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1983,"Initially, coming into college I had no idea what field I wanted to go into. I knew some of my strengths and had an idea of areas I wanted to pursue but I was not totally sure. As I moved through my first years in college, I was introduced to many different career paths but mechanical engineering stood out and felt most attracted to. These subjects have always been my strong suit and what I find most interesting. The STEM field covers so much different areas that I feel you can take away something from all aspects and they all correlate in some way. Additionally, I feel that it gives me the most options to find the career path that i want to pursue and would enjoy the most. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2115,"I want to go into the STEM field because I want to be able to make an impact. Previously, I was a Pre-Nursing major because I wanted to assist patients and help make their lives better - even if that involves doing what I can to make their hospital stay and transition easy and comforting. I made the switch to the Engineering field because I enjoyed being more hands on, and doing work behind the scenes. I had the intent of going into the STEM field designing and creating medical devices for patients in need of medication. Doing so would allow me to help create something that is beneficial for patients in my community, and for those around the world. It would fulfill my life's purpose of knowing that I had the ability to help not just one patient, but several more because of something that I had helped to contribute."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2116,I like the STEM field because of the rigorous challenge it presents. It really challenges you to commit to the material and to be disciplined in striving for the right understanding of concepts. I find reaching the right understanding of concepts and being able to communicate with other STEM majors in a universal Math and Science language to be the most rewarding thing. I love the humility and constant state of learning required in order to be successful. I hope my efforts will enable me to make a meaningful contribution to society someday. Some aspirations include a personal design being the final company product that will be manufactured.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2117,"I want to go into the STEM field for financial Stability. Being financially stable is very important to me as my family has always had difficulties in that area. I wouldn't say I have natural abilities to understand or apply mathematical concepts but I always try. I also find physics very interesting and the question on whether we invented mathematics or we discovered it. Is math the universes language or something we created to understand the craziness around us. I wish I was more gifted in being able to understand other worldly concepts and mathematical practices like many physicist but for now, this will do.If grades and financial necessity was not a factor, being able to study physics would be great."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2118,"I began my route to a STEM field in high school as I strived to learn what an engineer does. As technology has evolved throughout time, engineers and scientists have been adapting to the new ways of programming or planning out new objects that can be essential for society's use. I want to go into transportation engineering, which is a branch of civil engineering, where I am able to plan and construct highways or tunnels such as for trains or vehicles. I just fell in love with this idea because I’ve been so curious to see how civil engineers construct and plan out motorways where they can have a capacity of mass and how the pillars can sustain such weight. The thing that got me really interested in civil engineering was the channel tunnel which is amazing how this tunnel was built underwater and the technology in the 1990s wasn’t as advanced in comparison to the technology we have now."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2119,I want to go in the STEM field because I enjoy building things and my major is civil engineering. I also joined because I knew I wanted to get a college degree and my best subject at the time was math. So then I thought what better degree than an engineering degree. I also joined the STEM field because I have always been interested on how things work. For example when I was younger I was really curious on how houses were built.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1826,"I wanted to go into the stem field because it it has always interested me. In high school I found chemistry, physics, and math fun and thought that I would someday like to major in one of these or even major in something that relates to these subjects. I ended up choosing Mechanical Engineering. I have always enjoyed building things and I find it fun to design things. In high school I took a couple of engineering class to see what they were like and they were quite fun because I was able to go through a process of designing my own project. It started with detailed drawings and then I came up with a plan on how I was going to design it. Then as it was coming together I could see my vision coming together. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2120,I want to go into the STEM field to advance humankind to the next level. Whether be advancing in aerospace technology or even new technologies in the medical field. Ideally once I graduate from SFSU I will be joining the Air Force to see the new and emerging technologies within Special Tactics and hopefully I can use my engineering skills to create something to better everyone. STEM is so broad that being a mechanical engineer can intersect all aspects of STEM. Being anywhere in STEM makes me feel like I am progressing humankind.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,147,"I want to go into the stem field mostly because construction has been around me my whole life. I would work at my dads job in the summer and was lucky to speak to a couple of civil and design engineers. This is what got me interested in civil engineering, seeing what they do everyday. Hopefully I chose the right major, so far it feels like I have. Going into a STEM field is a lot of work, but the challenging classes and journey you have to take hopefully will make it feel extra better when you make it to where you want to be. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,145,I want to go into the stem field it is sometimes unpredictable. There is so much to explore in the stem field. I am more of a hands on type of person and I learn better when there is something physical in front of me. I also find it very interesting how things work. In physics we learn about the way things work around us. I like to learn how things work and why certain stuff move a certain way. I think this can also help me in the future when I get a job as an engineer. I need to know how certain things move and why before I actually do them. This can help prevent an accident when working on a job that requires me to know things will move a certain way before actually doing it. I also enjoy working in a stem field since it is very cool to know certain things about the world such as acceleration on an object how gravity plays a role in the speed of an object and why it is moving this way. It also helps my curiosity in the world.  
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2121,"“Why do I want to go into the STEM field?” is the question I have been asking myself all my college years. Is it for the money, is it to prove something, is it for the challenge? I believe it is all of the above and because I’m not sure what else I want to do. I like a challenge and at the beginning I was debating if I should swap a major. I knew that I could fall back to business major if I wanted to, but I told myself that I could push myself and that could do it. Simple as that, I am pursuing a degree in the STEM field for computer engineering because I want to push myself and challenge myself to go through with it and not to give up. I want to do it for my family, and because I want to come out with a degree that will open up brand new opportunities in my life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2122,"Since I was a kid, building with Legos was a huge part of my childhood. My dad used to buy me all sorts of Lego sets and I would finish the set then create something new out of it. At first, the idea of going to space, flying, and building intrigued me. I thought some day that I might want to become an astronaut, a pilot, or some kind of designer. As I grew older, I learned about engineering and the different types of paths it could diverge into. Throughout high school, math nor physics were my strong suit, I thought maybe coding is something I'd enjoy. My dad has been a huge inspiration in my life, he currently is a software engineer and I initially went into college aiming to be that. After taking a few classes in coding, I realized I enjoyed math and physics more, so I dropped the idea of becoming a software engineering and swapped over to mechanical engineering. While I still may not be as proficient in math and physics, I still want to improve on those topics as I do find enjoyment in them so I could eventually get more into designing, building and testing in my future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2123,"Originally my major was Criminal Justice after being inspired by the benefits my family members received (they were government employees), but after my first two years of general ed classes I wanted to aim for a field that was more productive and rewarding. I chose Mechanical Engineering due to my interest in cars and fighter jets, but that interest eventually expanded into other sub-fields like materials, mechanical design, and 3D modelling. I knew the hardships and struggles of engineering going in, and as a third-year engineering student I can absolutely attest to how difficult it is. But honestly, I cannot imagine pursuing any other field that exemplifies communication, teamwork, and out-of-the-box thinking which in turn creates a gratifying sense of accomplishment."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2124,"I have always wanted to go into the STEM field since I have always been a hands on learner and most of the jobs that come with stem, are usually pretty hands on.  Even the courses I was interested in such as geology and archeology are hands on jobs and have caught my eye as well.  But I think the main reason for STEM was growing up watching star wars and Iron Man and thinking about all of the tech in those movies that I felt I could possibly build in the future.  Those fields will always be evolving and I would always have a job in the future.  The future is mostly tech based and to be apart of that is a no brainer.  Aside from sports, my hobbies have always included designing and building different projects so it only made sense to take the path of doing that for a living. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2125,"The reason I want to pursue a career in the STEM field is that I know this is somewhere I know I can succeed while doing something I can passionately do. Since I was younger, I have always been fascinated with the automotive industry which is a trait that follows me to this day. Currently as of now, I am working on two cars, a Mazda Miata and a Subaru WRX, with the end goals being that these are still street driven cars that can outperform others by superior handling. I just want to prove to my car group that power is not everything and that a car with better chassis stiffness, suspension, weight can hold their own better than others with more power. In addition, another reason I want to pursue a STEM career is that the opportunities I receive can be used to help my mom and give her financial opportunities we never had growing up. It would be great to finally give back and thank her for everything she has done for me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,588,"I want to go into the stem field because I personally like science and math, and I also want to become an engineer. I want to be in the stem field because it also pays good I want to be secured when I retire one day. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2126,"I want to go in the STEM field because I know it would lead me to a successful career and I know I would enjoy the job the I get. I chose mechanical engineering because I always wondered how things work and I like to build. My dad works in construction, so I think that where I got my passion from. He would sometimes take me to work, and I would see all the projects that him and his co-workers built. I know that it will not be easy to get my degree, but I am willing to put in all my effort to get as far as possible into my field because I want to help my parents financially along with myself. I’m still thinking about getting my master’s degree because I know that some companies pay your tuition to get your master’s. So far, my classes have been great because I’m learning the fundamentals.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2127,"I want to get into the STEM field because it's what I find the most interesting especially something to do with designing and creating that is why I am majoring in civil engineering. I like being about to help communities prosper with the ability to make structures safer such as creating better roads or infrastructures.  Also, I like doing something that I could do both on the field and off the field I feel that being in STEM  this is possible. Not only that I but I find it morally good doing this sort of job because I am making society better in a way. Another thing is going to this path I could find myself to be financially comfortable as compared to other jobs and that is something I want to strive for."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,165,I want to go into the STEM field because everything about technology and engineering fascinates me. I have been into Engineering since my high school days. I was part of the engineering academy all 4 years throughout high school. I was able to familiarize myself with basic engineering properties and materials at an early stage of my life. Therefore I strongly felt that this was what I wanted to study to make a career around it. I feel like this is something I'm passionate about and I hope to be doing big things with my degree in the future. The STEM field has a lot of interesting and great possibilities when it comes to choosing a career choice and I feel that the time studying for these degrees is well worth it. Soon I will be able to work in the field of engineering more specifically Civil engineering and I will enjoy designing and building different structures for our community.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1843,"STEM subjects have always been my favorite growing up. Math, Science, anything in the STEM field just seemed so much fun and interesting during school for me. From the experimentation to the numbers it just clicked in my brain whereas English and other subjects didn't have that same effect. This was one of the driving forces of pursuing a STEM major but one of the biggest reasons was my grandma. She was an Engineer for Disney and would always pique my interest in the STEM field. From doing labs as a kid to looking at construction designs and seeing things be built was so thrilling for me. I remember I used to play with Legos and dream about building a giant skyscraper that stretched to the stars or building a bridge to an unknown island. STEM has just felt like home for me. Sometimes though a little tedious and stressful, it has been a lifelong aspiration to continue to live up to what my grandma would expect from me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1997,"My name is Karell Kouakou and I am from  Ivory Coast which is located in the west side of Africa. I decided to go into the Stem field for many reasons. In fact, since my childhood I had in mind that I will do a job that women are not used to do. In my country for example women like to work as secretary, office assistant, nurse, or teacher. From my part I am inspired by the type of work which allows me to be on the move instead of staying in one place. In addition, as I had always loved and been good at math and physique during high school, I decided then to go into the STEM field. The STEM field is also the path that will help me do the job I want. Among the numerous disciplines in engineering I chose to pursue my study in civil engineering because I have always been fascinated by the creativity used to construct big bridges."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2128,"I want to be in the STEM field because I want to do something that I would enjoy and feel at home in. I have always been interested on how things work, fixed, and built. I honestly do not have any family members or people that I personally know that are in the STEM field. Maybe my dad since he does have a civil engineering degree but I was born yet when he was doing engineering stuff. That is probably a reason why I want to be a civil engineer too just to do something my dad did but I feel like it's more about me than him. I want to be an engineering because it might be something that I might enjoy more than anything than would decide to do in the future. In a way a want to explore a path in life that I have no idea how it works but that is what makes it the most interesting. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,176,"The reason I wanted to go into STEM is because it's what I've always been good at. I was never good at reading and writing classes and they also did not interest me as much as STEM classes. Math and science are for the most part very intuitive and there's almost always a clear answer to a problem which tends to click better in my brain than subjects that tend to be more subjective. More specifically with my major being Mechanical Engineering, I have also always been really interested in cars. That interest as I got older continued to develop where at first it was just cool to look at cars but now I also find it very interesting to know exactly how a car works and all the engineering that goes into building every single component. Another reason is that I find that STEM is one of the major components to driving our society forward rather than backwards. The more advanced we make our technology the easier our lives become and that is pretty much what STEM drives to do."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2129,"When I think about it, there is way more than just one reason why I joined the STEM field. Aside from an obvious superiority complex, like all of my peers (kidding), I have always loved to build things and understand not only why but how it is that they work. Whether it be a plane, boat, train, or car, I pretty much went through phases of loving all of these things as a kid. As I got deeper into the science of these man-made marvels, I became even more fascinated on how they are designed. My father studied some drafting in college, and when he showed me all of his old work, I knew that I was going to get sucked into some kind of design. Combining this with my passion for machines, I landed on engineering being my career path. Knowing that I would get to be able to build some pretty amazing technology while having a massive opportunity to be the greater good of humanity is what kept me going to where I am to this day. More or so now more than ever as I am 3 years and 1 engineering internship into my career as a young STEM student. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1838,"I wish to go into the STEM field because I have always found it fun. I was first introduced to STEM through a 3D modeling course at my middle school. I found the class to be very fun and exciting as I enjoyed being able to think of objects in my head, create them in the CAD program, and then 3D print them. I then went into a robotics course that allowed me to compete in robot rally competitions. I found the coding to be a lot of fun and enjoyed the ability to create a small robot with a team. Those two memories and my enjoyment of math encouraged me to enter the field of STEM. This is why I chose to come to State as a Mechanical Engineer in hopes of one day work for Disney as one of their Imagineers.    "
