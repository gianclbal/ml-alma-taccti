2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2126,"My goals are to get a career in mechanical engineering and live financially stable. I want to love my job because I didn’t use four years of my life for no reason. I also don’t want to stress over having to pay the bills, groceries, etc. because I will never get to enjoy life. I have to do the hard work now so I can live easier in the future. This class will help me by completing the prerequisites for my major. If I pass, I won’t have to worry about doing it all over again and I will still be on track for graduating in four years. Additionally, this class will help me by setting down the first stones to get where I want to. Physics will definitely be used in my major and it’s no wonder why physics is a prerequisite. I will be on top of the work because I know if I slack the work will pile up quickly.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2122,"My long term goals are to finish school and to get my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. Being able to get a more hands on experience is something I'm looking forward to to help improve my understanding in the occupation. Physics and math are both important subjects that acts as gateways to become a mechanical engineer. Having a deep understanding of those subject would make achieving and maintaining those goals. This class in particular, phys 242, helps improve my understanding of physics through a more hands on approach than through a lecture approach. The structure we currently go through in this class has been a good approach so far. A mini lecture into a lab exploration then top it off with a post-lab and summary confirms my understanding of the topic."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,165,"My goals are to graduate and get my bachelor's in Civil Engineering, this class helps me achieve this goal by teaching me various topics that are widely used in the field of engineering. This physics lab also teaches to be punctual with turning in assignments which is a very important skill to have when working in the field. This class also has units that are used to get my bachelor's of science degree in Civil Engineering. Physics is very important in the field of engineering because physics is basically how everything works in our natural world."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1997,"Karell KouakouFirst of all, my goal is to one day work as a civil engineer. In fact we cannot mention engineering without physics. This class of General physics will help me understand most of the basic material that I need to do for my engineering classes. This class covers a lot of useful topics like Buoyancy, Gas properties, Heat, First Law of thermodynamics, Maxwell Boltzmann Distribution, Simple Motion, Wave Optics, Lenses, Fall Recess and more. All that will help me better understand physics concepts. Also, the lab is one of the greatest advantages for me to actually get to practice and have some experience on things around me . The lab makes me feel more in the subject, and it helps me understand real life problems. Finally I can say that this general physics class will develop more aptitude in me, meaning I will focus more on the experiment before drawing a conclusion."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,588,"my goals are to be on top of my work, sometimes I get offtrack and forget to do things but I will definitely try to do better at getting work done this semester, this class can help me achieve this by constantly looking to check off things on ilearn"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2124,"My goal is to become a well rounded engineer.  I have seen time and time again that the more you know and understand about how things around you work, the better off you are.  The people who start these massive engineering companies have a general understanding of a multitude of topics and I would like to be included in that category. This class can help me with the physics aspect of that.  Plus, I have quickly realized that physics actually plays a big part in several aspects of electrical engineering.  To be able to understand the ins and outs, physics would be at the fore front of that. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,176,My goals are to graduate with a degree in mechanical engineering and this class helps me get there because it's is a major core class. But beyond that I do think this class and physics in general are going to be vital to my future as an engineer. Having a solid foundation and understanding of physic is really important to engineering because I have always thought of engineering as a subset of physics basically meaning applied physics. When engineers create things it is always part of the design process to understand how those things are going to function in the real world. Already in this class we have talked about how in civil engineering they have to account for things like thermal expansion when they build sidewalks and bridges. All these physics concepts can be applied to real world situations so they are key to my future as an engineer. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2127,"Well, My goal is to become a civil engineer or more specifically a geotechnical engineer or construction management still haven't decided between the two. However, this class helps by giving me knowledge of components I may have to encounter in my field for example Temperature and Heat expansion. In terms of the lab portion it goes more in-depth and a better understanding of how it works visually even though we are working online it helps to do simulations making it so it relates to the real world. Basically, doing a simulation of some sort or presentation can help me achieve my goals."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2116,"My overall goal of undergrad is to graduate with a Bachelors of Science degree in Electrical Engineering. This class is a crucial foundational course that will apply to future upper division courses in which having a  background of knowledge in thermal contact, transfer of heat, and thermodynamics would be needed in learning new material. I hope to one day achieve enough success to help uplift others that come from a similar background as myself. I am a second generation Filipino American that is the son of Filipino immigrant parents. I take pride in my culture, pride in my family's origins, and pride in holding myself to good morals and ethics. I hope to sponsor a foster kid in the Philippines someday."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1838,"My ultimate goal has always been the same since I was about eight years old. I grew up always going to different amusement parks, curious about how they were able to make the rides. That curiosity has been carried into my adult life as I now major in Mechanical Engineering in order to work for amusement parks such as Disneyland one day. I think this class will help me achieve my goals by providing a better understanding of how different equations can be used and applied to real-life situations involving heat, expansion, etc. These skills can be useful when working with different materials for a ride or even how these materials may be affected when in an outside environment. These factors must be discussed when working with certain materials. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2118,"My goals for myself, in general, would be to get a degree in civil engineering and pursuing transportation engineering where I can plan and build motorways or tunnels for civilians. Another goal would be to maintain my grades at a good level, meaning As and Bs, but during the pandemic, I had struggled to maintain high grades as it was hard to learn and really study on one's own. Another goal is to pass this class with a relatively good grade. This course can help me with achieving these certain goals by understanding the curriculum and following step by step with laboratory procedures. With this class, I am able to learn theoretical laws and cycles on how the earth and other factors function.  Also, passing this class will help me move onto the next few courses required for my major which will help me with achieving my goal with a bachelor's degree. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1983,"One of my top goals is to graduate so this class helps me work towards this goal. Additionally, this class will also help in my future career because we will use or reference some of the topics that we will go over. Aside from that, I believe that I will be able to meet people that have similar interests or goals and be able to create connections with eachother."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2117,"Some of my goals include being able to understand physics both in the simplified manner and the more complicated Formula related manner. I think by really working through the Laboratory and doing everything independently but also asking for hints when needed will set me on the path or having a deeper understanding of physics in the real word and formula related word.It could just at times be difficult because relating why something in the physics world is related to a particular formula is hard to grasp, as I am a very literal person. It is also at times hard for me to take a formula and think critically as to how I can manipulate it to make it applicable to another scenario regarding similar components. Although I think it is also just a muscle I need to continue to stretch until I'm able to flex it on my own."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,145,My goals is to be an electrical  engineer and this class can help me. By learning about physics I can learn how things work around me. I get to learn on how thermal expansion works. I found this concept very important since me wanting to be an engineering can help me be aware on how this works. When applying this knowledge to the real world it can be beneficial because when I am building something and I am not aware of how thermal expansion works I will be risking people lives if something collapses. This is just one concept that can help me with being an engineering and this class is only a month in.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2130,"My ultimate goal is to do my masters in aerospace engineering and I know that will involve lots of physics. This class gets me closer to getting better at it. I keep getting deeper into Physics and I know once I do my masters I will have to learn more about it. Being in this class, it helps me understand how Physics is applied in our day to day lives. Since I work in a research lab, physics plays a big role and you need to understand the concept of it. It excites me being able to use what I learn in class and apply it outside of it. For example, I had to create a door stop and 3D print it because there wasn't any, so once I did that, I knew I had to also get a material to put on the bottom of it to create friction, or else it would not hold the door properly."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,147,"If this class if performed correctly, it should help you with your group collaborating skills. Also how to analyze data in which we do with the simulations. It also broadens our view of the concepts we learn by us constantly being asked to relate the concepts we learn in the lab to real life.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2120,"My current goals is to get a mechanical engineering degree and then join the air force. This class is helping me understand the foundation of how things work in our everyday lives. I must say I have been struggling these past couple of weeks because life has been very hectic. I'm going to turn in all my labs as soon as possible. Sometimes I feel like dropping out because of the stress, but I just need to never quit. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1826,"My goals in life are to become an Olympic cyclist and to become a Mechanical Engineer. This class can help me achieve my goals by helping me with my studies. I am putting my previous skills to the test every day when I go to class. Every day is a struggle, but I am keeping my goals in mind everyday. Everyday I am able to build upon my skills as a student and as a person. I think it's important to be able to take things away from problems that you encounter in life. The skills that we learn in school are meant to help us in our futures. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2114,My goal is to get a degree in Mechanical Engineering. This class can help achieve this goal by giving me an understanding of physics and how they are applied to real world applications.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2121,"My goals are to pass all the classes I am enrolled in and to get all my work turned in on time. I like to learn, and I make sure to take notes to help me get the most out of my lectures in order to pass the class with good grades. My ultimate goal for my academic career involves graduation in 5 years and not failing any classes, to earn the degree I want from computer engineering, I think this class can help me achieve my goals by teaching me to build good habits for my work ethic and it can help me by teaching my skills I will use in the long run. I think it is known that engineering major will take lots of physics classes and this being my introduction will help me in preparing for the future classes I will need to take. This class will be the basis I will have for physics classes and I hope it will prepare for the next physics classes to come."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2128,"My goal is to get a degree in Civil Engineering but to also learn more about things that happens around. It is just a matter of being curious while also pursuing something that can be beneficial for my personal life. This class will definetly help me answer my curiosity in the world while also prepare me for my future classes. Being a Civil Engineering major, all the concepts that I have learned from my Physics classes will most likely come up again but maybe more challenging and elaborated upon. It would also allow me to actually apply these knowledge in real life it is needed for everyday living. I think by giving insights of what goes on in these chapters that we learn, it helps prepare me for my future endeavors. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,150,"My goals are to complete my bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering. But most importantly, learn a lot from my remaining Physics courses I have to take and get a good grade of course. This course will definitely help me achieve these goals. This is because in the lab course we are practicing the information we learn in the Physics lecture class. Physics is huge in the Civil Engineering world because literally everything revolves around it, especially in the construction of any building or bridge. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2125,"My end goal is to get a career in the field I am studying in. The goal I have right now is to pass all my classes. This is because if I fail again, I might end up in academic probation. What sucked about being in academic probation was that I was limited to a few number of units. Instead of having the ability to take 15-16 units, I was limited to only 13 units. Another reason why it is important for me to pass is that if I don't, it will slow me down and stop me from take other classes due to pre reqs. The reason I want to achieve my end goal is that I know with opportunities I get, I want to take advantage of them and give myself a chance at a better life. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1843,My goal is to graduate and get my life back on track. I have been in college for over 6 years now and longer than I would like. I have had a lot of ups and downs and things that have distracted me from my goal. Only recently I have been able to get back on track and see a finish line towards my goal. This class is one step towards my goal and accomplishing well in this class will help me graduate and pursue my dreams to be a civil engineer. Taking this class has helped me focus and tune in on what I need to accomplish. I don't know if it is providing me with busy work or just allowing me to finally understand what I want to do but it is definitely helping push me forward. Even during my everyday life now I try to think of physics and how it affects my normal life. For example I was driving and saw my tire pressure was low then went up to only realize that it was the gas particles speeding up and increasing the volume but not the amount of particles which I learned about recently in a lab. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2115,"I feel like my goals have changed numerous times throughout the years, especially around the time that I had started college. For the longest time, I have been going back on forth whether or not I wanted to switch my major halfway through my college career. It was a risky jump, but I did it - I changed my major from Pre-Nursing to Mechanical Engineering. It was definitely scary at first, but over time I realized that it may be a good fit for me. It is difficult, but I see now that despite being in a new career field, I am still chasing the same goal: to be able to find a job where I am able to help people. Had I become a nurse, I would have helped patients in the hospital as they recover. As a mechanical engineer major, I help solve problems that would then go on to help people in their daily lives. Another goal I may add to this would be to find a job position with a company that I am 100% truly happy to be at."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2113,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?Goals are always important and when you are in college it helps to have mindset goals. If you want to succeed, you need to set goals. Without goals you lack focus and direction. Goal setting not only allows you to take control of your life's direction; it also provides you a benchmark for determining whether you are actually succeeding. Think about it: having a million dollars in the bank is only proof of success if one of your goals is to amass riches. If your goal is to practice acts of charity, then keeping the money for yourself is suddenly contrary to how you would define success. To accomplish your goals, however, you need to know how to set them. You can't simply say, ""I want"" and expect it to happen. Goal setting is a process that starts with careful consideration of what you want to achieve, and ends with a lot of hard work to actually do it. In between, there are some very well-defined steps that transcend the specifics of each goal. Knowing these steps will allow you to formulate goals that you can accomplish."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2129,"My goals are sort of all over the place, but I guess the best way that I can put this in the scope of this class is pretty simple. I would really just love to be a well-rounded mechanical engineer who fights for important things such as climate change. The best way that I can utilize this class to give me an advantage in success is to learn all of the big idea concepts such as the laws of thermodynamics and the core principles such as thermal expansion. This way, when I am analyzing a real world design or problem, I can make the best approach possible with my education in one hand."
