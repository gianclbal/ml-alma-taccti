2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2128,"A concept that was by far the most interesting that we have covered this semester is the Bernoulli Principle. Have you ever wondered why golf balls have dimple? That is to prevent the ball from having too much low pressure behind it which causes drag. The is the same force that makes planes fly. The high velocity on top of the wing causes low pressure which creates lift force. This could be applicable for many things especially how traveling is done is high speeds nowadays. We travel by cars which are much more aerodynamic now but there is still a lot of room for improvement. Especially those big trucks that would really benefit from being more aerodynamic to not cause drag this way they same more energy which boosts businesses and production . It is also very applicable to public transportation like trains systems like BART because not only can we make them faster, we can also make them more efficient and could help people that can not afford to drive to other cities for better paychecks and rely on public transportation. We can even connect big cities into big metropolis like how trains do it in Japan and they are planning on making even faster trains and fluid dynamics play a major role to those things. I have also seen how this Bernoulli effect is applied on hyper cars. Bugatti have recently made a car that has active dimple to actually mimic a golf ball to make it more aerodynamic."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2127,"Heat is applicable to people's lives and it could be useful to benefit society from cooking to engineering almost everything we do, where heat is a transfer of energy between two objects due to temperature differences. Also noting that with heat transfer with two objects there is conservation of energy and heat flows from a hot object to the cold one. We could also acknowledge specific heat for different substances which gives the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature. One example of heat is ice in water energy is transferred from the warm water to the cold ice until they reach temperature equilibrium. A beneficial example of heat is knowing the specific heat to prevent thermal expansion in substances such as concrete or steel that will help prevent disaster in the future. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2129,"Why does my tire pressure light come on when its a chilly morning? A great way to answer this is through understanding the simple laws of thermodynamics and more importantly, the relationship between pressure and heat in a system. The specific formula that we may use to answer this question is as follows: PV = nRT, where P- Pressure; V- Volume; n- Number of Particles; R- Gas Constant; T- Temperature. We see a direct relationship between temperature and pressure. Let's say we double temperature, since we are modifying one side of the equation, we must equally modify the other side, so essentially, it can double pressure. Of course, this is in very crude terms, but it gives us the necessary mathematical relationship between the two. Since we can use this mathematical relationship for a rise in temperature, let's think about the initial question, where we understand the morning is colder. If we initially filled the tires at 32 PSI on a warm afternoon, this sets the initial boundaries for the temperature-pressure relationship. However, if the morning after is a cold morning, because of this relationship, we can cause a decrease in pressure, which technically is below the recommended tire pressure. Hence, our tire pressure light will come on for the time being until the system can be reset at the optimal temperature."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1843,"A concept that is relevant or beneficial to society could be Maxwell Boltzmann theory of kinetic energy. From that lab I thought of soda cans as a prime example of how temperature affects the speed or distribution of the gas molecules of the soda. Taking that into a further step we can use that in many other ways in our daily lives. An engine for example in cars. Car engines are constantly pushing pistons and converting liquid gas into vapor which is expelled through the exhaust. The engine as time goes on increases in temperature as it keeps running and this increase in temperature can cause the engine to overheat. Once a car overheats it will usually break down. In our experiment this was comparable to the box busting open as temperature rose because the gas molecules had a higher kinetic energy. From this we can see why cars have coolant systems. Coolant is pushed through the engine to keep it cool and stop this situation from happening. It helps regulate the temperatures of the engine making sure that the kinetic energy of the engine never exceeds what the car can handle. Thus we can use this to make implications about other mechanical technology in our daily lives i.e. boiling water on a stove top, airplane engines etc."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1997,"Why do container ships Float?Container ships float because there is an upward force acting on it. This force is called Buoyant Force. Buoyancy is a force exerted on bodies immersed in a fluid (liquid or gaseous), and therefore subjected to Archimedes' thrust. It opposes the force of gravity, since it is directed from the bottom up. Depending on the ratio of its weight to Archimedes' thrust, a body can have neutral, positive, or negative buoyancy. In these three cases, the objects will respectively float between two waters, rise to the surface or sink. Also the Buoyancy force depends on the density of the liquid, the volume displacement and the acceleration due to gravity. When the buoyant force is greater than the weight of the object it is acting on, the object floats. In conclusion, we can say that the container ships weigh less than the buoyant force.Beside the container ships that float due to buoyancy force, there are other examples of buoyancy force in our everyday life. Let's take the example of a swimmer, Buoyancy force helps him/her to stay closer to the surface. This is because the pressure experienced by the swimmer under the water is more than the pressure experienced above. This is also the reason why swimmers can float on the surface of the water.We also have, Iceberg floating on water, A person with a life vest floating on water, a Helium balloon rising in the air, etc."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1983,"well maybe because it is what we covered most recently but one question I had about the way current moved, is why did the current travel quicker around the system when the light bulbs were parallel to each other but on separate paths. What we found was the current traveled through the path where it would use up less energy, in other words, fewer obstacles. while doing this lab, I realized how everything that we use on the regular in our daily lives is dependent on energy and power. things such as our phones, TVs, appliances, even our homes, and some cars. in our homes, we use up a large amount of energy that is traveling all around us pretty much at all times. So if we know how it works and we use it, we can be more mindful of how we waste it and figure ways to conserve it"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2119,Is the entropy of condensation and vaporization positive negative or 0?The entropy of vaporization should always be positive because it is the increase in entropy upon vaporization of a liquid.The entropy of condensation will be negative because going from a gas to a liquid results in a decrease in the disorder of the substance. This also results in a decrease in entropy therefore it should be negative. this is also because the heat is released from the substance in condensation. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2131,"The lesson I will be discussing is about sound/sound waves. Everything we know is founded upon the human body’s ability to process sensory information. Of these senses, hearing is one of the most fundamental and important to our accumulation of knowledge and our understanding of the world. Sound is vital to sharing information, interacting with other people, creating art, regulating schedules, and countless other aspects of life. That being said, understanding the science behind sound/ sound wave is extremely beneficial to soicty.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2130,"One of my favorite topics we have learned in class is thermodynamics. You can apply it to many things. Sweating in a Crowded Room. The human body obeys the laws of thermodynamics. As to how does it better our lives? Well, thermodynamics can also be an example like the flip of a switch since electricity is a form of energy. Although it seems small, it has completely changed and bettered our lives. That’s only one of the many examples of thermodynamics."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2126,"The question is what is buoyancy and how does it apply to real life?Buoyancy is when the fluid is applying an upward force on an immersed object. Many factors include whether the object will float or sink. The fluid doesn’t necessarily have to be water. It could be honey, milk, oil, etc. but that would affect the buoyancy. Additionally, the gravitational force plays a role, and it changes depending on the where the system is located. Precisely what planet the system is on. As well as density of the object affects if it will float or sink. If the gravitational force is greater than the buoyant force than the object will sink and float if the buoyant force is greater than the gravitational force. An example of buoyancy are ships. Ships are crucial to move goods and people. You would think that a ship being so big and heavy it would sink but it doesn’t because it has a lot of air in it. The steel is hallowed which decreases the density. Therefore, the buoyant force is greater and why ships are afloat. In case of the titanic, water entered the ship which increased the density of the titanic. The downward force became greater than the buoyant force which is why it sank. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2122,"How do people float on water? It is much more difficult when you're trying to float upright than laying on your back, people tend to slowly paddle their legs and arms, if you flail too much or get too much water into your system, you'll sink. On the flip side if you try to float on water on your back, it's significantly easier to suck in your chest/stomach a bit while holding still. A big factor to that is buoyancy. When laying on your back, the water is able to cover more surface area( therefore more volume) from your head to toe. Meaning the front half of your body isn't submerged while the back half of your body is. The buoyant force is pushing up toward your back for you body to displace to water. As for trying to float upright, a majority of your body is submerged in water and you aren't covering as much surface area, therefore it is more difficult to float. This info can be relevant to those who are practicing swimming or trying to learn how to float in water. Being able to swim and to stay calm can benefit whether you can float or drown in situations that involve a person in water."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,147,"I think so far the the most useful information is how volume and pressure are related. I remember in lab that if the volume decreased, the pressure increased and vise versa. We also introduced temperature which could either increase or decrease the pressure as well. This is  important as gases are things we deal with today and understanding how to sustain and store them safely is important knowledge to have."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,176,One of the topics that has interested me the most is when we discussed thermal expansion. This concept was one that I felt you could literally experience in every day life. So my question would be what obscure cases or cases where you wouldn't think thermal expansion would have an impact but it does. In class we discussed a lot about how engineers have to account for thermal expansion when building roads and sidewalks which is why we see those small slits in the concrete slabs that make up the sidewalks. We can also assume that thermal expansion is a huge factor in systems that produce a lot of heat such as engines. I think this might be one of the reasons I find car engines so fascinating. They have to be built within incredibly small tolerance for everything to fit perfectly and run as efficiently as possible but they also have to give enough room for the metals to expand under some of the extremely high temperatures that they can be run at. One sort of obscure application of thermal expansion that I found was to use thermal expansion to your advantage in order to open a jar that may be really tight. You can run the lid of the jar under hot water and the heat should help get the lid loose more easily. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2116,"A lab topic that I've chosen to base my question for this week's journal is the transfer of heat and how it applies with refrigerators. Nonetheless my question is how does a refrigerator use the transfer of heat principle to keep the fridge cold? I've learned from lecture that this is associated with the second law of thermodynamics and how work is required for a continuous cyclical transfer of heat from one object to another. I found it fascinating to learn how the ""engine"" of the refrigerator is absorbing heat from the cold reservoir, or inside of the fridge, and expelling it out to its corresponding outlet for heat. When contemplating on this further, this makes sense because the cold reservoir is either continuously getting cooler or maintaining a cooler temperature because it is releasing heat to the fridge's ""engine"". Previously I always thought its outputting cold air into the inside of the fridge but this was incorrect because of how the concept of heat transfer works. It's important to understand this concept and how it works with modern technology to eventually be able to account the factor of heat and how to manage it in any future engineering devices."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2121,"During week 8 one conclusion is that in a harmonic system when we take the position of an object on a spring vs time, the period is how long it takes for the object to complete a full cycle. We know this is true because we can the motion of an object on a spring as a wave on a graph. If we observe an object to oscillate on a spring, and we measure the displacement, it will take a certain amount of time for the object to return to its original position. If we know the period, then we can find the frequency and angular speed, as well as the amplitude. Also for week 5 we learned that heat is a form of energy and that in a system with a cold and hot object, energy (heat) is transferred from the hotter object to the cooler one. This is important to understand if we wanted to place some ice cubes into our sprite drink and we do not want the ice to melt quickly, and drink watered down sprite. So in order to keep our drink cool and prevent ice from melting we must ensure that the sprite is chilled before we place our ice cubes in so that way the energy transfer is less as opposed to putting ice in a warm/room temp glass of sprite."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,165,"A topic that was covered in class in the past few weeks was Simple harmonic motion. How do you find the angular frequency of 2 masses hanging by a spring? In order to find the angular frequency, we must be given the spring constant k. It is directly related to the spring constant and the mass. Using the formula w = sqrt(k/m) we can solve for the angular frequency. This information can be applicable to many real-world examples; such as shocks on a car, musical instruments, and even bungee jumping. These formulas are required in order to make precise calculations to know which shocks are needed on certain cars, tuning in musical instruments, and having the right rope for different weight constraints in bungee jumping."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1826,What is heat and how do we describe it? Heat is an interesting thing to describe. Well we describe heat as a form of energy that is transferred from one body to another. We experience heat everyday. For example when we drive a car for a long period of time the engine will start getting hotter. The only way to cool the engine done would be to pull over and let the engine come back to a normal temperature. We also experience heat when we go outside on a hot day. The sun will be shining down on us with its rays. Although we can't see them we can feel them. Heat will travel from a hot reservoir to a cold reservoir. An example of this would be if you add hot water to some cold water. The cold water gains thermal energy. They will both become the same temperature.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2124,"As someone who enjoys all types of music and has even tried learning to play, this week's lab was interesting in the fact that I had never thought about it from a physics standpoint.  I had never thought that the reason the music gets louder and louder as you get closer to the amplifier, is because the pressure on the ears is greater and greater as you get closer.  That has kind of been a question I have always asked myself, is that these invisible waves actually have a physical effect on our bodies and that doesn't just count for listening to music. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,145,"What happens when a gallon of water with a temperature of one hundred degrees celsius gets mixed with water that has temperature of zero degrees celsius. Will the water reach either sides of the temperature? Well from looking at the lab we know that the water will never be the starting temperature. They will mix up and try to balance each other out. The water will probably land to about fifty degrees celsius. The reason it will balance out is because of the temperature. We can compare this to weight since that also has energy and takes up space. Let's think about a scale. When there is a one hundred pound brick on a scale, the scale will mark one hundred. But when we push the scale up with a force that matches fifty pounds. The scale will no longer read one hundred pounds. The scale will now read as fifty pounds since some weight has been taken away from going down. This information can be used in the real world when we want, say a tea to cool down. The tea is too hot to drink but you are in a hurry to leave. You can add some ice cubes so you can cool down the tea. By knowing this you will know how many ice cubes to throw in. If you put a small ice cube maybe the tea will still be too hot but if you add to many it will be too cold. So by knowing this you can add a good amount of ice cubed that will make your tea cool down so it wont be to cold or hot."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,588,"why does a boat float but a rock sink even though boat is bigger?This is because of buoyancy, buoyancy is when the force is caused by the pressure exerted by the fluid in which an object is immersed. The buoyancy force always points upwards because the pressure of a fluid increases with depth. knowing that, since the area of the boat displaced in water is larger than the area of the boat submerged in water, it floats. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2117,"Entropy is my biggest confusion. While I have an idea on what it is, it might be helpful to understand how scientist came to ""discover"" entropy. The book goes through all the different ways we can ""see"" entropy in but the actual explanation is still vague, considering it is a very large talked about in the book. I also find it strange that while carnot engines aren't real in this world, we follow a formula that approximates an real world engines using carnot models."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2118,"What I learned this week would be the second law of thermodynamics where the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease. A hot object is in contact with a cold object where heat flows from the hot to the cold object. It would never flow from cold to hot. An example could be an ice cube with room temperature water. The water would give off heat to the ice cube, where the entropy of the water would decrease. The cube would absorb the heat, where the entropy would increase. I added a small picture of an ice cube!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2115,"What is an everyday example of the first law of dynamics in action?For starters, the first law of thermodynamics is the difference in internal energy equals to heat flowing in/out of the system plus/minus the work and its surroundings doing work. Basically, you cannot get out more energy than you put in. In other words, the amount of energy in = the amount of energy out.Let's say we have a block being pushed up a slope by a hand as it moved from the bottom to the top. Keep in mind that friction is omitted. The work done on the block by the hand is positive as it is being pushed up, and the work done on the block by the incline is negative as it is being pushed with normal force. The same amount of energy from the hand, reflected the same amount of energy from the block."
