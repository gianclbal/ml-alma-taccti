2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2128,"I think the greatest take away from this class for me is basically learning how to apply physics. I am not talking about this class specifically but all the physics labs i have taken because this might be the last one the is required for my major. I would say this one is the easiest just because I was already trained by the previous physics labs. It will be very helpful because my other classes will be going deep into topics we have gone over this class. For example, I will need to take thermodynamics for engineering the semester after this one but I hope that the thermodynamics I have learned from this class will help me a lot. I think labs really solidify topics for me but maybe that is just because lecture is asynchronous but I think that is the purpose of labs anyways. But I do regret not being able to the labs physically because I was a freshman before pandemic and the in person labs was so interesting and was much harder to comprehend since that was my first physics class. The online physics labs have actually made use of my imagination more so maybe that will help my mental muscle for my future engineering classes. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2116,"My greatest takeaway from this class was to really be patient with the learning process especially with Physics and even all stem courses. I no longer see labs as just 1 unit courses, but as potentially the best opportunity to really digest lectures through hands on learning. In other words you really get out of the lab what you put in! For this class I really went at my own pace with the lab exploration, challenging myself to really understand all parts of the lab despite how long it may take. This really helped with my comprehension on exams related to this course as well as being more proficient in the material to sustain a conversation."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2124,"My greatest take away from this class is that there are an abundant of simulations on the internet solely made for physics.  As far as not being to take the class in person, the simulations were a good alternative to that.  I am a pretty hands on person and in-class classes are usually an essential for me to be able to learn effectively.   I thought that they provided a good source to learn physics as well as I have actually gone back to them.  Another thing that I have taken away from this class is that some of these concepts are not as menacing as previous students and even a couple teachers have made it out to be."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2121,"The greatest take away from this class has to be from week 5, where we worked with Heat and the law of thermodynamics. One conclusion is that heat is a form of energy and that in a system with a cold and hot object, energy (heat) is transferred from the hotter object to the cooler one. Another conclusion is that a system with in which there is no heat transferred but we observe a change in temperature of the gas or there is no work done on the gas, it is an adiabatic process. For example, first law of thermodynamics states the internal energy is the summation of the work done and heat transferred. In an adiabatic system we know there is no energy transfer when there is either no work done or the temperature changes in a system. If we heat a hot air balloon it will rise and if we take away heat, it will fall. We know this is true because we made observations utilizing the first law of thermodynamics, U = Q + W. We observed in process 3 of the lab that in a cylinder moving down and compressing a gas in thermal equilibrium saw negative work and a heat transfer of 0. Another example is if we wanted to place some ice cubes into our sprite drink and we do not want the ice to melt quickly, and drink watered down sprite. So in order to keep our drink cool and prevent ice from melting we must ensure that the sprite is chilled before we place our ice cubes in so that way the energy transfer is less as opposed to putting ice in a warm/room temp glass of sprite."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2114,The greatest take away from this course was learning how to be consistent with the work and answers. Having this course online was challenging when it come to staying on task.  
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,165,My greatest takeaway from this class is that it is the last physics class I will be taking in college and I feel that it gave me the necessary tools to use in future engineering courses I take. My physics professors were all very helpful throughout the years and I'm glad that they taught me what I need to know to be successful in the field of engineering. I enjoyed the peers I met along the way and the friendships that will last a lifetime with some peers following the same career path as me. The knowledge I take with me into the following years of pursuing my Engineering degree will give me to strength to pass all my classes with flying colors. I am looking forward to this endeavour and I hope to become the most successful man I can be.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2131,"My greatest takeaway from this class is how difficult physics can be, especially learning it on my own for the majority of the time. There are times where the subjects can be downright confusing and can take me hours to comprehend. I wish I could have taken this class in person to have actual support from peers and my professors. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2125,"My greatest take away from this class was that I was able to hopefully succeed while it was online. Also was that I was able to learn new things. I was amazed on how many things in my daily life revolves around physics. I also was able to meet with new people despite it being online, they were helpful when I needed it when I did not get something"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2117,"Physics is all around, question the things around you more often. Next time you are doing random things that usually you do without much thought ask yourself  ""how does this work? Why does this work?""As human beings on earth and as technology gets more and more advanced I find we are no longer asking or wondering why things work. Many of the times we just know they do and move on. For example, I work at a car parts place and people usually don't know one thing as to why their car is able to work. Especially now with being able to pay people to do simple tasks that everyone used to have to know 40 years ago, we ask less and less questions. Continue to ask yourself basic questions and it will slowly expose you to more and more physics concepts! Learning is never ending, things that may not make sense with one concept may make sense when you apply it to another real world example.Learn on!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2130,"My greatest takeaway from this class was learning how to use my words in a scientific manner. I feel like I have always struggled with writing what I mean, especially when it’s involving complex words. I know it may seem very small, but for someone who struggles in writing, this was something I needed to work on. Because I’m in stem, we don’t often get the chance to write about anything, it’s mostly just equations and numbers. It’s important to know how to explain the equations we do, that’s why I really enjoy labs, because it helps me understand what I’m solving. As a researcher, this class helps me be able to write my findings and helps me become a better student and researcher."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1826,"My greatest take away from this class would have been being able to work with others and get their opinions on the lab. It was very helpful to have others to talk to when I got stuck on a concept. I have also learnt how to summarize information from the labs. I enjoyed working with new peers and getting to know some of them. I learnt how to problem solve and used this ability to efficiently complete the lab assignments. Another immense take away is how I was able to apply concepts from physics to the real world, for instance, studying the oscillation of waves as I throw pebbles into the ocean.   "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1997,"My greatest take away of this class can be divided into many groups. First of all, this class taught me how to write a good lab report. In fact, I already took a class where I had to do some lab reports but I was not really good at it since It was my first time and I was really scared. Then this class of physics 242 came up and I was then more confident doing lab reports. Secondly, the way our teacher explains the different lab subjects is really helpful. In fact, she makes us go through a powerpoint that has some explanations about the topic we are going to do in the lab before starting the lab itself. That really helps me understand the lab better. Also, the teacher is always willing to come back on a material you do not understand. Finally, the fact that we do the lab in a group is really helpful. Since we do not do in person classes, being in a group helps interact with each other."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2129,"My greatest takeaway from this class was more or so in the lecture portion- in that I learned how to formulate and put together a formal report & analysis for one problem. This is a huge skill to have, especially when It comes to the professional career of an engineer. Being in the every-day industry goes well beyond the scope of designing and calculating properties. Reports are crucial, and the projects in lecture, as well as the lab reports/summaries help contribute to that crucial element of the day to day job we engineers will have one day."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,588,For me the greatest take away of this class is how to stay organized and be on top of things. Doing the lab exploration isn't enough to get a good grade you have to be able to understand what you are doing to explain it and be able to relate it in the real world.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2127,"My greatest takeaway from this class was having a laboratory experience despite being online most of the lab felt interactive and fun and made me better understand the concepts in physics. For example, the light labs were really helpful in getting a picture in mind of how it works also with the labs the equation are easier to understand because of the variables described in the lab. Another great takeaway from this class was staying on track with my work and actually understanding the concept rather than just doing it aimlessly. That is I am really glad the labs were interactive and that this lab class made the best of its opportunity while being online."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,176,"My greatest take away from this class is the importance of repetition and having labs like this where the material gets reviewed in a manner that is more tangible than reading a textbook. I found that this class was really helpful in solidifying my general understanding of the topics. In some cases there were more specifics to the topic that I wouldn't feel as solid about after the class, but still I had a better general understanding which helps a lot in getting the specifics. I also would often use these labs as a reference when doing homework. There were a lot of examples we went through where it would be a similar but more general form of one of the homework questions so it helped to be able to look back on a lab and see the thought process that went into  solving a question and see if that same thought process could be applied to the homework question."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2119,My biggest take away from this class is that i used a lot of this information in my engineering classes. I am excited that this will be my last physics class but we see physics everyday all the time so it was a very valuable class.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2120,"My greatest takeaway from this class was that I definitely fell behind because of other courses and work. I also realized that because of the pandemic I'm not that good of an online student learner and hope to be back in person soon. Whether or not I pass this lab, I am grateful to be able to learn and watch cat videos. I found that learning about sound waves is pretty cool and probably my favorite subject in this class. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2122,"My greatest take away from this class is just a better understanding of physics. Going into this semester was a rough start because I had taken Spring 2021 off. So half a semester of no school and no progression towards my major alongside of covid and mental health took a toll on how to prepare myself to gain an understanding of the classes I took this semester. While I'm wasn't successful in understanding a few of my classes, I'm glad to have both enjoyed understand learning both math 245 and physics 242 this semester. Comparatively back in the community college I went to, I thought I wasn't going to like physics all too well, but I'm glad that changed transferring over to SFSU last fall."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,150,"My greatest takeaway from this class was probably the way that I was allowed to improve on my time management skills. I had to sort out time during the day in order to complete all of these assignments I was given. However this class also allowed me to tie together all the information I had learned in the lecture portion of Physics 3 and put it to use in a lab environment so I could practice a bit more, even if it wasn't in hands and in person. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,147,"This class has taught me to be observant and helped me relay what I have learned to others. We watched simulations and have to go into detail and describe what were learned in the lab exploration and postlabs. I enjoyed this class a lot, but wish it was in person since it is my final physics class I have to take. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,1843,"The greatest takeaway I took away from this class was the outlook I have on science and real life. Through this course, I was able to connect topics and experiential evidence to daily life to prove how things work. This allowed me to be able to better understand how things operate and to both problems solve and predict certain things. for example, the distribution of wave motion and water motion is something that a sound engineer can use when designing concerts and how to better establish an experience where the whole audience can hear the music. They can take into account slits or obstacles and determine the weaker points in the audience and adjust accordingly. This type of critical thinking is a skill that I took away from this course and will now be able to push myself to ask the questions why and how things tick. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,2126,"The greatest take away from this class is how light and sound are all types of waves. The create similar shapes when going through a slit or numerous slits and similar if there are no slits. In a picture you can tell where there are nodal lines, constructive and destructive interference. If there is a screen and light waves are shown wherever there is light that is constructive interference. Wherever it is dark that is destructive interference.  Another thing that I got from this class is a study habit. Since there were numerous assignments from different classes it was hard to remember them. I had to write all my homework in my little notebook and once I turned it in, I checked it off. It was a great way for me to visually see what I had to do. I will be able imply that into my future courses, so I don’t forget anything at all. "
