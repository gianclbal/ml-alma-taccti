2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1550,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""  My goals are to always think positive and not negative. Always growing up I have always thought negative and never really wanted to do anything during the day. I missed a lot of school in high school and that when I learned physics and never was really into it. Once I got to college that is when I knew I wanted to go into kinesiology of some sort. This class has been helping me because im learning physics in the real world and how it relates to my body. I really hope this class will help me. I want to become a tennis coach at some point after college because I really want to work with kids and there is a lot of physics in tennis."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1547,"Reflection 2 My goals in this physics class that I would like to achieve is to have an adequate and decent understanding of the use of applied physics in design solutions. In product design, the designing and assembling requires one to take into consideration the product parts and the mechanical features of the materials. A solid amount of the physics knowledge can be integrated into my design projects and also, most importantly, help to find successful solutions. Therefore, an understanding of the physical laws of functionality can help inform my design thinking and execution of such thinking."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1540,My goal is to graduate with a kinesiology degree and future my study by going to physical therapy school. A prerequisite for kinesiology is that I take physics 101 and the lab that comes along with it. Since a young age I’ve always enjoyed learning about dif ferent forms of science such as the body and space. It’ s always something that’ s fascinated me growing up. I remember I dreamt of becoming an astronaut. My dreams have changed a lot since then and as of now I’m interested in becoming a physical therapist. With going into this field the requirements are people get their masters in physical therapy . This class will help to fulfill that requirement. After that’ s completed I would be able to take my upper division kinesiology courses. This time for me is very important to study so I don’ t have to retake classes which will postpone my graduation date.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1552,"My goal is to pass this course and to ﬁnish my general requirements and then to focus on my upper division and major courses so I can graduate w my Bachelor’s degree in Kinesiology. I am achieving this goal by putting in the time and eﬀort each week in every class that I have and will do the best that I can do in each class. This class is just one more step closer to helping me achieve my goal as there is a lot more work I still need to do if I want to ﬁnd success after school is done. This class helps me relate physics to our everyday world and even if I do not think something is physics related, it probably has some type of eﬀect on physics. This can help in the future with kinesiology because of the physics involved when the body is at rest or in motion. Whether someone is running or working out at a gym there is physics that is being applied whether someone is thinking about it or not. I hope to continue to be able to ﬁnd success in this course and continue to learn more about how physics relates to our everyday lives."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1546,"Vanessa Gonzalez 09/22/2021 PHYS 010202 ""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?"" My professional goals are to become a physical therapist or something along the field of kinesiology. I have always been passionate about helping people and studying the human body has always been fascinating to me so I am able to do both by becoming a physical therapist. To be able to get there I still have a lot of years of school left. Which includes two more years to get my bachelors degree and then three to four more years to get my masters degree. This class is part of my plan and a requirement of being able to get my bachelors degree. Physics has never been a topic I completely understand but I hope this class helps me get a better perspective of that."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1542,"Reflection #2 My goal for this class is first to do overall my best and to get an A or a B as my final grade. Additionally, by getting a good grade I would have a decent overall understand of the physics topics being taught by the course. There are some tasks I have set for myself to achieve this goal of mine. the first thing I must do is to keep up and attend class when it is scheduled. Secondly, doing the lab work and assignments and doing some extra reading on the lecture notes provided and other readings from other book sources will help keep me on track with the content that is provided and assigned by the course. Another tip or idea that I have is if I had any troubling issues with a topic taking to it with friends and classmates that are knowledgeable about the subject will help me understand it better. And if I continue to have any further issues, I will later find time to meet with the professor during office hours and task for help."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1543,"Jessica   J   Cuevas    Con.   Physics   Lab    Reflection   2       My   goals   are   to   graduate   college   while   learning   about   the   day-to-day   obstacles.   Setting    this   goal   for   myself   will   allow   me   to   learn   about   how   what   we   learn   connects   to   our   daily   life.    Another   goal   I   have   for   myself   is   to   become   a   more   educated   individual.   This   will   allow   me   to    become   a   better   citizen/   person   in   the   community .   This   class   will   help   me   reach   my   goals   in    many   different   ways.   First,   this   class   will   satisfy   my   requirement   for   a   lab   that   is   one   step   closer    to   graduating.   This   class   also   discusses   topics   we   see   in   our   day-to-day   life   that   sometimes   we   do    not   know   are   going   on.   This   class   also   helps   me   achieve   my   second   goal   because   it   teaches   me    different   topics   that   happen   in   the   world.   Being   able   to   know   how   things   around   us   are   working    is   a   big   plus   when   it   comes   to   being   a   more   educated   individual."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1551,"“What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?” In terms of my degree and major, Conceptual physics will ﬁll out a pre-requisite for my major. •Depending on the type of career I want to pursue, I will need to take College Physics next semester, so this class will build a foundation of my understanding and knowledge that will carry me to the next level of Physics. But in general, this physics class will help me regardless because the physics can be applied to the ﬁeld of kinesiology. For example, biomechanics of the human body and sports uses techniques of mathematical modeling, computer simulations, and measurements to enhance sports performance and reducing injury, which I think the concepts of physics are applied."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1556,"Reflection #2 So far the course has been going well for me. I have been able to understand all of the concepts and topics we have gone through so my goals have been set to be accomplished as of now. I will keep on working hard to pass my classes and do my best to complete my work to the best of my ability . I strive to work hard and I value hard work over talent. I am far confident that we all can understand these topics and pass the class too! I just would like for my classmates to speak up more and communicate far more during the breakout rooms. It’ s difficult to work with others online because they do not want to participate during class. Another challenge I face a lot is the practice of time management. It really is dif ficult to manage my time since I am in a sport. With my sport, time is really scarce and also I have to decline to a lot of friend gatherings in order to get my homework done and to study for exams."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1548,My goals are to gain a better understanding of how the world around me works. What are the natural causes that make all things possible? The class is helping me achieve these goals because it is using real life simulators. These help a lot because I get a visual to what I am learning and it’s a plus because it’s with real life situations.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1539,"My main goal is to become a great physical therapist. This class is helping achieve that goal in many ways. In this class I am exercising discipline and self-regulated learning. The material I learn here, such as force and motion are concepts that I will use in my future career as a physical therapist. I am taking the information I am learning here and absorbing it so that I can utilize and apply concepts and relations to not only my career, but also my everyday life. This class demands my discipline and full attention at every session. It is also asking that I participate in learning physics outside of the designated class time by reading my textbook. This class is also supporting me in become a great student and in turn a great teacher in the future to my clients. This class is helping me achieve my goal by making me exercise my skills, such as discipline , and also by feeding me ways of visualizing and working out concepts of physics important to my life and career."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1541,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""     My goals are to be able to finish college. My major ri ght now is Psychology. I hope to become a  therapist or a social worker. I want to get my master’s right after my bachelor’s, so I can be more  educated in my field . Right now, I work at a preschool, and it is giving me more insight on what  exactly I want to do. I find my job fun, but also draining at times. It’s helping me understand  what I really want to do in life. I find that I do enjoy educating young kids, but a whole group  setting isn’t for me. I find m yself getting stuck and not knowing what to do in certain situations.  This class isn’t helping me achieve my goals. The teacher isn’t present in my learning, and t his a  “do it yourself” kind of thing. Which is fine, but at times it becomes overwhelming/challenging/"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1554,"What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals? An academic goal I have for this semester is to extend my knowledge of physics. A personal goal I have is to successfully be able to time manage. This class will help me achieve my academic goal because this is a physics lab class. In addition to learning different concepts of physics, we are applying our knowledge and skills in the lab when we are doing experiments. Although we are not in person, our lab assignments are still very effective because it allows us to apply physics concepts hands-on and solving problems also allows us to analyze and think effectively. This class will help me achieve my personal goal of time management because this is one of my only classes that I have synchronous meetings. It’s easier for me to schedule a time to complete my lab assignments and because I will feel very productive, it will help me finish my other assignments. This will allow me to manage my time more effectively, instead of procrastinating."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1545,"My main goal is to pass with an A. I think that this is achievable and the class is structured well to help me succeed and I am very grateful for this. Physics is unrelated to my major so the things I learn here are purely for my personal benefit. I think physics in general is a good subject to be knowledgeable about. I’m considering a career as a pilot after college so this is all very useful information to me in particular . Additionally , it seems apparent to me that the universe operates with similar patterns across all scales and learning how it works scientifically helps with personal development and critical thinking to some degree."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1557,"Reflection My goals are to catch up in the class. It's been hard to be motivated and stay on track since I’m just coming back from a trip from england. My goal is to do well and get a better understanding of physics. I believe this class is helping me with understanding my physics class. But my biggest issue is staying on track. I've had issues with this, and it’s really hard because it’s a lot of work to get caught up on. Something I wanna learn is more motion with exercise. My major is kinesiology so this would be a very interesting thing to do. I wanna learn more about working out and exercise, and I’m not sure if physics will be the thing to directly teach me but it’s a stepping stone I’m excited about. It’s also a general requirement and I really wanna do well in it! So I appreciate the time you’re putting to help us learn."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1553,"My goals aren't connected to this class as I am not majoring in Physics or any related field; I am taking this to fulfill a GE. However, Physics can be a useful subject, and it can relate to my larger life goals by providing critical thinking skills as well as a questioning mindset to learn how the world works. One of my goals has always been to learn how to make things, as well as figure out how and why they work, and physics allows me to quantify that mindset and put it into words for further evaluation."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1537,"My goal at this moment is to graduate by next fall, so in one year . I will be graduating with a bachelor's degree in Kinesiology . After I graduate I want to finish some extra classes for pre-med because I will also be trying to get into medical school in the near future. In the meantime I will be working in the medical field and gaining experience and knowledge. While I'm gaining experience I will also be trying to save up some money for medical school and saving up to get another bachelor ’s degree in political science as well. These are my current goals at the moment, but I am more focused on graduating on time and the rest will follow . This class is helping me achieve these goals because it’ s bringing me one step closer to finishing my degree and one step closer to finishing my pre-med prerequisites in the physics department. This class is setting me up for future success in my future physics classes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1549,"Munazza Shaikh PHYS 102-02 Week 5 - 9/26/2021  					         Reflection #2  One of my biggest goals at the moment is to graduate college. School has always been very hard for me since I was a child and I never thought I would make it this far. Some days I still can’t see the finish line for myself but I know I have to stay strong and keep faith in myself. This class is helping to achieve this goal by giving me the course credit that I need to obtain my degree. It is also helping me gain critical thinking skills, and over all become a better, more knowledgeable student. Another one of my goals is to be financially stable. I am working towards this by working 2 jobs, saving money however I can, and of course attending school so that I can build a career and land a higher paying job."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1538,"Going to university with the goal of achieving a step up to a higher level, going to university is learning the necessary knowledge and skills. The university environment is an open environment where I can freely exchange and make friends, improve their communication skills, and help them become more confident. Going to university to have a stable job in the future, with a good income, improve each person's cultural, economic, spiritual life. The goal of going to college is to affirm myself self-worth. You will understand who you are, what you need, what you want and how suitable for the industry. The investment in study has never been a mistake, going to college is not only about making a lot of money in the future, but moreover, it also helps you to have many social relationships and a safe foothold if you are really capable. And this class is one of my courses I need to finish get my degree. although it does not directly add value to my future work. but it brings knowledge in my daily life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1544,"I have several goals for this class. One of my goals is to actually learn physics instead of just trying to remember what is taught. There have been plenty of times where I would take a class and not actually process the information. I usually just remember the work for the satisfaction of passing the class. However , I do not want that for myself this year because I am actually learning new work that regards my major , kinesiology . This class is helping me reach that goal by weekly learning new things and processing new knowledge about physics. Another goal is for me to become what I want to be, a physical therapist. This class is helping me reach that goal by getting me prepared for things I need to know about my career . Physics lab is also helping me by teaching me everything I need to know , so I can pass this class with a good grade."
