The values of my family have helped me through college. I have had my cousins who are older then me help me with my classes because I have been having difficulty in them. I got a hold of them because I know that they know what im studying and they love helping me out so I can learn from a different person. My parents have helped me through college I was gonna go to a 4 year college after high school but I decided right before applying that I was going to stay home because I knew I was going to get anxiety moving away so I then went to a 2 year and stayed at home and had my parents help and saved money to go to a four year. Now im at a 4year stilling living at home just because of some family things that happened. The values that my family have showed me I have caught on and now I follow there values. There are so many values that I have used that my family has taught me about. I love how everyone in my family has there own values and shows them to me so then I have a mixture of values since im one of the youngest in the family."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1552,"My parents have supported me throughout the semester. They tell me that everything will be alright when I’m stressed out from school. Having this type of support makes a person feel better. Knowing that there are people around you who agree with your decisions and are willing to help support you along the way can take oﬀ a lot of stress you put upon yourself. They believe in my abilities of working hard in school and giving it my best opportunity every time, even if some of those opportunities result in failure. Learning from your mistakes is important as it helps you grow and mature and allows you to not make the same mistakes in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1540,". With me being in school I’ve learned to value family more. At this age we’re constantly around people who don’ t have our best interest, which can be one draining if you're always around them. Not saying it’ s bad to have a good community of friends around but family will always have your back. One thing I’ve also noticed is that families will tell you what they want you to do in order to be successful, which can also be detrimental. This can af fect one's thoughts of self into having low confidence when it comes to pursuing whatever it is they desire because of someone else’s thoughts. I’d say this has happened to me as well. I only went to college because growing up that all I’ve been taught to be successful, while that is not true. I have many things I want to accomplish that don’ t even involve my major in kinesiology . If I had the chance to go four years back, I would have chosen to not attend college."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1557,"I think a lot of my choices on college came through my own decisions, and being told what to look for. I never really had a role model to follow, so I had to figure out my passions. And at the moment I thought I wanted to explore outside of school, because I was tired of the tiring traffic in Los Angeles, and wanted to explore a city I knew I could give a new try. I went to different lengths to figure out what was the perfect fit for me, and I ended up with San Francisco State University. All my decisions were my choice, but my mom helped support my decision on wanting to become independent fully. Now I’m studying Kinesiology, hoping to obtain my degree in physical therapy, and become a physical therapist or a chiropractor for a big part of my life after college."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1539,"My famil y, as well a s the values of  my community have he lped me throughout  my college career in  numerous ways. Without the support of my family or community, coll ege would be  more difficult than it  is now. M y family inspires me and motivations me to become a better person and student and through  higher education, this is possible. My community holds me acco untable and ho lds high expectations for  me as we ll as my family. My community cheers me on when things get rough or wh en I have low energy.  My family and my community are all counting on me and I will not let them down. My famil y has taught  me to give each obstacle  or task set onto me my ma ximum effort and maxi mum impo rtance. I have  learned through the experiences  of my family and community that higher education is a better ro ute  than more  common routes.  They taught me that if I work hard, keep my nose down, and follow through  on the goals I have set for myself  then I am able to achieve  great thin gs."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1537,Jose Motolinia Reflection 4 Phys 102 I come from an immigrant family so the highest education my parents attended was up to high school level. This was very hard for my siblings and I because our parents didn’ t really understand the struggles of getting into and attending college. They couldn’ t really help us navigate through college because they didn’ t attend college themselves. The only way they could help us is to support us financially if needed and emotionally be there for us. They did help me however understand that their way of helping us was giving us money if we ever needed it for education only . In this way it has helped with my first semester of college because it was very expensive and I would not be able to pay everything on my own. So for that I am very thankful and extremely lucky in that aspect that my parents help me with my education. Not a lot of people are on the same boat so I do not take it for granted and work hard to make it worth it in the end.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1549,"Munazza Shaikh PHYS 102.01 Week 9: Buoyancy  					Reflection #4  ""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""  The values of my family helped me navigate through college because my parents always made it known to my siblings and I how important it was to attend and obtain a degree. They never had the chance to attend and they never forced it upon us either, but they are the most important people in my life and I know how much it would mean to them if I graduated. This alone has helped me through all my hardships when classes began to feel impossible, when the stress felt unbearable, and when I ultimately just felt like giving up and dropping out. My family is my “why” and I make sure to remind myself of this every day."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1543,"Jessica   J   Cuevas    Week   10    Reflection   4         ""How   have   the   values   of   my   community   or   my   family   (of   origin   or   of   choice)   helped   me    navigate   through   college?""      My   close   family   has   always   been   very   supportive   and   has   always   put   family   first.   Over   the   past    two   years,   my   family   has   been   going   through   many   different   changes   which   has   definitely   been    hard   and   distracted   me   from   school.   I   have   also   been   the   one   receiving   the   support   from   my    mother   but   these   years   it   has   been   the   other   way   around   as   we   go   through   family   issues.   I   believe    that   having   a   good   support   system   makes   a   student   more   confident   in   succeeding.   I   feel   like   a    support   system   overall   makes   a   person   happier   causing   unnecessary   stress.   Another   value   that    has   helped   me   in   school   is   the   value   of   receiving   an   education   and   being   able   to   take   advantage   of   opportunities.   This   has   to   help   me   in   my   college   journey   because   I   have   been   more   open   to    asking   for   help   but   the   more   I   do   the   more   I   realize   that   the   problem   is   from   deep   down.   The    thing   is   I   haven’ t   gotten   comfortable   to   be   able   to   speak   about   the   problem   that   I   myself   see    affect   my   school   work.   It’s   just   so   hard   but   can’t   wait   until   the   moment   passes.       Word   Count   217"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1547,Neelu Mirkhani Phys 102-02 Reflection #4 Practicing values of humility and vigilance have helped me navigate college because they have afforded me the self-disciple to continuously strive without becoming disenchanted.

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1551,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origins or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""  	 My parents were never hands on with my education, speciﬁcally guiding me through the process growing up. There were never hands on with any of school work, and trusts us to ﬁgure it out. However, I guess a few values my parents told me is to always do my best in school and to keep trying no matter what.  I guess these values helped navigate me through college because despite how life gets in the way, such as the pandemic for example, I always tried to do my best no matter the circumstances and persevere through it. I could've quit going to college, but stayed because I know the importance of having a degree to move up in the world, and work in the career ﬁeld that you are interested."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1542,"Reflection #4 From my family the values that I have been taught and drew from are to be diligent, hard-working, and resource. The diligence has helped me navigate throughout the semester greatly because when I am met with a task that is assign from class, I am able handle and complete in a timely manner. Being hard-working and resourceful has helped me overcome obstacles and challenges that I have encountered in the past. When I am dealt with an issue, I seek out many ways to help me overcome it. The value of working hard has help me preserve through tough times and has taught me not to give up even though when I find it struggling to handle different tasks given to me. Whether it may be asking for help from my peers or from tutors or teachers. Being able to find ways to seek out answers goes along way for me. I think overall with those three values that I have practiced and maintain will help me succeed as I progress throughout my time as a student."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1538,"In times of the current Covid -19 pandemic, it is very important to stay in touch and regularly  update your situation with your loved ones back home. This will help your family feel secure  even when you are halfway around the world, and it is also a great s ource of spiritual  encouragement to help you get through this difficult time of isolation.  Busy study abroad life,  busy with schoolwork or exams can make you forget to keep in touch with your loved ones in  Vietnam. The best way to stay connected with my fam ily is to schedule a weekly phone call with  my family to chat and update myself. I put them on my to -do list for the day, or for the week to  make sure you always have time for your family and friends, wherever you are.   Sharing and updating information and images about my daily life on social networks such as  Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram will  help my relatives and friends ""see"" me every day,  understand more about me. my life in a faraway place as well as being willing to share when I  am in trouble. My relatives also feel much more secure if they know that I am very optimistic,  happy and have a  positive life in a foreign land. Sometimes, a ""like"" on Facebook or a gentle  encouraging comment from friends and relatives will also help me feel warm and have more  motivation for the upcoming journey."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1541,"How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through  college?""     As I go through college it’s important to rem ember my family values. With this I’m able to stay  true to myself  and not forget where I came from. By keeping these ideals close I can maintain  my morals and focus on my academics.

You  shouldn’t pre -judge anyone because everyone comes into college with their own set of  problems. You shouldn’t make anyone’s life harder. Always suggesting friendships because  college can be difficult for some. Especially those who have social anxiety. When you  do this  you can not only make lifelong friends, but also support others while forming relationships."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1548,"I am happy to be able to say I have a really solid community around me. They support and believe in me alot. Coming into college I had already had three of my older siblings go to college, so I was able to ask a lot of questions about classes, teachers, and dorming. That made me feel more comfortable and confident going to college. When I had any issues my mom would always be there to help me navigate through them. Even when I was just feeling overwhelmed or like I needed some clarity they had no problem providing that. The biggest thing I like is that I can relate to them alot about college issues and they always keep it real with me. So the values of just always staying true to yourself, showing respect to everyone, and always looking at the bright side in situations are just some of the values that have really helped me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1546,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" Growing up in Mexico, being respectful, faithful and honest were probably the biggest values that I was taught. Being respectful towards other but specially older people was very important and showed the type of education a kid had at home. Mexicans, but my family in particular, is very religious. So giving thanks to god and asking him to help us do good was also very implemented within my community and family. These values now help me to stay true to myself while in college, but also help me push through. When things get rough I know that having faith that things will get better with time helps me push through. Being respectful towards others beliefs, ideas, and concepts is a basic part of being an adult and having to interact with new people. Having these values allow me to become the person I want to be and to always continue to do good."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1544,"My community and family values have helped me throughout college due to the support they have provided for me since the first day I started freshman semester . There have been times when I wanted to give up on school; however , my family has always been there to push me and guide me in the right direction. I feel as though while being in college, it is extremely important to have a support system. Even if sometimes I may not want to admit it, I am grateful for the support I receive. Especially since I am the first out of my family to go to college. In my freshman year of college, I did not know what to expect because I had nobody to guide me or inform me on what to expect. Since I am now in my junior year going into senior year, I hope to get the same support I have been getting to complete my college experience successfully ."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1554,"How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college? My parents are firm believers that having a good education will lead to success in career. College has always been important to my family. My parents were not able to achieve higher education so they expect my siblings and I to graduate college and to pursue a career that will guarantee us happiness and wealth. With this value in mind, I’m trying my best to intake my education to the best of my ability to ensure that things that I’ve learned are later useful in my career path and even in my everyday life. Although, I am not exactly sure what I want to do in my life, my major which is Business Marketing, is a guidance to what I could potentially be interested in. Another value my family holds, especially my siblings, is to enjoy my time in college while I can. In this past year or so, I’ve learned that anything can happen that could interfere with our college experience. Speaking from how my senior year of high school was cut short, I wish I would’ve done more to really enjoy high school. Once I’m able to go back on campus I will definitely take advantage of the resources provided to me in terms of academically and socially."

First, they actively encouraged me to pursue further education after high school and started to point to various college degrees that I could enjoy. Then, once I found a degree that I was interested in pursuing (Industrial Design) they showed monetary support so that I would be able to continue with my plans without worrying about the financial obligations of it. Finally, they also provide emotional support and helpful advice that I can look to whenever I am in need. My family has been a huge support on not only getting me in college, but also on making sure that I am having a good time here, and I know they will continue to support me beyond college as well. Community is important as well, with the friends that I have met providing me the same support that I show them."
