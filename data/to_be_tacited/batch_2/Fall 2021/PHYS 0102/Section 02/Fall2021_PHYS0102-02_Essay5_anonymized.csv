2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1554,"What resources do I have to support me? When I think of resources I like to think of something or someone that could help me and that I could benefit from. Also, when I think of resources I think of what could help me, not only academically , but financially , physically , and mentally . In terms of the resources that I have academically , I know that I have academic counselors that I can speak to if I need any help with choosing classes or navigating through my major . Thus far , I have been able to speak to a couple of counselors because I was having trouble with deciding what classes would be best for me to take with my major . As an Asian American, it’ s important for me to find resources to help me navigate through college as well with the help of Asian American advisors. ASPIRE is another resource that I have access to. In terms of resources for my well-being, I would consider my friends and family to be a resource. Generally I don’ t think other people would consider their friends and family as a resource but I do because most of them have experienced the same things I have and it’ s nice to lean on them for advice."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1537,The resources I have for my classes are professors and other classmates. If I ever have questions or concerns I can reach out to either my professor or a classmate. Usually I go talk to a professor for specific questions regarding the class. But for general stuf f like hw problems or assignments I can reach out to a classmate and discuss. I also have advisors for resources regarding graduation and my semester schedule. I can also use the student center online and check out information there as well. The student center is a great resource to check on updates on holds and your road map. For emotional support or any support in general I have my parents and friends I can ask for help. Although I live alone here and they all live far away I can still call or video chat if I need to. I usually call my parents every other week to check in and let them know how things are going. These are the resources I use the most during my time here.

Taking care of myself is the first step I need to take when reaching a gym Most of the universities in the US have gyms for students and teachers to come to practice. This is a very useful resource that the school has dedicated. for international students, so take advantage of it! Friend relationships: maintaining relationships with friends in Vietnam as well as friends who are international students in other countries because they will be a great source of encouragement while I lack love in the distance.  Education: Studying in the US offers a variety of options for students from academic programs to extracurricular activities such as culture and sports.

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1557,"What resources do I have to support me?""  I don’t necessarily have many resources to support me, since I travel very much. I try to get a tutoring session for classes I don’t understand, and I try to catch up on this one since I’m behind. COVID has severely impacted my way of learning, and education. I don’t think many people have much resources to help them as well, it becomes a very tough scenario not having zoom classes, to learn from the teacher manually. I know there’s a zoom online, but I seem to have trouble with it. And sometimes the zoom clashes with other class times, so I have to figure out other things too. I wish I did have more resources, but the ones I have besides tutoring are just notebooks, and reading textbooks to help me get an idea of the class."

I have utilized my major advisor and my ge neral advisor to help me  make sure my classes are in order and I am on the right track to get where I need to go. I also was  introduced to extracurricula r resour ces by my advisors . I signed up for a group outsid e of school who  specializes in hel ping physical therapy stude nts like myse lf. This has been helpful because  It showed me  what it takes to be in the career,  I want to be in."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1542,"Reflection #5 The resources available that I have to support me are my friends, family, and my communities I am apart of. For my family and friends are there to support me morally and emotionally. Whenever I am struggling or going through tough days, I can come for them to talk to too as a way to relieve stress and to have their company. I think it is important to have people to communicate your thoughts and feelings too as when they get bottled up, it can be unhealthy mentally. For my communities like the social and school clubs can also be supportive because I am in the environment with other people who are in a similar situation like me. I can turn to them for help if I find it necessary to do so. I also think that the internet can be a great resource to find support as well. There are online communities and an abundance of information that can be learned as a way to find support for oneself. With those in mind, I am able to find a good amount of support when I need it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1551,"Reﬂection #5 “What resources do I have to support me?” In terms of school, there are many resources out there can that can support me in diﬀerent aspects. If there are any classes that I may be struggling, I can always stop by student resources like tutoring and academic support center to help get understanding diﬀerent subjects that I may need for academic success in this semester or upcoming semesters along the way. If there any need for support with my potential career or struggling with ﬁguring things out, I can always reach out with a counselor to help guide me and give me some sort of direction. This is just another resource that I can take advantage for more academic success as well as future career ﬁeld success. Outside of school, I have family or friends that are there to support me in some form of way, by just being there and able to talk to them if needed. I usually talk to my older brother about school and my courses, and he would also give me some advice because he also went to SF State and graduated years ago."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1544,"I have different resources to support me when going through different situations. As for school, the resources that support me are my professors, my family, and more importantly my counselors. My counselor is most significant because she guides me and helps me the most. She points me in the direction of opportunities that will help me in the future, and I am forever grateful for that. Another resource for a different situation will be my mental health. My mental health is something I take seriously because nowadays it is extremely easy to lose your mind. The resource that I use for my mental health is journaling, going to the beach, and most importantly praying. I understand lots of people are not big on religion, but I feel as though prayer opens plenty of doors. I also added the beach into the equation because when I am at the beach, the sound of the wind and water waves clears my thoughts. And honestly who doesn’t want peace of mind!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1546,"""What resources do I have to support me?"" Academically there are so many different services at school that give us help in so many aspects. Whether you need tutoring, financial help, or emotional support. Personally, the support that I always have had is from my family and close friends. They have listened to me and have given me advice in my worst moments. They are a big encouragement also to do better and want more for myself. Although, even with all the support in the world it all comes down to ourselves and the choices we make. When I was in a bad state of mind a couple years back, having so many changes around me I felt alone. I knew I had people that cared about me and a ton in fact, but being sad and alone made me feel like I had no one. Sometimes we have to find the balance between what we feel and what is actually happening. So the most important resource I have to support me is myself. If I don’t push myself and put myself in uncomfortable situations, then the support from the people around me means absolutely nothing."

I have a couple resources to support me when I am in physical, mental, financial, or academic need. Two resources these all have in common are the internet and my family. Any time I am feeling physical or emotional pain, I can always use the internet to search any possible solutions for myself. It has helped through so many situations in life whether it be dealing with something like exercises to help with my back pain or with my personal life such as how to handle certain social situations. When it comes to my mental health, I know our school has a wellness center that offers emotional support, one of my biggest resources is my family. I have been through a lot with my mental health and have tried so many different resources – medication, therapy, etc. but the only thing that helped me truly heal was my family. When it comes to my financial support, I know there are many resources within our city and school that provide financial aid when it comes to food, housing, and tuition (CalFresh, Medicaid, COVID19 Rent Relief, & many other programs). Lastly, when I am struggling academically, again the internet of course is one of my biggest resources as it has almost all the answers to any question I may have but I know our school also has so many different options for tutoring and our professors are also one of our best resources for help as well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1540,"There are so many dif ferent resources San Francisco State has to of fer their students. Coming into SFSU as a freshman I was in the metro program for first and second year students. This program helped with tutoring, class scheduling and overall counseling throughout my years in college. It's more specialized for minority students, however everyone is welcome. Another really useful resource is the Library and their online search engine. Over the years this resource has been really useful while writing my research papers. They of fer peer reviewed papers and many others to help backup a strong thesis. The school of fers so many other in person as well as online tutoring services like MARC all for free with being enrolled to the school.

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1552,"The resources that I have to support me along my studies are the professors, textbooks, labs, and material being used in the class. These can all assist me in continuing to learn because I can ask my professors questions if I am not sure of something and need it to be cleared up. Textbooks can be references for material that is unclear or needs more information to understand the topic. Labs are being able to practice these potential events that can occur in real life. Material from the class can be used to refresh my memory and keep things fresh."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1548,"I do not have a lot of resources to support me, but the ones that I do have are supercritical and special. My main resource I have is my blood cousin, but he is more like my best friend, my brother. He supports me in everything that I do. From reposting my content. To being there for me when I am having a bad day. He does an amazing job at being there for everything, personal and professional. My other resource is my parents. They do not ask me too many questions, but I know I am making them proud. When I have questions they are always honest with me. And for me honesty is huge because I need to hear the truth so I know how to get better. Those are my resources for support and what makes them special is that they do not judge me ever. No matter if I am right or wrong."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1553,"Reflection #5: What resources do I have to support me? As a student, I feel like it can often be easy to forget the large expanse of support that is available whenever it is that you need it. The first resource that comes to my mind is my family, who have always been supportive of me. Whenever I have a question, a problem, or just need someone to talk to, they are always there to support me. There are other resources closer to campus as well which may be useful for more specific questions, especially ones that are school related. There have been many professors that give highly valuable feedback and support, offering encouragement as well as a good environment to learn. I have also developed friendships with some professors as well as classmates that will continue to support me well past my time in college, just like my family."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1543,"Jessica   Julian   Cuevas    Lab   Reflection   5    ""What   resources   do   I   have   to   support   me?       I   believe   that   there   are   many   resources   out   there   for   college   students   both   on-campus   and    off-campus.   It   is   a   bit   difficult   to   find   the   resources   that   will   help   you   out   especially   when   one    is   doing   classes   online.   Throughout   high   school,   I   would   take   advantage   of   the   programs    that   would   teach   me   about   the   resource   that   was   available   to   me.   While   in   college   I   am    using   the   resources   of   scholarships   and   financial   aid.   Once   I   am   on   campus   I   hope   to   be    able   to   be   a   part   of   the   tutoring   program   on   campus.   I   believe   that   this   will   definitely   help   me    out   with   my   grades   and   give   me   relief   knowing   that   there   are   people   there   to   help   me.   One    other   major   resource   is   the   ability   to   have   an   adviser   that   guides   you   into   your   academic    success.   This   becomes   very   helpful   because   they   have   connections   that   they   are   glad   to    share   with   you   which   leads   to   other   resources   and   opportunities."
