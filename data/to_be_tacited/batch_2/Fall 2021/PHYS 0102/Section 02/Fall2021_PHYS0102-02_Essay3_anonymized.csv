2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1539,"When life gets hard, I first try to take a step back and realize that there is something off about the way my day is going. I then try to step back even further by taking a break from my daily tasks if possible and really try and see if there are any things that I am doing wrong. If not, I just realize that sometimes things are not going to run smoothly. I try to then set time aside for myself to relax and rest, whenever possible. I understand sometimes life is unfair and unpredictable, but I also understand that sometimes life is perfect and brings in lots of beauty. I tell myself that once these times of unease and restlessness pass, that life will continue to be beautiful and run smoothly again, it is only a short time in this life that we will experience the unease when compared to our lives as a whole. I small bad patch should not ruin the whole field of flowers."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1544,"When life gets challenging, I try my hardest not to shut down and just stop. For instance, as of right now , this school stuf f has been extremely dif ficult. I am taking two biologies classes, two physics classes, and two kinesiology classes. I sort of knew what I signed up for , but the work is piling up like crazy . Sometimes I feel as though I just want to say for get it and not complete the work. However , that is not going to get me anywhere. I am just going to end up failing and upsetting myself much more. It is essential not to let your stubbornness get in the way . Therefore, I try my hardest to do assignments even if it is late. I try my hardest to manage my time suf ficiently .  I am trying this new strategy as to where I complete the work given to me the day it is assigned. Life will always come with a challenge, but I will never give up. Some of the most successful people in the world went through challenges; do you think they ever gave up? Life is not peaches and cream; therefore, be prepared to go through ups and downs, and be ready to overcome the tough times."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1556,"Reflection #3 ""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" What do I do when life gets challenging? Most of the time I strive to keep on pushing to get what I want. I may complain and groan about the small things that makes life harder , but I will usually get over the complaining and get motivated to complete my tasks for the day/week. When life gets really tough and challenging, I try to look for help from others. I usually don't like to ask for help, but when I cant find a resolution to something, I’ll ask for advice from my friends and family . It is hard for me to ask for help because I want to figure problems out by myself. I don’ t expect other to help all of the time, so I will help myself and others when they need it. In general, I will find a solution to my challenges and problems in life. I will not allow for a single setback to ruin my life and the potential success I have for myself."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1552,"What I get when life gets challenging is motivation to try to do my best. Even if I don’t think I will succeed, I believe that if I give my best eﬀort and be able to learn from what I got right and what I did wrong, it will help me in the future. When I might encounter a similar situation, I will know how to face that challenge and have a better thought process to help me solve the issue. If the problem is new, it is a good challenge to give it your best and try to learn from it. I won’t ever give up if something gets tough. I will always try my hardest, and give my best eﬀort until I believe that I gave it my best eﬀort."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1550,"Anna Brody  Prompt: ""What do I do when life gets challenging?""  	When life gets challenging I just stop whatever im doing and breath. I have recently had a challenging time because my grandpa has passed away at the end of April and up until now I have finally let go of looking at pictures of me and him and remebering all the trips we have done together. With school during that time it was pretty hard for me and going to a 4 year made my life challenging again because he always wanted me to go to SFSU and he was never here to see me move on and another thing is he was a doctor and I never wanted to be a doctor so I thought of something else he would like and I decided to go into Kinesiology. With all that being said I have been catching up on all my homework and notes and taking the time out of my day to study. Another thing I do when life gets challeneging is I just stop what im doing and watch tv or a movie or lay down and close my eyes and litsen to music."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1549,"Munazza Shaikh PHYS 101.02 10/06/2021 Week 7: Reflection 3  When life gets challenging, I make time for myself to think and organize my thoughts in a way so that I am not overwhelmed. I categorize all my problems into 2 sections – things I can control and things I cannot control. From there, I start taking action and coming up with ways I can resolve or change my situation. After doing so, I feel more at ease as I no longer put any unnecessary energy towards things I cannot control and can now free up space in my head to do something productive that will actually help me get me through whatever it is I am going through."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1540,"Honestly who knew life would be the way it is, at such a young age. Who knew you’d have to work someday for the rest of your life in order to just live under comfort or even struggle. I grew up sheltered my whole life with my parents not talking to me about real world issues at a young age. Now being 21 it feels as if 30 things are being thrown at me all at once and I have to figure out how to catch everything with only 2 hands. Trying to balance school, dif ferent jobs in between school, managing to being independent and not rely on parents, buying my own car , mom moving states for marriage and my own relationship problems has a lar ge ef fect on my wellbeing but one thing that always helps has been my faith in God. I’ve always been a believer of God growing up, but now with my adult experience I’m seeing that he’ s always there building me through life with every situation. I'd always have a feeling about something and not really trust my intuition, then coming to find out the situation was really what it seemed. The past 4 months have been a lot for me and with God's strength I’m a stronger person who continues to get stronger because of him."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1542,"Reflection #3 When things in life gets challenging and stressful, I usually take some time think about what is causing this and then I begin to think about solutions on how to deal with it. For example, if something is family related and that gets involved with my school or work life, I usually would let my professors and other people that I close to what I am dealing with. I think the best solution for me when dealing with stress is to be communicative and no being afraid to ask for help, especially when I feel like I need to. Being communicative to those close to me helps me be able to talk about the issues so they do not get built up emotionally inside and to let the people I know what is going on so that have content. It also helps me relieve stress because I am interacting with others, and it can help put me in a good and positive mindset because I know that I have people who will listen and help me when in need."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1537,"When life gets challenging for me I like to slow down for a little bit and take time to think. Whatever it might be that I’m going through I like to work out because usually after I go to the gym I feel a lot better . It allows me to clear my mind and escape momentarily and I usually find that I have a clear head right after . I can think clearer and come up with solutions on how to fix my current problems whatever they might be. I also like to self-reflect and ask myself why I am here and doing what I’m doing. It usually sparks something within me and keeps me going knowing that I can’ t give up on anything no matter how challenging it might be. I like to prove to myself that I can accomplish whatever comes my way . Lastly , if I need advice I usually talk to friends. I find that hearing what close friends have to say can help me choose a better course of action on how to deal with my challenge ahead."

Physics   Lab    Reflection   3       When   life   gets   challenging   I   do   my   best   to   stay   positive   but   sometimes   it   gets   to   you   no    matter   how   one   tries   it   not   to.   These   past   two   years   have   been   the   most   difficult   years   of   my   life.    From   starting   college   during   the   pandemic   to   there   being   a   lot   of   change   in   my   household.   This    has   made   it   difficult   for   me   to   perform   my   best   in   school.   There   was   a   point   where   I   had   to   help    my   family   financially   by   picking   up   two   jobs   but   this   led   to   my   grades   dropping   and   put   me   at    risk   of   not   being   able   to   achieve   my   goal   of   graduating   college.   My   life   can   definitely   be    challenging   but   happy   as   well.   There   are   many   challenges   that   I   have   come   across   that   have    shaped   me   into   the   individual   I   am.   Coming   from   a   Hispanic   background   I   am   expected   to   fill    the   role   of   older   sister   meaning   looking   after   the   house   and   siblings.   This   role   definitely   comes    with   stress,   pros,   and   cons."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1541,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?""     when life gets challenging,  I like to take small breaks from whatever is stressing me out. For  example, when I’m stuck at a point in my life I like to do things that I actually enjoy. I like to go  on hikes with my friends or just enjoy my own company. In my free time I like to paint or play  mario kart by myself. I also like to remind myself that not everything is a major inconvenience,   and it can  also be seen as something that can improve my overall lifestyle. Sometimes you need  a reminder that it’s okay to take time for yourself. I take these small breaks to remind myself  the purpose for everything I do, and to also have reality checks."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1546,"What do I do when life gets challenging? I’ve encountered different challenges throughout my whole life, in all sorts of aspects. Whether it is academic, economic, or personal problems, there has always been something difficult. I handle each situation differently, but for all of them I try to take a minute and relax before I start to stress and overthink about how I am going to solve the problem, if there is a solution, or how I am going to get past it. Most of the time asking for help from other people around me seems to be useful in getting through the challenge. Although it also has to come from myself to be able to figure out what I need to do to take on that challenge. For example, I went to high school in Mexico and my initial thoughts when coming to college here were that I was not going to be able to do it. There were so many extra requirements and I was also very misinformed. I asked the only cousin I had that had been to college for help and he was able to get me connected with the right people to learn more. Community college was my best bet and further on I was able to transfer which is how I am at San Francisco State now. Challenges are very hard to overcome and puts us in uncomfortable situations, but they also help us grow as a person and have more critical thinking skills."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1548,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" When life gets challenging I sometimes see myself perform my best. I really try to changemy perspective on every situation. I make a choice to view challenges as oppor tunities for me tosee what I can do when my back is against the wall. I constantly reassure myself that I am stillhere and that no matter the situation I am still who I am. One of the biggest realization I makeevery time things get hard is to only focus on the things you ha ve control over. I do not  havecontrol over externals, only the internal aspects. I just try to master my mindset throughout  thewhole thing. Not accept it, but make the most of it and w ork with it. I am forever fortunate, nomatter how unfortunate the situation may seem. Usually the thing that is standing in the way isthe way. Mastering the mind is what I do when life gets challenging."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1547,"Neelufar Mirkhani 21 October 2021 PHYS 102-02 ""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" I try to take responsibility for the challenges that might be holding me back, and rise to the occasion. In this way , I become more resilient instead of of floading my grievances and struggles onto others. However , I think it takes a tremendous amount of will to achieve this. Remaining vigilant and consistent is the key ."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1538,"Everyone has times when they are stuck and bored with their current life. Everyone has to go through a lot of emotions in life. There will be times when people are extremely happy, so happy that they feel like they are walking on clouds, and of course, there are also times when they are sad and desperate as if the ground under their feet is collapsing. As an international student, these seem to happen more often. It is very stressful to live away from family in a faraway home country. take care of myself, pressure with study and work. But to overcome those difficulties and challenges, I always try to have positive thoughts so that I don't fall to the bottom of the abyss. Regulate my emotions, if I can't control my emotions, I can cause foolish actions. Also Sharing stories with friends and advisors is a good way that I sometimes use.    	"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1557,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?""    Something that’s extremely interesting is the way I take on my own challenges. I challenge it, depending on what the situation is. This year has been the hardest for me to figure out what I want to do for college. I don’t see myself going to San Francisco State for much longer, it’s a school I’ve given a chance to, but I don’t see myself passionate about staying in the city. This is a common occurrence I tend to have with situations I’m not sure of. A lot of the time I used to freak out about my situations, thinking life is over. But now I start to take it easy, give it an hour and take deep breaths, then I start to come up with solutions. Life isn’t over even if you’re challegened, you have to learn to get over those obstacles, and I start taking them head-on, if I have too."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1553,"When things get challenging, I feel like there usually isn’t anything that I can do in the moment. Usually these are time constrained situations or other moments where there is a lot of stress, and as such they don’t last long. Generally, my approach is to take a deep breath and move on to finish whatever needs to be finished. It is easy to get past these challenges as they never last long, generally only a few days. With that, it is easy to carry through the challenges to the other side, knowing that it will get easier."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1551,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?""  	 I think there are multiple ways to take on when life gets challenging. Sometimes you don't want to deal with these challenging moments or circumstances and just shut down, which can be unhealthy but once in awhile, I think it's okay to just stop everything and take a break from it all and be alone. But, it really depends on the circumstance. I think when things get tough and everything feels like life seems to be more of a control than you are, I think it's ﬁne to stop and take a step back and reevaluate what is happening, and what are the steps I can do to overcome this challenge, and lastly take it day by day and do your best and try."
