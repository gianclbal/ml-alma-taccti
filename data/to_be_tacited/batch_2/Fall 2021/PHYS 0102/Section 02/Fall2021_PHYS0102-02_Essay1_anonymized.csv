Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1537,"I am here because I want to learn more about physics and better understand the concepts behind them. I am also here because I need this class to be able to take an upper division physics class in the future. I am majoring in Kinesiology and doing pre-med so I need this class to advance and be able to take other classes that require this prerequisite course. I am also taking physics 101 combined with this lab to get the full experience and learn a lot more. I’m also here because I’m interested in learning how to apply these concepts to real world situations! So I’m hoping that by being here in this lab that will help me better apply these concepts in the real world. I also really like science in general and really like learning about dif ferent topics like biology , anatomy , chemistry , and physics. So I am here for these reasons and hoping for a good experience!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1538,"The first reason I'm here is to complete the college degree my parents wanted from me. As a foreign student, I was given a lot of priority by my family to study in the United States. The second reason is that I want to learn knowledge from the teachers and moreover, to share the culture with everyone in the school here."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1539,"I am here in this class because I need to fulfill my GE requirements. This in my last class in that category. I am here now because I transferred from a junior college to SFSU. My goal is to get my BA here in kinesiology. With that being said, I enjoy learning about physics. I think it is a fun and interesting subject that is seen in everyday life, such as driving and playing a sport. I am here because I need to pass certain requirement that will allow me to open doors for the future. I hope to become a great physical therapist and the education I receive here will help me not achieve that goal, but goals I may have in the future as well. I want to be able to help others and make a positive impact in their lives while also impacting mine in a good way as well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1540,"I am here with a purpose. I am here to find that purpose and continue to grow from it to help me learn. I was born in Los Angeles, Ca. And decided to go to the Bay Area for school being San Francisco State university . Though my major is kinesiology I’m still searching for my purpose in life. I wish it came easier but it’ s something I have to genuinely look for and not force at the same time. Something that comes to me naturally , something I will do without needing to get paid for . I’ve always enjoyed working out and working towards my health goals, maybe that’ s it. I’ve also always enjoyed modeling and being in front of the camera maybe that too. I’m not sure what I am here for , but everyday I continue to get some step closer to figuring that out. What I am doing here will come to me soon."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1541,"WHY AM I HERE?     I’m here to make a better life for myself. I want to be able to provide for my future family. I also want to  obtain my degree, so I can become a therapist. I’ve always wanted to help people, a nd I feel like I am a  good listener overall. I also want to open up my own practice."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1542,"Why am I here? The main reason I am here and enrolled is due to that I have to take a science class as a requirement for my major, which is kinesiology. I am also here because out of the many options provided as for a science class, topic of physics interests me the most of out the choices that I have. I additionally believe that when learning and understanding the basic foundations of physics can be applicable to many general things that may exist outside of my academic life. And I may find them useful in situations that I may not have thought of later down the line. Furthermore, I think physics can also improve my understanding of mathematics because it ties in with all the theories and the experiments we are doing, and this helps me practices the general understanding with it comes to a logical and methodical approaches to problem solving and organizing."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1543,"Jessica Julian Cuevas 09/08/21 Why I’m I here Over the summer I was thinking about what I had yet to take and saw that I needed a science class. Therefore I began to do my research on dif ferent science classes to find one that was interesting to me and I would take a lot of. I then came across a Conceptual Physics class that seemed interesting the way the professor described it. After enrolling in this class I decided that it would be fun to join a lab that will help me with the topics we discussed in class by viewing them from dif ferent perspectives in other work doing it as a group. So far , I really enjoy the class and feel like I would get a lot out of it. However , one thing that is challenging for me is where we turn in the work because when you click on the link it doesn’ t seem to let me publish it. I am looking forward to learning a lot of new things and the way it plays a role in the world around us. Thank you for giving us this assignment to check in can’ t for what this class brings throughout the semester ."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1544,"I am here in this class because it is a prerequisite for my major , kinesiology . I was told since I am taking physics 101 and 102, I am going to have to take physics again in graduate school. However , I do not want to take physics in graduate school; therefore, I am going to take physics 111 and 1 12 next semester . After this class, I want to be able to properly and transparently understand the importance of physics and how it works. Overall, I want to be prepared for physics 1 11 and 1 12. Aside from the prerequisites, I am also taking this class because I have never taken a physics class before. Therefore, this is my first class and I am excited to learn about how things work. Although, I am sad because we cannot experience the experiments in person. I still feel confident that I am going to enjoy learning dif ferent things about physics."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1545,"I am in this class mostly because it's a required course. That being said, I did choose physics over other courses that could fill the requirement because I believe it is good to have an understanding of the forces that the universe works on. Firstly I think having a general understanding of natural forces such as gravity has practical uses. Secondly it seems to me that things in the universe tend to work on similar principles across all scales and interpretations so having knowledge of the universe is useful to be generally centered."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1546,"Why am I here? Probably the question that I would ask myself first is how did I get here? That starts off with two Mexican parents coming to the US in order for their children to have a better life. They sacrificed leaving their family behind and coming here with no knowledge, just a dream. Then I was born along with two other boys years later. Growing up I saw the struggle my parents had first hand as I would have to translate for them from a very young age. Although language barriers weren't the only struggle they encountered, I quickly realized that if they had been through a lot and had made some many sacrifices for us the least I could do was to show them that it was worth it for their children. Getting and education and going to college is a lot of pressure but at the end of the day besides my parents I am here today taking this class for myself because I want to prove to myself that I am capable of so many things in life that will ultimately lead me to becoming happy and successful one way or another."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1547,"Neelu Mirkhani 8 September 2021 PHYS 01-02 Reflection #1 I am a senior here at San Francisco State University, majoring in Industrial Design with an emphasis in Graphic Design. I enrolled in this class due to Conceptual Physics being a General Education requirement of the Design department. I actually have already taken this class at a previous university (SJSU) two years ago but they did not require students to take the accompanying lab. This class has actually disrupted my schedule quite a bit as I am taking many advanced design classes as well. I spoke to my advisor about finding a way to waive the lab portion of this class but they unfortunately could not help me. I am somewhat nervous about having this three hour lab in my schedule, especially without the class. Hopefully I can find time to balance my major design classes with this lab and ultimately complete this class in a satisfactory fashion. Physics has never been my strong suit but I do enjoy how it manifests in nature as well as in the Auto-cad softwares I use to 3D model objects and products."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1548,"I am here in this class because it is a part of my General Education Requirements. Now, I know I could pick any form of science for my lab, but I decided to pick Physics because I like learning things when I can apply them to my real life on a consistent basis. In highschool I always loved to do Physics experiments in class and outside. So, I just knew it would be fun to go a little deeper in college. I am here at college to learn more about myself and network. I truly believe your network is your net worth. I have already been able to connect with a lot of awesome people already and I know a lot of those relationships I will have for a lifetime. I know for a fact that a person's story is big and you never know if their story can help you or even the other way around. So, that is why I am here to network, impact, and continuously learn things that I can connect with on a daily basis."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1550,Reﬂection 1: Why am I here?I am here to be able to learn more about Physics and be able to see physics in the real world. This is my second physics class I took it in High School and thought it was cool and wanted to learn more about physics in the real world. When I learned it In high school I didn’t really focus on the class and I'm excited to learn about it more. Also I have to take physics for my major which is Kinesiology. Learning from labs and physically doing things it would help with actually seeing the physics that is happening around us. I always thought that physics was cool and a fun science to learn about. Im excited to learn more about physics and how I can use it in the world when I travel or do anything there is always physics happening around me is what my dad always taught me.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1551,"I think the question ”Why am I here?” Can be answered in diﬀerent ways. From a biological aspect, the reason that I am here today is due to the fact that my parents had pro-created me. Another aspect you can look at this question can be answered or looked at from a philosophical view. The question itself is such a loaded question that sometimes I can’t even answer myself, or the answer changes as days or months or years passes by. I’m not religious or but I was born into a Catholic family and majority of my school years were spent in a christian or catholic school, so you can say that we are put on this earth because God made us into his own image and likeness and sent down to Earth to spread his faith through daily living, through our words and actions, and essentially being a good person overall. But in all honestly, I have no answer on why I’m here, but even if I don’t know or would ever receive an answer, I’m still going to be living my life to the best of my ability, to try and contribute to society, and overall try to be a better person and improve daily."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1552,"I am in this class because it is one of the final general education requirements I need to get done. I have previously taken conceptual physics but wasn’t able to take the lab along with the class. I think physics is in our every day lives and everything that we do requires physics. Being able to have a better understanding of physics in our every day lives will help me understand why things happen the way they do. Even though I am not a physics major, being able to relate how physics topics and the body works when exercising is something that I find interesting. Whether it is lifting weights or playing sports or running there is always a force that is being incorporated. Physics is a interesting topic and is a part of everything that we do even if we do not think there is physics involved."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1553,"Reflection 1: ""Why am I here?"" I am primarily taking this class as it is a GE class required for my major in Industrial Design. However, even though I am not a math focused person, I think that there is a lot I can benefit from by taking this class and I would be taking it even if it weren’t required. I have always had an interest in science and trying to define how the world around me works and taking both the lab and the lecture courses could not only give me words to express how objects interact with natural forces but also give me a deeper understanding of the world around me. By the end of this class, I hope to be able to notice and explain things that I have never noticed before, as well as use science to explain both everyday phenomenon and areas that are completely new to me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1554,"Why am I here? I am here in this Physics class because I really wanted to take Physics again after my experience in high school. I took Physics in my junior year of high school and I would have to say that out of all of the classes I took, Physics was my favorite. It was the most interesting to me and I had the most fun. My teacher made it very enjoyable. I decided to take Physics again to build on the things I learned and to continue on applying Physics concepts to my everyday life. Out of all the science subjects I had the option to take this semester , I decided to go with Physics. I’m super excited to see what we will learn and do in this class for the rest of the semester . I want to learn more about the Laws of Physics such as gravity , kinetic and potential ener gy, Newton’ s Laws, etc."
