2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1529,"I really am privileged to be given the opportunity to learn about certain things that some may not even have the chance to gain that knowledge. I could go on and talk about how this class has taught me about certain topics relating to acceleration, forces, or even energy, but I want to talk about the discipline and the responsibilities of being in school. This class made me realize that although I am now an adult, I have to set my priorities straight especially if I want to reach my certain goals. In the future, I want to work with Apple and be happy with where I am. Having a set mindset really has pushed me to do things that I thought was impossible at the time, so I think that this class helped me really think about how I should go about doing things especially if it relates to the position I will be soon to be in. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1527,"My goals is to graduate from college and start working as a dental hygienist. My first goal is to fulfill my prerequisites and enroll into Chabot College dental hygiene program. After this goal I want to graduate with honors in dental hygiene school as well. Overall my goal is start working by 23. This class is helping me reach my goal because it is a requirement for my major as well as dental school. I hope to pass this class and earn the best grade, if I work hard enough. I already completed phys101 and this is my last lab. For this class, phys 102 I need to set an alarm so that I show up because I keep forgetting. I don't forget on purpose rather, I'm so drained mentally I can't keep track of my agenda as good as I used to. Something I learned from one of the readings in my kin class is to focus on small goals, such as what's happening in present time. If I think too far ahead I'll get distracted and I may even slow myself down."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1536,"My goal is to better understand physics and figure out how to apply it to coaching/training young athletes. I can see where learning about motion could be helpful, since soccer is all about moving to different spots and with changes of speed. At the moment I have found this course challenging it seems very math heavy and in returning to school I am not as up to date on my math skills as I should be. As I do get it down better it will be interesting to see if I can apply more of a math angle to coaching."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1519,"What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve those goals? My goals are mainly to have a successful career and stable life. This class is helping me achieve both of those goals because I need to take this class as a prerequisite for my major: kinesiology , even though I do not see the point in it. But over time I learned that physics is involved in everything, from how things move to how nature works. Learning about these new things does not make me like physics any more than I used to. I do not like physics because of all the equations and hard thinking about certain questions. I think it’ s because, in the past, I took a physics class where it was all about the math material and not so much about the principles of physics. I do like math, but not when it comes to science because, for some reason, it’ s harder for me to understand when it’ s combined. By taking this class, I am one step closer to pursuing my degree and also a step closer to graduation and going out into the field. Only a few more months of physics and I won’t have to take a physics-based class again."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1532,"My goal is to ultimately graduate with a B.S. in Kinesiology. I am currently on my last few semesters before I can graduate. But in terms of my goal for this class, I want to know more about the basic fundamentals of physics through hands on activities through lab work. This class is helping me achieve my goal(s) because of the  labs and the activities that are helping me prepare me for the class that I need, which is biomechanics. But before I am able to take that class, I will first have to take on this class before I move on. Furthermore, my goal is to gain enough knowledge and understanding from this class and use it outside of the class room and help me with other classes that are related to the fundamental of physics. This class is also helping towards my goal of graduating because it is one of the last few lower division classes that I need. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1522,"My goals are to graduate from SFSU with a kinesiology degree in movement sciences. Taking this PHYS 102 Lab class will help me achieve that goal along the way because it is required. This class is also a prereq to biomechanics and will help me understand the foundations of physics. This class has gotten increasingly more difficult to understand as the weeks go on but I still find it interesting. I think remembering basic principles and rules will be really beneficial in this class. Also learning about forces and being able to conceptualize it is pretty cool, I can imagine it with others situations in life like going to the gym or driving a car."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1511,Now that I am a senior in college and have to move on with my life into adulthood next year I think about my goals in life very often. This thought is extremely scary and makes me terrified to become an adult. I recently decided that my goal is to become a chiropractor and eventually open my own practice. In order to do this I am getting my bachelor in kinesiology and then going to chiropractic school after for 4 years. I have zero clue where I am going to go to chiropractic school which is stressing me out. This class is helping me reach my goals by allowing me to get my bachelor in kinesiology because without this class I cannot do that. Other than career goals I honestly just strive to be happy. My overall goal in life is to live a happy and healthy life and I chase that feeling as much as possible. Another goal I have is to push myself out of my comfort zone. I am very socially shy when I first meet people so this limits me sometimes in life.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1512,My goals are to hopefully graduate in a year more and if I take a little longer that's ok. This class is helping me achieve these goals by finishing the science requirement of physics  and physics lab. I believe that physics will help for my major since I need to understand basic things relating to movement and weight. Even simulating things in physics can help in understanding how things work in daily life  which can relate to ones goals. Hopefully the things we learn in class and lab will give all of us knowledge that can be used to further advance and enrich our paths in life.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1520,My goal is to become a physical therapist and I will achieve this by taking the necessary prerequisites so that I can switch my major from pre-kinesiology to kinesiology. I knew I wanted to become a physical therapist my junior year of high school given that I was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis I went to physical therapy & occupational therapy which influenced my career path as a physical therapist. I loved that I was able to warm up my joints again to get rid of the stiffness in my arms/legs. My only goal is to graduate from San Francisco State University with my bachelors. Whether I chose to go into the work field is totally up to me but I’m positive that I will work hard to get where I want to be in life. This physics lab will help me understand the fundamentals of physics which I hope to apply in my everyday life. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1516,"My goal is to have the knowledge and ability of various problem-solving strategies, be able to prove and explain specific methods to solve the problem. This class can help achieve these goals because the goal of physics is to give students a broad understanding of the physical standards of the universe, help them build basic thinking and quantitative thinking skills, and enable them to imaginatively fundamentally Approximately think about logic problems and tests."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1530,My goal currently as of now is to graduate with a bachelors degree in Kinesiology. My other goal is possibly be getting commissioned in the military. I've considering being in the military for awhile since a freshman in high school and earning a degree would help me be one step closer to joining. By earning my bachelors degree I would be the first in my family to earn a college degree because I would be a first generation in my family to go college. By taking taking physics 101 and 102 it'll help me achieve these goals because it's one step closer to earning by degree because as each class I complete to the best of my ability I'm a step closer to earning my degree. By taking this course it helps further my education in different kinds of science course we take and would be tested on. Upon earning my degree I plan to utilize it and becoming a commissioned officer in the military. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1528,My goals are to become an EMS in order to get experience in the medical field to pursue my final goal which is to become a trauma doctor. This class is helping me achieve my goals because it is one of the classes I need to take in order to learn more about my major.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1533,"My goals are to improve my curiosity and creativity this semester. I want to learn more and explore different pathways that I am picking up along the way. For example, I actually just finished all of my prerequisites for the nursing program, and so this semester I am actually taking classes for another major, kinesiology, while I apply for nursing programs that don’t actually start until next year. This is one step in a new direction that I am not familiar with, and I hope to take more steps out of my comfort zone to explore and expand my horizons. This class, I would say, is indeed helping me with this goal because I have been primarily exposed to biological sciences these past few years, and it’s refreshing to have a different science that helps me understand the workings of the world. It is also a prerequisite for the kinesiology degree, so the class is definitely helping me out in that regard."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1531,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""My personal academic goals include graduating with my Bachelors, and hopefully being admitted into a masters Physician Assistant program. I am striving to graduate with a minor in Holistic Health as well. I am interested in taking a more natural approach to medicine and rehabilitation and hope to apply this to my future work. This class is helping me achieve my goals by understanding lab work in the physics and movement field, while giving me the credit I need to fulfill my degree. I want to emphasize more on the biology and anatomical area of kinesiology, rather than the movement or understanding of physics itself, therefore not everything in this class is very useful to me. But I do understand that knowing more is always better, especially since it relates to my field of study in many ways. This class is very helpful in making connections that way we all can understand the subject as best we can together. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1525,My goals are to get a degree at this moment and this class is a requirement for achieving that goal. Additionally being more organized with classes.  It is important for my major to have a basic understanding of physics because it is important to movement which relates to the human body. Not only that but I would like to have a basic understanding of physics. I have taken it in the past and didn't grasp it that well but I think doing the labs in class and with one another and discussing our findings is really helpful and important to gaining an understanding of it better. I think it is going a little outside of the box for me because it is different from what I have learned in the past so it is broadening my knowledge on different topics. This class has also been very helpful for me to stay organized because we do a lot of the work in class and then we have additional time to finish the worksheets. Everything is laid out in a very matter of fact way as well.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1517,"Kayl Zabala PHYS 102 09/22/21 ""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?"" My goals for this class are to get good grades and better understand Physics. Prior to this class I have only taken 1 Physics class in high school and it didn’ t leave a good impression to me. It was hard for me to understand the topics because I didn’ t have a good teacher . I’m hoping that I will be able to learn the essence of Physics and be able to explain what Physics is and its branches if I ever take another Physics class. So far I have been learning a lot about motion, acceleration, and velocity and all the lab explorations have helped me get clarity of f these topics. I am that this class will further enlighten me of deeper Physics topics that I had for gotten about in my previous high school class. I am hoping that I continue to meet all the assignment deadlines and not get distracted in order to achieve my goal of getting a good grade for this class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1521,"My current goal is to pass my classes this semester so that I can move concentrations into my preferred concentration which is Kinesiology: Exercise and Movement Science. This class is helping me in two different ways. One way this class is helping me is that it fulfills my requirement of needed a physics class and lab to take the require a Biomechanics class needed to graduate with a B.A. in Kinesiology at San Francisco State. In addition, this class helps me because it lets me apply the concepts I am learning in my others course. For example, concepts I am learning in my physics lecture come somewhat easier to me because I complete the labs from this class and then go to lecture. As well, for my anatomical kinesiology, we review and apply concepts from physics into our lectures and labs which this class has helped prepare me for. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1510,"My goals for this year are to succeed in my classes since I am now near graduation. I know that I really want to do physical therapy and that it is not something that is easy to just do, and this class is an important aspect in the field of kinesiology. A lot of the things we learn in here I can apply to my kin classes, so I want to take in the most that I can so that I can have success down the line. So far, I feel great because the things we are learning are hard topics that are being broken down for us to really comprehend."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1513,"My goal is to maintain my homework for courses better this semester. To keep this goal I have gotten a planner in order to plan my homework assignments better and this class is helping me to achieve this goal because of the schedule of homework in a way. However, when we are finished with the assignments for the week/day I feel like my brain is fried. This class is helping me achieve this goal by helping me to better understand the concept of different websites and movement. Especially since kinesiology is about the study of body movement and physics has to do with objects moving from one point to another. Physics has to do with chiropractic because of the way that bones in the body are positioned and the way that they are able to move well, or not well and therefore being adjusted. This class is also a requirement for my kinesiology major, which is one of many courses I have yet to complete at the moment. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1509,"I think there are many goals one set for themselves as a person, and one of my goals includes having better time management, as I finding myself procrastinating quite often. As it comes time to turn in assignments, working on them it is easy to push things off especially when I'm back at home and all my classes are online. This class is helping me to achieve this goal since most of my other classes have stuff due around the same time with a week time frame to complete them. Another one of my goals is to graduate undergrad with honors, this class is helping me to achieve this goal since the grade I receive in this class is used to calculate my SF State grade point average. I also have a goal of building networks, making friends so this class helps me find, connect to other kinesiology major students as this course is a pre-req for the major."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1515,"When I was in 7th grade, I had my first physics lecture. For me, physic is hard to understand but fun and has a significant room in our life. I remember the lab with the iron ball. Because of the inertia, it will not crash back my teacher's nose when my teacher lets go of the ball right on his nose. From the physics lecture, I learn that sometimes when we use the acknowledge from physics, we can save much energy; Such as Leverage Theory and Pulley Theory. I had learned many of them. However, I did not pay enough attention to them, and many knowledge points have been washed away by time. My goal is to master the knowledge of physics that is able to use in our daily life. I want to master more physical phenomena in our life or physical common sense through experiments or labs in this class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1534,"My goals are to continue my success and not let off the gas pedal is terms of working hard for classes. This class helps me achieve these goals because it is built to help me stay focused with my school work and the structure helps me stay on task and stay focused on what is ahead. Another goal of mine is to eventually branch off into more difficult science classes, and this class is a prep class for what is ahead of me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1535,"I have multiple goals that I want to accomplish. For school, I want to be able to succeed in all of my classes and try to aim high in receiving and A. I'm trying my best to do what I can ask early as possible to try to reduce the amount of schooling I will need to take all together. Financially I struggle and having to go to school for a long time might be difficult. However, in life my goals are different. Recently I have been dealing with a lot of stress and feeling burnt out. My goal is to try to find a healthy routine that will allow me to relax and still be able to do all the things that I want and need to do. This class is helping me achieve my goals because we always finish everything in class for the most part and all I have to do is upload the material. It takes away some of the stress that I have knowing that all my work is completed on time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1524,"my goals is to ask questions when I'm confused, ask classmates, then ask professor. I also wish to be able to complete all my assignments during the class period. this class definitely is allowing for me to do that. For my question asking, I like how the professor comes into the break out rooms to check on us and ask if we need help because sometimes some of us can be intimidated to go out of the way to ask help during the first days of class. it also allows us to bond with the other classmates whenever we are confused. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1508,"My goals for this semester is to keep track of my assignments and making sure I turn everything in on time. Which this class is good that we have time to do the worksheets I just think that in order for me to be more successful would be to probably have a longer lecture since sometimes our group members don’t help or interact. Which when you join groups does help but I just hoped we had our groupset. Also, the lectures being longer does help us have a better understanding when doing the worksheets since they are pretty long and a 5-10 min lecture doesn’t really cover it all so if we were to have an example like the worksheet we could be so blind going into the worksheets since it is a lot. But other than that I want to be able to pass all my classes and make sure that I am on track to graduate. I also need to study for my teas test which doing a backup major hasn’t really been easy. Also being more curious and asking more questions just to make sure that i am understanding the subject since physics is a lot."
