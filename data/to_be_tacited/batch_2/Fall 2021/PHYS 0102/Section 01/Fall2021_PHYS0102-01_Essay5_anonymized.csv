2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1508,What resources do I have to support meThe resources that I have to support me academically is EOP and Metro. In EOP I have my consular/advisor Julia to support me with classes and to give me through my college academics. She is really positive all the time which encourages me to get through my classes and to get an A or close to it. Metro was the only 2 years but through that program I met Raju and he is such a big advocate and speaks up on everything. He gives really good advice and will help you with everything he possibly can. The most important person that has help me with my homework and editing my essays has been my godmother she is a nurse and she has always checked up on me and made sure I am on tract. My parents and family the reason why I am in college they believe in me in every step of the way which pushes me to try even when I feel I can. They are my best supporter system I could have ever asked for.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1526,"Resources I have to support me are, office hours and different study groups I have made with friends. I prefer making study groups as it is less intimidating and you can make friends along the way. This semester especially studying with friends has been especially helpful with transitioning back to campus as well as it being my last year at SF State, the peer relationships have been really key. I also appreciate my professors who have opened office hours so I can sit down and explain my thought process and have someone else digest it and correct me where it is off."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1507,"Resources that I have to support me are the people I surround myself with. That includes my mom, sister, boyfriend, my three closest friends, and grandparents. Without them by my side I do not think I would possibly have any motivation to continue to go through schooling. As hard as it is, they keep grounded and sane. They remind me of what I’ve accomplished so far and that I’m capable of doing much more. Moving away from home is hard as it is, but having to try and make new friends, go to school, work, amongst other things it’s hard to maintain a positive mindset. Other resources I have are my peers, professors, and the library. My peers and professors help explain or figure out unanswered questions I might still have and the library provides further information. The education journey is never an easy process and it’s always nice to have others by your side to help along the way."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1511,"I am very thankful to have as many resources to support me as I do. Some of those being my friends, family , teachers, and therapist. My friends give me support by making me happy and having people to have fun with. I have been friends with my group of friends for a while now so it is great having such a close group of support. I am beyond thankful for my parents because they are always there for support whenever I need them. Although i financially support myself for the most part I know if I ever need help they will do anything they can to help me. In regards of schooling I am thankful to have supportive teachers that help guide me through school. Lastly , my therapist helps me through any emotional support I need which is amazing."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1510,"With the current sta te I am in, I feel like I have lots or resources that can help me. When it  comes to school, I know that SFSU offers a variety of programs and mul tiple resource s for research and  learning . Even teachers offer after hour s to assist  in learning class content . Regarding life, I have  everything  I would want. I know I can rely on my family at any given mo ment and that I al ways have  them as a resource  if I struggle in l ife. But the person I am, I try not  to rely on resources in the case that I  don’t like to rely on other s in the sense that I don ’t want to waste peopl e’s time . I know that I can  always l earn or figure  out a prob lem to my best ability , but if I continue to fail then I will event ually ask  for help  but only as a last reso rt."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1528,"Some resources that I have that support me are my family and friends. Whenever I feel down or not in the mood to do homework, when I hang out with my family and friends it always seems to cheer me up and help me get back up. Another thing that supports me in my opinion is my gym equipment. Working out is something that helps me become more determined and consistent in what I do."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1535,"I do not know many resources that can help me at this school considering that I just transferred and I haven't looked further into what the school has to offer. I do know that they do have a health and wellness center and I read about what they have but I forgot what they had to offer. I know that our school has tutoring in case we ever need help understanding the content. You can also talk to your academic or major counselor in case you ever need help trying to figure out what classes you need to take or if you have questions about your path. As for resources in my life, my job offers free therapy sessions in case I ever feel overwhelmed. It was very helpful considering at one point I was struggling and it was hard to keep up with ongoing events in my life. Teachers are always there to help when one has a question or just needing someone to talk to."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1533,"I believe I have plenty of r esour ces t o suppor t me thr ough any diﬃculty in my life, namely the people close t o me. My family has been with me since the beginning (literally) and I know I can trust on both my mother and my father t o have a conversation on the things that ar e on my mind. They have also helped me with my education by funding tuition for the schools that I’ve been t o, sacriﬁcing so much t o bring me t o school, and nur turing me at home with good values and manners. I also have my best friends who I’ve gr own up with and stuck with for the longest time. I know I can conﬁde in them, trust them t o be ther e for me, and help each other with our troubles.

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1524,"“What resources do I have to support me?”   The resources I have to support are school mentees, staff, people in my life and my coworkers. Each and every single “group” per say, has its on way of interference with my life and the different ways they help. Academically, emotionally, there are people who i can turn to, to receive the help I need. Sometimes it is hard to say you need help, we are seen as independent people who need to figure it out, but sometimes it’s ok to ask for help."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1525,"""What resources do I have to support me?"" Family is one of my main resources I have that support me. And in my opinion the most important resource because they will be honest and tell you things you don't always want to hear but sometimes need to hear. Specifically my mom is my greatest support system because she doesn't judge and usually has very insightful things to say if I need help with something or sometimes just want to talk. Additionally she can help guide me through tough times or when I am having difficulty deciding where I want to go or what I want to do in life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1536,"What resources do I have to support me? I have my family to support me which includes my family here and my mother, father, and brother. They are all very supportive along with some friends who are supportive by helping me out with rides for my kids to their sporting events if I need the time to do homework. I have found many professors and counselors at the colleges I have gone to, to also be very supportive"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1531,"Reflection	#5	Maria	Natalie	Martinez	11/10/21	 	""What resources do I have to support me?""  Some of the resources I have with me are my family, my friends and my school. I feel that I am able to get everything I need, including help with the current environment I am in.  I believe I can count on these resources. Anytime I am in need I feel confident that I have a support system behind me, always ready to help me out. Resources can be critical in ones life. For me, I depend on resources to get directions, get government help, help with food, and aid in understanding health insurance. Many people depend on resources for transportation, housing, or other critical things related to life. I do believe that the more resources one has the more beneficial it is to them getting through life. Growing up my support system was never the best, but I make sure to keep those I truly care about and that care about me closest to me.  	"

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1515,"""What resources do I have to support me?"" The most important resource for me is the economy, and my biggest source of money is the FAFSA. I used this grant to purchase a laptop and a tablet computer to support my study, as well as some books and learning tools related to my major. My second largest resource is YouTube. I often use YouTube to search for videos related to my courses, which helps me better understand and digest some knowledge points. Because my major is related to community health, I need to collect data and materials from the community, so I will use Google to search and collect the information or data I need to prove my argument. These three resources can support me in my study, and they have an irreplaceable position in my heart. However, interpersonal relationship is also an important resource. When I meet an unfamiliar field, I can turn to my family and friends for help, so my family and friends are also a resource that can support me in my study."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1520,"Mariana Cruz 11/10/2021 Reflection #5 ● ""What resources do I have to support me?"" ● This essay is meant to connect you to your purpose. This is not meant to be a formal essay. It should be stream-of-consciousness writing from the heart. You will be graded on participation only, not on the specifics of what you say. 5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150-200 words. For a long time, I've always felt like I had nobody that I could lean on for advice or support because I have a tendency of keeping everything to myself given that I hate bothering anyone with my problems. So It took me a long time to realize that I am not alone and that I have a big support system which I am grateful to have. To start of f I have my wonderful best friend who has supported me throughout my high school and college journey . Without her or my family I would’ve probably given up so with that being said I am super thankful to have them by my side and to keep me motivated throughout hard times. Then I have my family who I would like to think are my biggest supporters given that they are depending on me to make something out of myself. My college advisors would definitely be a resource that has supported me because as a first-generation college student it can be a bit dif ficult given that I have no one to lean on."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1534,"Reflection 5 ""What resources do I have to support me?"" I have been very lucky to have many resources that have been supporting me over the past years. I have many resources, such as my family , friends, and professors that have helped me along the way. There have many people who have been good resources to me and have supported me through everything that I have done. Some intangible resources that I have is the technology given to me, such as my computers, my phone, and other student resources that are very helpful. Another resource that I have in SFSU itself, they have many programs and people that are dedicated to help their students. I believe that these resources are very important and I am very glad that I have it on my side. I am very appreciative of all the resources that have helped me have a successful college career so far ."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1522,"I have many resources to support me. Firstly , I have both of my parents who both support me and whatever positive thing I do. Everyday , they ask me how school is going and I always say good. I have the Kinesiology department to support me as well, in terms of planning out my educational path. I also have my classmates who I've become friends with to support me as well. Overall, I think the resource that supports me the most is myself. I’ve always thought that it’ s on you to become who you want to be. I believe if you truly wanted something you’d do everything in your power to get that something, no excuses."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1521,"Jessica Gonzales PHYS-102-01 Reflection #5 I have many resources to support me. Specifically , a top resource I have for me is emailing my professor not only my professor for this lab (Easton Houston) but also my professor for my physics lecture class. If I feel like emailing them would not be enough to support me I can also attend their of fice hours for extra guidance. While my physics lecture professor did inform me that she wasn’ t a part of the group that created and wrote our lab she would help me if I had any general physics concept questions for the labs. In addition, I believe SF State of fers tutoring for physics classes. If I'm not comfortable attending my professors of fice hours then I know I can also attend a tutoring session for physics."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1530,"""What resources do I have to support me?"" Due to being a student at San Francisco State University I feel that the university is able to provide a lot of resources to me compared to other universities in the country. If I need help with school there's tutoring offered. The tutoring center offered on campus is great because you can get help knowing that you're not the only one who might need help. For physical health we have the gym. I would say having a good friend group that can help you."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1519,"""What resources do I have to support me?"" When first thinking about it, I thought I didn’t have a lot of resources at my disposal, but after some thought, I realized that there are a bunch of school resources that I can utilize. Some of those resources include tutoring, advising, as well as asking my professors and classmates questions about assignments. There are many departments for dif ferent kinds of advising, such as general education advising, study abroad advising, METRO advising, and your specific college advising. I also have my family as a resource, they would only be able to help on certain subjects. The internet is also a resource that every student uses daily . Whether it be for homework help or for just searching for something interesting to that individual, the internet is a very useful tool for a student’ s education. I feel the resources that students use the most are the internet and their classmates. These two resources are the easiest to use and I think it’ s easier to ask your classmates for help rather than emailing your professor every time you have a question."

Another resource is my major advisor. As my major advisor, they are there to support me in achieving my goals and graduating from college.

As good tasting, healthy meals are a crucial part when it comes to you staying focused and productive when working on homework, and studying since hard work and stress can take a toll on one's body. Lastly, another resource would be health services as I can get my flu shot there, medicine if needed, and so forth."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1517,"""What resources do I have to support me?"" The main resources I have for my education are my EOP and Metro counselors. I come to these people whenever I have trouble with pretty much anything related to my college classes. I have a very good relationship with my EOP counselor, for example, when I needed financial aid advice she helped me find a loan advisor. She also helped me register for classes and plan out my classes throughout my career here at San Francisco State. Outside of college, I have good connections with 3rd St Youth Clinic where I interned for a whole year. They provide clinic resources like therapy, food banks, women's health resources, and mentors for my major which is Kinesiology. I would say that I have very good resources that support me during times where I need it most and I am very grateful to have these programs around me."

It provides me with a lot of support because it helps me gather information and collect data from these resources. It also prepares me to complete tasks on time and ensures that I use my time wisely.

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1513,"I have a few resources to support me such as my family and my friends. They help to motivate me whenever I am having trouble with school or when I feel that the workload is too much.

Sometimes those break help me to think about those assignments and get a better idea of what it’s about but other times I just needed that break for myself."

With the help from these people , I can  fully get the support that I need to get through my classes and feel as if I am not alone through out  the semester . I think  one of the things that has been a big he lp through out online learning this  past year wa s the communication between my peers and I  on discord. It has been a great help and  it keeps me in contact with my  peers and professors as well . I also want to thank the professors  through  this time of online learning because I kno w how difficult it is to teach online and the  teaching setting is way different in person and I just appre ciate their effort s and strive to teach  through such a difficult  time."
