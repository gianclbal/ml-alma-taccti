2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1534,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" My values of my community and family help me navigate my way through college because it helps me determine what is right and what is wrong. In college, there are tons of decisions that you need to make in your life, and your values will ultimately guide you to the decisions that you make. Knowing what is beneficial for me and what would be a hindrance for me heavily relates to the values that I grew up on. I believe that these values will carry on with me beyond college, and it has definitely helped me to get to where I am today."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1516,"I would say the values   of my community helped me navigate through college because they provided positive guidance to me, helped me become more responsible, developed and guided my beliefs. The community provides different services, including taking care of our health: maintaining mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual balance. When I am not ready for college, they will help me find resources. I am grateful that they used their time to help a lot in the process of going to university."

The values of my community and family have helped me navigate throughout college due to the support they have provided since the first day I started my freshman semester. As support is something needed as I can be shy, a first-generation student it can help with taking away some stress because I know I am not alone. Now I am slowly breaking that shell and starting to be able to speak to people that I don't know well. Also, my mom constantly tells me phrases like you reap as you sow, which means the harder I work later in the long run I will get compensated for that. That family has been a key thing from the start from cousins to aunts, uncles to brothers, and sister to my parents. As my aunts and uncles will occasionally send me money for support whether I use to grab some lunch or dinner, books, or even toiletries, they also check up on me by texting me Face Timing me or calling me and see how I am doing as being a couple of miles away from home being from SoCal, being close to my family they know from time to time I get homesick."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1518,The values of my community and family have helped me navigate through college because they have  instilled in me the work ethic that I have now.

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1519,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of the origin or choice) helped me navigate through college?"" My family has always constantly mentioned how a good education leads to a good career and therefore leads to a good life. This constant reminder has always pushed me to perform well in school so I can attend a good university . My parents have also said, “Don’t end up like them”. For example, when there is a homeless person on the side of the road, my mom or dad would say “Do well in school, so you don’t end up like them”. I always intended to perform well in school for myself, but it’ s a dif ferent standard when you’re trying to please your parents’  academics wise. Sometimes their expectations for grades are above what mine are, but on the other hand, I set my expectations so high that I would work harder for the ‘A ’ when my parents are okay with a ‘B’."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1522,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" The values of my community and my family help me navigate through college by realizing my parents had it way harder than me growing up. My mom is an immigrant and immigrated to this country in the 80’s. With only one friend helping her out. She didn’t know English and had to learn it as her second language. So whenever, I don’t want to do my homework or not try in school I think of her journey and I grind my work the best I can. Also thinking about my family name, there aren't a lot of us left, in fact there are only less than a handful of us left. My brother, my father, my aunt, and myself. So I want to leave behind a proud legacy in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1524,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""  The values of my community and family that have helped me navigate college is that everyone has their own experiences. Making this mine gives me something to look forward to. It's nothing I have to compare myself to. I have myself to look up to, as I grow up and become a role model to others. The one thing is nothing is ever going to be done on its own. It has to be done by someone, that someone is me. So if i do it or not, it will depend on me, it’ll show up and how either it can affect me positively or negatively. Fake it til you make it, working hard till i can achieve what i want in life. Nothing will be done easily."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1510,"The values of my family have been one of the greatest moti vating factors in my life. Even with  colleg e, this has always  been a path I wanted to go t o make my family happy and proud because I kn ow  that if I was n’t here I wouldn ’t be doing an ything else . Growin g up, I saw m y family struggle and pull  themselves out from the bottom to get to where they are now.  I know the value of hard work and doing  things to ensure that the people around you have food and cloth es. I’ve always been raised to be a  perfectioni st in the sense that everything you do especially if its work or school should be done to a  point where  you aren’t half assing it because there is no reaso n not t o do a hundred percent of the work  and effort . Even working hard, learning about respect and the value of a dollar were also important  things  because it puts into perspective  how the world works and what kind of person you should be.  Being humble and a kind person will get you far ."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1521,Jessica Gonzales PHYS-102-01 Reflection #4 I grew up in a struggling family. Seeing both my parents struggle to pay bills and my dads struggle to find a decent job to help us while on top of all of that having an external family that would not help us even a little bit really taught me independence. While that is good in a sense but being a 5 year old having to take care of yourself because both your parents work wasn’t really ideal. That situation has left me with a lot of personal issues today on top of emotional abuse from when I was little from my parents. All of this helped me become very independent and able to help myself through college alone. But it's also held me back from asking the correct questions or seeking advice from peers. I have a hard time seeking help or support now because my mindset is that ‘I don't want to be a bother’ although I know that is not the case.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1511,"The values of my community have helped me navigate through college by being there for support and to answer questions when needed. When I talk about community I specifically mean San Francisco State University staf f and students. Anytime I need help on anything I know I can research online and find someone to call or email for help. This has helped me be successful through my four years here at SFSU. I am very thankful to have such a supporting community around me because I have not had any serious issues I have ran into. My family has also helped me navigate through college by providing me emotional and financial help when needed. It has been very helpful having my family to call when I need to get my mind of f of stressful school work. Although I do financially support myself, my parents are always there if I am in dire need of something."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1520,"Mariana Cruz 10/27/2021 Reflection #4 My family has played a huge role throughout my journey in college, to be quite honest I did not want to pursue a higher education but I’ve seen my family struggle which broke my heart so I wanted to do better for them. My family gives me the motivation to continue being great, when times get rough or when I’m stressed out I just think about how it’ll all be worth it in the end. Coming from a low-income community it is everyone’s goal to make it out, make something for themselves and that is exactly what I plan to do. If it weren’t for my family I would’ve already probably given up but I’m thankful that I have the love and support that I do. As for my community it has taught me so much, I am proud of where I’m from but we all need some change at some point."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1526,"My family really values being able to work hard but have purpose to your life and enjoying life instead of just working to make money and being caught in this spiral. This has helped me through college in moments where I am cramming for a test or the work that I am doing feels meaningless I am able to reflect on what this is leading up to. It has helped me to identify what I am working hard on is not just to work hard in that moment, but it is for a far greater purpose and will ultimately lead to my career where I get to mentor and help teenagers. This value of working hard for a greater purpose and not just to better yourself often gives me vision and excitement for the future and allows me to push and work hard even when I am over it or feel like quitting."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1515,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" Everyone has different values, because different living environment including status will affect people's values. The reason why I want to go to college is the pressure from the society and my family, because it is believed that those who get college diploma can adapt to the society more quickly and obtain better living conditions. So the reason why I want to go to college is very realistic. For life, the second reason is my dream. I want to be a psychologist, which is very demanding, so going to college is inevitable. Although college life is very busy and stressful, I think it is worth it for my future and my dreams, even my family. I also hope that I can gain more people's recognition through my efforts, improve my status in the society, and give me and my family a higher living conditions."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1517,"Kayl Zabala PHYS 102 10/27/21 ""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" My family’ s educational background mostly pushes me to navigate college on my own. I am the first person in my immediate family to step into college here in America. Coming from an immigrant family , it was particularly hard to receive help from my parents on how to navigate college because they don’ t know how college works here in America. I’m very lucky to have reliable friends, counselors, and programs that help me stay on track and help me with my application process and classes. Without them, I probably wouldn’ t be where I am right now and I am truly grateful for all the opportunities and resources that I encountered in my high school and college life. My counselor at SFSU is someone who actually helped me tremendously she checks up on me every semester and I would reach out to her whenever I had questions about classes or my major . I am extremely grateful to have these people by myside."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1531,"Reflection #4 – PHYS 102 Maria Martinez ""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""   The values shared by my community that helped me navigate through college were taking care of one’s health, whether that be mentally, physically, or emotionally. I feel that in college you are meeting so many new people, developing new relationships, balancing work, home life and schoolwork; it can be quite overwhelming. We forget to prioritize our well-being by tricking ourselves that all these external experiences are more important than our own. I learned to apply being focused but flexible. Given my low attention span, it hard to concentrate and still very difficult for me to get through a reading for a class. However, my community reminds me to have a strong work ethic always. I believe this is one of the most important values regarding anything one does in their lives. Lastly, we cannot forget how important it is to have respect for oneself as well as others. This will maintain their integrity as a college student, addressing values surrounding themes such as love, responsibility, and perseverance."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1536,"My family is very exciting that I have returned to college. They are very supportive, and my kids even try to help me with my schoolwork, which, is pretty funny. My whole family has found ways to help out around the apartment and understand that our schedule is hectic doing their best to keep things moving like a well-oiled machine. I am even now better able to help my college son and high school son with their studies which I also really enjoy. When I am locked in a room doing my school work it has my kids working together to help each other instead of insisting I help them, they realize I am not always available and it has made them closer something else I think is great."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1508,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""The values of my family have helped me navigate college since they really value education as a way to be successful in life. This has taught me that if I donʼt educate my self people would use their knowledge against me which is true. When I was little and I was learning English I haded speaking it or writing it but as I got to 5th grade I realized that if I didnʼt learn English and being a us citizen will affect me and my family. My family will come to me for translation and I got better at it since I pushed my self to do it even the I didnʼt like it or wanted to. This is the same in college it is really stressful to keep up with the assignments but as long as a push through I know that finishing a bachelors will mean a lot especially how people see me and treat me. I also learned from my parents that knowing that I am first generation makes it hardened since my parents couldnʼt really help me but I will be able to help my sister as she goes into college. I learned to be patient and to continue even when it gets hard."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1512,"The values of my community and Family have helped me navigate college by instilling the value of never giving up no matter how hard something may seem. Not only that but the value of hard work and dedication and that even if you navigate college slowly, it is ok for some movement of goal progression than no movement of school goals at all. It is important for me to navigate college and finish getting my bachelors because technically I would be the first male in my family to have a bachelors. I have multiple women family members that have a bachelors and it would be a great feat to also join them and make them proud to finish my academics in pursuing my bachelors degree. They have shown me that it is not easy and it takes hard work and dedication. However, I will try my best to finish and soon enough I too will be amongst them to finish my academic goals."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1525,How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college? My mother was a particularly good role model for me because I grew up watching her go through school while also being a mother and going to school. Because of this I always understood the importance of education and it made me appreciate it more. Watching my mom graduate with both her bachelors and masters geared me towards school and I think a lot of people go to college sometimes just for the experience not knowing what they want to do yet but I made it a point to know what I wanted to do prior to going to college.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1513,"The values of my family helped me navigate through college by supporting me, although sometimes I can’t stand to be at home because it’s so loud and there’s a lot I have to deal with, but I am thankful that I have shelter and food. My friends are also very supportive and have helped me to navigate through college by always bringing me up when I was down. They also give me so much of their positivity, when I can’t talk to anyone else they are there for me to talk about my classes and assignments with. And vice versa they can tell me what has been troubling them recently. My family also helps me navigate through college by telling my siblings to not bother me so that I am able to get my homework done and do not have to stress out about it too much and have a free weekend to relax from all the work that I’ve been assigned.."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1535,"My family helped me so far with college as in they support me no matter what I do. My parents are the ones that guide me, even though they don’t really know much about college, they make sure I am doing my best in every other aspect.They try to make sure I do not have much of a load on my plate or try to help me with anything that they can help with. For my community, there are always options that have helped with answering any questions I have or if I have any opportunity to experience new things. Especially with the job I have at the moment, I get to meet many different people who have different jobs and it is interesting to speak with them because they offer hlp. Even though I am not going in that field, they always say if I need help they would be willing to help me out."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1530,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" I would say this question is a little bit hard for me because I’m a first generation to go to college. Although I have an older brother in college as well I’m much closer to obtaining my degree quicker than him. It’s hard to ask him for any help to navigate through college because our experiences and the different schools we go to don't have as many similarities. I can’t ask my parents for help because they didn’t get the opportunity to go college when they were my age. When I’m in college and a question or problem arises I would have to figure it out myself. It’s a trial and error experience for me and to learn what’s good and bad for me. Other than that I try to be independent and learn as I go through life and college."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1507,"The values of my family helped me navigate through college by reminding me to always go harder when I feel like giving up. To always do my best and to be proud of the outcome no matter what. My family consists of people who encourage me to be the best possible version of yourself and without them being by my side, I’m not sure if I would have made it this far. Growing up I was raised by a single mother of two and she made sure we were able to get the things we wanted/earned. For example, I played travel soccer and that’s really expensive as it is, but that doesn’t even cover the cost of traveling fees and her having to work all the time she had to make sacrifices and couldn’t make major tournaments, but always made sure someone was there. Whether that be an immediate family member, close friend nearby, my godparents or a teammate's parent. That showed me independence, strength, braveness, and courage all in one. My mother is the strongest person I know and I know I have the ability to be just as strong and continue out my career path of choice and make her proud."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1532,"My family has always emphasized the importance of having an education and going to school  overall. M y famil y and friends have been my motiv ators to work and grind my way to getting a  degree. They ’ve taught me to  be respons ible when it comes to accomplishing my top pr iorities .
