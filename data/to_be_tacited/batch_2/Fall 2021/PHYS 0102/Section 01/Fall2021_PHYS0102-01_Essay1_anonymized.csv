Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1507,I'm here to learn more about physics and become one step closer to completing my requirements for my major.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1508,"Hi my mane is Arlish Lopez and I am majoring in nursing but meanwhile I prepare to take the teas test and community hours I am doing my make up major kinesiology. This is my 3rd year meaning I finish my pre request so now I am only taking pre request for kinesiology. Which consisted on physics and physics lab. I think I was never drawn into physics or really care for explanation on what really it is and how we see it in everyday life. This is because in high school I had a horrible physics teacher which made me think of physics as boring and complicated. But after my two weeks on taking physics and physics lab physics is everywhere and we currently use it for predicting the weather which I just found out recently . The generators that help create energy from sources whee we obtain them like gas, water, etc has been fun to learn. I think this is because my professors really bring objects and interacts with us. So I am here to learn more about physics and know the laws that help us understand it. Also need to learn my conversions as well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1509,"I think I'm personally here for various reasons. Beginning with doing something to help others, give back. This is because yes I go through challenges in life I always remember that some people may have it worse than me. With that being said another reason why I think I'm here is to provide love and encouragement not just to friends and family but to everyone especially since there are people who lack getting that from others. It just honestly breaks my heart to witness people struggle like street vendors. I'm also here to learn, grow, be creative. It doesn't end there I'm also here most importantly to make my parents proud, one day be able to take care of them financially. Lastly of various reasons, I'm here to be loved and to receive love. Don't get me wrong it is better to give love but it feels just as good to receive it from others. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1510,"When asked “why am I here?” there is a lot to think about. If we’re discussing our actual existence and the purpose of what our life is supposed to be about then that’s not easy to answer. I recently had this talk with my two friends about what our lives mean in the end of things and if what we do really matters because we really don’t know what will happen when we pass. Are we a creation of a higher being or evolution of single cells that have thoughts, passions, and emotions? That’s something nobody knows, but one thing for certain is that being here and being alive is a blessing. Enjoying life day by day and taking in all the experiences is why I’m here. I want to be able to enjoy things in this world and also to make those around me happy and proud because life isn’t long. I might not be someone who can change the world, but everybody can be someone that makes the people around them feel better."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1511,"Well to start off I am here in this class because it is a requirement for the kinesiology major. I am here at San Francisco State to get my kinesiology degree with a minor in holistic health. This will then allow me to go on to chiropractic school and further to be a chiropractor. I am here in this life to live my life as happy as possible while also supporting myself and going to work. My main priority in life is to be happy because without happiness, everything else sucks. So the real reason I am here is to be happy and explore and learn about myself in this hectic life we are all living. Because life is so structured I do not like to follow this structure of life so perfectly, I like to skew off of it a bit. In other words I do not want to live this structured life that we think we have to live (i.e school, college, job, marriage, family, etc.) I want to take time to myself and really explore life in my own terms. I do not think I am here to work for the rest of my life. Yes, I need to work to make money but as of right now I am young enough, with enough money saved to go explore the world and really fully live. WE are here to have fun and be happy, not to be so structured and depressed. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1512,"Thinking of purpose in life as to ""Why am I here?"" is to enjoy many of the things life has to offer which is could be the experience of different cultures and their art and food. Also doing things that one enjoys doing such as listening to music and other hobbies that one might have. Going back to my purpose I feel like  mine is to enjoy creating things which could  come in many forms  such as that of painting or  drawing.  Even doing little  things to help the community by being polite or respectful can be impactful and help define ones purpose. I have been fortunate that because of my hobbies I have always felt like I've had a purpose."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1513,"Reflection #1: I am here because I would like to further my education as well as be the first person in my family to graduate from college as well as make my family proud. I am also here because I would like to expand my knowledge based on my major or kinesiology. I have great determination to finish college and to take the steps into becoming a chiropractor in order to help reduce people's pain and adjust their body alignment. Especially since I have had the experience of being adjusted by a chiropractor, I would love to help clients’ with their needs. I’d also like to have experience in order to help my family since my dad is always having back pain from work and my sister's foot is always hurting due to a sports injury. And I feel that physics will help me to better understand the movements in which one is able to correlate with the body."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1514,"I am not a physics major or anything and was not interested in physics till I actually took the lecture and the lab class. I took these classes for my GE requirements but feel like I am enjoying it. I am a Business Administration - Marketing major, so physics does not directly relate to this but as I am knowing more about a particular concept, I feel that physics is what we come across in our everyday life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1515,"As a Chinese saying goes, ""学好数理化，走遍天下都不怕。"" It means that ""You will have no trouble throughout the world once You've learned math, physics, and chemistry well."" I admit that I am a slow learner in mathematics, and sometimes my classmates can understand it after learning it once, but I need to spend more time exploring by myself then master the secrets behind the math. But this does not stop my love for physics; for me, physics is the most interesting among the three. In my opinion, people have more access to physics knowledge than chemistry and mathematics. In addition, the theory and experiment of physics reveal the mystery of nature and reflect the objective law of material movement. I have no reason not to study physics. I want to learn more physics knowledge during this semester and improve my life quality by learning physics."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1516,"I am here because I want to practice more problem-solving skills and I think physics can help me develop critical thinking. I also enrolled in the class conceptual physics but I also want to get some experience from the lab. I am interested in how the world around us works. Although physics is challenging for me, I just think that if I fully understand how physics works, I will discover how amazing physics is. Another reason that I want to take this class is that I am very interested in many topics in physics like thermodynamics and statistical mechanics but I didn't have a chance to learn more about it. Physics enables me to accept and understand new concepts and ideas."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1517,"Why Am I Here? If I’m being honest with myself I feel very lost. A lot has happened to my life the last few months and it made me do a lot of things that I might regret in the future. I felt like I didn’ t know what I was doing or where I was headed in terms of what I was doing with my life. At the moment, I am trying to find my middle ground and focusing my time on school so that I can take a break from all the problems I’m experiencing in my life. Working hard and getting school work done allows me to feel at peace and in control of what’ s happening in my life. Being in college and getting my degree is probably my biggest motivator in life at the moment. To answer your question, I am here because I want to find myself and give myself a better future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1518,I am here because I left the military to pursue something that I would enjoy doing. I am here because the military is paying for my tuition. I am here because I need to earn my bachelors degree so that I can continue my education and earn my PHD. I am here because I want to further my education. I am here because I want a to prove the people who said I couldn't wrong. I am here to better myself. I am here to make connections with people who have similar interests. I am here because I want to learn. I am here so that I can have a successful future. I am here to make a difference in other people's lives.

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1521,
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1522,"I am here because I need this class to obtain my Kinesiology degree in movement science. I have never taken a physics class before so I am interested in learning fundamental physics and being able to apply that knowledge in a lab sense. My goal is to go to graduate school after obtaining my degree. I either want to go to PT school or Chiropractic school. So for the why that's the mean reason ""Why am I here?"". But also I think of the other circumstances that brought me here because of other decisions. For example, taking a break from school delayed my educational path & not knowing what I wanted to pursue. However, I do not regret my decision for taking the time to figure out what I want to do. Overall, physics is a fundamental class for me to take in order to pursue my passion."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1523,"""Why am I here?""That's a very good question actually, I'm here because I wanted to get a higher education. My family also wanted me to get a higher education. So I'm not only here for myself but for my family. Both of my parents encouraged me to go to college and honestly I didn't think college was for me, but here I am. I'm kinda making my way through it but I feel like I question whether or not I want to continue with what I am doing with my life and school. I'm pushing through it though. I'll most likely stay until I graduate but I might not enjoy the experiences I'm supposed to experience the people in college do. If that makes sense... I do know but I don't know why I'm here honestly."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1524,"Why am I here? I am here because I want to grow as a person, student, etc. I am conscious of what surrounds me makes me, me. I personally do not feel the greatest today, however, I made the effort into joining the class after driving back from campus either thinking of I was going to make it back home on time. I am here because of my family supporting me and I want to be able to make them proud as a first generation to prove anything is possible. Sure it is cheesy, but it is the truth. It feels good to be able to make small accomplishments which at the very end it'll pay off. I know when the time comes to do my own career, it'll feel nice, although I'll always be eager to continue my studies. My goal is to care for those around me to the best of my ability."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1525,"I am here because It is a requirement for my major to continue on. I do think it is important to understand how things work and why things work the way that they do and I think this class will be beneficial in teaching me those things. It's important as a whole to understand physics because of how you can relate these concepts to the body and motion which is a really major part of physical therapy. Physics as whole is a subject that can tie back to day to day life which is really interesting and gets us thinking about other questions we may have, it is a subject that can teach us more than what is just blatantly being taught. I am here because it is important that I have a basic understand of how things work in the world.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1526,"When I first think about this question, my first thought is because I have to be or because its a general requirement for my kinesiology degree. The more I think about this question though, I am in this class because I want to make a difference in peoples lives and this is a stop on my way there. For myself, I want to work with high school athletes, helping them rehab from injuries and learn how to listen to their bodies. In order to get here there are some steps I have to take along the way and this is one of them. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1527,"I am here because I have to. I need to be here to pass the class. I need to finish college soon so I can start working. I really want to start working to help pay off my moms house. I want to start saving up for my future too. I'm actually really tired of school, I'm not there biggest fan of it but I'm here because I have to. I'm not trying to stay poor. I'm here to learn I guess but really just to pass. Oh I'm here because I completed physics 101, I couldn't compete together because it would be too much work for me. For someone who wants to graduate early, doesn't want too much on their plate. Right now I making lunch because I'm hungry, its time for lunch anyway. Theres only soup in the kitchen but I'm not craving it. Soup is only good the day it made, fresh out the pot. So I guess I'll have to settle for some frozen tacos.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1528,"I am here to achieve my goals in life. This class is a requirement for my major, which will help me have the knowledge about the human body which will help me become a good doctor. I think it's important to know human anatomy when you want to become a doctor that deals with the body. In my case, it will be trauma, and a kinesiology major will help me. First I want to become an EMT, to gain experience and be their first hand to help. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1529,"I am a first year. During high school, I did not get the chance to take physics as an actual course, but not that the ides of physics did not interest me at all because the idea of physics DOES interest me. I just did not get the chance to take the class. Fast forward to the present, I actually had the choice to take this class, and I immediately knew that I wanted to, so I did exactly that. I watched various shows that included some topics about physics, but I never understood what the characters were talking about. Instead, I just assumed I knew what was being discussed. The reason I am here is to understand more and more about physics and the different concepts. I am simply here to learn about numerous topics in order to get a much better understanding of what it has to offer."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1530,"I feel that the reason I am here is because it is a pre-requisite for my major. As a kinesiology major there's a class called Biomechanics that I will be required to take in order to graduate. I also feel that that I am taking this course because I have never taken a physics class before not even in high school. I think that having a general understanding of how physics affects us on a day to day basis that we usually don't think about. I think that the other reason why I am here is because I was a little bit curious about what physics was back in high school when I saw some of my friends doing interesting labs during our block days. Although physics isn't my strong point, it does catch my attention because of some things that we do get to learn like aerodynamics and energy. I have a small interest in aerodynamics because I like cars and jets that the military uses and how they're able to fly at incredible speed. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1531,"I am here because this class is a required core-elective for my major. Unfortunately, I have zero interest in physics and its concepts, however, it is something I need to understand to be successful in my major. I am here to further my education and develop a better understanding on my subject of study. I believe that I was meant to be here, especially at SFSU. I had doubts making the move over here from LA, but I have been loving every minute over here. Being a whole 6 hours away from home, learning to live on my own while managing work and school at the same time, has been pretty stressful mentally. Although, I have been developing techniques and methods to manage stress, I am worried that it'll take control over me. I want to live at peace, and calmness despite the 6 class schedule I am working on. I know that SFSU is where I belong, despite me trying to petition last year to go to Northridge instead. I am genuinely happy that I get to further my education here with helpful and approachable professors the school has to offer.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1532,"The reason I am taking this class is for a general education requirement that I need in order to take an upper division class for my Kinesiology Major. However, I have always had curiosity when it comes to the matter of physics because of how unique it is and it does have really interesting topics or ideas that I want to know more about. Besides the fact of the requirements I need, I do enjoy lab activities whether that be simulations, projects, experiments, research, etc.. which also prompted me to take this class. I also wanted to expand my knowledge when it comes to the general topic of nature, and Physics is the area that discusses that topic. I know Physics can be a very challenging and complex subject, but I believe anyone can do it. Hopefully the topics, formula's, concepts, etc., that I am going to learn throughout this semester will help me in my future classes. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1533,"At first glance, I take this question from a metaphysical and philosophical perspective and I want to answer by explaining my existence on this Earth. While it being a rather grave and serious topic, I think it is a good practice to review my life so far, and what better way to do so than to document it here in this submission box for a prompt asking me to reflect on my existence for a Physics laboratory course. So I begin with stating that I am alive on this planet at this very point in time because my body has not failed me yet, with all of my physiological processes and internal homeostatic activities continuing to provide for my survival. I like to think that I have taken care of myself through healthy practices such as a balanced nutrition and regular exercise, and my body has taken care of me in turn by keeping me alive and well. As a result of my good health, my brain and heart and all of the above have kept me living and existing today. At second glance, the question may have simply been asking me to think about why I am taking this Physics laboratory, to which I respond in simple regards as well. It also makes a little more sense to answer the question about the course since it is in the context of the physics course, but I digress. I am here in this class because it is a prerequisite for the Kinesiology major to which I am interested in declaring, so I take it to satisfy the prerequisite and advance towards my endeavor to achieving a degree in Kinesiology."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1534,"I am here because I took the physics lecture class last semester. I know that I needed a lab class to fulfill my GE requirements and I really enjoyed physics last semester so I decided to take this lab over a biology or chemistry lab. For a deeper meaning, I am here because I am trying to graduate from college as efficiently as possible, thus I need this class to move on to my next steps. I am also here because I enjoy the concepts of physics because it is used so much in real life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1535,"Why am I here? Well there's a mainly one reason as to why I am here and that is for school. In order to be able to take other classes, I must take a physics lab. Not only that but it also goes towards my college degree. Although that is the main reason as to why I am here, another reason is that I am motivated to learn and understand what is being taught. I chose this class specifically because it worked out with my schedule, but after seeing as to who my teacher is and how my classmates are, I'm glad to be in this class. Coming to this class is great because the teacher is very understanding and although the students are quiet, they are still very helpful and participate. I am also here because this college is very close by and I do not have the privileged of going somewhere else. However, SF state does have a program for my major which I recently found out and I am glad to have chosen to come here rather than somewhere else. It has been a bit difficult getting to where I am today because I have been on my own for almost two years now and having to work and be a full time student is very difficult but I push myself to get through it and get to my goals faster rather than later."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1536,"When I think of physics I thing of how things move and energy. So I am here to learn about these topics with hopes of figuring out how to apply this to my real life situation. I coach and train youth athletes, which also involves motion and energy. So I am hoping it will allow me to have a better understanding of these things so I can figure out how to use what I learn and help athletes with their movements."
