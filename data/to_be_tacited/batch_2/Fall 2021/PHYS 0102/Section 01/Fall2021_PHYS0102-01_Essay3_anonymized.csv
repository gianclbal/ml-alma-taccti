2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1520,"If I’m being honest, I usually cry and throw a fit when life gets challenging or when I feel overwhelmed with school because I’m not the best under pressure. I hate feeling stressed out so I will cry for about five minutes then realize that I can do it I just have to pull myself together and put my mind to it. After getting motivation and finding a solution to my problem I usually feel better which helps me get through my problems. Sometimes when I have no motivation at all my best friend or sister pulls me aside or takes me out to reassure me that everything will be fine in the long run. I just have to give it time. I am thankful that I have someone to lean on because if I didn't have to support that I do, I would've probably given up or dropped out of college. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1532,"Whenever life gets challenging or there are challenges ahead, I tend to step back and try not to panic or think about it too much. I try not to overthink about the challenges, and I tell myself to keep calm and motivate myself with a little bit of a “pep talk”. Whenever challenges occur, I take it one by one and try to think of a plan on how I will tackle a certain challenge, what are the best ways I can handle this challenge, and what am I going to sacrifice to accomplish this challenge? Moreover, am I going to cancel certain plans that I have made to make more time to take on this challenge? But another thing that relieves me from challenging situations is by going to the gym or having to talk it out with my friends or girlfriend. They are always the first ones to help me through every situation that I find challenging.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1511,"When life gets challenging I ultimately keep pushing forward. Life continuously smacks us in the face but we do not have any other option than to keep moving forward and doing our best to get out of this difficult time. Sometimes it feels like it is impossible to get past the challenging times. When this is the case it takes a lot of time. I usually try and do everything I can to make myself happy because if I am completely unhappy then it will feel very impossible to do anything but be depressed and lay in bed. Examples of things I do to make myself happy are going outside for walks, meditation, seeing friends, exercising, reading self help books, etc. With that being said, it is very hard to get up and out when life is at a low. This takes a lot of push from yourself to get up and out and stop laying around sad and conflicted. Overall, when life gets challenging do not forget to do the things that make you happy and do not get caught up in the challenge and neglect your happiness. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1531,"Even at the most challenging times in my life, I felt that I was always able to be resilient, despite how bad the situation can be. During my free time, I love to do yoga and meditation. I feel that stretching out the body boosts my mood and my energy levels in a way no other activity has done for me. I do roller-skate as well which makes me happy. My other hobbies are pretty time consuming which it make it perfect for needing time to oneself, allowing me to reflect and control my thoughts and emotions during challenging times. When life gets challenging, I like to improve my skills in different things. I feel this skill-building technique allows me to be creative, as well as take control over things happening in my life by giving me time to think to myself as well as my hobbies. Meditation and yoga help by allowing thoughts to enter the mind while using different techniques to organize them. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1516,"When my life gets challenging, I usually try to accept the situations. For me, I haven't experienced any challenges in my life so far, but I think I might take it as a learning experience and try to deal with every situation step by step. I don't want to avoid these challenges, because if I don't try to solve these situations, other challenges will arise."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1522,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?""Normally when life gets challenging for me I try my best to push through. But sometimes I just drop everything and do not care about anything which leads to some bumps on the road. It tends to happen more frequently than someone would like it to happen. But then I always find something that keeps me going and tell myself it's okay if you missed that one assignment, it's not the end of the world in the grand scheme of things. But then also sometimes I think what if it is? Anyways, overall when life gets challenging to do my best to get through but sometimes I get in a rut & eventually keep going."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1507,"When life gets challenging it usually puts me in a minor setback stage where I feel super discouraged and sad for myself. That usually lasts for 15 minutes or so and then I'm ready to get after it. Meaning that I try to figure out ways to make my life a little better even if it's something like doing laundry. I like to make a list of goals for myself or errands I've been meaning to do, but just haven't gotten around to it. After completing a task on that list really helps boost my self-esteem helping me gain the confidence that life gets better. It's definitely hard not to get discouraged here and there, but the main thing is to not let it take over your mind completely. Another thing I like to do is go play soccer or hangout with my boyfriend. Both make me feel safe and make me forget all the bad things that are going on in my life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1508,When life gets challenging I like to relieve my stress by working out just to get my mind off things and then be able to come out with a plan. I am a person that likes to seek help so I like to talk to people to get their advice especially if I cant do it for myself or don't know what to do. Another thing that I do when things get challenging is watching Netflix just to make sure am not too stressed. This then helps me come up with a plan on how to approach this situation to come up with a good solution to come up with a good game plan. I also like to tell myself that everything is going to be okay. By doing this I will be able to come to get through any challenges like I have done before since this method helps me get through situations.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1515,"With every person in the world, you have the opportunity to face different challenges. In my opinion, whether we can overcome difficulties depends on our attitude towards challenges. I grew up in China. When I was 15 years old, my family and I immigrated to live in the United States. The first difficulty we faced was the language. Because we have different languages, we are always at odds with society. I also began to feel inferior and afraid of socializing, taking more time to understand and digest everything. In my opinion, the only way to change this situation is to find ways to learn to listen and speak. My first friend at school means a lot to me. I was glad that she was patient enough to answer my questions. So I think asking for help is also one of the ways to overcome difficulties."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1519,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" When life gets challenging, the one thing I would do to not think about life for a little while is to watch a show , movie, or even YouTube videos. W atching anything will get my mind of f of what I was thinking because I have to pay attention to what’ s on the screen and think about the plot as well. Sometimes this does not work because the show could lead me to think about life if the show is about life or how life could be. For example, when there are shows that portray the perfect lifestyle or the ideal life, it leads me to believe that I could have that life. I would be thinking about the ‘what ifs’. The shows that display the impossible are the ones that got me thinking the most. How perfect would it be to live in that world and have only a specific amount of worries instead of all in the world? Another thing I do to get my mind of f of my hard life is to sleep or take a nap. At first, I think about life, but then after I fall asleep, I usually forget all about it, and sometimes I force myself to think about certain things as I fall asleep."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1530,When life gets challenging I would do a couple of things I would take a step back and think about what makes the situation challenging and reproach it in a different way. When life does get challenging for me sometimes I tend to put off things that I was previously doing to get something done or simply procrastinate a little bit. Sometimes I would stop what I'm doing and get fresh air or go workout out to help me relieve the stress I would have from it. Another thing I do is just simply take a break and come back to what I was doing when I'm ready. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1533,"When life gets challenging, I like to take a step back and look at everything that is causing me stress. The first step in tackling these difficulties is by identifying them, so it is important for me to brainstorm all of them and write them down or make a mental note to recognize them as stressors. Becoming aware of the roadblocks in my life makes it easier for me to think of ways to address them. Instead of being overwhelmed by unknown problems, I can focus on an individual issue and go from there by looking for ways I can solve it. This focused confrontation with each item on my problems list allows me to be less swamped with the challenges and makes it more efficient for me in effectively reaching some solutions. Eventually, the original list will dwindle after addressing each issue one-by-one, and new challenges will come, but at least I have a method to take them on again. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1535,"When life becomes challenging, I tend to want to go away from it all. I will usually take a small break and head on up to visit my family since I am not with them. I also like to go on small vacations and explore around the area with my dog and my boyfriend. We tend to do a lot of hiking at many different places in order to get some air and to just breathe to get away from all of the things that are stressing us out. We also like to go to the beach and have a picnic or relax and take in the fresh air. By going out, it takes all of my focus on electronics and puts it away because I am so interested in the view and what is around me.  There are times however where I stay in bed and don't really want to do much just because I get very tired easily and I take a bath and a nap after to just relax and do my own thing."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1510,"When life gets challenging, I just suck it up and keep on rolling. I usually try to not stress to much or worry about little things in life that I know I can't control. Mostly I just go with the flow and whatever happens just happens. Life right now isn't too difficult but coming to the end of college, life is starting to catch up. I don't know what my future really is going to be but everyday I try to enjoy my doing things I like such as gaming and playing basketball, or even listening to music and being able to have my own space. Hopefully I can figure everything out and set myself up for the future, but I know the challenges in life I have to face myself if I actually want to do what I want to do rather than doing stuff in my life that I have to do as a result of me not making sure I'm headed the right way."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1534,"When life gets challenging, I will usually take a step back and try to understand my situation and what I am up against. Even when life gets challenging, I try not to let it get to my head and stress over it. Mostly, I would step away and do something that I enjoy, and come back after a bit to figure it out. I also realize that everyone's life will at one point become challenging, so understanding that everyone else also goes through with this type of stuff makes me feel like worrisome about my situation. Overall, I try to figure out solutions to make my life less challenging when I am faced with problems that make my life challenging."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1518,When life gets challenging I like to slow down and take some time to myself and do things that I enjoy. I like to draw or paint as a way to take my mind off of things and escape into something. I also enjoy learning new songs to play on my ukulele because music is something I use as a stress reliever. I also like to get outside into the fresh air and go on a hike or take my dog for a walk. Physical activity is another thing that I turn to when the going gets tough. Endorphins help me feel happier and I can channel the negative energy into lifting weights. I will also turn to my friends and the little family I have if I am in need of someone to talk to or any kind of advice. I also have my dog who never fails to put a smile on my face when things are tough.

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1514,"Life can be difficult at times, and there will be many ups and downs, but I keep strong and inspired because there is always hope at the end of the tunnel. I believe that the difficulties are only transitory, and I try to remain optimistic no matter how difficult things become. I also like to bring the issues to the notice of my parents as it makes me feel light and good. I share everything with my mom and then she helps me calm myself and even helps me with any problem I face. Freaking out when things get challenging or difficult can never help one so I try to take deep breathes and try to process things calmly. Even though I cry sometimes seeing everything getting difficult around me, but the people around me really motivate me. Its like I just never want to stop; maybe I just want to walk slowly at times, but just never want to stop or look behind. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1521,"I have crippling anxiety and I am heavily medicated for it but obviously, medication can only help so much. So, personally, when life gets challenging for me my anxiety raises making it harder for me to complete regular tasks. Tasks such as eating, getting out of bed, drinking water, or complete my homework and studies. I also shake a lot when my anxiety raises which makes it extremely hard for me to properly sleep. Honestly, when life becomes hard I feel like giving up and not doing anything anymore even though I know I can't do that. While it is very hard for me to get out of my anxious episodes I know I have deadlines and I have to go to work so I pull myself out of my episodes using that as a motivation. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1512,"When life gets challenging I try to calm myself and think of what is with in my control. If I  can control that certain aspect of life that is causing me difficulty or is challenging me then I try to correct it so that it wont bother me. However sometimes life can just happen and become challenging out of the blue but one thing I like to tell me self is to never give up have hope and and just take life a day at a time. These  challenging situations can be stressful but one must always remember to keep calm, keep your composure and think it through."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1513,What I do when life gets challenging is take control of my breathing and be aware of my surroundings. I also play some relaxing music in order to calm down and relax in order to not stress out as much. I sometimes also go to my workout in order to keep my mind off schoolwork and take a break and then come back to my work. It depends on how difficult of a week I’m having. If I am having a more difficult week than usual then I tell myself that this week is almost over and that a new week is going to start with hopefully less assignments. That way I get to have some free time to relax and enjoy the rest of my week. I do this around almost every week and tell myself that I have to do it all over again for this coming week in order to prepare myself for the upcoming assignments.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1525,When life gets challenging I am not so great at dealing with it I usually ignore the problem at hand or avoid it. I use to work a lot a lot and would pick up more shifts when something was not going great so that I don't have to think about it and it's a really bad habit that I have. Before I started doing that I would do a lot of self reflection and yoga when things get hard and I hope to get back into it because obviously avoiding is not a healthy way of coping and everything comes back around sooner or later. I am currently really enjoying walks to help clear my head but I seem to be going on them more and more and it is almost becoming an avoidance thing as well so I definitely need to find some new outlets.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1528,"What I do when life gets challenging is take a step back, analyze the situation, and come up with the best solution I can to solve my problems. I don't ignore the situation or take a step back and relax because I still need to solve the situation. Other times where I can't fix the situation because it is not in my control, I like to play music, play games with my friends, and work out also. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1529,"Something that I learned whilst being in school or around family, is that it's best to back away from it when under too much stress or even in a bad mindset. Right now, the only things that are at the top of my mind is family and school so whenever I worry about any of those things, days get tougher and longer. ""Life gets challenging."" Overthinking is another thing that plays a role in this whole thing, so I know that I have to clear my mind and just do something else like listen to music or even go for a skate. Overall, stepping back and taking a break is very essential for anyone's health especially when you know it's getting to a bad point."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,1,1509,"Life is actually challenging at the moment and I just begin with remembering that there are actually others who have it worse than me, being catholic in times like this my mother tells my siblings and me that “God gives his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers” so this is what seems to help. Also, going over to family members' houses and spending quality time with them helps me out. Not just that but I also found that doing the things I love most well my hobbies like going to the park with my brothers and or cousins and shooting around the basketball also helps. At challenging times like this, I have learned over time that it is important to stay positive, kind of just take it day by day, and to be grateful for everything from waking up, coming back home to having food to eat, warm showers, and so forth."
