2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1580,"Reflection 4 The values of my family helped me navigate through college by motivating me to become a successful person. Another thing is giving me support or advice when I run into obstacles so I can overcome them. In my culture (Filipino), people find ways to overcome any problems or difficulties they run into, and they would never give up no matter how dif ficult the situation gets. For me, I try my best in college and never give up when it gets dif ficult so that I would be able to finish of f strong and make my family and friends proud."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1586,"Reflection #4 ""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" The values of my family have helped me navigate college because my family has taught me that the importance of hardwork and persistence can get you anywhere you want in life. Growing up I was raised by my mom who is from Thailand, and my dad who is from Haiti. They were both raised by immigrant parents and learned how to work very hard in life for what they want. I’ve been watching my parents work so hard for everything since I can remember, that it makes me want to become a hardworker as well - especially in college. I was always told school was a super important part of life, and it can lead you down a great path. So I have always wanted to get my degree so that I can make my family proud and have a great future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1584,"The values of my family have helped me be more confident in college. They help me by showing me that I can get through anything with hard work. This year has been rough for me, but I try to keep working hard so that I can get through college and everything involved in it. They have also taught me confidence and how if I have confidence in what I do, I can do anything I put my mind to."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1587,"I do not think the values of my community help me significantly navigate through college since I am studying abroad, and I just do not find a connection with the people who make me part of something. The Asian American community is unfamiliar to me even though we share similar cultures or traditions. However,  the values of my family certainly guide me through daily life and at school. Neither of my parents went to college, but they understand it is not easy and always tell me not to give up on my passion for chasing the long-term goal. Also, I gain more grit and persistence by engaging in regular physical training. I can picture how high I can achieve with patience and determination, which mentality could also be applied in learning at school."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1579,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" This essay is meant to remind you that who you are, your values, and the people that are important to you are strengths. This is not meant to be a formal essay. It should be stream-of-consciousness writing from the heart. You will be graded on participation only, not on the specifics of what you say.  5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150-200 words. After you finish your essays, we will provide some class time to discuss your thoughts, to the extent that you feel comfortable sharing. The values of my community and family really encouraged and pushed me to receive higher education. Almost to the point where I felt like I had no choice but to go to college. I wanted to go and having them pushing me forward even when things got hard really helped my confidence and without them, I might have given up while applying. Growing up, academics were above anything else. Family events, sports games/practices, vacations, etc. were all second to school and there were no workarounds for it. I hated it at the time, but now looking back, I can see how it taught me a proper work ethic and time management. My parents didn’t go to college and they both regret not going, so for my sister and me, that meant that they made sure we both went and received our higher education. In today’s world, it is near impossible if not impossible to live comfortably with a job that doesn’t require some sort of degree. Being pushed to college is a privilege I’m lucky to have and I’m hoping I don’t waste this opportunity."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1581,"Maria Bonillas Physics 101 10/28/21 Reflection W eek 10: My family has helped me navigate through college by pushing me to do my best and don't give up so easily. Navigating the new experience and life journey as a college student. My older sister has guided me through applying to colleges and navigating me through options. Understanding that it's okay to challenge yourself. It won't always be easy but it's to break that cycle in our family's generation. To do bigger things after college. Acknowledging that I'm the second generation to attend college. Trying to make my parents proud and to appreciate what I am doing for them. Even if it does get challenging , I still show up as a college undergrad student. I still try to maintain my homework and social life outside of school. So, my family are the ones who push me to do better and be better. Never give up without trying. Just try to live the experience of a college student."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1583,"Reflection 4  The values of my family have definitely shaped me both from a positive aspect as well as from the negative in all aspects of my life. I am the first college graduate in my entire family tree so more than anything I would say that the struggle that I seen from my single mother is something that I knew I didn’t want to do for my entire life or have my children go through. Due to this exposure I have always been a strong willed, determined, goal-oriented person that developed at a very young age when I realized that is what it would take in order for me to change my family dynamics. These values or developed traits are something that I try to use in every aspect of my life to include college. I graduated with my bachelor’s degree while being an active-duty military member working 10-12 hour days. I would not have had the ability to do those things if it wasn’t for those values that I developed at a very young age."
