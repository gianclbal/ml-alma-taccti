2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1581,"Maria Bonillas 12/10/21 Physics Lab 102 What resources do I have to support me? The resources I have to support me are my family , instructors, and friends. My family can be a helpful resource. In a way if I'm having self doubt about college, they are the ones to bring me up and support me for what I am doing and trying. Along with my instructors being a reliable resource. They are very helpful towards me in a way of academic support. If I am struggling in an academic area, they are there to guide me along the way to reach my understanding. Lastly , my friends are a very supportive resource considering if I need to get something of f my chest or talk about my day , they are there to listen to what I have to say . Even if we are hanging out or communicating over the phone. I can rely on them as they can towards me. If they need some additional support from a friend. I am right there hanging on their words. I am very thankful to know that my resources are there if I need them in support."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1584,"The resources that I have to support me are my family and friends. My family and friends help me out through everything that I need. I wish I knew more resources at school that can help me, but I don’t even know who my academic advisor is. I don’t even know where to find this information and every time I had a problem in school, I got barely any help. I really just use my family and friends for help even though they do not know that much about my school, we figure it out together. I really wish that this school was more helpful to their students because I struggle a lot with financial aid stuff and with academic counseling stuff. It’s hard to figure it out on your own because none of the people that work in the offices like financial aid are very helpful."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1582,There are a few resources on campus that I have available to me. I am apart of EOP and my first two years I was apart of a METRO which helped me a lot especially when it came to registering for classes for the first time and helping me pick the general classes that I needed for my major. I also use the tutoring resource a lot because sometimes I get confused with certain assignments and seek more assistance. Also another resource I use is my professor's office hours this helps me a lot and that way I can keep track of how i'm doing in the class or if in that particular class if I need more assistance its cool to be able to drop in class.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1583,"Reflection #5   Michael Prater   12/9/2021   There are many resources out there for everyone but for me specifically I can count on the  following resources. To start obviously, my family are the strongest resource that I have to fall  back on when I am struggling, lacking confidence and needing that extra push for these last  couple weeks of the semester. Outside of those I have resources such as the VA that offers me  support in many different areas such as free education, free medical, free support group s etc.  Also after running through the school website SFSU seems to offer quite a few different support  systems for those who find themselves struggling throughout the long semesters."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1587,"What resources do I have to support me?  	My parents are the most significant support to help to obtain my degree and even pursue higher education. The college tuition can be exorbitant for international students who does not have a green card, and it is impossible to finish school without my parents finically support. Moreover, I talk to my academic advisor regularly to make sure taking the right classes and keep everything on track. My advisor also gives me many recommendations regarding graduate school. I decided to get my graduate degree in either japan or the UK; even though not many Professors know school information abroad, they still can tell me what school might potentially offer the best program for me. I understand SFSU has a lot more resources that I could utilize, but it is more difficult to get instantly help due to the pandemic when we could get walk into the office back everything was normal."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1580,Reflection 5 The first resource I have to support me is my family . My family is the people I would go to if I need support because they would give me advice or help if there are obstacles. Another resource I have to support me is my friends.

The professors I have are a resource to support me because they would ask if I need help or more clarification on something.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1586,"Reflection #5 ""What resources do I have to support me?"" From the start of childhood I have been fortunate enough to have a resource to support me. That resource is my family and community . Whenever I have troubles or need support, or an opinion on something I run to my mom and dad. Both of my parents have attended college and have guided me and supported me the whole way through. I will never take for granted how much love and support they give me. As well as my community that I grew up in, Cambrian Park school district has provided me with resources and a platform to be academically successful. So I have had and have resources that support me and make me feel seen and heard, and help me when I need."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1579,"""What resources do I have to support me?"" The resource that immediately pops into my head when asked this question is my friends. I think my friends are an incredible resource to me because although we all come from different walks of life, they provide perspective to topics that I am struggling with. I chose my friends over my family because although my family is also a resource for me, they lack the perspective of my age group and what I am going through. My friends, who are roughly the same ages as I understand what it’s like to be a college student during the pandemic whereas my family doesn’t. My friends are especially a resource to me mentally where I tend to dive into myself and suffer in silence. They distract me from my problems and help me get through some tough times. Academically, they are also great resources because since some of them are older than I am and one is even the same major as me, they give insight into how I should pick classes, how to do certain things, and just advice they wish they knew when they were in my position. I am thankful for them and everything that help and provide me with."
