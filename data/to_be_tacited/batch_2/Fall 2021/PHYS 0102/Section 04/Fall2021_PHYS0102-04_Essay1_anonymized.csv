2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1578,"Name: Teresa Allysa Onia Section: PHY 102.04 R e f l e c t i o n Why am I here? I am here because I want to become a nurse and in order to get there, I need a degree and this class was recommended to me by my counselor. I chose nursing because I thought that there was a variety of specialties that I could choose from. I wanted to have a better future not just for myself but also for my family because I am a first generation student and I know how hard my parents worked just to provide for me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1579,"I’m here to receive my higher education so that I can pursue my dream career. More specifically, I’m in this physics lab class because I needed it to fulfill my GE requirements. I chose conceptual physics because I was told it had less math and was much easier than other physics classes. I’m not really sure what the exact differences are between each physics class, but hopefully, this one is a bit easier. As a STEM major, I’m already taking a lot of science and math courses, so I wanted to have at least one science class I wasn’t stressing and wanting to drop out from. Through this class and every class I’m taking, I want to become more educated in my field, kinesiology so that I can one day become an athletic trainer. Without attending college, it is impossible for me to become one, let alone get a job that pays enough for me to live comfortably in California. So, I am here to secure a position in a job where I can live comfortably and receive degrees to help me along my future occupation journey."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1580,"Reflection 1 The reason I am here is to have goals and make those around me happy . My goal in life is to be successful and be financially stable so I can be able to get anything I desire and not worry about losing anything. For me to achieve this goal, I have to do well in school and secure a stable job that I will enjoy doing. The people who are significant in my life will be happy with the goal that I have because they know that I worked hard to become successful and be proud of what I achieved in life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1581,"Why am I here? When I hear this question I think about what I am doing now . That is attending school. I figured why work a half job that pays tightly , when I can attend back to school and a career that may pay successfully . It doesn't necessarily have to be as much but good to live kindly . This came from an experience of working at a fast food restaurant for 2 weeks. Therefore, this class I am taking. Which of course is Conceptual Physics Laboratory is for my General Education form. Although I am here to get a better job for my future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1582,"Why am I here I am here because I have a goal and I want to be as successful as I can be. I want to learn all that I can learn so that I can teach others and use my knowledge to help others out. I am also a first generation college student so I am striving to make a difference in my family and show them that anything is possible. I have goals and dreams and nothing or nobody will ever get in the way of that because I work too hard and I motivate myself everyday! I will not stop until I reach ABOVE AND BEYOND THE TOP. I am here because this is my passion, this is what I love to do, I love to learn. This isn’t easy but its well worth it and i'm so happy that I had the opportunity to seek higher education because it is well worth it to me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1583,"Reflection #1 Michael Prater 9/9/2021 “Why am I here?” This question is one that my wife and I discuss all of the time as both of us are pretty deep thinkers and enjoy thinking about all aspects of life in different lights. Growing up in a small town in the bible belt I was taught that our life is supposed to be used in a form of religion. However, after leaving this area and meeting people of all types of religions and even no religion. I believe that my outlook has definitely changed in many areas when it comes to “why I am here?”."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1584,"I think I am here to help people. I think my purpose is to help people. All my life I have been wanting to help people in any way I can. Every job that I have thought about having as a career in the future involved me helping people in some way or another. I don’t know why I think this way, but I really do believe my purpose is to help people. It might have to do with my being the oldest sibling. I grew up helping my parents around the house and helping my younger siblings with things like school work and advice. I am also a huge empath. I feel for other people so deeply. When others are struggling, I just want to help them with whatever I can. I have always been a peacemaker in life. In every social setting or group, I always want everyone to be happy. I think thats what my purpose in life is. As a kid, my dream jobs were always things like doctor, social worker, lawyer, and even president. I always had this overwhelming urge that I want to have an impact on people’s lives. I want to be able to say that I have impacted people’s lives in a positive way and I have helped them. This might be actually selfish to say, but it’s just what I want in life. I don’t want to be famous or a millionaire, I want to help people. I don’t even think I could become a millionaire because I would want to redistribute my wealth. I just feel like the world is so cruel and unfair to some people and I just want to help in any way that I can."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1585,Why am I here?  	I am here because I want to pursue in Physical therapy helping injured clients in need to live with basic necessities and functions that are part of their life. Conceptual physics lab is part of the pre requisites of Kinesiology that I must accomplish to progress further in route of my physical therapy career. Before I majored in computer science and I changed after realizing that I do not like solving problems in one sitting for 6 to 8 hours a day. So I reflected on myself and what I would like to do and one part is that I like to help others. I also keep positive thoughts most of the time when times are hard or not. I am also into fitness and love to exercise specifically body building and weight loss as it is part of my lifestyle. So with those consideration and more I have decided to become a Physical Therapist.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1586,"Why Am I Here? I think about this question a lot honestly . Why am I here? In high school, my weight training teacher asked us “ what’ s your why '', and she made everyone come up in front of the class and talk about our why . Which essentially is like the same question as why am I here. That day that I had to think about my why , and I realized that I am here for love. Love from my family , friends, significant others and even strangers. I love.. Love and I love to feel love, be loved, and give love. And it makes me want to be a better person, and make everyone proud. I love those around me, and it makes me want to stick around to see what everyone around me is doing or achieving, and vice versa."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1587,"It is pretty hard to answer with a couple of sentences, but I am here to fulfill my major requirement, Kinesiology, and learn about fundamental physics to be prepared for more upper-division classes in the future. I have already taken the lecture part at a community college, so I am pretty familiar with the content. However, I realize that I must use a lot of concepts from physics to answer questions in other classes this semester. Taking the lab portion, I believe I can strengthen what I have already learned in the past, and more importantly, have fun with classmates since I love any lab more than the lectures, and the lab is all about cooperation."
