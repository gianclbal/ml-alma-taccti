2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1579,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?"" My goals for this year are to be a better student and have better studying and academic practices. Last year when we were online, I had no motivation or accountability for myself to study hard and do my absolute best. This year even though this class is online, I am living on campus and I feel more motivated to try hard. For some reason, while living on campus, it feels more real and not like an extension to my senior year of high school. This class is helping me a lot actually in achieving these goals because one, the group I am with to do the labs is incredibly nice and I feel comfortable asking questions and expressing to them when I don’t get it. Where last year I would skip questions until after they discussed and then just fill them in. In a similar way, I also feel more comfortable with this professor asking him questions and having him go to our breakout room to explain them. Usually when my group is stuck (last year), we would just assume an answer and all agree on it. But, this professor really takes the time to explain thoroughly and from all angles which I am really grateful for. This encourages me to learn more and to study harder to be a better student and to try my absolute best."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1581,"My goal is to learn how we use physics in our daily life and to pass my physics class. This class is helping me achieve my goals by gaining the knowledge from my professors to help me with my assignments that are given. Along with using this knowledge to help me observe how I use physics daily. I wasn't very good at any type of science, so for me to learn real world situations can benefit me personally and academically. Like recently I have learned that just walking is an exerting force. An action that is a pull from the body by friction or gravity. Also that with no friction, everything would be sliding. Furthermore, learning basic real world problems can help me with my daily physics wonders which can have a benefit on my assignments more. Not just looking at a paper and answering further questions. Therefore, this class can help me achieve my goals."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1580,Reflection 2 My goal is to pass this semester with good grades and stay on track to graduate as planned. This class is helping me to reach my goals because this class is needed to finish one of the requirements that I need to graduate. Another goal is to be successful in life and be financially stable. This class is helping to reach that goal because I can work hard in this class and overcome any obstacles that I would encounter .
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1585,"My goals are to achieve and pass this class. I also want to be able to apply physics into real world life, so it makes it more interesting for me to live. This class will help me learn more about this world in a basic sense, but regardless of it would still be fun to apply some of the physics that we learn in the lab into real world examples. Also, I hope this class will show me a better understanding of physics. Another goal is hoping that his class will help me with my future career in physical therapy. I am hoping there most or at least one lab will let me apply physics in physical therapy."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1587,"It is crucial to have both long-term and short-term goals for me since long-term goals are usually pretty hard to achieve and having short-term goals can keep me feel less stressed and ensure that I can be on the right track. Starting with my short-term goal, I hope I can get my bachelor's in Kinesiology within three years total and get into the master's program that I want to.  Taking this class can help me strengthen what I have learned, which applies to many subjects such as biomechanics and anatomical kinesiology. Furthermore, I want to be a strength and conditioning coach in the professional sports industry. I already planned out how I will get there, and I think I just need to follow my plan and stay persistent to accomplish my goal."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1584,"My goals at the moment are just to graduate with a biology degree. I used to have bigger goals, but last year being all on line kind of took the motivation out of me, so for now I’m just thinking about the close future and going for that biology degree. This class is going to help me because it is going to give me the baseline understanding for physics. This is my first physics class that I have ever taken, so it is really important for me to set the foundation. I have been in kind of a slump since being online for college, so I feel like I should make more goals to look forward to that are closer to reach, like getting all A’s this semester or applying for at least 10 scholarships. I’m trying really hard to find the motivation again, so I think i’m going to start making more goals for myself. Maybe I’ll write them down."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1583,"Reflection 2 Michael Prater My goals are to pursue medical school and become a physician. This class is helping me in many ways to achieve this goal but the most profound would be that it is helping me understand how things work at a deeper level. This class also requires critical thinking skills and because of that this class is helping me sharpen those skills. Critical thinking is not mutual exclusive to being a medical physician but it is highly needed for that occupation. The act of understanding why something works the way that it does and not just understanding that it works is vital in any medical profession. I believe that we should have more classes such as physics taught in lower level school (middle school, high school) because critical thinking is not something that is in abundance in many areas around where I grew up. For example, the debate between being vaccinated or not and COVID in general. 99% of people could regurgitate what their new station talks about it but I would bet only 1% of those people could tell you how a vaccine in general even works or even care to learn."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1588,My education goals would be to just be well educated on things that interest me and not be  stressed out daily. With this class I’m planning on learning a lot more on physics and being  more hands on even though its online. Since I’m interested in the class  I feel as if it helps me  achieve my goals by interesting me enough to be well educated on the subject.
