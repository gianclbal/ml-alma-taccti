2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1585,"Francis Quang PHYS 102-04 Reflection #3 	When life gets challenging, I would start meditating and refocusing on what my goals are. I also go exercise in the gym lifting weights to relieve the stress. Meditating is a very great method to start the day so I can get my mindset to plan out the day and refocus my mind on my goals. Exercising is also a great method so we can get away for a little bit with reality and use this time for ourselves to improve in our health and body. Music is also a great way to relax to recollect ourselves then go back into going to work. Another method is playing video games with a mean of an escape. To be immersed into a different world stress free and more entertaining for me. Talking to close ones are also a great way to vent with what is struggling our lives and that they can give feedback or other ideas to help that struggle and give a push to keep going with motivating and supporting words."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1586,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" What do I do when lifes gets challenging? Well to be honest I cry . I cry a lot. There is just something about crying that releases stress and things aren’ t going the way they’re supposed to. Though after crying i’ve learned you have to get up and keep going. I will usually talk to my family or friends about the challenges that ive been facing, and they give me advice or cheer me up and make me feel better . It is always good to talk your problems out, because I think they get more jumbled when you keep them in your head. Yet when life gets challenging, I have to remind myself life goes on, and I am where i’m supposed to be. I just have to get through it with those who love me helping me out."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1581,"What do I do when life gets challenging? What I do when life gets challenging like stressful. I will sometimes make a to-do list. This helps me organize my thoughts a bit more and to see what needs to be done. I also write down on my to-do list things I can control instead of writing something down that I have no control over. Oftentimes I’d listen to some music or listen to inspirational videos: like motivation speakers, to help me get back on my feet. Feeling stressed and overwhelmed is kinda a downer so I tend to use this technique to maybe pick some sort of myself up. Another time is to accept what is and acknowledge that others are either going through worse or the same as me. I have many techniques or things I do when I feel like my life is beginning to be challenging. Another one is, taking a walk. Taking in a breath of fresh air to calm myself and to not overthink on a situation. Understanding everything is going to be okay sooner or later."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1583,"Reflection #3 Michael Prater  Life is full of challenges and it is not a matter of “if” you will face them but when you will face them and to the level of difficulty those challenges will bring. With the looming of challenges that we know we will face it is imperative that we figure out a healthy way to deal with these and they will not be the same for each person. Personally, when those challenges hit I try to breakdown what that (those) challenge(‘s) are because often times those challenges aren’t as heavy as we initially perceive them to be. When I do this I can take the time to realize that I have been through worse and I have conquered more than this often temporary challenge. This helps relieve that initial fight or flight response that causes so much anxiety within myself and allows me to tackle this challenge as it is."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1579,"When life gets hard and I start to struggle more, whether it’s with school, my mental health, family, etc. I tend to retreat into myself and become more reserved. I am the type of person to listen and be there as best as I can for others but hate to confide my problems with them. I feel like a burden when I do that. If I do talk to someone about it, it’ll be my two best friends back home that have been my best friends since we were born… literally, our parents were best friends growing up. When life gets hard I go to them and they are like two sides of conscience and I absolutely love that about them. One is more logical and leads a life with her head and radical decisions, whereas one leads with her heart and follows life with her emotions. They give me both sides to every problem and help me through anything I need. Without them, I shut myself in my room and I just throw myself into school or work. I tend to look tired, or so I’m told, and I live life by going through the motions until either I’ve gotten over everything or it passes by."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1584,"When life gets challenging for me, it’s hard for me to continue to finish my work and priorities. I need to take a lot of breaks when I feel like this. I like to go to the gym to workout and relieve stress. I struggle with bipolar disorder, so sometimes I go through depressions where life is really challenging and I struggle to get out of bed. When this happens, I need to remind myself that I need to go out, get fresh air, something to eat, and distract myself from whatever is making life challenging at the moment. I also like to be around friends that make me forget about the challenges. Once I get out of the funk, then I start to focus on what I was ignorning during the funk."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1587,"What do I do when life gets challenging?  I have not felt that my life gets challenging for a long time since I do not work, and the only thing that I need to worry about is school. The classes I am taking during this semester can sometimes be challenging, but I think they are all reasonably manageable. However, I feel stress if I do not have good performance during my workout sessions because of sleep, diet, and some other influences, which is probably the only factor that can make me feel my life is challenging. Due to my future career path and personal goal, I must conduct resistance training on a daily basis with a well-designed program. I try to do some light conditioning with my girlfriend, such as a 30-minute walk can make me mentally and physically relax and understand that I cannot be perfect every day. I just need to work hard like usual to make good progress and persist."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,4,1582,When life gets challenging I think of different things that I can do to get my mind off whatever it might be that’s causing a Challenge in my life. It seems like something is always going on every time something good is happening… something bad comes up. I am a really determined person so no matter what happens I just keep on going and hope things get better. I also go to the gym. This helps me a lot. Not only helps me to be in better shape physically but it also clears my mind and helps me mentally. I also love to listen to music and it really relaxes me and helps me to get my mind off anything that is stressing me out. Another thing is write down anything that I feel is affecting me and my life and figure out a solution to get rid of it.
