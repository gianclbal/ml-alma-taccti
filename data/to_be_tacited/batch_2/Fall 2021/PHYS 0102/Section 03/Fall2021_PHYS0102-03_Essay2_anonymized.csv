2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1576,I feel like my goals reflect upon who I want to be as a person. These are reflected across many aspects from my profession/work goals to my social life. Long term goals I have created are achieving my kinesiology degree here at SFSU and soon after getting my Physical Therapist certification. Short term goals could also be completing all my assignments on time or catching up on any previous assignments by a certain date. Something currently I am working on is trying to get my weight up and improve my mental health through physical health improvements. All this is just changing based on the situation I am in. When new opportunities or setbacks come up then I can add or go back on anything I established prior. This class helps me complete aspects of my career related goals of achieving my education and furthering my degree standing. Alongside that it helps me understand aspects of physics and how that is incorporated into my understanding of kinesiology.

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1571,"Patrick Chung PHYS 102 9/9/21 Michelle Chong Reflection #2  As of right now, my goals are to maintain a good status with my academics. I am currently managing both school and work right now and time management must be on point. I am looking forward to formulating a schedule that benefits all fields of my life right now. I dedicate much of my on-campus time in the library, grinding through online classes or readings. On the weekends, I work the morning shifts and then follow up with some more reading and studying. Usually after work, it is quite difficult to switch gears and focus on schoolwork. This class is by far my longest one and the last class I have before the weekend, I am hoping that I can manage to absorb all the material without feeling too burnt out from the previous days."

My goal in life is to work with professional athletes, athletes who are trying to transform and improve their athletic abilities to achieve their competitive goals. Human athleticism is a combination of genetics and effort. Even though we can’t tamper with genetics and change our genes we still have a lot of room to work with the effort part where training specifically for athleticism by understanding the science behind our physiology. Physics plays a key role in athleticism since certain angles, planes of motion, other principles such as levers and pulleys which are basically directly shadowed in our body (bones and joints). This class is helping me revise, learn concepts and apply them to my training regimen."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1574,"My long-term 10 year goal is to eventually become a medical doctor.  My shorter-term goals leading up to that long-term goal are to graduate with a bachelor’s degree in kinesiology in the fall of next year and then either move on to UC Berkely to do pre-med requirements or apply to the program at SF state.  I am anticipating that the pre-med requirements will take around two years to complete.  Upon approaching completion of the pre-med requirements I will begin the application process for medical school and preparing for the MCATs and interviews.  This class is helping me reach that goal because it’s preparing me to take the next step which will prepare me for the next step and so on and so forth.  Getting an A in this class not only prepares me for future classes or tests but also increases my chances of med school acceptance by raising my GPA, so its kind of a two-fold benefit."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1577,My goal is to graduate college with a degree in computer science and this class is necessary for me to get that degree. My goal for this class is to gain an understanding of the topic and leave with a passing grade. I'm sorry but the level of physics knowledge in this class is more than I need to live my happy life and to be entirely honest I don't need this knowledge to live the life I want just to get the degree I want.

My long-term goals include working with professional soccer athletes and professional soccer teams to improve their players strength, fitness, and to keep them healthy. Another long-term goal, which will most likely be a long-life journey is to master by craft and be one of the greatest to do it. This class is also helping me achieve that goal by giving me the foundation necessary to build my skills. Another goal that I have is to use my profession to be able to help communities and people in need. I believe no one person should ever go to sleep hungry."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1558,"Isabelle Gutierrez Phys 102 ""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?"" This essay is meant to connect you to your purpose. This is not meant to be a formal essay. It should be stream-of-conciousness writing from the heart. You will be graded on participation only, not on the specifics of what you say. 5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150-200 words. My goals are all over the place, but I don’t think that’s a bad thing. We only have one life, so why not live it up to the fullest? Two of my main goals are to be happy and to be healthy. Health is wealth and happiness is what makes us feel whole. Personal goals include traveling the world and experiencing all kinds of different cultures, religion, and food. It also includes living on the East Coast for a few years, but then settling in sunny San Diego with a golden retriever named Buster. My career goals include getting my Master’s of Nursing, becoming a registered NICU nurse, and (maybe) opening my own practice. Go big or go home! All I desire in this life is to be financially stable, successful and happy in my career, see the world, be an amazing parent, and to meet and marry my soulmate. But as of right now, I aspire to get straight A’s for the third semester in a row and graduate with my Bachelors of Kinesiology. As a first generation student, this is a must to receive my degree with all eyes on me."

Also I definitely think that attending your classes, participating, and    making relationships is a major key to having a successful school year because it will    prepare you for the real world. What I mean by “real world” is jobs that you will be    encountering. Y ou will be meeting people that are going to be your allies and others that    are not going to be your allies. That's how the real world works, not everyone is going to    be friendly or nice."
