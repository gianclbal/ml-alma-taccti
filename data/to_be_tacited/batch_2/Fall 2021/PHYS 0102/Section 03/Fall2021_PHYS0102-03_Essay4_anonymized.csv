2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1572,"PHYS 102 – Reflection#4 How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college? I think many of the values and beliefs I have now through growing up with my traditional Asian parents have shaped and helped me navigate through college. One of the fundamental beliefs I have is to always give everything a try even if I don’t think I will like it. This mindset helps me try out new things that are out of my comfort zone and helps me grow as a person throughout college. A simpler way to say it is “do what excites”. I am also a very family orientated person so when I meet new people, I tend to look for people who I can ride or die with, and I tend to stay away from people who are “fake”. It is something I learned through family and community experiences. I think many of my values are based off of things my parents taught me."

My family has experienced college  and I wasn’t the first one, but they haven’t  attended college in the United States. It’s a totally different experience and I had  no one to get advice from due to this. I moved out of my house at 17 and moved to  the United States and figured out my colleg e and life experience as an individual.  My family helped by supporting my mentally and financially to an extent. They  taught to be an explorer and not get afraid of new circumstances."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1571,"Reflection #3   Community has been one of the few things that never fail to motivate me. Especially this time  around my life, I have needed community more than ever. I decided to life alone in San  Francisco, managing rent, bills, and groceries while working a part -time jo b and being a full -time  student. I have learned more in these past two months than I have in the past twenty years of  my life, both the good and the bad lessons. I reach out to my close friends quite frequently,  living alone does get a bit quiet at times, and I also enjoy hearing what they are up to in life. We  constantly talk about the good and bad times and how we can help each other through the rainy  days. I still strive to learn and continue to look out for myself but at the same time, I keep close  with my community."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1565,"Anastasia Balthasar For 5 minutes, journal reflectively on: ""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" This essay is meant to remind you that who you are, your values, and the people that are important to you are strengths. This is not meant to be a formal essay. It should be stream-of-conciousness writing from the heart. You will be graded on participation only, not on the specifics of what you say.  5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150-200 words. The values of my community or my family have strongly navigated my experience through college. From a young age we are put into school from our parents, we are told to behave, we are told to do well in school so we can move on to the next grade and if we dont we have fear of being left behind. Society puts pressure on students to get to highschool, to take the best AP classes so we can get into a UC. Never really leaving the thinking up to the students. I feel like I have been doing what I was told to do since kindergarten. Working harder than everyone in my class because things in school don't come easy to me. I have navigated through college with just the hope that I can survive that semester. My family, especially my Mom, really pressures me to do well, and although I have been doing well in college I still feel so much pressure being put on my shoulders. I have always been extremely family oriented and have felt (within my own merit) that I have to do well and be able to give back to my family because they have nothing. They live penny to penny and I’ve always wanted to help them out as much as I can. All in all, I think that society's pressure to do well and my own Moms opinions of what I should be doing are big factors of what motivates me to keep going."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1573,"Yana Dineli Phys 102-03 Reflection #4 Growing up in Iran, school and academics are highly valued in the community. My family has always encouraged me and my sibling to pursue a college degree and a good career. Although in my culture it is common for parents to be super involved in their children’s academic life and decide their major for them, my parents always gave me the freedom of choosing my own passion and career path while supporting me through my journey. I have changed my major 3 times throughout my college experience and they have had my back every step of the way and guided me to better find my passion and the right career for me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1570,"College has been a difficult journey for me. I try not to let that affect how I view myself. I struggled to get through classes. It has taken me almost 10 years to get my degree. One thing that keeps me going is the perseverance my dad had to better his family’s life and himself. His desire to better his life and to not give up when times get hard gives me the strength to continue the path I am. I used to only want my bachelor’s degree, but now I want to obtain a PhD to inspire my family’s future generations to better themselves. My family’s story is based on hard work, sacrifice, and dedication. Family is very important to me and as I’ve gotten older, I have realized how important having support from the ones you love. I am excited to accomplish my goal of finishing school and I have my family to thank for being there for me when I needed it the most."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1567,"Giovanni Elvira Physic 102 11/11/2021 Reflection 4 ""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" I feel that the value of my community and family is a big factor in my life and accomplishments that I achieve over time. My family and community has supported me and motivated me to do better and act right because I was always told that the way you present yourself your representing your community as well and family. My family helped me get up on my feet sometimes when I feel like giving up or sad about things but they remind me that I made it this far to give up and that they believe I could be anything I want to be as long as I achieve it. Through college, I always wake up and push myself because I want my family to know that I graduated college and became a sports medicine therapist. I want to be the first in my family that graduated college and made something out of myself. So far, I’ve been pushing myself and still til this day my family is behind my back supporting me through the process."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1562,"James Poblete Michelle PHYS 102 9 September 2021 Why am I here? 	To be honest, I am here to fulfill a GE requirement for my Physical Science Lab and that is all. Right now, I am in a weird spot in my college career because I took a semester off just to take EMT classes and I am currently going to take an ambulance DMV test so I can be hired to a company in Santa Clara County. Right now, I have these thoughts on my focus in higher education and figuring out what I want to be in the future. I have an option that I can graduate with an undergraduate degree and go to med school to become a higher medical professional or become a firefighter and go thru grueling academy after a few years of EMT experience. I am really indecisive and even though I have options, I do not know which one I would like to go thru."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1560,"My values that come from family and friends around me have helped in many ways. The ﬁrst is that there is always someone to help no matter what, this is something that my family has taught me growing up. With family you may not have chose them but choosing to accept them and embrace is a destine you make and this is something that I hold close to my heart. They next value is to surround yourself  with people you want to be around to help you grow. Surrounding yourself  with people that don’t help you grow won’t help you, you will be stuck in a place wanting more. And this isn’t how you should be in college, wanting to meet new people that have similar interests as you can be a great thing when times get tough in college or you're trying to make  decision.    MEMULA 1"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1576,"I would say that my family and community values have a very big focus on pushing yourself to the best of your ability and going to college to succeed. Just about everyone that I know from high school is in college now, community or a university. Along with that we are told to take AP and IB classes to further our positions and set ourselves up for success. If anything it is frowned upon where I am from to not go to school straight out of college. With students going to even harvard and MIT,we have high standards. In terms of family my parents push us to always work and go to school. They want to facilitate an environment for learning and finding new opportunities for our career. My dad didn’t even finish high school but wants my siblings and I to all reach high status with our education and future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1569,"Denny Ching Physics Lab 102 10/28/21 Reflection #4 How the values of my family helped me navigate through college is by never giving up on what your goals/dreams are in the first place. And that there are challenges/obstacles along the road that's going to be bumpy and hell of a ride. But it's up to me to take things step by step towards achieving those goals. I think having a specific goal in mind is important because you're the one who will need to achieve these goals so that you feel happy , satisfied, and content about your life. At the same time, I believe everyone has their own definition of what “success” is and the meaning of ""success"" will not be the exact same as someone else's. To me the definition of what “success” is, is when you put your sweat, blood, and tears into something that you believe in. That something that you believe in can be literally small or big. It can be finishing an assignment that was dif ficult to complete, reading a long chapter or section in a textbook, giving out a presentation to your class, or passing your test because you studied."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1563,"Reﬂection #4 The values of my community and/or my family helped me navigate through college? Interesting one. Well, the values that I was taught by my family have just mainly to be a hard worker and do my best in school. To forget everything about friends and everything else and just study in my education and academics so that I can set myself up for success in life. Kind of like a lone wolf mentality? But to be honest, my friends have really helped me understand the importance of surrounding myself with people that are like-minded and who share a common goal or interest."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1564,"""How have the values of my community or my family helped me navigate through college?"" A major takeaway from my 6th-grade teacher was the motto “work hard now, to play hard later”. At the time she was referring to getting our classwork done so we could go to recess, but it is something I still apply to my life to this day. Whenever I don’t want to do work I tell myself that I need to work hard now, so that when I am out having fun or hanging with friends I can be fully in the moment instead of having other things I need to worry about. In addition, my mom always raised me to be a hard worker and to earn what I am given. I also adopted the trait of always feeling like I need to do things myself in order for it to be done right and often when I don’t think I can do something I will have someone else do it. I am someone who prefers to play to their strengths instead of catering to their weaknesses. Lastly, the values my family shares are presentation and the way others view you. While I try not to let this completely affect me, it is something I still try to take into consideration."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1559,"Renee Ysabel Chatto October 28,2021 Reflection #4 ""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" One value that was continually taught in my family is to “Try your best”. This really helped me get through stress and being overwhelmed because I understood that no matter what grade I got and what the results are, it’s okay because I worked my hardest and did the best I could. This  translated from my family since if my parents saw me working and studying for a particular class, they would still be proud of me because I worked hard. Another value that was taught to me that really helped is to “do to other what you want done to you”. This mindset really helped me navigate through especially tough classes because I would help others with assignments or study with people who needed extra help because this is what I would want to happen to me. It even helps me study more often since I go over subjects that I need to and my peers get to understand the material better."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1575,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" Sometimes when I doubted myself and felt discouraged. I would always remember what my father told me and instilled in me, “Having a good education is the key to a better future” which gives me strength to keep working to achieve my goals. I want to accomplish my goal of completing college to fulfill the promise I made to my parents. Also, I have always wanted to embark on a medical mission, which entails working in dif ferent locations to serve people who have little to no access to healthcare. Once I start working in my career , I hope to alleviate some financial burden to help my parents."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1574,"My values are a very b ig part of who I am  because  all of the choices I make that direct the path of my life  are extensions of my values.  In other words, my values shape my character and influence how I engage  with people and situations.   Tha t being said , I would say that my values have been passed down from my  family mostly specifically my immediate family.  The se values have helped me navigate through  college  because to a large extent they have guided my choices in pretty much everything from how I manage  my time, to the people that I hang out with, to what I choose to spend my time doing.   I would even say  these values have influenced how I ’ve chosen my major and the career path  that I am pursuing.   These   values h ave also kept me grounded in times of hardship and through struggles because I was ab le to  maintain a clear vision of my goals and  be driven forward regardless of how much I wanted to give up."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1558,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" As a first generation student with two parents who are immigrants, I have a lot to be grateful for. But, I also have a lot of pressure to deal with. By having a difficult life financially, I’ve truly been able to learn that my education and the life decisions I make are what will make or break my future. School is extremely important to me and I prioritize my classes, involvement on campus, and my part-time job because it is what will give me the opportunities to reach my biggest dreams and desires. I have no familial inheritance or business or anything like that, so I know it all depends on me. I have been taught this over and over again throughout my lifespan by my mother and grandmother because they know how hard it is to be successful, to be financially stable, and not having a college education. My mom has forced me to be involved in multiple clubs, organizations, and AP/Honors courses dating back till Junior High in order to set me up for success. I appreciate my community, being my family, to the greatest extent because their struggles and life advice that comes with them are what have molded me to be the determined go-getter woman I am today."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1561,"Reflection #4 The values of my community or my family have helped me navigate through college greatly. I am beyond thankful for the support I have in my life. It has given me the strength to grow. They push me every day to be the best version of myself. Especially when I feel like giving up, they show me how strong I am and I can do anything I put my mind to. My family and community has always encouraged education which has played a role in me striving to do good in school and get good grades. Growing up I have always had my cousins to look up to, watching them succeed and grow as an individual makes me want to do the same. Having peers in my community have most of those same goals to strive to do good in school to follow a good career path. Looking to the present, I thank my family and community for believing in me and giving me the opportunity to get the education I have growing up. I am excited to be graduating next year and moving on to grad school. I am excited for my future."

As a first-generation student, the values of my family are something that I always carry with me because it serves as my guide and my reference point whenever I’m doing something. These values helped me to navigate and reminded me to keep on going because the value of education is something that we treasure a lot. With education, it will help me to become a role model to everyone by helping them and sharing the learnings that I learned throughout my school experience. On the other hand, these values became my living principles on how to behave and act properly as a college student. Nonetheless, these values will strengthen me and guide me until I pursue my chosen career of endeavor as a registered nurse."
