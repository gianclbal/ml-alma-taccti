2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1558,"Isabelle Gutierrez ""Why am I here?"" I am here because I am a first generation, minority, female student who has been given the opportunity to study Kinesiology in my favorite city of San Francisco. I know that I have to make my family proud and achieve all the goals I have in mind when it comes to my future. When I imagine my future, I see myself as a NICU nurse working in San Diego. However, as much as I keep dreaming about the future, it is important to realize where I am now at this very moment. If you would’ve told 10 year old me that I’m going to school in San Francisco, I probably would’ve cried on the spot. It has always been my dream to be here, and I’m living it now. The fact that I’m able to go to school here and work towards my future where I will be successful, is amazing. I am here because of my family and because of my identity as a first-generation student. I am here because it is my life and I need to live up to all my expectations and do so by completing a higher education. Lastly, I am here to be one more kind soul the earth needs."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1559,"Renee  Ysabel Chatto Professor Chong BIO 212-07 Why am I here? For this class, most basically, I am here because it is a prerequisite for my Kinesiology major. Disregarding that, I am here because I like physics; I find it interesting that physics can be found everywhere - from the tiniest molecule to physics found in space. I love to think that the scope for physics is almost infinite and there are many things in physics that are unknown and speculated. But as a person,I believe I am here to experience life, and that my purpose is to be alive. Meeting people, trying new experiences (like cultures, food, art),  and learning how the world works seems a fulfilling enough reason to be in this world. I am here to discover things that I have never thought of to even exist and see beautiful things. I want to see a lot of sights while I am alive and moving; I believe this is my reason for being here."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1561,“Why am I here” I am here because I want to be successful in my future. I want to achieve all of my goals set and in the process that means completing school. Taking these classes and engaging in the meetings widen my knowledge and make me smarter than I was the day before. I enjoy learning new things and challenging myself. I hope to pass this class and all of my other classes to get one step closer to my career . Phys 102 will help prepare me for my career in becoming a PT  or OT . So when I ask myself why am I here it is to better myself everyday . Although it can be hard and overwhelming at times I know it will soon benefit me. I want to be the best version of myself.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1562,"James Poblete Michelle PHYS 102 9 September 2021 Why am I here? 	To be honest, I am here to fulfill a GE requirement for my Physical Science Lab and that is all. Right now, I am in a weird spot in my college career because I took a semester off just to take EMT classes and I am currently going to take an ambulance DMV test so I can be hired to a company in Santa Clara County. Right now, I have these thoughts on my focus in higher education and figuring out what I want to be in the future. I have an option that I can graduate with an undergraduate degree and go to med school to become a higher medical professional or become a firefighter and go thru grueling academy after a few years of EMT experience. I am really indecisive and even though I have options, I do not know which one I would like to go thru."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1563,"The question that I am supposed to answer is a: Why Am I Here? To be honest, I actually do not really know. In relation to this class? It is because it is a prerequisite for being a KIN major. I’m going to be honest, this is a bit too unorganized and even if I was paying attention or even as I am paying full attention, the wording and the explanations get lost in so many other things and—I don’t know—its just a bit hard to understand. I am not too sure how I can keep writing more, but what I can talk about is how to maybe make this alittle better? I would suggest maybe like… slower explanations and a bit less jumbling or like jargon to really throw us oﬀ! Ohp, its already 5 minutes up! But yes, this is all I have."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1564,"For 5 minutes, journal reflectively on: ""Why am I here?"" This essay is meant to connect you to your purpose. This is not meant to be a formal essay. It should be stream-of-consciousness writing from the heart. You will be graded on participation only, not on the specifics of what you say. 5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150-200 words. After you finish your essays, we will provide some class time to discuss your thoughts, to the extent that you feel comfortable sharing. I am in this class to fulfill the physics requirements for my major. Throughout high school I avoiding physics classes because they really intimidated me. This course, along with PHYS 101, is the first physics course I have ever taken. In middle school, I took an 8th-grade general science class. We touched on topics like velocity and acceleration, but it never made much sense to me. That class ultimately deterred me away from ever taking a physics class. Now that I am a Kinesiology major in college I am required to take PHYS 101 and PHYS 102. So ar these classes have been fairly straightforward and have not left me confused. While I may not be the most excited about these classes, I will be putting in my all in hopes of receiving a good grade and understanding the concepts in physics. Hopefully, I will learn enough that can be applied to my major and help in my study of the movement of the body. 165 Words"

There are many reasons why people believe that they were put here on this earth. Some may say that they were are put on this earth to change it for the better, to leave a lasting impact.. Others may say that they were put here by God himself, or rather that they were chosen to live for a higher reason. I personally don't know the reason why I was put on this earth. I have many conflicting and personal feelings towards whether or not I was meant to be here but ultimately, throughout my own experiences, I believe that I am where I’m supposed to be. I was adopted when I was a baby and I have always been told that “God had a plan for me and sent me to the right family.” This statement alone says a lot about the character of who my family is and without trying to get too much into religion I'd say I have a general agreement with that statement. I’m not exactly sure that this is how I was supposed to answer this question."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1567,"Giovanni Elvira 09/22/2021 Physics 102 Professor Michelle Chong Reflection 1 Well when asking the question Why am I here? I think of my parents because they had me pretty much. Also because they want me to succeed they try to help me as much as possible to have a great life and make a career out of college. When in high school, I knew I wanted to go to college and I made all these goals I wanted to accomplish right away. I learn the hard way that it takes time and dedication. When starting college I was afraid of failing and disappointing my family. I was doubting myself and I wanted to give up, but I know I want to be a role model to my younger siblings so I changed my ways and created good study habits and maintain on track with my studies. And look at me now I’m still here grinding through these books I have no plan to stop until I graduate college."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1568,"Mark Carwin Bustos 9/9/21 PHYS 0102 Reflection #1: ""Why am I here?"" This question is the question that always comes to my mind. The idea of being here is a deep sense of understanding, figuring out what purpose do I have in life. Thus, I am here because I have a purpose. I have such responsibilities that I need to complete as a student, as a son, as a brother , and as a human being. I have a lot of purposes in life and the only thing I need to do is to do them one at a time and once this purpose is done, then I think I am successful in terms of serving my purpose. Right now , I am here because I want to learn, I want to stay engaged until I achieve my chosen career of endeavor as a registered nurse. And by that time I achieve this purpose, I know I’ll be ready to embark on the next chapter of my life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1569,"Denny   Ching    Physics   Lab   102   9/22/21    Reflection   #1    Why   am   I   here?   What's   my   sense   of   purpose?   Am   I   put   here   on   this   earth   cause    I   have   a   mission   to   accomplish?   These   are   the   types   of   questions   and   thoughts   I   ask   myself   occasionally   time   after   time.   I   believe   the   reason   why   I’m   here   on   this   earth   is   to    continue   my   parents'   journey ,   a   journey   (opportunity)   that   they   weren’t   able   to   do   when    they   were   younger   and   to   pass   down   generations   of   stories   that   they   have   heard   from    their   parents.   Also   another   reason   I   believe   why   we   are   all   here   on   this   earth   is   to    experience   life.   Experiencing   life   meaning   learning   from   our   own   mistakes,   having   a    connection   with   people,   helping   others   who   are   also   on   this   journey ,   reaching   goals   that    you   want   to   accomplish   one   day,   uplifting   each   other   when   situations   are   tough,   and    growing   as   an   individual   that   shapes   you   for   who   you   truly   are.   Life   is   truly   short   and   it    can   be   unpredictable   at   times.   That's   why   it’s   important   to   spend   as   much   time   as    possible   with   people   you   love   most.   It   can   be   your   family   members,   grandparents,    friends,   peers   etc.   Additionally ,   it   can   be   for   example   asking   the   person   if   they   want   to    go   to   prom   with   you,   going   out   for   a   date,   hanging   out   with   each   other   etc.   Shooting    your   chances   can   be   hard   at   times   and   I   get   it.   But   at   the   end   of   the   day,   if   you're   not    grabbing   your   chances   you   might   regret   not   doing   it   and   the   opportunity   just   went   past    without   even   realising   it   yourself."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1570,"Reflection #1   I am here on a journey just like everyone else. I am here to serve and help those around me. Being here in class is another part of my journey. I am here to be my best self. I am here to inspire others. I am here to love. I am here to positively impact the next generation. I am here to fulfill all of my dreams.  I am here because this is where I need to be right now. I am here to help other reach their full potential through sports and training. I am here to be of service to those around me to the best of my ability. I am here to have fun and enjoy life and not take it too seriously. I am here to learn from my mistakes. I am here to laugh, smile, cry. I am here to do everything I’ve ever dreamed of. I am here to work with the best soccer players in the world. I am here to help create some of the world’s best soccer players."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1571,"Week 3 Reflection #1   I am here because I have decided to take the route of becoming a physical therapist and  understanding physics is a major branch of kinesiology. Not only will I build a strong foundation  on physics, but I can also utilize concepts from physics to other subj ects like biology or human  anatomy. An example can be, understanding if a force is a “push” or “pull” can determine which  muscle groups are being used to perform that specific action. I had originally planned to take  this class last year, along with my phy sics lecture, although I wasn’t able to join the classes that  were friendly to the rest of my schedule. Taking this lab now is a way to refresh on the basics of  physics, along with applying the concepts in real life situations. It is also quite convenient that  this course is over zoom, only because I can engage fully at the comfort of my couch."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1572,"Mike Lu Reflection #1 I am here to learn and explore more about myself. I came to college with the purpose of getting a degree and experiencing living away from home. I want to learn and experience new events and things. My main purpose here is to get my nursing degree to move onto nursing school and then finally residency. I am here not only to make my family proud but also to myself. I want to be able to say that I have made it out of college successfully. For this physics class specifically, I am here to learn more about physics and deepen my understanding of how the work works. I also have a small interest in physics since I took it in high school and wanted to learn more about it in college. I think this class will be really fun and engaging as long as I am willing to put in the effort and learn."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1573,"Yana Dineli Journal 1 The reason I am here is because of my academic and career goals. I am majoring in Kinesiology and physics is a very important concept in understanding human body movements. In order to understand physics, it’s important to be able to explore the concepts in a lab to visually see and practice these concepts. The Physics lab helps us in establishing the relevance of a theory. It brings clarity to our minds regarding the basic concept of the subjects. This class can help us to understand the difference between theory and application."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1574,"I am in this class in order to satisfy the requirement I need for my major and graduation.  I am a Kinesiology major and physics is an important component of this field of study.  My ultimate goal is to become  a doctor of physical therapy and have my own practice potentially and I would specifically like to work with athletes or wounded veterans.  I think that this class will be beneficial to me in many ways including improving my knowledge of how the world works around me, especially in relation to injuries caused by external forces acting on the body.  I also think that this class will help improve my critical thinking skills because physics require you to investigate the reasons for why something occurred and consider many different variables in relation to something happening.  All in all I hope to be a better well rounded student after this class and better prepared for the next steps in my journey."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1575,"Francesca Velasco PHYS 102 ""Why am I here?"" Why am I here? A question that is easy to ask but dif ficult to answer . Why am I here in the first place?... I am here in SF State University to further my knowledge and I am here with a goal of obtaining my Bachelor ’s Degree in Kinesiology to pursue my career and professional goal as a Physical Therapist. I am taking the PHYS 102 Lab as a prerequisite for my major . My journey to be here has been a dif ficult journey . There are alot of things that have happened in my life that makes me think a lot, there are people I met and there are people who left. Even though I have a plan and a goal to fulfill, sometimes life is unpredictable, many things can happen and many things can change. I think I am here because I need to know and feel what I really want, find myself, be confident, and have a positive outlook in life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1576,Honestly I don’t know exactly why I am here. Sometimes I think I have a special purpose in life that is different from everyone else. Other times I think I am just exactly like everyone else trying to make it out here and succeed. I realize that I will never truly know till I get there. I work so hard day in and day out striving to reach a goal. That goal is something that won't ever be defined to me. All I know is that I just want to do better each and every day. I want to be happy and proud of myself when I know I don’t got much time left. When I was young I grew up very shy and scared of what was too come but in reality that was just time I could have spent living my life. Every second I spend sad about something that doesn’t matter is another one I could have spent happy over something that does. So in reality I don’t know why I am here and never will but all I want is to live my life knowing I did the most I could for my happiness and those around me.
