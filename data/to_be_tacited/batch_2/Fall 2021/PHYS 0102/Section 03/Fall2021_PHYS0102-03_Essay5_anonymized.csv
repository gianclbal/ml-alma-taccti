2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1575,"Francesca Velasco PHYSICS 102 ""What resources do I have to support me? Do I see myself as a scientist? or will I be after graduating?"" The resources that can support me to be successful in my academic would be meeting up with graduate advisor , major advisor and peer advisers to get feedback on my progress towards my short-term and long-term goals and to guide me with my career choice to finish my education and earn my degree in Kinesiology to pursue my career and professional goal as a physical therapist or occupational therapist. Of fice hours to reach out with professors and ask help with the course material when having a dif ficult time finishing the course work. No, I don’ t see myself as a scientist because it's not something I wanted to do or pursue in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1560,"I have many resources that support me, mostly family and friends but also myself. I believe that if you have the confidence you are your best resource to have. You won’t always have the time to get in touch with people when you need something so having the ability to know that you can support yourself is a great thing. I can see my self as a scientist but not in the traditional way, I'm always looking for a different answer or solution to explain something, and at the core of science is understanding what is going on around us. So in that since I do think of myself as a scientist. Having the thought process of how to make this easier to understand or finding solutions to problems is key to being successful in my field, its not always knowing everything but the ability to solve problems that can help improve people lives and also yours is key.

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1576,"I would have tosay the resources I have supporting me are my family, friends, and some of my teachers. I am very grateful for how understanding you have been with my situation, I just think that oftentimes some teachers treat us just as students and not fully as people. They push us to have extremely high standards and not have any room for surprises(positive or negative) that we may have in our lives. My family always pushes me to do the best and my friends can help me out by studying, going out to help me relieve stress, and many other aspects. I do not see myself as a scientist currently because I feel like the level of my work doesn’t reach to become so. I would say that in the future it could be interesting and may align with the career I want to pursue through physical therapy."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1570,"Reflection #5   The resources I have to support me are my teachers, mentors, books, and the internet. I do not  feel like I lack support. I have never felt like I needed support because it has always been there for me. I used to not think of myself as a scientist or anythi ng close to that before but my  interest and passion for sports has led me to want to become a sports scientist. After my first  semester as a transfer student, I can say I see myself as a sports scientist now and it makes me  want to continue to pursue a hig her education. I want to become a sports scientist specializing  in soccer with the ability to apply the knowledge and science to other sports as well. Being a  sports scientist for a professional national team is something I see myself as and something I feel is becoming more important in sports."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1567,"Giovanni Elvira Physics 102 12/9/2021 Reflection #5 What resources do I have to support me? Do I see myself as a scientist? or will I be after graduating?"" The resources I have in school or through life would be my family most all since I know I could always have their support and my job. I say my job because they are non-profit and they support me with needs such as things I needed through covid and support with money if I needed such as grocery gift cards and more. At this point, in time I would say the resources I need would be my job just for things such as getting my brother vaccinated and yea that’s mainly it pretty much. I honestly don’t see myself as a scientist. I used to think of myself as that but things have changed and I wanted to be a sports medicine therapist. I think maybe after graduating I would have to do my masters so I could spend a little more time in school to achieve my goals and hopefully I can make more money especially right now with the pandemic issue going on and want to be able to support more with bills."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1564,"""What resources do I have to support me?"" The resources I have to support me include my best friends and my family. My best friend Yaya is someone I met just recently in August. She is someone I truly feel I can rely on and will support me whenever I need her. My childhood best friend Jordan is someone who has been with me through thick and thin. I know she is someone who will be there for me for the rest of my life. Additionally, my high school best friend Jesse is also someone who has been there for me through some really tough times. My mom is also a major resource that I go to when I am confused or just need help. She always gives me advice and knows the right thing to say even if it pisses me off sometimes. My little brother is someone I can count on to make me laugh, but also hug me when I’m feeling down or pick me up on my feet. Lastly, my dad is someone I’ve had an interesting relationship with. While it seems shallow, he is a resource that I know will always support me financially when I need it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1566,"PHYS 102     Reflection 5  Prof. Michelle Chong   Aditya Mantha     ""What resources do I have to support me? Do I see myself as a scientist? or will I  be after graduating?""   I honestly don’t see myself being a scientist since I am heavily inclined towards  sports performance and wish to work in that field. I love helping athletes unlock  their genetic potential through the right training. They discover abilities they had  no clue  they possessed or could develop. Guiding them to achieve their athletic  goals gives me pleasure and I wish to do that moving ahead."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1569,"Denny Ching    Physics Lab 102    12/9/21    Reflection #5   What resources do I   have to support me? Do I see myself as a scientist? or will I    be after graduating? When it comes to resources, I think I have many to support me.    This means having access to the internet, having a computer to work on assignments,    having a place to live (roof under my head), clothes to keep me warm, food to survive,    and family and friends to support and help me along my journey . I really don’t see    myself as a scientist because I’m interested and passionate about art and design. I’ve    been interested in art for as long as I can remember . When I was 5 years old, I    remember drawing the Simpsons and Family Guy in my living room and being proud of    it. And during my 4th grade year of elementary school, my book cover art design got    nominated/picked by the principal of my school, which is so cool and exciting to see    something that I drew and spent a lot of time on got picked to be on the main cover of a    book. No, I don't see myself as a scientist after graduating because I’m not that    interested in the science field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1561,"Reflection #5 I have a lot of resources and support. There are so many resources provided at school and on campus for everyone. This includes tutoring, advisors, the health center, support groups, and so many more. Tutoring and my advisor have been a huge help in my college journey. Outside of school I have a lot of support from my family, peers, and my significant other. These resources and support have played a big role in my life and get me through the hard times. I do not see myself as a scientist. I guess maybe, but that is not my goal or choice of career path. I will be graduating next year and pursuing physical or occupational therapy. The goal is to continue on to grad school to give myself a wider opportunity of landing a good and well paid job. I know all of my hard work will pay off and I am looking forward to seeing what the future has in store for me and my journey."

Do I see myself as a scientist? or will I be after graduating?"" As a college student and as an aspiring registered nurse, I know that I have a lot of resources readily available for me to use, however , it’s up to me and I’m accountable for how am I going to navigate them. In school, I know that I have my counselors who will guide me alongside or ganizations and opportunities that are beneficial for my growth and success. After I graduate, I could totally see myself working in the medical field applying all the learnings that I learned throughout my educational journey . On the other hand, tutoring services and even job opportunities are just some of the resources that I have in order to excel and develop my learnings for my chosen career of endeavor . On the other hand, applying for scholarships is also a resource that I could use to sustain my financial needs. Overall, I see myself specializing in the medical field contributing my knowledge to the field of medicine."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1563,"Reﬂection #5  Some resources that I have to support me are my family and friends. My family and I have developed a better relationship and it is really nice because they understand that I am becoming my own independent person but they still care and want to support me as best as they can. In terms of my friends, they are also my lifeline. They give me life and laughter and they also let me know the things I need to adjust or ﬁx and that makes me happy. I go through a lot of things throughout the days and just knowing that my friends can be a positive resource for me or a group of people in a safe space that I can go to makes me feel better."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1559,"Renee Ysabel Chatto PHYS 1020-03 Dec 22, 2021 PHYS Reflection #5 I have many resources to support me. Academic wise, I have my professors, my peers, and academic advisors to help me understand material and coursework, and work towards getting my degree. I also, of course, have the physical resources that aid me in my work including: my laptop, notebook, textbooks, lectures, and access to the internet. But as an individual, I get a lot of support from my  family and friends that help me get through everyday life and help me to become a better person. I don’t think I see myself as a scientist, currently I see myself as a student learning from other people and trying to understand the world around me. I don’t think I’ll ever feel like a scientist because I feel like being called a scientist is a label reserved for people who do research and make advancements towards scientific discovery. Maybe in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1562,"James Poblete PHYS 102 Michelle Chong 9 December 2021 Reflection #5 	The resources I have is my family and my job to support me. I do not see myself as a scientist because of the repetition of running labs and test to yield a result that may or may not be true. I am a pretty impatient person, so I commend those in the field. If I were to be a scientist, I would think a person who test blood or urine samples in the hospital lab. I won’t be a scientist but I think the scientific method is used unconsciously in other fields."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1565,"1 Anastasia Balthasar Reflection 5 For 5 minutes, journal reflectively on: ""What resources do I have to support me? Do I see myself as a scientist? or will I be after graduating?"" The resources that I have had available to me this semester have been a few . To start of f with, I had my professors as a resource, I had the library to work, I had the SFSU bookstore open to me with a variety of resources including the 4 scantrons I bought the morning of my exams. I also had the support of my friends and family who did such a great job cheering me on. Do I see myself as a scientist? I don’ t see myself that much as a scientist because to me being a scientist is being in a laboratory with the lab coats and such separating muscle tissue or something. But I haven’ t really been doing that because of covid. I am a kinesiology major and I'm a junior and it still hasn’ t hit me that I'm a stem major . I think after graduating I won’ t really be a “scientist” but I will still heavily relay on science for whichever job I am lucky enough to land."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1572,"Reflection #5 – Mike Lu  I think that I have plenty of resources that support me in my life goals and dreams. To name a few “resources”: parents, friends, professors, advisors, and family. I think these people help me a lot in many ways. I have parents, friends, and family to support me emotionally and make sure I am okay. They are always there whenever I would need them. I find my professors and advisors great help when I am struggling academically. In which they would give me advice and guidance to help me achieve my academic goals. Overall, I think I have a great support system to keep me going when I am struggling or have a tough time. I see myself a scientist once I graduate. I am not sure if its really a traditional “scientist”, but I want to become an anesthesiologist. I guess in a sense being a anesthesiologist is a scientist but for medical purposes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1573,"Yana Dineli Phys 102-03 Reflection #5 I have plenty of resources that support me such as my family, friends, school advisors, and coworkers. I recently changed my major to kinesiology and my goal is to become an occupational therapist. So I wouldn’t be a traditional scientist per se, but occupational therapy is a form of science that is based on the discipline of occupational science. Occupational science attempts to study and draw conclusions on human occupations and how people accomplish basic tasks."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1558,"""What resources do I have to support me? Do I see myself as a scientist? or will I be after graduating?"" The resources I have to support me are my professors, advisors, family and friends, and even my coworkers. I’ve recognized that having a strong social system and great influencers in my life have motivated me to become the best I can be. School has always been a big deal in my home and getting good grades was crucial because it meant getting a higher education and a successful career. I’ve noticed that I like to be surrounded by friends who care about school and work hard as a student because they understand why I try as much as I do to get A’s. By being a chiropractic assistant, I see how the doctors in our practice develop strong relationships with all kinds of patients and are well off with their careers that did require them to get a doctorate degree, meaning they are goal driven. As my career, I hope to become a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Nurse who works at a hospital in San Diego. Very specific, I know. Nurses are a blessing to society and truly are some of the hardest people I know. My knowledge and aid as a nurse will make a difference. I would consider myself a scientist already because I am taking a wide variety of science classes and looking over the hypotheses, methods, and results. By studying this information, I learn more and more about why things are the way they are in the science field. I enjoy learning about us as humans and how we survive on planet earth. The more I take these courses, the more educated I become, and therefore, the more I am able to make a difference in this world. Once I reach my career goals, I will only be a more professional scientist who is still expanding her knowledge. But even right now, I am still a scientist, I just haven’t been given the degree yet."
