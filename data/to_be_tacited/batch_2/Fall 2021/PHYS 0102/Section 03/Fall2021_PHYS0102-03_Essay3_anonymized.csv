2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1575,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" When life gets challenging, I first try to get away from what is causing my stress and anxiety by relaxing and meditating that will help me clear my mind from the stressful events that happened, so that I could face my problem with a clear mind, because the more we force ourselves on facing the challenges in a chaotic state of mind. It will be more difficult to face them and more bad things could happen. In my experience when I try to face life challenges, I tend to stress out and lose my temper and do stuff abruptly without thinking about the consequences and in the end I regret it. Also another thing that helps me relieve my stress is by talking to my friends asking for advice and seeking comfort because I think our friends share the feeling and so will understand each other and we know how to comfort one another."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1563,"Reﬂection #3  Something that I do when life gets challenging is I take a moment of silence, lie down, and deeply analyze what are the things that I can ﬁx. Everything in life is almost always a constant ﬂux of chaos and it is hard to ﬁnd some sort of peace or tranquility. Therefore, it is important to try and control the things that you can do and actually ﬁx instead of getting caught up in things that are inevitable. I do not think that there are a lot of things that challenge me outside of my major, recent internship and just relationships that I share with people, but when they do become that way—chaotic—I always take some time to just have a soft reset and take time oﬀ for myself for self-care."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1558,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" When life gets challenging, I tend to have mental breakdowns. However, I then realize that crying and stressing over something isn’t going to be the solution. So then, I give myself a pep talk and sort of whip myself into shape. I like to write a visual checklist with boxes that I can check off when I get a task done. Also, I like to give myself some type of reward to give myself a pat on the back. Throughout all of life’s challenges, I’ve noticed that life doesn’t always have to be stressful. Our mindset is everything. Therefore, I also like to write down affirmations of what I will succeed at in life. By writing these down, I realign myself and remind myself what is the purpose of me working hard today. I work everyday to ensure my future self gets the life she deserves. But also, I try to romanticize my struggles and make the most out of it. The fact that I’m even struggling in school today is beautiful. I’m a first generation student and to be given the opportunities I’m given, is amazing. In addition, I also like to do acts of self-care whether that be sleeping in, doing face masks, watching a romantic comedy, or making Kraft mac and cheese. Let’s keep our chins up!"

When life gets challenging, I control my breathing, slow down and pace my  thoughts. I have noticed that I have produced my best results in tough times  when I was calm and composed. I break things down into simpler tasks and not  worry about the big problem."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1561,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" This is a great question to ask myself right now because my classes have been getting even more challenging with assignments, tests, projects, etc. I have always been super big on focusing on self care and making time for self care even when my schedule is busy. My main form of self care is working out. It helps me relieve stress while also feeling good, physically and mentally. Another thing I do when life gets challenging is take a step back and evaluate my life like living in the moment and not worrying about what's coming. In school when I get overwhelmed I focus on doing one thing at a time. I look at what assignments are due first. Another huge thing that helps me is having a planner and writing everything down. This helps me see everything in one area. No matter how challenging life gets and this can happen very often, just remember it will all pay off in the end and nothing is impossible. Remind yourself “you can do it”."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1559,"Renee Ysabel Chatto 10/05/21 What do I do when life get challenging? To be completely honest, I’m not too good at handling challenges or pressure, I kind of get overwhelmed easily and I start to put things off (which only increases anxiety). But when I get over this slump, I put all my effort into the challenge at hand. For example, I had a Physiology exam this Wednesday and had an incredibly busy weekend so I had little time to study.  At first I felt really anxious when I was thinking of the upcoming exam and I had put off studying for a while, but when I finally felt ready to at least start thinking about it, I made myself a schedule of when I had available and had set amounts of time I should study and take breaks. I also feel that before starting anything I like to organize what I can, like my notes or my desk, this helps be feel less disorganized and makes me less anxious."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1571,"Reflection #3: What do I do when life gets challenging? When life gets challenging, I do my best to take a step back and reassess my situation. Whether that be managing time or balancing school and work, it is important for me to stay organized and focus on which area needs the most work. In recent times, I have had trouble waking up for early shifts and early classes, I personally hate being late and will always ger frustrated when I am late. However, being upset about the challenges that follow balancing work and school will not necessarily help the situation, if anything, it may blind me to see the solution to all my problems. I am also trying to give myself more breaks to relax and destress instead of constantly putting my body and mind through work. Staying disciplined has also helped me persevere through the challenges of life, sacrificing the time I dedicate for games to cook are one of examples of self-discipline."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1565,"For 5 minutes, journal reflectively on: ""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" This essay is meant to remind you that even at challenging points in the semester , you have resources you can draw on and that you got this. This is not meant to be a formal essay . It should be stream-of-conciousness writing from the heart. You will be graded on participation only , not on the specifics of what you say .  5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150-200 words. When life gets challenging there are many things I can do. There are good and bad things that I do when the world starts to cave in and it becomes challenging. Some good things I do is take a break from whatever I’m doing and try to distract myself. Another thing I do is I really enjoy taking a nice bath with some relaxing music and just collect/clear my thoughts. Sometimes I rely on my friends and family and get reassurance that I can do something. On the other hand I do tend to get down on myself and hibernate in my apartment with a lot of pressure on my shoulders. I know that the healthiest thing to do is to take a walk, or exercise."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1569,"Denny   Ching    Physics   Lab   102   10/7/21    Reflection   #3    What   do   I   do   when   life   gets   challenging?   When   my   life   gets   challenging,   I   take   things    step   by   step.   What   I   mean   by   step   by   step   is   taking   small   baby   paces.   I   always   feel   like   I’m    constantly   tackling   assignments   and   never   able   to   have   time   for   myself   to   relax   or   distress.   I    have   to   remind   myself   that   I’m   not   a   robot   and   I   can’t   constantly   working   working   working.    Constantly   working   can   definitely   burn   yourself   out   and   make   you   feel   stressed   out.   I   find   exercising   really   does   help   with   my   mood   throughout   the   day   and   it   makes   me   feel    energized   and   ready   to   tackle   tasks   that   are   in   front   of   me.   Exercising   makes   me   feel   great    physically   and   mentally   since   I'm   moving   my   entire   body   instead   of   sitting   at   my   desk   for    hours   and   hours   doing   work   consistently.   The   only   time   I   really   get   to   exercise   is   during   the    weekends   because   that's   when   I   have   more   time   to   do   whatever   I   want.   I   do   say   so   myself    that   I'm   a   workaholic   because   I'm   always   busy   doing   some   sort   of   task   or   assignment.   On    days   if   I'm   really   busy   and   can't   go   out   to   the   park   to   exercise,   I   like   to   play   the   Just   Dance    game   as   a   form   of   exercise.   The   Just   Dance   game   has   this   feature   where   you   can   make   a    playlist   of   your   favorite   songs   to   exercise   or   workout   to.   I   definitely   think   it's   super   fun   since    I'm   learning   different   kinds   of   dance   moves   when   I'm   exercising."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1576,When life gets stressful I just start thinking about it. This could be a positive eustress or a negative one the demotivates me if anything from working due to being overwhelmed. I want the item to be done and over with. I used to let stress get to me a lot but recently I done a lot better at handling it. The key to it is evaluating what I can do with the resources I have and the time that I have left. Sometimes it can be scary with how much work or how little time you really have to do it. I just learned that if you start and get momentum going often times your can just really push yourself and get a lot of things done. Overall stress gets to you if you let it but its your choice if you decide to use this as a positive or a negative situation.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1560,"When life gets challenging for me this is when life gets interesting, when things do get tough I know that I'm living and that this challenge that I'm facing can be accomplished and with facing this my true self  comes out. The self  that wants to be challenged in every aspect in my life. While challenges comes a time to reﬂect on actions that have been made to have led to this point, and focusing not on what to change but how to embrace the challenge and to not back down until feeling stratiﬁed that if  it comes again I can have references to how to face and concur again. With time get challenging I like to go for a long drive or ﬁnd a place that has background noise that isn’t people or cars, one of  my favorite places is an outlook on the SF side of  the golden gate bridge, looking at the bridge puts into perspective on what can be accomplished when challenges arise.

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1564,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" When life gets challenging I like to usually sit down and get myself organized. I feel I am able to work best when I use my planner and write out the things I need to get done. It also helps me ensure I do not forget about anything throughout the day. Additionally, I like to hang out with friends to decompress or have some alone time where I just relax and binge-watch shows on Netflix or Hulu. Overall, I feel like I have learned how to handle stress and challenges. I always tell myself everything will work out and if it doesn’t then I will figure it out. That is the motto I say when I am starting to doubt myself or I start to get nervous or anxious before an exam or event. Lastly, I do think it is important to point out my use of marijuana as a coping skill. I usually treat this as a reward after a long day of school and homework. It helps me wind down, as well as, fall asleep."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1570,"Reflection #3 When life gets challenging, I usually give myself a time to reset and forget about everything for the time being. This usually helps me take away unnecessary stress created by own thoughts and past experiences. This break also allows me to go back to the knowingness that everything will always be okay and work out for the best. Growing up I always had that intuition that everything will always be okay because life is happening for me and not to me. When life gets hard, I usually just sit back and ride the wave because there is no point going against it because it will feel like a struggle but riding the wave will be smooth and exciting. When life gets hard, I always remember to surrender and not feel like I need to have control, or everything figured out right away. Life being hard is also just a perception and thought. Things don’t always have to be hard; we can have an easy life where things come easily. If one expects a hard life to get the things we desire, life will always be challenging. Life is meant to enjoy and have fun."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1567,"Giovanni Elvira Physics 102 Professor Michelle Chong Reflection 3 ""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" When things feel challenging I tend to workout or spend time with my family because it helps me feel more at ease especially when I’m stressed with homework. I’m usually good when working under limited time to submit homework such as essays, but sometimes I need to regroup myself. When spending time with my family I play with my siblings, joke with them and we watch movies and eat popcorn together. When working out I use my frustration to push me when lifting heavy weights. Overall, doing these things and listening to music help me get through any challenge in life. I was always taught how to work through things and never show when I’m down or struggling because I can make it through any situation. I can honestly say that I learned a lot about myself in college and how I really had to make myself known when reaching out to advisors when needing support so helped me grow by learning how to reach others when needed."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1573,Yana Dineli Phys 102-03 Reflection #3 When life gets challenging is very difficult to know what to do. One thing that helps to ease my mind when life gets tough is writing down my thoughts and journaling. Writing down my thoughts provides clarity and helps me see the bigger picture. Journaling also reduces my anxiety by serving as an escape or emotional release of my negative thoughts and feelings. It helps me realize that there are some things in life that are out of my control I should let go. I also try to express gratitude by letting my memories remind me that I’m lucky and look forward to making more good small memories.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1572,"Reflection #3 What do I do when life gets challenging? 	A few things come to mind. Usually hangout with friends or listening to music helps me a lot to clear up my thoughts and organize them. Doing something fun usually also helps relief the pressure or stress I am feeling. Recently, I’ve been going to the gym pretty frequently and it also helps me clear my mind when I am under pressure or feeling stressed. I think the gym is a great place to focus on your physical self while giving your mental self a break. I also find talking to other about the things that are challenging me also helps me by getting different perspectives from my friends. These are some of the ways I deal with stress when life gets challenging."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1562,"James Poblete PHYS 102 Michelle Chong 7 October 2021 Reflection #3 	When life gets challenging, I usually get lost in my hobbies and literally reflect on myself or the situation that makes life challenging. Usually, my challenges right now are trying to grow up because I am in my early 20s so I should have my life together but there are unique things that make this age weird. I don’t have my life together yet but at the same time I need my life together. I feel like I am being rushed to finish or conform to what my elders think is best for me really stresses me out.  	I get lost in my hobbies like watching or studying matches (MMA/Kickboxing/other martial arts), play video games, read manga, exercise my cardio, or practice technique in martial arts or weightlifting, and practice Spanish for my EMT job. I take breaks and reflect on myself like my relationships with other people, how far I come, what I need to do better, what makes me feel like crap or what makes me feel better, and etc. When I do those things my headspace is clear and I feel motivated to do things.

2021,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,3,1568,"Mark Carwin Bustos Michelle Chong PHYS 102 07 October 2021 Reflection #3: ""What do I do when life gets challenging?""   When life gets challenging, I usually take a break and give myself some time to meditate and ponder . Sometimes all we need is a break. Even though life gets hard sometimes, we need to remain steadfast and continue to move. We might get tired, but don’ t give up easily . Thus, challenges are something that makes me even stronger; they keep me moving. If I could go for a short walk, inhale some fresh air , talk to my friends, go shopping, pamper myself---I’ll be able to fight these challenges and turn them into achievements or progress. Life could be challenging and that’ s okay . A moment of taking a break and coming back after I feel better will help me ease the stress that I’m feeling from within. The most important thing is to rise from the occasion and to keep on moving----I will never give up because I still have dreams to achieve."
