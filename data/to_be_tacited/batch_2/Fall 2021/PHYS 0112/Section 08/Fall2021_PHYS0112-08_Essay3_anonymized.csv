2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1756,"I am really bad at managing stress and dealing with life challenges. When life gets challenging in terms of school, I like to schedule a system for my classes I go through all my classes and see what is due and write it down in my journal with the due dates. School can be challenging and I try to do that to take out the stress from that. In general, when life does get challenging, I just like to take a breather and relax. I like to write it out in my journals or talk about it with other friends so that I can feel less stressed and make the challenges go away.  I enjoy doing yoga or talking to my therapist so that we can form a plan or system that will make all my challenges go away or minimized. I do no try to burn myself out or burn myself out in school"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1743,"What do I do when life gets challenging?     Well to be honest I don’t really respond well with challenging situations. When meeting a challenging situation I would try to overcome the challenge as soon as possible but as soon as I start slacking and don’t see any progress of solving the challenge, I start to procrastinate. I would try to forget about the challenge and come back to it with a different angle to see if it will work. But the more challenging the situation is, the more I procrastinate and have a lower chance of succeeding which leads to more procrastination. I will keep doing this process until I finally overcome the challenge but if this is not not possible, I will most likely deem the problem a waste a time and give up completely. Even if taking a break and coming back to the problem is a really good solution, as you can see the problem with fresh eyes and motivation. It will also led the problem to build up until it seem like its impossible to solve or it will take forever to do. Therefore I would try by best until that last light fade."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1750,"When life gets challenging I like to take time out of my day to do things I find stress relieving. I like to play video games and talk to my friends about my issues while we play just so I have an outlet to get a lot of raw emotions out. I also love to go outside to views because it gives me time to reflect over the many things that are stressing me out. However, my go to is going to the gym and playing basketball. When I'm out on the court I can just focus on basketball and worry about nothing else really. Working out and playing completely clears my mind and helps me refocus on what is important to me. Its been my outlet for years, ever since elementary school, I have been playing basketball no matter how injured or tired I am. While I was injured last month with a broken ankle, the only thing I really missed was being able to play basketball."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1748,"When life gets challenging, I usually find ways to manage the stress and anxiety that those challenging situations create. I do this by going on walks at the park, playing with my pets, playing a video game, playing my piano, or hanging out with my family and friends. It is strikingly important that I do not let the challenges in my life consume me or overwork me because then it becomes harder to bounce back from those challenges. There may be times where I fall off and begin to fade into the background, but I must never let those encounters defeat me and instead fuel my potential to advance myself forward. Right now, I am still facing the transition from online school to in-person meetings again and it is a large weight needing to adapt to both forms of instruction because I don't know if I can handle both. However, every day is a lesson for me and for how I should go about dealing with these two different challenges."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1739,"The most important task that I love to do is ensuring to take a deep breath. Over time, I’ve noticed that in these situations I used to panic immediately. Rather than taking a breath or speaking to someone about my challenges, I restored to panicking rather than analyzing. Of course, everyone encounters rough patches in their lifetime, although everyone takes these challenges in different contexts. In most situations, when life gets challenging, I remember that the present conflicts are experiences that others have experienced. It has been a coping technique that emphasizes that you will never be alone in the specific situation if help or communication is expressed. When life gets tough, I love speaking to my friends and family regarding the situation. Oftentimes,  I may get some reassurance or moral support so that I may overcome the challenge as best as possible. Healthy communication and breathing is key in overcoming hard experiences."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1744,"When life gets challenging I usually sleep. I know that is not the best thing to do. Now I try to do something active like workout or play basketball. Something that tires me out and gets my mind of things definitely helps the most. I know I should do this every time but finding the motivation to do so is the hard part. Sometimes it is probably better to just rest and give your mind and body a break. The thing is though is when I wake up I don't feel any better. Ill still be unmotivated and tired. Im not sure if there is something better for me to do when I'm not feeling enough energy to be active. I dont know maybe playing video games. But when I do that I feel better during the game but after I finish, Im back at square one. Im trying to write this without sounding super depressing but its hard lol. I know I will get through school and graduate but it does feel like its taking forever. I wish it just didn't feel like a chore. I wish it was something I enjoyed doing."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1747,"When is life not challenging right?! When I feel the pressure of life get to me I stop everything I'm doing and go out. I sit in a spot by myself and just breathe forget everything and anything. After I calm myself down then I start to think of a solution, think of a way that will solve my problems without letting the stress of them get to me. I also remember to remind myself that challenges are the obstacles that help us better ourselves. I then but my solutions to work and remember to never let my hopes up on the first attempt because not everything works from the first try. If my solutions work I continue to have my guard up because like I said at first when is life not challenging and the next challenge is probably waiting for you at your next turn, so don't let anything get you down. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1742,"When life gets challenging, I think the first thing that I do is react negatively. I am a short-tempered person and I am quick to get emotional. So, I might be angry or upset at first until I properly assess the situation. I also know that I hold onto the past a lot so I might follow along all the decisions that led up to the challenging point. However, I know that I would start to think of solutions or at least next steps to prevent the situation from getting out of hand. Usually I play out different scenarios in my head to think about what the outcomes of each decision will be. I also turn to my close friends and loved ones to vent about the problem and then see what they think about it. I find that talking it out can help reveal new strategies that I hadn't seen before."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1753,"When things become difficult, I practice gratitude. I think of all of the opportunities that are now at my disposal and of other situations that have come into fruition that I can appreciate. While practicing gratitude works, I cannot deny myself of negative emotions, as it would not allow me to process them properly. I reach out to my support system and tell them how I feel, to which will calm me down or provide me with some insight. Between these two things, I am able to ground myself a bit more. When I am alone, I like to meditate on the source of my challenge(s). I find that when I'm able to work through my challenges in this way, I can learn from why it has been presented in my life. Most of these tactics can be easier said than done. However, I do my best to work through my challenges in this healthy and productive manner so that I can grow in spite of them."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1741,"When life gets hard or challenging I always pray first. Prayer is power & prayer has truly saved me. I pray for strength, patience & guidance on whatever is tough for me at the moment. I also find comfort and peace in church.  I also like to take a step back & breathe & do whatever it is I love. I'll grab a coffee, read a good book & relax or Ill binge a show. Another thing I love to do is drive around and listen to music. Its such a fun thing to do and its so relaxing because it's just you and your music or Ill go somewhere relaxing with my friends like the beach or the park & just take & eat some food. It's such a relaxing activity. School can be overwhelming & consume our lives & it shouldn't. Its always good to take a step back & have a moment for you. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1746,"When things get challenging I think it is important to find ways to cope and take care of myself so that I am best able to overcome the challenges I am faced with.  One of the most important things is making sure I am meeting my basic needs of getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and  getting some physical activity.  Also taking time to take some deep breaths can be helpful.  I think when life gets busy and challenging it can be easy to forget to prioritize myself and so making sure I take time for these basics is important.   I also think taking time to be around the people I care about and do things that I enjoy is important when times are challenging as it reminds me of my priorities and values.  Overall taking care of myself and reminding myself of what is important to me in life helps me overcome challenges.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1749,"What do I do when life gets challenging?Great question. I've encountered many moments of struggle in my life, some by chance and others self imposed in pursuit of greater character development. When life gets challenging, I tend to grab the bull by its balls haha. I'm very confrontational and I see struggle/ challenges as an opportunity for growth. Thankfully wrestling and coach JJ (RIP) have taught me so many lessons about pushing through the suck and perseverance that I feel as if I can handle anything. In times of struggle, I reflect on what I've been doing and how it's positively and negatively been affecting my life. I explore all possible options then act according to the best option. School has been a constant struggle between time management of essential events throughout the week such as wrestling, sleeping on time, eating right, saving & making money, etc. Overall I'm in a very good headspace and although my grades could be better, I'm going at my own pace and that's good enough for me. It's really hard balancing the stuff on my plate right now however I know my priorities and how to most efficiently expend my time and energy. It's important to reassess, revaluate, and act according to your priorities so that you remain a vector in the direction of your goals."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1752,"When life gets hard, I often try to talk to my friends about it, so I can vent. I realize venting makes me feel a bit better. I also try to hang out with my friends more and do things like day trips, get dinner/drinks, etc. I try to take a break from whatever is stressing me out. I also enjoy keeping a planner to keep my life as organized as possible. I struggle with anxiety and have an extremely full school and work schedule, so life gets hard pretty often, but keeping a planner at least helps me keep my thoughts organized and clear a little bit. I am a big fan of routine as well overall. So when I get upset or stressed, I try my hardest to not break my regular routine. I also try to remind myself to just take things day by day, in an attempt to not overwhelm myself. In terms of hobbies to help me chill out, I love working out, it's a great way to make myself feel better. I also love to draw so I do that occasionally. Online shopping is also a big stress reliever for me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1754,"When life starts to get challenging, I usually like to take a break and if I'm behind on sleep, I will take a nap, and if not, then I usually like to spend time with friends and family to get my mind of the challenging part in my life. I sometimes also like to ask for help from friends and family if is needed but with school work, I tend to just push assignments aside for a day so that my brain can have a moment to relax. I even will turn assignments in late because I would rather take care of my mental health rather then cramming so much work in one night and not getting enough sleep. I personally am a procrastinator and won't do assignments until 2 days before the due date or on the day it's due because I like to plan my days out sothat I don't stress over assignments but if I somehow end up cramming a lot of assignments in one day, I typically like to go out and do some thrift shopping or just watch some t.v."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1740,"Kymber GastinellAssignment: Reflective Journal #3    When things get challenging in life, I tend to just handle my emotions first. If that means crying, screaming, or just having some alone time with myself - then I do that. Not dealing with the emotions can easily have damaging effects for me. So, that’s the very first thing I have to do. Another thing I do when life gets challenging is do something to relax me and just have positive reinforcements. Also, when life does get challenging, I pray and go into a space of just dealing with the situation. Moreover, I talk to family members and close friends about what’s going on, and gather different perspectives that would help me.     Then, I would do hobbies/activities that I know would bring me joy. Listening to music, working out, taking car trips or just getting out the house - I do those activities/hobbies just to help and bring in some type of peace factor. I think those are just two major things I do when life is getting challenging. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1758,"When life gets challenging I try to take a step back and think of what steps I can do to move forward and persevere. I used to get very overwhelmed when I was faced with challenges and as a result, I would back away and avoid them. This became a really bad habit and prevented me from moving forward. For example, I used to be a terrible studier. When I had multiple exams in a week and I had to work that week as well, I would start to procrastinate and avoid studying because I knew I had a very limited amount of time and I didn’t want to feel the stress. But avoiding it just made things worse. I have now learned that when challenges come into my life I need to take some time to think about how I am creating my own stress. There are always solutions to get through challenges in life so now I try my best to stay calm and focus on the solution rather than letting the stress get to me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1755,"What do I do when life gets challenging?	At the beginning of the school year, life was pretty challenging and I was a little overwhelmed. However, as time went on, I fell into a routine and things began to get easier. I find that having a routine and planning out your day helps. Knowing what you need to get done and planning it out creates good time management skills and an overall better work ethic. Throughout this year, I have learned how to balance going to school full-time as a biochemistry major, going to night school part-time trying to become an EMT, and working at Starbucks on the weekends. At times it has been very stressful but having a routine and planning out my days have been really helpful. Also having the support of friends and family has been great too. Since I still live at home, coming home to fresh food cooked by my parents has been great. Not needing to worry about cooking or what I am going to eat saves me tons of time that I can otherwise spend doing something else. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1759,"When life gets challenging, I tend to make time for breaks. Especially during the times when school becomes stressful and work begins to become more difficult, I like to take a step back and do something that makes me feel happy. Some activities that help me relax are drawing, gardening, baking, watching movies, and listening to music. Remembering to get sunlight is also a great way to destress. I’ve heard that exposure to sunlight and fresh air can help you relax; your body also releases “happy hormones” in response to getting some sun. Whenever things become too difficult for me to handle on my own, I like to talk to my parents, my sister, or my friends. Asking for help can sometimes give you a different perspective on what you are dealing with. Since things tend to cloud my head and give me anxiety, talking to people helps me feel that I am not alone."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1738,"I feel that life in general always have many challenges even though sometimes they are more apparent than others. Personally, when I am struggling to find motivation or when I am stressed out with my work, I like to take a break and do something else to give myself some space. I believe that this allows for me to clear my head and reorganize myself to create a plan that is more productive. I like to find something that would relax me or something I just enjoy doing. After the break, I plan out what I need to do and look for resources that will help me get the work done. I also like to ask for help from others as well as suggestions or advice. This gives me a different perspective and allows for me to understand that there are solutions to whatever problems I am facing. It is important to take time to refuel yourself and give yourself that mental break, if not then it can cause you to burn out. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1757,"When my life gets challenging, I remind myself of how privileged I am to be able to go to University. I forgot about it often because I am considered lower-class but I am much more privileged than other kids who are not able to go to University or even finish their high school diploma. I also remind myself that I have family and friends who love me and support me and who will always be here for me even if I make mistakes. Being able to say that I am going to college in a city like San Francisco (a city thats known for being really expensive and knowing that the school is paying for my education so I don't have to worry about for the time being feels like a big relieve because I won't have to bother my family with worrying about how we are going to pay for my education. "
