2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1750,"I have many different resources that support me in life, but the main support system that I use are my friends and family. They support me in so many different ways and are honestly one of the main reasons I am still in school. Specifically, my parents and my grandparents are helping push my way through school right now so that I can find a good career in the future and not have to worry about much in my life. They inspire me to pursue my dreams and they do not pressure me so much that it is unbearable. Whenever my head gets clouded and I feel a little lost, I know I can look to them for advice and they will usually help me find the answer I am looking for. I also have a strong support group of friends that I know I can rely on if I need help."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1758,"For support in school, I have my professors and classmates. When I’m having trouble in one of my classes, I always try to make time to go to office hours and get my question answered. Sometimes I can’t make it to office hours but I’m in a group on GroupMe where a bunch of my classmates can message each other and get help on homework problems. We also study together sometimes through Zoom. This is a big help because if I type a question in the chat someone will respond rather quickly and this allows me to get help any time I need it. I also have my brother who supports me. I can talk to him about what's stressing me out in school and he helps me think of a plan for how I should manage my time and relieve my stress."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1747,"I feel like there are so many resources that are always there for my needs which I am grateful for. My family is the number one resource I have because I go to them for guidance and whenever I feel like I'm lost. They provide me with my personal and overall help which is why I always go to them first. Professors are also great resources that are always there whenever I feel confused or need further explanation. They leave time for questions during lectures and have specific times dedicated for students to ask about different things. There is also the school that provides a wide variety of guidance for many fields. Also, the web is a great resource for searching up videos and looking up almost anything and everything. If you think about it almost everything is a resource but only if you take advantage of it, so if you ever feel in need of support just look around you and you will see support coming from every direction!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1754,"I honestly don't feel like I have any resources that support me and that might be entirely my fault as I don't do much to seek out those resources. One resource I feel like I should take advantage of is the disabilities center so that I get more time on exams due to my high levels of anxiety. I also feel that I don't know many resources that are available to me. I am just trying to get through schooling and the resources might be helpful. I know that professors offer office hours but I personally have to much anxiety to go and ask anything and that is what is greatly impacting me from learning more and understanding topics we are currently learning. I think that I will go over some resources and look for more because I know they are available, I just haven't looked which is not a good thing."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1738,"Specifically for this class, I feel like the main resources that I have would be my peers as well as the office hours that the professor holds. I would usually ask my classmates for help or if I need any clarifications on any topics. I would also ask for help on homework if I am stuck and have already tried to find other ways to answers. If I am not able to figure out a question even after asking my classmates, I know that there are office hours that I could attend to get more help. There are also lecture video recordings and past recordings that I could watch to either refresh my memory on the topic or to review and learn the material again. I also like the resource link homework that we have. This gives me an organized spot where all the helpful links would be located. I also know that there are more resources beyond the class that could also help me if I need it. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1739,"This semester has so far been a challenging but rewarding semester. It has been a challenge for me to continuously keep up with my courses while studying for upcoming exams and quizzes. Although, it has been a great learning experience to utilize what went wrong during the semester, to then apply them to my upcoming semesters. Reaching in towards my academics, I’ve noticed that I need some more practice and understanding in my general physics course and calculus course. Based on these circumstances, I have reached out to fellow classmates to ask about confusing topics or questions discussed in class. It has been a great way to compare and discuss any approximations and understandings that can later be evaluated. I’ve also seen that reaching out for assistance during office hours has assisted me in reassuring any confusion. Since the lectures can become heavy and quick, having a one on one with the instructor has allowed me to ensure a proper understanding of any specific topics that I may have."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1746,I have many resources to turn to for support.  For help with coursework knowing my professors want me to succeed and are there during office hours is helpful.  It is also nice to have the support of classmates and knowing I can ask them for help if there are concepts I am struggling with or studying together is a good support system.  I also have the support of family members and friends to remind me of my strengths when I am challenged. This type of emotional support can be useful in seeing the bigger picture and staying true to my values.  Sometimes even getting support from my pets like petting my dog can help ground me in a stressful situation.   I am grateful that as I have gotten older I have gotten better about asking for help and having many different sources of support to turn to.    
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1744,"There are a lot of resources available to support me. First off school is one. Having the opportunity to further my education and find a job after college and make more money is such an important thing. College also offers me to pursue certain careers that are only offered to college graduates. And as your going through college, different resources are offered to you as aid so you can get through your studies whether that in the form of student loans and scholarships, free food, social clubs, and even mental and physical health support programs. By far my biggest support are my parents. Without them I wouldn't be here."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1752,"For me, my greatest form of support comes from my immediate household family. My parents have always been patient and understanding of my college journey, so I am glad I have them to talk to and rely on. While my parents are college graduates, I am the first in my family to be a STEM major and the first to have the goal of working in healthcare. While my parents do not fully understand the extant pressure and competitiveness that comes with STEM and healthcare-focused graduate school applications, they do their best to do whatever they can to make me feel supported. They also emphasize to me that taking care of myself mentally and physically is just as important as my academic abilities. I also find most of my professors so far, always willing to help and encouraging questions, which I appreciate. I have had my professors in the past make seem like additional assistance was an inconvenience to them, and as a result, I was often afraid to ask questions. When professors are open and willing to help, and emphasize it's okay not to understand concepts, right away, it makes me feel better and makes me more comfortable to reach out for help when I need it, and gives me a better opportunity to do well in class!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1741,"I have a few resources implemented support me. One resource I have available to me for this class specifically is my professors office hours that are available to me when & if needed by appointment or specific set of hours. I also have the SFSU tutors who can help me when needed via zoom on most topics, i've been meaning to meet up with them. Another resource I have available to me is youtube. I love youtube, it's such a great tool & Ive used it for many classes, there are teachers on there who can teach on topic in many ways & i really enjoy that. It gives me the opportunity to learn one thing in many ways & not just one, sometimes its very helpful to have many ways available to me & one that I find easiest. These resources are there for me when I need them to help me excel in my classes not just physics. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1743,"""What resources do I have to support me?""     Well it’s hard to open up and know exactly what resource you need as the first step of getting these resource is to identify the problem so you can find a solution. In almost all the cases these resource will never come to you but you go to them. So the only resource I could think of that I can’t get right now is Moral Support. Taking to friends is a good way to get support but it’s hard for someone to open up everything onto the other person as there are many factor that comes in play. 1 might be that even though they are your friend they don’t need to hear your life story as they have their own problems to deal with so they can’t deal with all your problems. And 2 not everyone gives good advice. For people who aren’t that social, it’s hard to find these type of people."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1759,"Some resources that I have to support my learning are the physics SCI class and my peers. A majority of the time, the SCI class helps me the most by acknowledging the use of certain equations and why they work in given circumstances. Not only does my SCI class help me understand equations, but it also gives me a sense of belonging. It’s nice to know that I am not the only one who doesn’t completely understand the class content and that I have two amazing instructors to help me through it. My peers may also help, but I have been reluctant to ask for help from some of them. The class is usually split up into two groups: people who understand everything and people who don’t understand anything. It upsets me that I fall in between the two groups and that I cannot fully relate to either of the groups; I’m sure some of my other peers feel the same way. However, I hope to reach out more to others in order to create a study group and, possibly, make new friends."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1749,"What resources do i have to support me?I am blessed to have an abundance of resources supporting me. Two loving parents that support my journey, thankfully a solid bank account balance, and a team full of friends that have my back. Thankfully, I am blessed to have been taught discipline and perseverance in both mental and physical virtues. Wrestling has taught me how to approach a problem from many different trains of thoughts and overcome a problem. Additionally, it's taught me to manage mental stress. In pursuit of greater wrestling attributes I have become a more healthy eater, student, and person overall. My coaches push me everyday to seek greatness in all aspects of life. Both my sisters push me to become the best version of myself in school and in wrestling. They inspire me to carry out my vision for my future and push through academic challenges. With my oldest sister achieving her dream of becoming a vet, my older sister applying to dental school while wrestling though college, I am motivated to keep on pushing."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1742,"I think I have a good amount of resources to support me, both academically and personally. For school, my MARC fellowship has given me financial support, so I don't have to worry as much about tuition and buying supplies and can focus on my schoolwork and research. I also met new mentors from that program that have helped me get into a research lab and present my findings. This has led to me gaining research experience and build some new connections. I also think my classmates within that program are constantly supporting each other. They offer their experiences, advice, and want to see others succeed with them. As for my personal life, I have a close group of friends whom have stuck by me since elementary school. We've gone through so much together and I appreciate all the fun and connections we have with each other. My boyfriend is also a great supporter, encouraging me to follow my academic dreams and offering help when he can."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1756,"I have not been able to stay on campus for too long this semester to really be able to use the resources there, especially when it comes to physics and any of my other classes, however, I have been making use of the physics discord. Everyone is very helpful and can help with confusion or questions. I think it is a good resource because when another student explains it, it helps me, and other students because a teacher's perspective can be a little different. I also try to engage in lecture office hours or review sessions if I am confused about the material that I bring later to the lab, but it has been decent enough. Those are the only two main resources I have that support me and when it comes to different classes I do the same- talk to my peers and classmates because learning together and explaining different equations and topics is so much easier to do and understand. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1748,"Some of the resources that I have to support me are my instructor, my peers, my family, and the services that the school provides for tutoring and learning. However, I have not really looked into the resources that the school provides but I do know that they offer tutoring services in the library. Also, I believe there is a course that was designed specifically to help with Physics labs/lectures. Other potential resources could be my local library and the tutoring or other help that they provide to the community. I think that professors are an extremely valuable resource because you can set up office hours with them if you have any further questions that you do not want to ask in the class lecture. Peers are an excellent resource too because you are learning the same material that they are so there is a greater chance of figuring out a problem if you collaborate and share your ideas with each other. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1751,"I have a lot of resources to support me. This includes peers, my therapist, my family and friends and the internet. I am unfortunately going through a rough time right now and the stress of school and life is starting to grind down on me hard. However, I have so many resources to help me get through this time that nothing feels too impossible. Between my family, therapist and friends, I have enough moral support to get me out of dark head spaces. They provide me with skills I need to come out of panic attacks and to organize my responsibilities so that I can avoid getting overwhelmed. I have my peers to help support me in getting things turned in on time and understanding difficult concepts that I struggle with. My peers have been a very important resource to help me this semester especially since I am taking a large course load with mainly classes that have labs and it’s hard to keep track of all my due dates. I wouldn’t be able to get through some of these classes without my peers keeping me in check. Lastly, the internet is a strong resource for me. Between looking up meditations and yoga to calm my nervous system, to youtube tutorials on how to solve specific problems, I wouldn’t be able to make it through without it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1740,"Kymber Gastinell Assignment: Reflective Journal #4    What resources do I have to support me? - When I think of this question and how I have an extensive support system - I get instantly happy and relaxed. One of my prime resources of support are my family members. When I’m  going through something difficult or challenging, I know I can have support from my family. From getting loads of advice, guidance, and most importantly love. Besides the family aspect, I have support academically with some of my peers. Just having numerous uplifting words and true comfort has been momentumal for me. Then, there are the many mentors I have as well. The sense of support and guidance I feel with my mentors has helped me a lot. From, gathering different perspectives and applying them to whatever I need advice on. Nonetheless, I think it’s very important to have a support system. It doesn’t matter if the support system is within your home or not. It just truly matters to have a support system in place because it truly does matter (and it be some positive for many).    Finally, I think having multiple support systems is really healthy as well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1755,"Since the start of school in August, I have been very busy. Not just busy with school, but also with work and taking care of myself. Lately, I have been going to school during the day at San Francisco State University, going to school during the evening at a local community college, and working Saturday/Sunday at Starbucks. At times, going to two different schools and working at the same time has been overwhelming. However, I have had a lot of resources to support me during this time. Some of these resources include friends, family, and resources provided by schools like San Francisco State and my local community college. Some of the best resources I have had to support me have been friends and family. It had been nice to have friends to talk to and hang out with within my limited free time, which gives me a break from schoolwork. It has also been nice having a family that cooks for me, so I can spend more time doing other important things. In regards to resources at school, I have a lot at my local community college but not so much at San Francisco State University that I find helpful. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1757,"Going to school at San Francisco State University has a lot of perks. One of them is that they offer a lot of resources for anything. Free tutoring, therapy, advising and many, many more. Knowing that I have these amazing resources that come from SFSU is very revealing because I know that if I need anything I can look for support from SFSU. Resources that I have that aren't from SFSU would come from my hometown, family and friends. My hometown offer many resources like music classes, public library, gym, etc. My family and friends offer me support and comfort; knowing that I can rely on them for anything is the biggest resource I can ask for. I am forever grateful to SFSU for having these resources available to their students because without them I don't know how my grades would be."
