2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1756,"My current short-term goals are to do well in the lecture and lab for this class and to actually learn the material as well as be engaged in what I'm learning since I hate any types of numbers or calculations. This class has been helpful in having group work discussions when we have to do the labs. Although my long-term goal is to graduate with a biology degree and get into the nursing programs, this class helps me with connecting out of my subject reach and learn new things I didn't know about. I think we can get more insight with each other though during labs because I feel like communication is lacking at many points and we need to work on more problems. In the past two labs, my teammates don't talk as much, and I think this class should be a little bit more about working together and talking to each other because my long-term goals will be about working and talking with others to solve something."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1738,"My goal is to graduate with my biology degree and this class is one of the many classes that are required for me to get my degree. I am also planning to take the MCAT in order to get into medical school, so physics will help me with studying for it. It would be better to take a class and learn to study versus teaching myself physics. I hope this class will teach me a lot and help me out in the future with my next series of physics. This class is a prerequisite of the next in the series so I hope that the information I learn will carry on. I also hope that this class will give me more practice with the material in order for me to retain that information for later on. By taking this class and graduating, I can move on and achieve my long term goal of attending medical school and becoming a doctor."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1740,"Kymber GastinellAssignment: Reflective Journal     For myself, I have numerous goals for myself that I want to accomplish - personal, professional, and academically. Academically, I want to really excel for all of my core courses. I want to steadily raise my grades/gpa because it’s not where it should be. Nonetheless, I recognize this could be a stressful predicament to be in. It’s really stressful if I think more in depth about it. Personally, I think my goals deal with more of my mental health aspects, especially with this semester. I think I’ve been rather stressed out this semester - dealing with the pandemic, more online-learning, and even having personal problems occur. It’s a lot to handle when I’m thinking about school. Also, I have to constantly remind myself to take breaks, be mindful about myself, and use positivity outlooks.     When I think about this class and in terms of achieving my goals - I think it’s more a part of my goals. Having to at least pass my classes and maintaining a schedule has definitely helped. This class has kept me on my ‘toes’ in a sense and really maintains a schedule. Definitely has been a huge help with achieving my goals."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1751,"My goals are to get a Doctorate, be in a profession I enjoy, be knowledgeable on all subjects and be happy overall.  This class is going to help get me to those goals in multiple ways. The first one being my doctorate! This class is a stepping stone needed for my major, Microbiology, so I can go to med school. Even though I don't think I will be using a lot of Physics in med school, having the basic knowledge as to how it works is extremely important. I also think that it is helpful in learning how to think in a different way. Biology feels like a very straight-forward subject to me that doesn't require much thinking, just memorizing a lot of terms. This class is giving me the ability to think critically to solve problems. That skill is going to be important if I end up becoming a forensic pathologist as well which is the ultimate goal of goals. I also think having a basic knowledge/understanding of all major subjects is an important quality to have to get through life. Not only does learning new things stimulate your brain, but you can help so many people with having a basic knowledge of these things! I sometimes help out friends in different majors because I have taken so many classes that aren't part of my major core, but still give me some basic knowledge that I can help my friends with."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1748,"My long-term goal is to receive a bachelor's degree but my short-term goal right now is to earn a passing grade for Physics. This class is helping me to achieve these goals by expanding my knowledge of Physics and building upon the ideas that are taught in the lecture portion of the class. In the lab, I am able to communicate and collaborate with other peers in an exchange of ideas that allows all of us involved to strengthen our understanding of Physics. So far, this has benefitted me and has kept my grade up. By continuing to focus on the collaboration of labs and the understanding of the overall material, I think I will be able to earn a passing grade in the class. This would certainly bring me closer to my long-term goal of receiving a bachelor's degree because a Physics course is required for the major that I am interested in."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1741,"My main goal is to one day become a doctor & help/treat people, kids more specifically. A more attainable goal for now is to be able to pass this class with a solid understanding of physics. With this in mind I know physics is a cre class needed to be able to accomplish this main goal. This class, physics and physics lab, is huge when it comes to being in the medical field and pursuing a career in medicine, diagnosing people, treatment of illnesses, x-rays, imaging etc... all has to do with physics. How can I be successful in my career if I can't understand the fundamentals of physics and how they are applied in not only medicine but my everyday life. I hope this class helps me to understand the basics needed to be successful in my future classes and career and how and where to apply its use. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1759,"My goals are to have a career in marine biology and to teach the youth about ocean conservation. I prefer to work at a museum like the Academy of Sciences or the Exploratorium. I feel that this class will help me to achieve my goals because it is giving me a solid foundation for what I am going to learn in the future. During my last two years of college, and hopefully graduate school, I will be learning the most about my major and the field I plan to study in. So far, I feel that many aspects of physics can be applied to the ocean. Some examples where physics could be applicable are ocean depth pressure, the velocity and speed of waves, and the magnetic force of the moon on the ocean. Something that I am interested in is how marine organisms have been able to adapt to the unpredictable conditions of the ocean. At some times the waves could be calm, but could also be choppy and stormy."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1758,"My goal in this lab class is to gain a clear understanding of physics principles so I can apply them to my lecture class and do well on my tests. I need this class for my major and although I am majoring in biochemistry, I do believe physics is important because it teaches good problem solving skills. This lab class is helping me with my critical thinking as well. The relationship between position vs. time and velocity vs. time graphs was confusing at first but after putting a lot of effort into understanding the concepts it makes much more sense now. It is also interesting to learn why objects behave the way they do. It was interesting to learn how if an object has an initial velocity in the positive direction and it experiences negative acceleration, at the point where it is at rest and changing direction it is actually still experiencing negative acceleration. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1753,"My goals for this semester are to build the foundation of my understanding in physics. I find that the concepts of physics are pretty intrinsic, but the formulas are where I begin to have problems. I have a tougher time trying to apply them in that sense. which is why I have been doing my best to understand it. I have gone to tutoring almost every day which helps in completing questions that I don't have a firm grasp on. To be a credible and reliable scientist, I need to know fundamental physics. I would like to learn more about these topics so that if they come up in the future, I will know how to solve them. I am very excited to become an official scientist, but I need to build the skills needed in order to do so. This class is the beginning of that goal, since this is one of the fundamental classes that will be used to build a stronger understanding of other advanced concepts."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1755,"What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?	My long-term goal, as I had mentioned before, is to eventually finish my undergrad here at San Francisco State University and then apply to medical school. Right not I am pursuing an undergraduate degree in biochemistry, and plan to finish within the next two years or so. After that, I plan to take a gap year and maybe work part-time as a paramedic to get clinical experience before I apply to medical school. I am already EMT certified so getting paramedic certified shouldn't be much more difficult. This class is helping me achieve my goal of one day attending medical school because 1 year of physics is a prerequisite for all medical schools. Passing this class with an A or B is crucial for me to get into a good medical school. Thus, I am trying my best to pass this class not only to prepare me for physics next semester but also to get into a good medical school. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1739,"My goals for this semester is to gain a greater understanding of the general concepts of physics and how it can be applied to the real world. I hope to also apply my knowledge obtained from taking this course into the next physics courses that I encounter. I am currently taking chemistry, calculus, and physics this semester. These subjects contain similar rules regarding significant figures, units, and scientific principles. At the same time, these subjects are completely different in the field. Although these subjects may be completely different from one another, I hope to differentiate the key ideas associated with the subjects. By taking this course, it would allow me to develop new skills. These skills would allow me to accomplish my goal of differentiating between each subject’s principles and ideas. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1754,"My goal is to get my bachelor's in zoology, gain experience out in the field, and go abroad in about 5 years to study animals and maybe become a vet to help them as well. I am still uncertain if I want to become a vet before I get my career started but I do know that I want to go abroad to help endangered animals especially the larger wild animals. If I do not go abroad, I want to work at animal sanctuaries for large wild animals or a zoo and while I am doing that, I plan to go to veterinary school and become a vet zoologist. This class is helping me achieve my goals because it is helping me to gain an understanding of the drag and lift that affects flight animals and if I were to study marine animals and other aquatic animals like hippos, alligators, etc., it will help me to understand the physics of water flow."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1752,"My goals in this class are to improve and broaden my perspective of physics. I tend to struggle with converting word problems/real-world situations into equations and tend to get overwhelmed. I realize the math in physics is not actually very hard, but translating words into equations is what many struggle with. But many life tasks require this ability, and so I hoping to get more practice in being able to identify parts of a sentence, and being able to determine their significance and compose a solvable equation. This process also aids in helping me look at situations from a different perspective. I feel if I can nail down a word to equation translating, then I can actually be really good at physics and enjoy it. This class is meant to build a solid foundation for this type of translation, and I am hoping it will be really good practice! Also, we are constantly surrounded by physics in the real world, and having basic physics knowledge of how things work, and why they work can be helpful in solving in more complex, complicated problems in the future. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1747,"When I was younger my one goal in life was to be rich, funny right. I mean everyone wanted to be rich who didn't want to live in a mansion and be served a fancy plate of fruit. But as a grew older I found it exhausting and it seemed something that was impossible to achieve. Spend the first 12 years of your life in school and then to college and then start looking for a job and even then you still have a lot of responsibilities to pay off. All these things made me realize that I would rather find happiness than run after money. My goal is to be happy with what I do. I want to become a dentist and this class is one step closer to becoming a dentist which would make me happy thus achieving my goal. An although becoming a dentist is a goal it's self it also ties to the happiness that can arise from such achievement. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1750,"This year, my goals are to focus on myself and my school. The past couple years have been extremely tough for me with Covid-19 and staying motivated to continue school. During all of quarantine I was not able to motivate myself to wake up and go to my computer just for class. It got to the point where I decided to take my whole second year as a sort of ""gap-year"" in my schooling and just focus on myself and work. For all of 2020-2021 I was just continuously working and focusing more on my mental health in the hard times, everyone was going through and it better prepared me to come back and focus in school so I can at least graduate. This class can help me achieve my goal by being one of the first stepping stones back into grinding out classes and investing more into myself. I also hope to continue expanding my connections with those around me while figuring out where I will go next in life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1746,"My goals are to challenge myself, to feel enthusiastic about learning, and to feel confident in myself.  This class is helping me challenge myself as it is difficult material and thus I have stepped out of my comfort zone at times to ask for help which is a good thing to know how to do.  I also feel enthusiastic about learning physics content as I can relate them to real world concepts which I find rewarding.  I also am learning to feel confident about myself because even though at first sometimes physics concepts and problems seem challenging, as I practice and do more problems I feel like I start to understand more.  Having confidence that with practice I can get better at solving physics problems will be helpful for my success in the class.  These skills will also be useful elsewhere.  I am taking the class as a pre-requisite for dental school.  However, the learning strategies and confidence in myself I can gain from this class will also help me succeed in my future goals and endeavors."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1757,My goals as of right now is to become a Wildlife Veterinarian. To be able to achieve that I need to pass this class and others to be able to graduate with my Bachelors degree and get into Veterinary school. I need to pass this class with a C- or better. Of course the better the grade the better my chances are of getting into Vet school are. This class is helping me achieve my goals because it is helping me to get into the other classes I need that require Physics 111 and 112 are a prerequisite. Physics is also something I struggle with so knowing that I'm getting better at understanding something that I'm going to end up using later on in life is really cool!
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1744,My ultimate goal is to get good grades and graduate college. I need to be more on top of my schoolwork in order for this to happen. I have been very busy with other things and have not been able to prioritize my schoolwork like I should. I will just have to work extra in order to be on top of things again. I have not been sleeping much either. I'm probably averaging 4 to 5 hours a night which is not sufficient. The lack of sleep also impairs my ability to focus on schoolwork and get stuff done. Once I get everything together again I will do fine. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1743,"School has been coming pretty well so far. Midterms are coming up for some of my classes so my goal right now is to study well for them. To achieve this goal, I will spend more time on school work. I also need to catch up on my work for this class as I just do the homework before the class next week. To achieve this goal, I need to spend more time during the weekend for this class but I feel like we should get a full week to do the labs and such, and since you grade the homework during the next week’s class. Another goal I might do sometime soon is to do an off school project to get experience for my major and future job’s resume. I been trying for a while now but never got to it so not sure if this is going to happen any time soon."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1742,"At this point in my life, my main goal is to graduate college and get my bachelor's degree in zoology. Eventually, I would like to pursue my Master's degree or a PHD. Ideally, I will do all this with a high GPA standing and a good amount of biological research under my belt. I would also like to enter a scientific career where I can be interested in my work and can provide a positive impact on the Earth. This class is acting as a stepping stone in my college journey and will fulfill one of my major requirements. It also is demystifying my perception of physics because I thought it was just another math class. Now it feels like a math class with physical science mixed in. It is challenging to me, but as I learn more and more I find myself satisfied when I understand a new concept. "
