2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1750,"My family is one of the main reasons why I wanted to go to college because they support what I want to do unconditionally. Some of the major values that they ingrained into me while I was a child was that education was a key to wealth but family is the key to happiness. You can always find money in life so I want to pursue a medical career so I can do something that I want to do, and be financially stable to support a family of my own one day. I'm still figuring out what I want to specialize in but so far I think pathology is the most interesting to me. As a pathologist you are given specimens to examine and see what issues are happening in that person's body. Almost like a detective putting crime scene pieces together, finding the root of the issue and solving the problem."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1758,"My family taught me the value of hard work. Working hard isn’t always “fun” and sometimes you feel burnt-out but its important to always try your best. This has helped me navigate through college because I’ve always had trouble with focusing but I’ve learned to get better because I’ve realized how good it feels to work hard and earn a good grade. Sometimes when I’m studying my mind drifts to something else and I start to feel the pull to go look on my phone or do something else that is completely unproductive. However, I always try to keep in mind that I’m working hard in school for a reason. It will feel much better to persevere through this challenge and earn a good grade rather than to procrastinate and indulge in something that is instantly gratifying. My family has also taught me the value of education and finding a career that I am truly interested in. It took me a while, but now I feel like I have much more of a purpose in college. It was harder for me to focus on school before because I didn’t know what I was doing it for but now that I can see the future that I want, the hard work that I am putting into school seems worth it and I actually enjoy learning."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1743,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""Well my family helps me through financial support. They are paying for my rent and tuition as they want me to focus on studying instead of working. I'm not sure if this really helped me out as I really want to work so I can get the full college experience of working, studying, playing, and spending as much as I want. But I can't achieve that. Now all I have is study and play. I feel like if I get the chance to work, my gaming life will drastically decrease as I will need more time to study. I would also have a chance to spend on unnecessary things as I earn the money and eat out more but that's not the case. Well there are pros and cons on both ends and on the current end Im on, I have all the time in the day to study."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1759,"My values within my family helped me to navigate my way through college by reminding me to be true to myself. My mom has always taught me the importance of prioritizing and knowing my own limits. In college, the common narrative is that people often go to parties to get drunk and smoke weed. I believe that the narrative is true, but I don’t give in to it. I have heard of the parties that some students at SFSU throw, but they don’t sound appealing to me. Parties aren’t really my thing and I have the most fun with small groups of people or just by myself. When I’m with a small group of people or by myself, I can read, write, draw, or listen to music at my own pace. In addition, I mostly prioritize schoolwork over going out with friends or going to parties. I like making sure that all of my work is done before I go out and have fun."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1755,"Throughout my life, my parents have held my siblings and I to a very high standard. My parents were both born in Portugal and were brought up on very strong values, which they are constantly trying to instill in us. While living in Portugal, my parents received practically no education as they were forced to work on the family farm to help make ends meet. It was not until my parents immigrated to the United States that they were able to receive an adequate education. My dad was never able to finish high school because he struggled to learn English. My mom was able to graduate high school and later pursued a teaching degree at San Jose State. My parents have always instilled the importance of higher education in my siblings and I. Thus, encouraging us all to attend college. The motivation and perseverance my parents once had has encouraged my siblings and I to further our education and do something better with our lives. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1742,"I think every Mexican family that has immigrated to the United States thinks that the youngest generation must be better than the previous ones. This is how my grandparents and maybe even my parents think of me and my siblings. This has pushed me to always be the one to pass everything with good grades and keep going even if I feel like I'm drowning. But, this has also given me a motivation to succeed because I don't want their sacrifices to be pushed aside when it has allowed me to pursue my goals. My mom has always told me that she will help me as much as she can through college. She has made sure that I know that there is always food and shelter for me when I need it and that has taken a big weight off my shoulders. My older cousin and aunt have also been big helps because they have already gone through college and give me tips on how to navigate the terrain."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1749,"*Late because was traveling for wrestling, talked to professor hossain about absence and late submission in advance*The values of my community and ethnic family has greatly helped me navigate through college. Both of my parents immigrated from different countries-- the Philippines and Iraq-- and have been very directive in how I approach my studies. At times, it can be very hard living up to their expectations however I am thankful for their efforts in ensuring my success. I am very blessed to have a mother who has came up from a province in the Philippines and became a physician in America. She inspires me to push harder and focus on my studies... Both her and my dad are big on study time so they push me to complete my homework as soon as possible and ask questions immediately if I am struggling with a topic. Additionally, they've instilled great time management skills into me which is crucial when balancing wrestling, work, and school. At the end of the day all they ask of me is to put myself in the best position to excel and to give college me all. I am very thankful"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1740,"Kymber GastinellAssignment: Reflective Journal #5     My family has been literally my inspiration for going to college - and not giving up as well. I grew up around educators my whole entire life and college has been a vocal point. Most importantly, finishing college has been the most important aspect. I think that tends to be one of the aspects why I keep going. Going to college has been really hard, but my family has been impactful for me to keep going. Nonetheless, I’ve kept going because of them as well. Moreover, the moral code I’ve been instilled with at an early age has helped me wth college as well. It’s helped me understand certain aspects individuals have overlooked and not pay attention too. Besides this, it’s helped me pay attention to the bigger picture of college in many ways. From, thinking into other perspectives and listening to other perspectives as well. It’s helped me navigate certain hardships within college as well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1752,"My family definitely values hard work and accepting failures throughout the way, and learning to be okay with them. My career goal is a very competitive field, and therefore I essentially need to give my all to every single class I take, as well as maintain extracurricular such as working, clubs, volunteering, etc. Having to do all of this while keeping a healthy social life, and healthy state of mind is extremely difficult at times, and the ""burnout"" mentality becomes very real. This value of hard work and the acceptance that my family emphasizes helps me a ton. I am fortunate to not have parents that make me feel pressured, and are understanding of my situation. They often remind me that nothing worthwhile comes easy, and failures at some point are inevitable, and ultimately what matters most is that I do things at my own pace, but don't stop working towards my goal. My mom is a perfect example of this mentality, as we come from a low SES family, and have faced many hardships growing up. Yet, my mom has always exhibited unreal levels of determination and commitment, and because of this, she became the 1st in our family to go to college and the first to receive a master's. She is one of the most important people that I look to when it comes to college struggles and just daily hardships, and so it is nice to have her be understanding and supportive of me"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1748,"The values of my family have guided me through my journey in college reminding me to never give up on myself, my ideas, and my capabilities which I can tend to forget at times. My family has all been my greatest support and the values they have instilled in me have navigated me and are still navigating me through stressful times. Even though a test or essay may result in a score that I am not proud of it does not mean that I should quit or underestimate myself because my potential is still within me. My family has fueled me to be resilient and to bounce back stronger than before when faced with disparaging results. My family and friends have also been my light in these dark times and I often rely on them for mental and emotional support. My parents are immigrants, and thus, I feel an enormous urge to make them proud and to build a successful career for myself. However, they always bring me back to reality when I overexert or drown myself in work by reassuring me that they are already proud of me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1746,"My family values learning and hard work ethic.  This in turn has pushed me to do my best in school and continue in higher education.   They have always wanted me to succeed and when I am struggling or doubting my capabilities they remind me that I am capable and smart and work hard.  Similarly my friends in college have been very motivated to do well and go on to grad school after college.  Being around others who work hard in school and care about the things they are learning has helped me maintain my motivation and find support when I am struggling.   Additionally, my friends and family help me find balance too by reminding me of the things I enjoy doing in my free time and what my values are in life.   This has allowed me to prioritize school and hard work while still finding time to enjoy the little things in life such as being with family or walking my dog or reading a book or doing some art for fun.    I think having balance between hard work and being reminded of what you value and enjoy is important to stay motivated and avoid burn out."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1738,My family is very supportive when it comes to education. We believe that education is very important and it will lead to more opportunities in the future. My family always does their best to help me out with my education whether it be academic support or just moral support by being there. I also think that my community values education a lot and we strive for the best. Education is important because we are able to make better decisions if we have a more rounded understand of the world and different concepts. I also thing that my community and family's values has helped me to keep an open mind throughout of college. They give me different perspectives of the world and different opinions. This really helped me to keep a clear head and to develop my own thoughts. I have also had a lot of help from those who have already gone through their college life and have shared their experience with me. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1754,"My family greatly values success in their children partly because my parents are from Mexico and they never had as many opportunities as we kids have today in the United States. I want to work hard as they have in order to support them as they grow older because I want to give back to my parents for everything they have done for me. My family has also told me to do what makes me happy and because of that, I am pursuing a degree in zoology so that one day I can become a zoo veterinarian and then in the future, go abroad to help endangered animals after I have made a living for a while. In high school, I volunteered at my local animal shelter and have always helped during adoption events and always tried my best to give love and attention to all the animals that came and went and I think this is where I decided that I wanted to go out in the world and help the animals that no one really wants to work with as they would be considered exotic and not normal such as cougars, lions, Tasmanian devils, alligators and more. I want to do what I love and provide for my parents and I think that would be success enough for me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1741,"My family is very big on religion, I grew up in a christian house hold with ministers & pastors surrounding me at all times. I didn't click with my religion & would have rather partied & had a wild night the spend my fridays or sundays at church. Now, i've decided to commit my life to my religion & its the best decision I have made. When things get hard, & thats most of the time, I don't worry because I know that it's all in God's hands. Instead of distract myself with things I shouldn't, I pray & read my bible & that has helped me navigate in college, because no matter what, God has a plan for me & nothing can ever change that. If i'm destined to be a doctor, it will be. Life is journey & so is college, I believe college would have been harder to navigate without my religion."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1739,"Reflecting from the semester, it was definitely a challenge compared to previous semesters. This semester was extremely stressful in regards to time managing multiple events every week. These include attending class, seminars, full time work schedule, social activities, and extracurricular activities.  My family and close friends have played a huge role in maintaining  motivation over the course of the semester. Listening and understanding has allowed me to better connect with them on a deeper level. Having someone who understands my situation and resonates with the challenges, has been extremely useful. It creates a safe and welcoming space that allows me to express a certain opinion. In which I may be offered advice on specific events or current challenges that have occurred in the semester. Moral support has overall been the most useful during the semester and I hope to use this strategy and coping mechanism for the upcoming semesters to come."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1756,"It has been hard to have family or my community be helpful in navigating me through college because I am one of the only people in my family who is fully educated and well versed in English. The first to go to a real four-year college so my family does not know what core values I care or need when it comes to my college education. When it comes to classes, applying to things, financial aid applications, I support myself with that. However, they still support me in making sure I take care of my health as I continue going to college, they help me with health because it is important for college students to be reminded to eat, and be healthy mentally and physically. My family is a big reason and value I take into consideration when I am going to college because I do it for them so that's important."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1744,"I don't think my family helped me a lot when it comes to navigating through college. They definitely played a huge role in encouraging me to go to college but didn't do much with the navigating part. I also feel like it is not their fault as I should leave it up to me to see where I want to go and see who I want to become while I am in college. Sadly, I still don't really know what I want to do with my life when it comes to work. It just didn't come that easy for me. I originally was pursuing nursing but decided last minute that it was not for me. Now I am getting a degree in biology but don't know what to do for a career. I would start over if I could and get a degree that I am passionate about, however, school is just too expensive for me to do that. I feel like all I can do at this point is to finish a degree, take what I can, and run with it and hopefully something good comes out of it. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1747,"Respect is a key component of all values. I believe that giving respect to others will get you to more places than you think. In my family respect is super important because it builds a positive relationship with one another and eliminates any type of rude aroura. In college, it's super important to replicate the values that are played in your community or home because by giving people the same respect you do with your family you also earn their respect as well. People will have a positive impression of you and will have nice things said when you are mentioned, It could be professors, instructors, staff members, and even your classmates. You give to receive and when you receive you give and that's something I live by. And with that, you will easily navigate through college with a positive perspective knowing that when you give something you will receive it right back except in some situations which you shouldn't let get to you. Continue doing you and don't let negativity get to you"
