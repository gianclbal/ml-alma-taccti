2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1738,"I am in this class in order to fulfill my major requirement. I also need it as a prerequisite for the higher level physics class. I hope to do well in this class and actually learn more about physics. I think that it is interesting that we are always surrounded by physics, but sometimes it goes unnoticed. Once I finish the course, I think that I will begin to be more aware of my surroundings and how things work the way they do. I also hope that this class will help me out with other classes and benefit me in that way. After I am done with my bachelor’s degree, I would like to apply for medical school or PA school. I am interested in becoming a doctor, but am not too sure which field I would like to specialize in. As for now, I am just trying my best to go through my courses, learn new things and get good grades for later on."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1739,"Since the very beginning of my education, I fell in love with science and math. With the idea that these two core subjects are the core in finding unknown answers, I have become a curious student to research questions that interest me. Utilizing qualitative and quantitative measurements are one of the general necessities to form the scientific method. When it was my time to apply for college, I decided to continue my passion in pursuing a bachelors in Biology. Taking on a science major would allow me to continue with moving forward in the medical field. Taking Physics 111/112 is one of the first steps that I would need to take in order to satisfy the prerequisites for my pre-med journey. Pursuing my degree at SFSU has been one of the greatest decisions so far. I hope to continue to utilize my knowledge to apply key ideas and mathematical interpretations throughout my future courses."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1740,"Kymber Gastinell Assignment: Reflective Journal                                     Why Am I Here?     When I’m thinking of “Why Am I Here?”- I'm thinking about school and exactly why I am in school. It’s been a difficult and challenging road - in terms of school. Especially, if I’m being honest about everything. It’s been challenging in a sense because of certain outside school situations that ultimately have affected my performance. For example, when I was a freshman in college, I had a huge adjustment to living out of state. I was dealing with major family situations that caused a lot of pressure on me. Then, there was the fact I was living in a whole new city and I literally knew nobody. Within these two aspects, major events occurred and had ripple effects on how I performed in school. Also, I ultimately viewed myself in reality - and my self-esteem was very low. Moreover, when I think of the difficult moments, it pertains to the schooling itself. Having to constantly study, learning very difficult topics, and being a STEM major - which can be rather difficult. Especially, for an individual of color because representation is scarce.     Therefore, when I’m thinking of “Why Am I Here?”- I think of how far I’ve come and why I need to keep going. I owe it to myself to keep going and to accomplish one of my goals. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1741,"There are a few reasons i'm enrolled into the physics course. For one, Im in this class because it is a required class for my major and this lab is a requirement for the lecture. Physics is something i use in my everyday life and will be useful in my career. I hope to become a pediatrician and that means working with kids and being able to diagnosis certain conditions. To do that sometimes you need an x-ray and thats physics. Thats just one example of the many ways its used in my future career. In my everyday life, physics is used when I used my headphones, id you still use an alarm clock thats physics, even if you use your alarm clock on your phone thats still physics. Having knowledge in physics is so important for not just everyday life but also if you plan on pursing a career in medicine. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1742,"I am here because I am trying to make a name for myself within my own comfort zone. Gaining higher education can make you stand out in our capitalistic society. But personally I just want to pursue knowledge. It is unfair and unequitable that I have to pay to gain knowledge and have conversations with like-minded people. I am here to be a typical high-achieving college student. I go to class, do my homework, go to work, and pay for my tuition. Eventually I will grow into the role that I want in society. I am here to be a biologist, an animal lover, and a conservationist"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1743,"I am supposed to write about Why I am here for 5 minutes but I don't exactly know the content around this question. Is it about my first couple weeks in school or the first lab I did or just why am I in the class. So I'll just give a few words on each topic. My week went pretty well, I came to college to get a higher education with a better job in the future. I don’t know what to say about the second one but I am in this class because it's a requirement that I need for PHYS 110. The class is pretty alright, but I feel like we get more homework in this lab than in the main class. It is helpful and all to practice but I still feel like it's a bit much for a lab class. The content and instruction with the group work that we have to do in this class is also helpful but in my last breakout room, we didn’t talk at all, we just worked on our own."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1744,I am here because I need this class to complete my biology degree. I still don't know why I need two semesters worth of physics in order to get a bio degree but maybe I will learn why later on. Physics isn't my favorite class but I am excited to see what we are going to learn. I didn't enjoy physics that much in high school but I feel like I might enjoy it a little more in college because the material we will be talking about is more advanced and interesting. I wish we didn't have to do it over zoom. I feel like having labs in person would have been so much more fun. I do not know what type of things we will be doing in class but the stuff they show in movies and on youtube look really cool. I have seen a lot of experiments with weight distribution and balancing different things that don't look like they would balance. Its hard to explain in words since I don't know how its done but I wish I were able to learn it in an in person setting.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1745,"Why am I here in Phys 111/112? I know that to progress in my goal to earn my B.S. degree in Biology, I have to take Physics as a Lower Division requirement. I also know that no matter what career path in Biology I decide to pursue, a solid understanding of Physics would be crucial. I know that the laws of Physics are intertwined with the natural world; studying physics would give me an in-depth understanding of how life functions. But when I ask myself on a deeper level why am I here, the truth is that I don’t know. I know that I chose to study at SFSU for their Biology program and taking Physics is a requirement to earn a degree. Currently, I don’t know why am here regarding my purpose or what specific career I want to pursue. I guess the best thing I can do is to approach studying physics with an open mind as well as other subjects I’m taking, actively participate in class discussions, talk with others, gain experience and exposure in research, and constantly reflect on the reason why I’m here every week. I hope that the next time when I’m asked this question, I can give my answer. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1746,"I am here to fulfill pre-requisites for dental school.  I hope that in addition to fulfilling this prereq I will be able to gain valuable skills that I will be able to use in my future career and life.  I hope to gain a broader understanding of how the world works.  I also hope to gain skills such as problem solving and logical thinking.  In addition, I am here to challenge my self as physics feels a little intimidating but with practice I hope to do well.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1747,Why am I here? The first thing that comes to mind when hearing this question is because I'm forced to be/need to be. But then what is the question really asking why am I in Physics 112 or why am I in Sf State or why am I in the US or why am I in this world. Its a broad question that can get a million answers. I think Im in this class because its one step closer to what I want to achieve in the future and that connects to why I am in sf state because it contains this class and also connects to why I'm in the US to study and lastly why I am in the world because I want to achieve my dreams. Everything is connected to one another somehow which can sum up the general question of why am I here and what the question really means. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1748,"I am taking this Physics course because it is a lower division requirement for my major, and it will enhance my critical thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving skills. Physics has never been a subject that I was fond of because it is often viewed as one of the harder sciences to learn. I took a high school Physics course during my senior year and while my views did not change, I did come to have a greater appreciation and respect for Physics because of how encompassing it is of the natural world. I still think Physics is a challenging subject to learn, but this is because the world and its workings are not easy to understand. I am excited to be taking this course this semester, but I was hoping to take it in person so that I could collaborate with my peers in the lab and have a more interactive experience. However, I am still glad to be taking this course this semester, and I will strive to do the best that I can."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1749,"I am here in pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the mechanics that make up the universe. That being said, physics labs are a great place to start. Being able to focus on specific principles and functions that make up everyday life allows one to apply knowledge gained in other similar scenarios outside of the lab. Additionally, labs provide a base where one can apply knowledge learned in lectures and explore principles discussed. I am super excited to apply knowledge to real world situations to see the bigger picture of the world. Physics is beautiful in the sense, that it is universally applicable. Thankfully, we are blessed to live in a state where knowledge is so readily available; we'd be fools if we do not take advantage of it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1750,"""Why am I here?"" is a thought lots of humans have whenever they want to reflect on themselves. The reason why I am here in college is to make my family proud and become financially stable so that I can support a family of my own one day. I chose to be a bio-major because of how I want to go to medical school and achieve becoming a doctor, all with the prospects of making life better for myself. So far, I would say I have no regrets in life because everything that life happens for a reason and I am happy where I am in life. Going to college in a new city was definitely one of the best decisions I have made because of the great experiences and great people I have met. Even if some of it is not as perfect as I dreamed it would be, that is just how life is."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1751,"I believe that we are all here by chance and that there is nothing pre-planned out for us in the grand scheme of things. We are not special and we are responsible for our own happiness. That is what brings me to why I am in this class. I am here in this class because I believe it will help make me happy in the future. I am extremely interested in science and learning the topics in school doesn't feel like a chore to me, it's something I genuinely look forward to. I am majoring in Microbiology to hopefully go to med school and become a Forensic Pathologist! I believe that majoring in something that I find interesting and that I enjoy learning will make me happy for the rest of my life. Especially since the average person just works every day for 40+ years, 40+ hours a week until they retire, I might as well enjoy what I am doing. So I am here by chance, but I am in this class by choice for the investment of my happiness in my future.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1752,"I am here, honestly because my major requires it ( Physiology). I have never taken a physics course before because I know physics requires good, extensive math skills. While I am okay at math, it takes me a lot of practice to get a formula/theory nailed into my brain and how to correctly utilize it. I tend to make little, tiny mistakes in math, and these tiny mistakes can ultimately lead to a very wrong answer, so sometimes I can get frustrated. Also, physics is definitely a completely different perspective on things, and sometimes the thought of that can be a bit overwhelming. I am excited about this class though because I understand the importance of physics and I am hoping I can brush up on some of my previous math skills. My goal is to work in the medical field and become a physician's assistant, and I am aware that having at least a basic understanding of physics, is extremely important, so I am hoping this class will provide me a good foundation of essential concepts!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1753,"I am here because I belong. I was placed on this path because it was meant for me to fulfill it. The journey to get to this point has been a very difficult one. There were so many challenges, setbacks, and dead-ends. After the endless loop that I was able to break free from, it has made me realize that it was all in preparation for the opportunities I now have. While I will continue to learn for the rest of my life, I am here to grow into the most evolved version of myself as possible. My current situation has been very stressful, and has made me re-evaluate my life. However, I know I am meant to learn something from it and it will elevate my understanding once I successfully grow through it. The point of being ""here"" is to learn as much possible. And I am doing my absolute best to absorb this knowledge."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1754,"I am here because I want to achieve a bachelor’s degree in zoology. I am also here because I need to understand certain components for my animal studies such as the lift and drag when birds or insects fly, or the water flow for aquatic animals. I am here because I need to understand the interactions of matter, space, and forces and how they apply to animals as I want to become a zoological veterinarian and hopefully go abroad one day to help endangered animals. I am also here because I do not understand physics one bit, but I am hoping that with this course, physics will make more sense to me. I am here to complete the courses I need for my degree but with it, I want to retain the knowledge that I learn and for physics, I know it is not going to be an easy task because I took physics in high school and it was the hardest class I personally ever took."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1755,"Why am I here?	The reason I am here, or more specifically enrolled in this course, is because physics is a prerequisite for medical school. After I finish my undergraduate studies in biochemistry, I would like to apply to medical school. To apply for medical school you need to complete at least 1 year of biology, 1 year of general chemistry, 1 year of organic chemistry, and 1 year of physics. In high school, I took physics my senior year and remembered enjoying it, but I don’t really recall much of what I learned. I am excited to be taken physics again in college and hope to learn a lot more about vectors, speed, velocity, and other basic physics concepts. After taking this physics course I plan on taking PHYS 121 and PHYS 122. However, after completing 1 year of physics needed for medical school I don’t think I will continue taking more physics or astronomy courses, although they do interest me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1756,"I am in this class because its a prerequiste for my major- Biology. I also am interested because I have never taken a physics class before, even during highschool. I hate math and physics, I prefer the specifics of biology over numbers, so it has been rough. However I am glad I am here taking this class even though it will never ever be used in the future of my careers which is working in the medical field, but it should help me a get better understanding of stuff that I am not used to. I really want to the learn the basics and make it a more interesting topic than dreading it because I really only like subjects that surround my degree rather than new things. I also want to refresh my math skills through this class too because it has been a few years since I have done math, and my major doesnt really have as many math classes needed."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1757,"I am here, in this specific class, because I want to get my bachelors degree in Zoology. This class is one of the requirements that I need to have completed in order to go to any Veterinary School. I am also here because I'm interested in learning how some physics work as this is my first physics class I've ever taken. Knowing my bad background with math and that this physics class is focused on some math topics, I need to make sure I know the math topics enough to be able to understand the physics topics. I am pretty sure I know the topics I need to study for the future physics subjects that I am going to learn. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1758,"The reason I am taking this class is because I am a biochemistry major and this class is necessary for my major. Although physics isn't what my major is focused on, as a stem major, it is important that I have a solid foundation in all sciences. But of course, physics principles apply to biology and chemistry. For example, in my biochemistry class we learned about the molecule ATP and when a phosphoanhydride bond is broken, a certain amount of energy is released. However, not all of the energy in that bond can be used in the associated chemical reaction, some will be lost as heat. This is the principle of conservation of energy. Also, I think it is important that I learn physics just to get my mind thinking in a certain way. A lot of my biology and chemistry classes are focused on learning facts but physics gets your mind working in a different way because you have to solve problems and think of creative solutions."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1759,"I am in this physics class because I am striving to become a marine biologist. I am currently a second-year majoring in biology with a concentration in marine biology. Not only am I interested in the ocean and marine conservation, but I am also a naturally curious person. I love to build things and know how things work. I like to know why things happen and why they happen in the way that they do. Something that I am incredibly interested in is the concept of  gravity. Gravity has always intrigued me because it is such an important part of our daily lives. Our world is built around gravity and, I have heard, that if gravity were to disappear, our world would most likely fall apart. If our world were to have a slight change in our level of gravity, many things from human development to building foundations will be affected. I am looking forward to learning new things in this class and working with my peers."
