2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1655,"The values of my community helped me navigate through college because I don't live in a very nice neighborhood/community. Since Richmond has high crime rates and there is a lot of poverty here, my community aims for the children to exceed in school so they can help their community become a better place when they get older. In my family, they strive to have their children become better than them which is why they have such high expectations; it is both good and frustrating."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1669,"To be quite honest, I'm not sure how the values of my community or family helped me navigate through college. My family has always been there to support my education financially but I do not think that they were there. I've always felt alone in my schooling process and it has taken a toll on me. I am always unsure of myself, not because I am not confident, but because I don't know what I am doing half of the time. I take each day by day but it just feels like I'm being robotic and just doing these things because I have to."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1670,i value my community and family very greatly. Both of my parents have done a lot to get me to the position I am at right now. I always try my best on all of my assignments I am given during class because I know I have a very strong support system backing me and a very strong family that I want to do good for. I am trying my hardest to pay for all of the expenses of college on my own so my parents do not have to give anymore then they already have to me. They already have provided enough aide for me so I will try to do things by myself so they can rest and take it easy.  
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1666,"Without my family I probably wouldn’t have been motivated enough to go to college, but with their support, I’m here now learning all sorts of things. My parents didn’t go to college, and struggled. My family didn’t want that for me, so here I am, working my best."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1684,"The values that I learned growing up have definitely helped me navigate through college. I know that school is important and should be a priority, but also taking care of myself and my mental health is important too. When it comes to school, it’s important to stay organized and stay on top of homework/studying so I’m not cramming at the last second. It’s good to participate in class and ask questions when I have them. When studying, I like to go over multiple problems to help me learn and remember things, which my mom and I did often while I was growing up. I generally like learning, so I will put in the extra time and effort if I don’t understand something. Also throughout college, I have gone through some emotionally terrible events, which my family and friends have helped me navigate. I’ve learned healthier coping skills, I’ve realized it’s okay to take a mental health day if I need it, and that I need to space out my work so I don’t become too stressed out."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1677,"I use my the value of my community and family as a way to motivate myself. I always try to remember to work hard but also to not beat myself up about every little thing. I think it I was doing that, it would really has the potential to seriously deteriorate my mental health, so I try to not sweat the small stuff because at the end of the day I probably won’t be thinking about it next month, or next year, or 5 years time so I like to keep the balance. Balance is the thing that keeps me going, and it’s different for everyone. It’s different even for me 2 years ago because I was able to go out travel for 3 hours a day to go to school and back, now I have severe insomnia and I can’t imagine doing that. I do have the balance between school and off time because I picked classes that I know I can succeed in so it’s easier for me to handle school."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1671,"The values of my community and my family have helped me a lot in navigating through college. I come from an immigrant family, and they have supported me in college. My older brothers have helped me navigate the college campus and teach me how to apply for fafsa. My counselors and friends are the main people who encouraged and supported me throughout college. They are very important to me because I would not be who I am today. The EOP, TRIO-SSS, and METRO programs helped me a lot in college. They provide a bunch of free resources and workshops to help explore around the campus. Also, these workshops can help me find out what my interests are and realize who I am as a college student. I met many friends who come from a variety of backgrounds. They teached me how important it is to participate in clubs, take on leadership roles, and get good grades. I am grateful to have amazing friends who supported me throughout college. I am glad that I am surrounded by intelligent, kind, and humble friends."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1658,"At a young age my parents have always encouraged me to go to college. Although both of my parents did not have the opportunity to go to college, they know the value of education. They have always supported my educational career, by encouraging me to join programs that would benefit my learning or to discover new passions. They have taught me to advocate for myself and work hard on whatever I would like to achieve. I admire how hardworking my parents are and I try my best to do the same. So far through college I have advocated for myself when I need help on a subject by going to office hours. I take their advice of taking any opportunity that comes my way. This summer I  intern at a lab that focuses on computational biology. I did not have any experience in coding so I felt nervous about the internship. But I wanted to see what coding was about while learning about biology so I joined and learned the basics of coding."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1678,My community and family have instilled in me values of determination and perseverance. That I am worthy of college and deserve to be here even though much of my family has not had that opportunity.  Theyve also taught me that its okay to go at my own pace and create my own experience that suits my life - its okay that I didnt go straight to a 4 year program right out of highschool. Its okay that I went to community college.  Its ok that I stopped and started and went part time for a lot of it. Theyve taught me to draw from my well of resources when I need help - to not shy from the resources the school offers as well - my dad encouraged me to post up in the tutoring center all the time and thats the only thing that got me through math and chemistry. i was also encouraged to be real with my professors and disability advocates about what I need to succeed.  To communicate with my professors when Im having a hard time and let them in.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1683,"I think that one of the most important things in life and especially when growing up in college would be to keep your values and use them to succeed in school. What I mean by this is that if there are values that you were taught from a young age, you can continue to follow those values and share them with others to make connections.  In my family we were always taught to stay humble even if you are succeeding. It is consider rude to use your success to intimidate others or put them down, if you see someone struggling you don't stand there you go and help them out. This value plays a role in the way I participate in classes because if I see a classmate struggling I won't leave them behind I feel I need to help them catch up instead of not sharing my knowledge. Being first generation puts me in a position where I don't have a big support system which makes me really open minded for advice, options and comfortable asking for help when I need it. And one thing I have learned is that in college asking for help and having a open mindset is a great tool to help you succeed. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1672,"The values of my family have not always been something that I've necessarily noticed at all. I think that's the thing about values that you grow up with, they never really surface until you reflect or until you see something different. All throughout my life, my family and school have never really intertwined at all. In high school, my parents never really asked how I was doing and never told me to do my homework. They had always just assumed I was doing well because my grade at the end of the quarter had always been good, even if I had really struggled to get there. I would say that this has helped me in the long run, however. I'm a lot more confident in my work, since my family had never doubted me and my abilities. Most of the uneasiness about myself and my work mostly stems from myself, which is something I still need to work on. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1674,"As I carry my parent's values and morals with me throughout college, I have found that they have helped me in more was that I can count. My mom always taught me patience and that nothing in life is for free. This has encouraged a productive and persistent lifestyle. I practice working for what I want and what is needed to be done. That knowing everything I work towards will help me in the end. Everything is at a price whether that is money or effort. With this value, it has made me more conscious about my goals and how to achieve them. Her other value of patience has taught me to carry a level-headed mindset. That nothing is good rushed and that smaller steps are sometimes more important than big steps. As I got got older another value got instilled in me by her, well more like a saying. She said to me that what ever you do, as long as you are successful and you enjoy doing it. I will support you. This was huge coming from my mom, because in my culture our futures are usually set in stone. To hear that coming from my mom, meant everything to me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1667,In a way it has helped me because back from where I was from school is very important. And it is highly regarded by everyone because it meant you had money to pay for it even public schools. This has sort of give me a push to continue and pursue my college degree. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1668,"My brother prepared me well for college, especially, since he is older and was already in college by the time I was in high school. So, he helped me choose my classes in high school. Even if I didn't want to take them, I had to because he knew that they would help me in the long run. I think originally I thought it was very overwhelming in high school to take the classes I was taking but it prepared me well for college. Besides him, my friends helped me throughout college especially during the beginning and the application/admission process. It's helped a lot to have people around me who have gone through the college experience already (and recently too) and people who are going through it at the same stage as me right now. It helps with not feeling disappointed in yourself or regretful if you're behind or could have done something ""better"". It's made me learn that I have time. Since I am the one who is making my own schedule now, it felt like I should be planning everything efficiently. But I realized I have time and I shouldn't be putting so much pressure on myself."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1675,"I think the values that i have grown up with have been very important  throughout my time in college especially because those ideas keep me going half the time. I grew up believing that school is very important and that i should get the best grades i could to get to college. Now that I am in college i still try my best to get good grades in order to go into the career of my choice which requires more schooling. I was taught that this way i could live well enough and have “a better life” than my parents and grandparents did. Honestly, i do not care to have a “better life” as long as my family and I are happy and healthy but graduating school means a lot to them and i do what i can to make them happy without killing my sanity too. Either way knowing that school would help me and make my family proud I have always pushed myself to work hard like they have done to raise me and provide for me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1659,What my family has taught me while growing up has had a big impacted in my college career. My parents taught me the importance of bettering myself alway aim high with whatever I want to do with my life. They taught me to be a hardworking man with all my work and to give 100% of my effort no matter the situation. This has helped me a lot through college because I have my priorities clear. I know college comes first and then everything else. Of course nothing tops my mental health so I don't let things affect me too much. Honestly I would be a total different person if it wasn't for the support of my parents. I owe everything to them and I hope I can make them proud one day.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1664,"my community has some what helped me succeed in taking college classes. in the way that they support me and help me when i   need assistance on questions. in other ways my community has been unsuccessful in assisting me as many have not attended college which also means often they have a difficult time reassuring me. i    personally dislike college greatly. the education i  receive is not a scam but what is, is the unnecessary fees we must pay for said education, but thats beside the point.  overall my community, close friends and family assist when needed "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,678,"I'd say both my parents, but not the rest of my family. Both my parents came from childhoods without much education, and neither passed middle school level, though my mom got her GED in her 30's. Both want me to do my best with my education, and I am also the first in my family to go to college. My dad has been my backbone throughout college, he's just always been my safe place. He is the person I look up to the most and the person I aspire to be. They are now, divorced, and more opposites than cats and dogs, but they agree on how important education is, and I think that's what helps me navigate through college. I always grew up understanding how important knowledge was and how you could learn or do whatever you wanted. I may not have the best grades all the time.... but I always try my best in the moment, whatever my best that day is. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1676,"A lot of things have happened and were only found with my family. A while back ago I did not think they were super into the supporting aspect, but that is because the are always working and not always talking to me. But recently they have retired and the support has really helped. Through these past few months they have shown a lot of support for me and helped me through some tough times so I thank them for that. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1681,"My community has become smaller and smaller throughout quarantine and I have never really depended on my family so there are not a lot of influences navigating me through college. My roommates are grad students now and they influence me a decent amount but we do not often talk about college topics since they are law students and I am a physiology major. They do help me a lot with my professionalism and also helped me with my job search. My family doesn't direct me much since I rarely see or speak with them and most of the family members I do communicate with, have not gone to college so they do not have much to suggest. I could use more resources but I have been doing pretty decent working from home and studying at home. It does feel like cabin fever at times so I try to go for walks everyday. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1663,Coming into college as a first generation student things were definitely hard. My parents have no idea what is it like to go through college therefore during my first year of college I had to navigate alone. I had to find resources that were able to help me out which I am very grateful for. The values of my family are to be very independent and go after what you want. I am happy that these are the values I am surrounded by because if it weren't for them then who knows where I would have ended up. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1665,"I’m pretty sure I have learnt a lot of things from different people but one of the most important values I learnt from was my brother. I don’t why, maybe is just because I could relate to him more in some way. He never gave up, at anything he did and also tried to find different ways to get things done rather than complaining. He always tried to be the best at everything he did. I learnt a lot of other things from him. I didn’t learn them right away but as I experienced life more I realized his way of life. I believe he has helped me a lot to navigate through my troubles of being an immigrant. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1661,"My family has supported me very much throughout my college years. I had siblings older than me go to college, and from their experiences they helped me with mine. I am a Biology major, meaning I am taking many difficult courses and so their support means a lot to me. My parents has also supported me financially throughout my colleges which helped me focus on my studies a lot more. I think my family has done so much for me to get this far in my studies and as a college student it means a lot. Being a college student especially in  STEM majors is very differcult to keep up with, so support from the community and your own family means a lot."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1679,"The values of my community and family have underpinned my higher education goals, since I started freshman year in community college I have been granted access to financial aid and other resources for support. My family has also supported me with monetary assistance and moral encouragement which I find invaluable during difficult times. I have been able to reach out to advisors and faculty in order to stay on course for graduation and preparations for school beyond undergraduate work. I have found it incredibly challenging at times to keep up with the load work and remain efficient but slowly I have overcome these seemingly insuperable difficulties and excelled in my courses. If it were not for the opportunities granted and made available to me by my community and family I am unsure of where I would be today. I am thankful to be this fortunate, to have a caring family and a community that supports me indefinitely. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1657,"My familys a and community values have helped me navigate through college. My community has shown me how hard all the immigrants in my community have worked to come to the US to give their family and children a better future. This makes me take advantage of the educational opportunity I have. This has also helped me navigate through college especially when I  need help. They both have given me the strength and courage to continue my education, this is also a way for me to help my siblings and others as they start their college career and be a resource for them. Navigating through college has really helped me a lot. I have found a lot of helpful resources and a lot of helpful people, who are also very nice and helped me out a lot. To this day I still communicate with them and I even consider them as family and friends. "
