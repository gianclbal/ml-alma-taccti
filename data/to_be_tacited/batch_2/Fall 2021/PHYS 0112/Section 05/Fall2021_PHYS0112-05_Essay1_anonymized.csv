Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1655,I am here because I want to pursue a career in the medical field and become the best version of myself. Sometimes I feel like school isn't for me but I realized that there is nothing wrong with getting an education and you can't go wrong with learning! I am starting off one of the most important chapters of my life and I would. like to enjoy it as I will never be in this time again. My parents didn't go far into their education but I want to make them proud and perhaps teach others. I am very excited to be in the position that I am and take advantage of the education that we're given. I realized that I am privileged. Also my major is cell and molecular biology so this course was mandatory to take.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1656,"I am here in Physics because it is a prerequisite for my degree I am attempting to earn in Biology. So far it has felt so much more difficult than it seems to be with classes and selective pressures of the outside world. I was always intimidated by the name Physics itself and the possible content it contains. The idea of math problems incorporated into science also makes me worried while Im here. Even though I know Im in good hands with a helpful professor, I still feel weary of the future of the course. One hobby that Im into that has very close correlation to physics is cars. I love to work on them and  drive them as well which has many correlations with physics by dealing with gravity and velocity and drag which are all important when your trying to compete for races. Lastly I am here to also learn something that can be useful in my everyday life. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1657,"Why am I here? I am here because I need to take this course as a prerequisite for my major which is Kinesiology. It is also my first time taking a physics course. I tried to take it back in highschool but I was overwhelmed by my classmates because they seemed to know what they were doing in class, and I just felt lost most of the time. So I’m hoping this time around it’s a better experience. So far it is going well and I'm understanding most of the material, and the professors are also making it a better experience. I hope to learn a lot from this class because it will definitely be helpful towards my career. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1658,"Physics is a subject that I struggled a lot with during high school. I am taking it again since it is a prerequisite for my biology major. I am kind of nervous about taking physics as I mentioned it was challenging for me. But I am looking forward to trying again.  My goal is to have a  better comprehension of physics, so far both the lecture and lab are going well and I am in a sci class for physics to have more support. I am also trying new study methods that I did not have in high school that would help me succeed in physics. Each week my plan is to review what I learned in class, practice problems, and go to office hours. I am looking forward to learning more about how physics is involved in our daily lives. Also I would like to  learn how physics is related to biology. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1659,"Jose QuinteroPhysics 112, WReflective JournalThe main reason I am in this course is because I want to become a physical therapist and this class is required for my degree. This is my first time taking a physics class and I used to think they were scary but so far everything has been good. My professor and lab instructor seem really nice and of course passionate about what they are doing.This brings a sense of comfort knowing I have good people teaching me this course. I know doing well in physics will help me out a lot with my career and with my confidence as I move forward with my education. Overall I’m excited for what’s to come with this class and I know with hard work I can accomplish my goals. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1660,"I am here to fulfill my physics requirement in order to graduate with a degree in biology.  I want to go into research and I am hoping that this class will help me learn more about physics so I can connect it to what I want to do in my career.  I have always had an interest in physics because I love cars and I love learning how a performance car is using physics to push out ever ounce of performance.  I am really interested in physics topics like friction, aerodynamics, torque etc.  I would really like if I can apply what I learn in this class to understand more about motorsports.  I am planning on restoring an old car soon and I hope I can use what I learn in this class to my project car.  I want to do well in the class not just pass as I plan on using what I learn in the real world."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1661,"""Why am I here?"" I am here because Physics is a requirement to my Biology major. I am currently a Biology major with a concentration of Physiology. As a Biology major I am required to take many courses that can be applied towards my future. My requirements are taking as much STEM courses as possible. Physics will be needed in my future for when I enter the medical field. All fields of science such as biology, chemistry and physics is required in order for me to get into PA school. Physics is also quite interesting to see how it is needed and involved in many ways. This is also my first Physics class, so it will be interesting to see how I will apply all this information towards my major. I am interested to also see how physics can interfere with the real life world. Many things that happen in the world is because of  the science of physics. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1662,"In the context of this class, I am here to develop my critical thinking. I am here to try and see normal, everyday, things in a different and more scientific way. Before taking a class like this I gave things a little bit of thought, but now the understanding is starting to get much deeper. For instance, ice, water, and water vapor can exist at the same temperature. I have become more curious and interested in the world around me. I am hoping this class helps me to think about non scientific things in other ways as well. I am looking forward to taking more physics in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1663,"I am here because even though this is a required course for my major I am very interested in learning about physics at a college level. I took physics in highschool and I found myself enjoying the course. Although physics can be challenging at times I find pushing myself to excel very fun. Physics can teach you so much about how the world works as far as how it contributes to our surroundings and our daily lives. It’s exciting to view how even just us jumping up in the air is related to gravity. Physics can really expand one's knowledge on both mathematical views as well as scientific views. Overall, I am here because I want to be able to learn more while also enjoying my experience taking this class. In other words, I want to be able to love physics and reconnect with that feeling I had when taking this course in highschool."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1664,"Honestly im not quite sure why im here. I understand that the physics lab must coincide with the physics class but other than that im not sure. Why am I majoring in a degree that I know I  have no interest in whatsoever. Why am I  continuously stressing myself out on topics that don't peak my interest? Ill tell you why. Because society says I  need degree. No its not specified to the degree that I  choose but still what will I be, what will I be able to do for as a career if I don't have a degree? Most likely nothing because society says I need a degree to get paid more, to be considered measurable to others. Imagine that. Apiece of paper determines my worth. So I    guess that is why im here. To measure up to what society expects from me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1665,"I'm here because i need this course. It's a requirement needed to get my degree. I'm also interested in this class as well. I was never the brightest in physics but i figured out i didn't really under the concepts back then but now I feel like I can understand better and the more I read or listen to something that involves physics, my brain is intrigued and gets curious to find out how things actually work or what laws of nature govern them. I'm pretty sure I'm going to learn a lot from this class and perhaps help me understand things around me a little better. This class will be a challenge I will have to overcome in order to be better. I hope this class helps me think outside the box and come up with creative ideas to solve different problems I might face. I can't wait to see out this turns out to be."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1666,"I am here because I want to learn, mainly. Learning things is important to me. This class was needed for my major and even though I’m not 100% sure why I have to take physics for biology. But that’s okay. Like I get that’s it’s important to understand movement since livings things move. But I think taking the class itself can help me solidify that 100%. It’s important to learn new things everyday anyways, because knowledge is helpful for any sort of situation. You never know when you might need that random trivia fact you read in some book a long time ago. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1667,"This is my first time in a physics class and I sort of not liking it so far. But, I have to stay in this class because it is a requirement for my major. Even though I am not liking the class, I do believe it is an educational class. Educational, meaning it is a good thing to have this knowledge of how things come to from its detailed and specific equations. My major is Biology with concentration in Cell and Molecular, this requires the forces of physics in a way. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1668,"I am trying to complete my physics requirement... again. I took this class last semester and I had to withdraw because I had some things going on at home. I was/am angry that I did not just finish the class then because there were only about 4 weeks left. But I am going to take it in stride and try to better my understanding of physics because you can never know have to much knowledge. However, if you are asking why I am at SFSU, I originally only admitted here because this was the ""best"" school I was accepted to. But I am honestly really glad that I decided to come here even though I have not been on campus yet. I have met a lot of really different people and I have yet to have a professor that I do not like (knock on wood). It has also really helped guide me too because I feel like I am actually moving forward. I know what I am doing and I have a rough plan for the future, but I do not think I would have had that if I went to the community college I ""wanted"" to go to."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1669,"I often ask myself this question as to why I am here. It almost feels like a constant battle because I did not ask to be here, but I can't imagine what life would ever be like if I was not here. This almost ties into my identity as well, being a child of immigrants. I was always taught to give back to my family but I feel as if that is unfair. My parents brought me into this world, they shouldn't expect me to provide for them, especially when I can't. The guilt just lives on, I suppose. One day, hopefully, I will get over this. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1670,"I am taking this physics lab to complete my Kinesiology academic requirements. Even though I an in this class for that very reason I still believe physics plays a big role in everyday life. To me physics is understanding how things work and being able to problem solve. being able to problem solve is very important because we will all face problems in our life, they can be physical problems or mental problems and we will need to know how to solve them. I am not saying physics will help you through your break up or anything, but physics might help you be a better more understanding person. Physics also plays a role in my life because I am a personal trainer and I need to know how levers work and how weight can change based on the angle you press or pull. I hope I can learn a lot from this class and will be able to apply this information to my everyday life. "

2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1671,"Linh Mao September 1st, 2021 Reflective Journaling #1 Words: 181 The purpose of why I am here is to learn physics in general. I took a physics class in high school, but I never took one in college. This will be my first time learning physics in college, and therefore I am looking forward to applying some physics in my real life. I had a lot of fun during the physics lab in high school, so I hope to gain the same experiences in college. I am excited to learn new challenging problems that I will encounter throughout this class. I am also interested in learning the topic of Newton’s law of motion and gravitational. The first time learning physics in high school was confusing because of the math problem. However, it started to make sense as I kept doing practice problems. I hope I will have a better understanding of physics in this class, and learn something new. I am a third-year and major in Kinesiology with a concentration in Exercise and Movement Sciences. PHYS 111 laboratory is a required concentration course that is needed for the degree in Kinesiology."

2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1672,"I have never taken any sort of physics class before, nor do I really know what physics entails. I am not extremely great with theoretical science, which is why I have avoided taking it during high school. To be totally honest, seeing that physics was a required course for my major scared me a bit. When it comes to theoreticals, I tend to get frustrated and can't quite grasp it, but I try. And I intend to try for the rest of the semester. Looking over the course load, however, I do feel a little bit more confident in the future. I really hope to get something great out of this class, even if I do dread it even just a tiny bit. I'm excited to see how physics connects with the human body and how they work together, because I'm sure that they do connect in a lot of ways."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1673,"im here today to learn about physics and do the physics lab and hopefully fully form my understanding of physics as well as the topic of motion. im also here to graduate from college amd finally be able to live a life where i dictate ,y time once its over i will no longer be held down by the chains of bureaucratic pay to win education. but also physics is an interesting topic that is very applicable to life and living especially when attempting challenging diy projects. and lab are most often fun so i look forward to today and this class today. on Wednesday im in class from 7-3 so its a very tiring day for me personally and this lab is my last class so when i arrive i am low on energy but its all good we gotta do the work right?"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1674,"Why am I here? That is an excellent question that I continue to ask myself day in and out. I ask myself that question when ever I see others that are around my age and are where I want to be in life. But then I remember that we all have our own path and I am where I am supposed to be and that one day I will get where I want to be. Currently where I am supposed to be is at SFSU obtaining my BS degree. I am here to work hard and focus on school, but at the same time enjoy my life a little. It's important to not compare to others and where they are because it will only trip you on your own path while you are trying to get where you want to be. It is a mental challenge, a necessary one. I am here because it is the next stop in my journey into hopefully becoming a nurse someday. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,678,"Well, to start, I'm here taking a physics class mostly for degree requirements, but not just that. I'm typically bad at math in general, and past physics teachers did not work well with my learning style, so I've had a bit of a negative bias towards physics. I was the same way with biology/science until i had a great AP bio teacher who helped made something click with me. I'm hoping that now, since I have also refined my study habits and the way I approach my schoolwork, I might be able to understand better and maybe even like it. There's also some content overlapping I have noticed between my other classes, so that's comforting. I also hope to retain (at least some...) knowledge and use it in the future either in my bio major or everyday life. I do remember that in the past, I was a lot more inclined to do work/study when I was getting the answers rights (who doesn't love being right...), as well as when my friends and I were working together and we all would just help the pieces fall into place for each other. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1675,"I’m in this class in order to complete unit and class requirements towards my degree and graduation. I’m a transfer student who is just starting and I need to take this class along with physics lecture. This class will help me learn more of physics content that I’m also connecting to my lecture class. It’s the second week of class so it’ll be officially starting and i must attend in order to complete the assignments. This class is part of the lower division classes I must complete to get a step closer to my future career and degree so I hope to get through it with a good grade and learn a lot from it. I think learning more about physics will help in my degree of zoology because there is many animals who, of course, use physics without even realizing it in order to just live so learning about it and later applying it or just realize how physics is being used will be interesting"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1676,"In all honesty, I didn't not think I would be enjoying this class that I am right now. Originally this class is just something I need to take for major so I can graduate, but I have been enjoying learning this subject. The things I am enjoying about this subject is probably how everything is connected to real world circumstances, and you can really visualize what it would look like and how it would work. My least favorite thing about this class is all the math that is included, though it is the class, I hate math. I really wish that this class was in person though, because I always see videos of the physics professor doing cool, almost impossible things with the power of physics. Furthermore I think I am in this class now because I am very interested in what we will be learning for the future to come."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1677,"I am in this class because it is a prerequisite for my major. I do not know why I chose to do it this late in my college career. I suppose I thought it would be a challenge for me that I wasn’t ready for even though I did well in Physics in high school. I like physics and I did my senior project on physics in high school but I feel intimidated that it is a college level class. I hope that because of my past knowledge it won’t be too difficult for me, although it was a while ago that I learned it. If I did not mess up my schedule I would probably put it off for even longer because I would have liked to take a biology class this semester. It is good that I am here in this class though because I wouldn’t want it to keep holding be back."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1678,"Why am I in this class,, It is a necessary requirement of my degree, but additionally I do think its important to understand physics, have a greater perspective of our position in space, etc.  I think physics can be incredibly humbling, thinking about how small we are in the universe, what exists beyond us, what forces act upon us, etc.  I imagine pursuing the more astrological sides of physics can become quite spiritual in that sense.  Im a marine biology major so the physics of the ocean are very important - it is such a strong force of nature, acting in synch with the moon, our atmosphere, the tectonic plates beneath us, the currents, etc. all things dictated by the laws of physics :)"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1679,"I am here because I need to fulfill my lower division GE courses to graduate with a B.A. in Biology. That is the most important reason as to why I am here but there are other influences that will underpin my learning throughout the semester. I view this class as an opportunity to gain invaluable knowledge and insight into the fundamental disciplines of physics. I look forward to understanding more about the properties of energy and force and how to apply them with the interactions of matter through space and time. I am excited to develop new skills and acquire tools that I can later use in the field. I plan on making every lab so that I can apply what I’ve learned in lecture and interact with classmates and the professor to address any concerns or issues. My purpose is to get a good grade, not a passing grade, for lecture and lab. For this, I will have to commit my time and effort and persevere through the challenges of learning new material, including the unexpected difficulties that may arise in any given semester.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1680,"I am here because this class is a requirement as a biology major. Plus I have always been curious about physics. Even though I know I would do better in class, I had to take this class online as I have a commute of an hour n a half. So well I was not going to drive that far either. Overall I hope to gain a good amount of knowledge from this class "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1681,"I am here to push and educate myself. I am on the path to enter the medical field after I graduate and there is no limit to how far I can go after that. I have always loved biology over other subjects and want to take part in the medical world to make a difference, bring aid to those in need, and also make the world a better place in general. I am currently a clinical operations specialist and am planning to become an MRI technician. I have worked hard to reach this point in life and I know my efforts will pay off down the road. I will be able to work in a field where I feel I belong and is very interesting to me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1682,"The reason I am here is because I am a Biology major with a concentration in Zoology. I attended my local junior college for a few years with poor advising, so I missed out on a lot of core STEM courses. But I am excited to learn and face the challenges of physics. I did not do well in high school physics but there was a lot going on at home. I think it is interesting how Physics ties in to other fields of science. Especially meteorology or learning the patterns of the waves. This is very important for safety reasons and expanding society. A lot of my friends are physics majors, one is working through is Masters at Long Beach State right now. So it would be nice to talk ideas and concepts. Plus, I am a big Rocket League nerd. The math and equations are intimidating sometimes but I believe I have the patience to have a great experience this semester."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1683,"""Why am I here?"" I am here because of two main reasons honestly. I'm in this class to get the credits and be able to take higher science courses that are needed for my major. I want to be able to get the credit to be exposed to other physics and especially biology. I feel intimidated by chemistry and physics so I defiantly struggle but I defiantly think this will help me be more comfortable with science. Another reason why I am here is because I want to learn about Physics, I have never taken a higher education courses other then biology so I am wondering how I will feel about others types of science and if it will play a big role in my major. I am excited to learn different things and meet new people and feel more included in the science field community. I am also excited to see how I will feel about physics."
