2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1665,"I feel like I have many people to support me but my constant support system I'll say is my mom and besides her my bestfriend who i have know for 5 years now. I feel like I lack support though in many instances. When trying something new can be hard sometimes due to lack of support from the people you think were going to support you all the way through. I learnt that sometimes to be better person or to be better at something you will have to do it alone because not everyone will understand what you're trying to do or won't understand my drive or mindset. I became my own support system. I had to train my brain to be more positive towards even and push myself to be better at everything I do. So, ill say as i grew up I became my best support system besides my mom and my bestfriend."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1678,"Both in school and in life I have many resources if I am willing to utilize them! The internet is perhaps my most used resource, counseling and advising at school, the counsel and advice of my friends and family, the resources of my community (online community, and in person) my fellow classmates - discord groups have been very helpful for this! I also often utilize the resources available to me from the government i.e FAFSA, food stamps, medi-cal etc.  I am also new to navigating the world of resources available via things like grants and artist residencies. I also have my personal and internal resources - which are replenished and nourished by nature, love, art, etc :-)"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1664,what resources do i    have to support me? is this meant o be a life question or a physics question? Ill take a life approach to it. my support comes from my friends and family. without them i    would have a near impossible time getting through the hardships of life. so with that my support comes from those whom i    love and love me in return. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1677,The resources I have to support me in this class are tutors from sfsu and friends and family I can ask for help from. I can also look up information on the internet or in a textbook. I can ask professors if I need further explanation or I can ask my classmates. I am on a discord server where we help each other out so it’s easy for me to go on there and ask a question at any time of the day. I feel like I don’t think I need too many resources for this class because I don’t find myself struggling that much. Usually I just look things up on google if I don’t understand them and I can find the answer in the first link whether it be a video or an article. I think that this way is the easiest for me out of all of the resources I did mention earlier.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1683,"Some resources that I have would be tutoring and advising on campus. There are many places and people to go to if I am struggling in this class or any class and are willing to help me understand material and do well in all my classes. Having office hours with professor is also another resource that I have to support me and my leaning because it offers a free space to be transparent with my professor and let them know what I am struggling or how they can support me in my class for my learning, EOP advising is offered as well which can serve as guide when it comes to choosing classes or scheduling as well and an emotional support in school. Overall I definite know that there are multiple resource and people to go to on campus that can guide me and support my education and my struggles in school."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1672,"The people I surround myself have been my support system for as long as I can remember. I don't really feel comfortable relying on those who are related to me, but my sister has definitely been there for me and would be the one who is more likely to understand what I'm going through. I've also been relying on my therapist for the last year and a half, but its better not to be codependent on them. I've recently ended services with my therapist (which is a good thing), but I find myself still relying on the knowledge I gained from it so I think it still counts as a support system. Also, I feel well supported by SFSU as well. Some of the college experiences I've heard from friends have been terrible and leave some of them feeling confused and alone, especially on a campus where they don't know anyone. For the most part, SFSU does a good job in making resources and help accessible to their students. In almost every single class I've been in, a separate class has been offered specifically to help the students in that class. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1668,"I have my brother to motivate me in pretty much everything, however, he is not really that encouraging nor does he give great advice, but I know that he is there. Every time I start to do something different in my life I know he will be there to see it through with me. I think the fact that there is someone who will be happy when I accomplish something and someone who will be disappointed/sad when I fail is kind of nice. I usually rely on my friends when I need some advice on something. My parents support me financially, which is obviously a big help, and it makes me want to work harder because I have people ""waiting"" for me to be something. Sometimes it feels like pressure, but I know if they were not there than I would not have the motivation to do anything, even if it was beneficial to me. Everyone needs a little validation to help them feel like what they are doing is meaningful."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1679,"I have access to a few resources with financial aid being the most influential in supporting my continuation in school. They have cut the cost to otherwise costly tuition and this has allowed me to focus on more important aspects of school and life. Financial support during the pandemic became critically necessary if I were to continue my studies, I was fortunate enough to receive monetary assistance during a difficult time. I have been able to focus solely on my studies without worrying about the costs as often which has enabled me to succeed so far in my collegiate experience. This semester I have been fortunate enough to have professors who are willing to provide office hours and opportunities for students to meet and discuss material related to the course. This type of support has allowed me to gain a greater understanding of challenging topics. Other outside resources that I have used entail online courses, videos, and readings that follow different approaches to similar concepts."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1670,"The resources I have that support me are my friends, family, and my computer and Ipad. My friends and family always support me and give me a place to stay where I can do my classwork. I have really nice people around me all the time that helps me a lot. I am very grateful for them without them I would struggle a lot more in these classes. My other resources re my electronics. My electronics allow me to do my classwork where ever I am as long as I have them with me with connection. Both of my electronic devices were given to me as a gift my family and friends so I am grateful for my family and friends once again. Most of my teachers offer office hours so if I ever get stuck on a problem I can go to office hours and ask for help. In whole I have a ton of useful resources to help me achieve all of my. goals in the classroom and outside the classroom. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1667,"I believe the resources I have to support my well-being would be from school, friends, and working for doordash. For my school homework helpful would be from my peers through discord."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1684,"I have many resources to support me. First and foremost, and on a personal level, I have my best friends and family. I can talk to them about anything and they are always supportive. They know how to help me decompress if I’m stressed and they encourage me to keep working hard. Another resource I can use is my peers. I have a discord chat for most of my classes where students collaborate ideas and ask questions, which has been extremely helpful. Professors are another great source. Being able to watch the recorded lectures over again can help clear up any confusion if I forget something. Additionally, office hours can be great if I am confused or need some clarification on something. Other outside resources come from the internet. YouTube is great to watch videos that explain complex topics that I may be confused on. I can also find extra worksheets if I feel like I need more practice.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1655,"The resources that I have to support me in general are my family, especially my mom. She is very supportive of me and always offers to help me any way she can; she knows when I get overwhelmed so she does check ins with me to see what I need from her or any ways she can be there for me. My friends are extremely resourceful and are always offering their help to me. They remind me to turn in assignments and offer to take us to coffee shops to do homework. I know that my teachers are also willing to help me, along with the advisors and students in metro."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1658,"Sci classes have supported me through some of my classes. Physics is not my greatest strength, I struggled with it in high school so I decided it would be best to enroll in a sci physics class. This class has helped me reinforce what I have learned by doing worksheets. We get to work as a team with people on the worksheets or as a whole class. While working as a group we get to ask questions to each other if we need clarification in anything. Also we do kahoots to review for  tests, I find this helpful since I see what parts I need to practice more on. Then you can try again on your own the kahoot and see your progress or what  you still need to practice on. When I do not understand something I like looking at youtube videos or khan academy. I also have office hours, to go ask the questions that I have."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1676,"Some resoruces that I have to support me is definetly other people in my classes. They can help i every way because they could be having the same hardships. If that werent the case I would have my professor that is the number one thing that I rely on because he/she is the one assigning the work. In my opinion though, it is better to not directly go to the professor if you have a question because it would be better to use your friends or other classmates first to see how they learned it to show you how they have memorized it. Then if you cant understand it then it would be best to ask the professor so he/she can do a sit down and you can learn better from it then watching a slide show."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1674,"As for people that I have to support me, I have my sisters, my mom, my cousins, some friends and my girlfriend. My sisters are always there to help me with school. Whether it is a tough homework question or I just need help understanding something a little more. They are always there to help just like how I am there to help them. My mom supports me by just wanting what's best for me, all though from time to time she says I need to do this or that. At the end of the day she just wants me to do what I want to do. I mention this because I grew up in a Filipino household and our culture is very different from the rest. Now my cousins come in to play, knowing how our culture is they tell me to follow my own path and that they are there to support me. And understand what I have and are going through. My girlfriend, is very supportive and is always offering to help me and guide me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1669,"The resources I have to support me include my close friends and family, and the internet. You can find almost anything on the internet to support yourself, and having a cheerleading team besides you helps as well. Recently I have been refraining from reaching out to school faculty because some of them are not too helpful, or I have not gotten a response at all, but that is okay. Sometimes I feel like I do not have the support I need because it is difficult working and going to school at the same time, but I can't sacrifice one or the other and I can't expect my instructors to adjust their curriculum for me. My grades probably do not reflect my potential."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1663,"I have quite a few resources that support me both academically and emotionally. For example, when it comes to my school work I have resources such as office hours, tutoring, or even asking a classmate/friend for help. I think these resources are very crucial to my success and understanding because without them I would just be lost and confused majority of the time. As far as emotionally goes, whenever I am overwhelmed by the amount of coursework I have, exams, work, etc I always have my emotional support cat to calm any stress or anxiety I am having as well as my boyfriend and friends who are always there for me which is nice. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1666,"I think I have my friends and family to thank for supporting me every step of the way, like any other person. I couldn’t imagine what it would be like without them. I can only hope I’m supporting them every step of the way as well. My teachers and classmates exist as well, they’re always helpful. I’m glad they’re friendly and helpful. Grouchy people or professors are always a pain in the butt. I'd hate to ask a question and get no answers from it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,678,"I think that's something I know, but keep trying to remind myself to use actually. For one, I have my professors/instructors and their office hours available to me. I haven't been to many office hours this semester and I really should. I also have my peers, and study groups/group chats where I can go with questions or to just work with people which makes it easier to understand. It's a bit hard for me though to connect with my peers through online classes, so in that aspect I'm kind of looking forward to taking in person classes at some point.  There are also tutoring resources available to to me through sf state, with tasc being one of them. I have also taken advantage of the SCI classes sf state offers, taking sci bio, sci chem, and a sci intro to healthcare this semester to help me make a more informed decision about what field I might want to go into. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1657,"Some of the resources I have that support me are those like SOARR, EOP or 10,000 degrees. These resources have been helping for the past few years, not only do they help academically but emotionally and mentally. Some of the things that 10,000 degrees has tutors that can help in any subject or people that you can confidently talk to if you need something or they are going through something. What I like about these resources is that they are always checking up on you to see how you are doing and if you need anything. Another resource I have that supports me is my family. They have really supported me in any decision as long as it is towards the right path. I'm really glad to have all these resources because life can get really hard sometimes and having these is very helpful and you do not feel alone. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1680,"As bland as it sounds, I would say google and youtube. I know that the teachers and TA's are resources as well, but I'm a visual learner and have to sometimes re-watch or see it all be done before I understand it. It's a weird way of learning, but we all learn at different styles and this just works for me. Every so often I use chegg as well, but that's more of making sure I am doing the steps correctly, using it more as a reference."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1659,"Some of my resources for support are my family. Especially my mom, she is the one that reminds me daily I have all her support and love with whatever I want to do with my life. Also my girlfriend plays a huge role in my support system. She is always pushing me to do my best and is always telling me that she believes in me. They both fuel me with motivation which helps me to get up in the morning and to try my best with whatever is in front of me. And even when days don’t go as planned, I just take things one day at a time. Lastly, my school offers a lot of resources to make sure I get all the help I need whenever I need it. I also feel comfortable in this lab. Edward is a professional guy that is always trying to help at any time during the course. I’m sure I can stop by during office hours and just talk physics or anything. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1661,"While taking physics online can limit your resources, I find one of my biggest support of resource to be the physics lecture and discords. The physics lecture has really helped me for this class because not only are we learning similar topics we are also learning problems that are connected to the labs in this class. I find that really helpful because then I can go back to the videos and reteach myself again. I find the discord to help me the most because we are online it is hard to share ideas and ask questions from others. The discord makes it easier for us to connect and communicate together."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1671,"The EOP, TRIO-SSS, and METRO programs are the resources that have supported me throughout college. My advisors and counselors helped me with picking classes for each semester. They are my guidance and supporters. If it weren’t for them, then I have no idea what prerequisite classes to take to fulfill my lower and upper division courses. I am thankful to be in these three programs here at SF State. My friends supported me along the way. They explained to me the importance of joining clubs, gaining leadership, and getting good grades. I am glad that I have someone to look for and talk to. If it weren’t for them, then I would be a depressed and lonely person. I am grateful to have amazing friends who supported me throughout college. There are also resources on campus available for me. They provide a bunch of free resources and workshops to help explore around the campus. They have free printers, scantrons, and notebooks. Their workshops can help me find out what my interests are and realize who I am as a college student."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1675,"my resources are my boyfriend and the internet. My boyfriend supports me in everything i do, especially school. He will always take the time to help me with my homework in any way he can even though he’s never taken STEM classes and he also likes to do “study sessions” when we hang out which we just do homework together so we don’t fall behind for in classes. I also rely on the internet when i don’t understand something. I look for example and practice problems or articles that’ll give me extra info to do my homework. I also get some help from study groups on discord and another app similar, students always talk about problems they’re struggling with and everyone helps each other out when they can. In those groups people also remind each other of due dates and things like that which is helpful since things can get busy. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1682,"I feel very grateful for the support system I have. At home I live my with my partner and our friend, both of whom are very experienced and helpful when I need to come back down to Earth. I often get overwhelmed and that can cause me to shut down all operations. My home support system is very understanding and I am lucky to know and trust the people I live with. At our last place, we had room mates that were complete strangers for the entire 6 months we lived there, so it felt like a burden when airing out emotions. I am also grateful to be able to talk to my mom back home. She has her bachelor's degree and is teaching kindergartners after working with children for many years. Since she has been through college and university, I feel she offers great insight when things start to build up. Additionally, the resources provided by SFSU are immeasurably better than those at my previous junior college. The only good thing to come out of quarantine has been the increase of online accessibility. "
