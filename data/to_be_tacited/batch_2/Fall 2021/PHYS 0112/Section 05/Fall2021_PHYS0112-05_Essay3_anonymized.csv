2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1661,"Being a college student, especially a biology major can make life really challenging at times. There was a point in my life where I honestly didn't know to how get relieved from all of these challenging and stressful events in my life. I found many ways to cope with stressful events. One way, which is releasing all of that stress while exercising and working out. I find this to be really helping because working out helps me relieve my stress. Even things such as hanging out with friends and family or taking a walk in nature really helps me tame my mind. Doing all of these things help me a lot when my life gets challenging which is quite often. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1668,"When I get stressed out, I like to map out what I have to do. It gives me the certainty I need to motivate me to move further. I like to keep a calendar or a to-do list of general things I have to do, even if it's for something small like washing my clothes. In highschool, I had a teacher who had us write down some New Year's resolutions. He told us to write down some stuff like ""brush your teeth everyday"" and normal things that we knew we could do. Then, when we look at our resolutions the next year, we would feel like we accomplished something even it was small and it would help motivate you. That's why when things get hard, I write down what have to do so I have something to start with. It pretty much grounds me enough to pull myself together and get back to work."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1658,"This past year and months with the pandemic having virtual classes was kind of challenging. Being in front of your screen for hours was tiring, so on my breaks I would go take a walk to a nearby park to get some fresh air and clear my mind to begin my next class. I had a chem lab online, it was a challenging class. But joining sci chem class  and watching youtube videos to have better understanding helped. The sci classes have helped me, so I have done the same with physics. I joined sci class to help to receive more support and practice. From my past semesters online I have learned what works best for me to manage online classes. I am still learning how to manage my time. Having classes online can be less motivating, but what keeps me going was the reason why I am in college in the first place. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1678,"When life gets challenging I try to take inventory of my resources and identify who the helpers are. I also usually make a detailed list to organize what I can do and what I need to do, this helps me to manage my energy and time and tackle the challenge in doable increments. I try to remind myself that Im never alone in any challenge and theres always someone with insight or experience that I can look to for reference. If something absolutely feels impossible in that moment I trust that at a later time when im more rested, fed and resourced that it wont feel as impossible. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1669,"When things in life get challenging I tend to think about the situation from many different angles to see which would be the best fitting within the scenario. Sometimes I get very upset and pick off my lash extensions which is not good, but it happens. A lot in my life has been difficult and challenging but I have to keep telling myself to just think about today and worry about the rest as the days follow. It allows to keep my anxiety at ease. I am hoping things ease up soon, and each day is better than before."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1682,"When life gets challenging sometimes I feel myself become a little overwhelmed. I start to have thoughts that overlap or are about things too far ahead in the future. Lately things hav ebeen a little easier for me though. I dont jump to frustration or feeling like things are too much. I try to take problems step by step and reach conclusions calmly. This isnt always easy for me but seeing my coworkers overcome with stress and make situations harder for those involved. At my job we deal with a lot of older customers and people who are not fluent english speakers. In these situations, I try to put myself in the shoes of the customer. I would never come back to a store if they were rude or treating me as a problem. Trying to separate yourself from a situation to face a challenge with an objective view point can sometimes be exhausting though. I prefer to actively assess an issue and take steps to move through it in a smooth motion. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1677,When life gets challenging I guess there are resources provided by the school but I would not use them unless it was to do directly with school. I think what is most challenging in my life can't be solved with a 30 minute talk with CAPS. I don't really have a healthy way of dealing with life when it gets challenging. I have a friend I can talk to but when it gets too hard I don't want to talk to anyone and I just bottle up all my feelings which makes things worse. I would say maybe this one show helps me to forget about what challenges me. I feel like this is the only thing that brings me happiness but people in my life shut me down when I talk about it so that makes me feel ashamed and discouraged. I don't know what motivates me. I guess I feel like I don't have a choice but to move along because I won't stop being challenged unless I get over what challenges me. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1679,"Some days I like to think about the future whenever I am going through a rough patch in life. Times can be challenging but things are always changing and though the circumstances may seem insuperable at the moment they can always change with a little bit of effort. If the challenge is great then I can take it as a learning experience to develop and learn from whatever it is that preoccupies my mind. Other times I take it day by day if it is out of my control and if the responsible thing to do is wait and relax. I am lucky to have a caring and loving family who supports me unconditionally, for the most part I tend to seek them out for advice and moral support. Talking it out with friends and family is the best tool I have for overcoming challenges that bring me to a low ebb."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1655,"When life gets challenging, I try to give myself some down-time to assess my situation and think about how I can plan things out and not stress myself over unnecessary things. I also seek support from my teachers and peers if I need help with certain things. Additionally, I try to do things that make happy like painting, going out with my friends to help me take my mind of things and relax."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1681,"I make sure to study more, take time to relax and do research on topics I am not confident in. I work from home as well so I make sure I organize my time and work efficiently. If I have any questions I do not understand, I reach out to my professor for clarification. Making sure I eat and sleep enough really helps me maintain my energy for each day and meditation and journaling help me relax. Working out in the morning and regular cardio has made a big difference for me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1657,"When life gets challenging I just try to remember everything that I have accomplished so far. This reminds me that if I have done all that I can do much more. I also think about my younger siblings since I’m the oldest one, they are always looking up at what I do and in a way have me as a role model.  Thinking about all of this helps me keep going and not give up because life can get really hard sometimes and there are times you have no clue what to do. There are also a lot of sources on campus that can help you with your personal life or academically. I have been to a couple and can say that they are very helpful and are always checking up on you to see if you are doing good, how you are doing, and if you need anything. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1670,"When life gets challenging I try to relax, take a step back, look at my options, and continue. Life gets challenging for everyone and you just have to keep pushing through. I like to view these challenges that we face as opportunities to get better since we are faced with diversity. We as people can only get better when things go wrong. This is because there is no good without bad. If we just sit down and quit when things get hard or challenging we will go nowhere in life, it is about how you respond to adversary in life. If you view it as an opportunity to better yourself then you will get better, if you view it as an excuse to stop and quit you will always be sad and you will never make any progress in life. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1675,"When life gets challenging i always try to take a step back and look at the things that I can manage first. I usually try to schedule my stuff the best I can so I don’t get overwhelmed. I have a planner for school stuff, so I write each assignment when it’s due and check it off when done. This also includes appointments and trips. While I don’t write it down, I also plan stuff to be done at home during certain parts of the day or when I know I’ll have a time slot. When stuff gets hard I also watch tv or stress clean or stress eat or both so that I feel like I have order and can breathe to keep going with my day. I also try to do yoga or workout to not only stay physically healthy but also mentally. Most of the time these things help but more than anything being with my bf helps the most because he’s someone who understands me and can help me manage what I feel or what I need to do and makes me feel safe and with my day in order.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1659,"I do many things to keep me going when life gets difficult. One of them is I exercise. I've been working out consistently for about 3 years now. I do some weightlifting 4 times a week. This helps me a lot with my mental health, especially when I have rough days. If I can end my day with a workout then my day was great. Another thing that I do is that I tend to watch some of my comfort shows before bed. I love watching the Simpsons, everybody hates Chris and Brooklyn 99. These are some of my favorite shows that bring me some kind of comfort and make me feel better after a difficult day. The last thing I do is watching sports. My favorite sport is basketball. I love watching the warriors play but any game gets the serotonin going in my brain. When life gets challenging I prioritize my mental health so I try to not worry too much about things I can control. What brings the most stress to my life is school, so when I get a lower grade than expected I don't really worry too much. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1671,"When life gets challenging, I usually get support from my friends and counselors. My friends and peers are the biggest support. When I talk to a friend about anything that is challenging in my life, I feel better mentally and emotionally. I do not feel depressed anymore because I have someone to talk to. My best friends are the number one I count on first. Then, I reached out to my counselors and advisor. I am in the EOP and TRIO programs, so they really helped me throughout college. I am a first-generation immigrant college student, and they understand my struggles at SF State. They provided many free resources and workshops to help make me feel more confident here. If I am not in these programs, then I am not where I am today. I am able to successfully complete all of my lower division classes. Now, I am working on my upper division classes for my Kinesiology major. My classmates are also the biggest help because they are always willing to help with homework if I am struggling in the class. If life gets challenging, then I sometimes walk on the beach alone and reflect about my struggles. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1674,"When life gets challenging, I tend to overthink first. Think my world is going to end. Then I get a grip of myself, tell myself that it's going to be ok and that I will get through this. I try to stay optimistic whenever things seem grim, so I guess when life gets hard I remain optimistic. I remind myself how far I have come and that it is only hard now, someday it won't be. I just got to get through this part in life. I try to take my ming off things. So either go play video games for a little, I go play basketball or workout at the gym. Basketball is one of my passions in life so turning to that always help deal with when life gets hard. Another thing I enjoy doing is hanging with my girlfriend. She helps me get through the rough times and helps me take my mind off things by going out and getting food or watching the sunset. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1680,"Just leave the area. Got to go clear my head, weather it's going for a walk or just simply staring at a wall watching paint dry. Just anything to relax my mind and stop thinking of the situation. Another way is definitely going to the gym, just putting music on full blast, ignoring the outside world and just destroy my body."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1684,"When life gets challenging, I think the first thing I like to do is decompress, whatever that means in the moment. Sometimes sitting on social media, taking my dog for a walk, reading my book, watching a show/movie, drawing, hanging out with a friend… Whatever I am feeling in the moment. After a while, I like to gather my thoughts and write out everything that I need to accomplish on paper so I can really visualize everything that I need to get done. I then prioritize how soon I should work on each thing/how long I should expect it to take me, etc. Then I begin my tasks, see how I can break them down into smaller steps so it’s not too overwhelming. If I’m still really stressed out or an emotionally challenging situation arises, I’ll call my mom or a close friend to get a different perspective on the situation which can help me take a breather and calm down, and then repeat the process. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1664,"What to do when life gets challenging. A question I think about constantly as a college student with all the overwhelming parts of assignments, social life, and maintaining a healthy mental health. What do I do when life is getting me down, I take time for myself. This looks very different day to day as some days consist of me laying in bed and watching a good show or movie, spending time with my family or even as easy as ""🌬🍃"". My day to day looks different but what ever I can do to silences the pressures and challenges of life, is what keeps my sanity alive and my mental health in check. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1663,"When life gets challenging I tend to take a step back and write down everything that I believe is a hardship going on through my life right now. After I see what I find difficult in my life I see what my options are and how I can combat them. For instance, if I am struggling with an assignment I would go to office hours and speak with someone in order to get a better understanding. Things like this really help out when I am not doing well and it's also really good when I write my challenges down because it gives me the sense that I have a grip on things "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1673,what do i do when life gets challenging? well it truly depends on the challenge if its the challenge of aiding my mother through her cancer diagnosis treatments and recovery i respond by simply doing and ever thinking but if it the challenge of my sister feeling insecure and not beautiful than again its all action. but when i need to get a job ive been wanting for some time and its pretty fancy i have to reduce my actions and focus on my brain and split second decision making and attitude these things make life fun truly and i hope others appreciate it as much as i do im sure they dont and neither do i most the time but yeah im human. but mostly when life gets challenging i do whatever is necessary to make the situation right again whatever that means for the situation whether its praise honesty gifts or neglect some times i feel like im too human. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1676,"I totally missed this assignment I am so sorry.But none the less, I have an example to explain! Just recently things have been getting challenging. Just recently I quit my job to continue my schooling at SFSU. At first things were going well, but as time went on I started to go back to what I was doing in high school. Homework started to get pushed down to later in the week vs a week or days before, classes I just day dream because I get lost, and everything just doesn't feel like it is important. But now, I am, as it worked in the past, I need to motivate myself to get back up and get back to work and find the confidence in myself like I once did and fight for the career that I want. This will require myself to be 100% and that might take a toll and take some time getting used to it, but im sure it will be worth it in the end."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1667,"When life gets challenging I usually go for a run or either go out to eat. With working out I get this adrenaline rush and I tend to forget what my problem was for a bit. But, later on I start thinking about ways to solve it or think of things to make it easier. I also tend to write on my journal when things get too embedded in me to the point of where I have no one to ask for help from. So, I write it out instead. I also tend to look back and read what I had wrote so far and think how I was able to overcome this. And this new challenge I am facing should be easy or even think that I am able to get out of this eventually. "
