2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1677,"My goal is to become a scientist. This class will help me to become a scientist because it goes towards my biology degree as well as the fact that I will gain more knowledge about science. I would like to lean more about physics because it is a subject that I have always been interested in but I do struggle with some of the concepts. Understanding these concepts will make it easier for me in the future when I do have to take more physics classes and understand the world around me. One topic that interested me in physics was multiverse theory because it is fun to think about how there could be multiple universes and how the Big Bang wasn’t the only one. One concept I learned, from a experiment, was that light could be a wave or particles but you can’t know until you observe it, like Schroeder’s cat."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1684,"My goals are to complete my college education as a double major in business and biology. I am hoping to either combine those degrees to become an environmental consultant for large companies to help reduce carbon emissions, or something related to the science fields to help combat climate change. This class will first, help me achieve my biology degree. And secondly, hopefully, will help me gain reasoning and logic skills. This class requires a lot of critical thinking and I want to be able to practice and master those skills. I believe those skills with help me be able to work through future problems - whether in class, a job, or personal life. I also hope that this class will help me connect with some of my other peers, as we will probably have future classes together and it can be hard to meet people and make friends during this pandemic. I work and learn better when I am able to collaborate with people, so I hope more people will be willing to speak up and have discussions in the breakout rooms."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1675,My goals are to pass all my classes with really good grades and complete my requirements to graduate. I think this class will really help me because it will help me learn more about physics. This class is a little ahead of my lecture class but that has actually helped more than I thought because I use the content that I learned in this class and add it to lecture so when we do problems I already know a bit more of what I’m doing. The lab reinforces all the topics I learn in lecture and helps me put the stuff I learn into an actually problem while also getting help from others. I’m not very social so the breakout rooms can be weird plus I can’t really talk as I have a loud household but I always communicate in the chat. This class will also help me achieve my goal because it is one of the requirements that I need for my major. I would like to graduate as soon as I can and taking this class for my first semester will I think help. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1664,my goal for this class it to better understand physics. That subject is most defiantly not easy so anything   can do to further my education and make me a better physics student or student in general is my goal. This class has been very helpful in achieving this goal. my lecture class is not as easy as I  would hope but the lab portion is a nice refresher to the possibilities of learning physics. My ultimate goals are to graduate with a timely fashion and finish my degree. though my degree has nothing to do with what i want to do as a career. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1657,"My goals are to graduate next year in spring and continue with my career of becoming a Pediatric Physical Therapist or continue with my goal of becoming a labor and delivery nurse. This class is helping me complete my prerequisites for my major and helping me graduate on time for next year. This class is also helping me extend my knowledge because I had never taken a physics class before, well I tried back in highschool but did not continue that so this time I had no choice and continued with the challenge. However it is going pretty well, I do have to say that the lab is a lot easier than the actual lecture which was surprising to me because I thought it would be the other way around. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1681,"This class expands my understanding of concepts that apply to everything. Physics occurs at a molecular level also so I am sure I will use it while studying health and biology related classes. I know I will apply it to my career as well, my ultimate goal is to become an MRI technician at the moment and there is a lot of physics behind medical-tech as well. I enjoy understanding how systems work and that is a reason I like cars as well. Knowing more about physics provides better explanations and can be used in the future while diagnosing someone. Physics can explain so many things and help with research and study. It is an important tool for any scientist to have a concrete understanding of (the basics at least)."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1670,"My goals are to be a sports physical therapist and a well known personal trainer. I believe this class can help me with those goals because being physics is so important. Physics is important because it helps us understand how things work and why they work. Physics helps us become better problem solvers in the world which is a very important skill to have. It is important for me to have an understanding on how levels work to be a successful trainer because that will help me understand how to make the human body better. If I know that the body responds to stress, I can help the persons' body reach a stress level that is appropriate for muscle growth. It is also important for me to know how to solve problems wrong with the human body because sometimes the injured person is not always going to tell me what is wrong with them, I have to figure it out by asking questions and solving problems in my head. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1667,My goals for attending at SF state is to hopefully get a degree for a Biotech Job position. I am still not quite sure in what specific pathway in Biotech industry but I was thinking of a lab work situation. By taking this class it will help me achieve my goals by completing the needed credits I needed to get a Biology degree. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1685,"I’ve been struggling ever since this pandemic started and we made the switch to online. My performance still feels like it’s lacking something, maybe because I feel like I’m not learning as much as I could be or should be. So with that being said my goal is to become a better learner and learn as much as I can from the classes I’m taking so that I can graduate. Eventually start a career or go to medical school. I know some physics is on the MCAT and I need to take this class so that I can move on to my upper division major classes I need to graduate. I think the class would better aid me in my goals if it were in person because I’m more of a visual/kinetic  learner. I don’t know if I’m retaining the information that I’m learning, but I also know it’s reliant on me too."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1663,"My goals are to be able to pass the lecture portion of this course, as of now I have an F and I am really bummed out about it. However, this class has been helping me achieve my goal of doing better in the lecture portion because I feel as if I get a better hands on experience at learning how to solve problems and I get feedback ASAP in zoom to go over where I went wrong. Another goal of mine is being able to be able to fully understand vectors, I think I still somewhat struggle with them as I find myself struggling to know which vector turns into a positive vs negative. However, I do know with attending office hours and seeking extra help I can achieve my goals. I am very thankful to have this course because I think I learn a lot and it does help further my understanding of physics. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1662,"My goals are to hold myself more accountable and manage my time better. This class is one of the first where there are requirements for journaling and forum posts and things of that nature in addition to the normal class curriculum. Being that I have a full time job and full plate for the semester it is a bit challenging to manage it all. But, I'm sure I will get better. I don't think this class specifically help me achieve my goals but overcoming the challenges of having a class like this will."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1655,"Lately, I have been struggling a lot with the material in my physics lecture along with the homework that is meant to help us get more of an understanding on the lessons. My goals are to more understand the information given and be able to solve physics problems on my own. There are a lot of equations that we need to use for the problems and I get lost on which ones we are suppose to use but I hope to be able to critical think. This class does help me understand some of the material, not all because we don't cover everything in lecture but I do understand velocity, acceleration, and force. I get the little bit of extra help/practice and I'm not afraid to ask questions as I am in lecture. I feel more confident."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1668,"My goals in terms of school and and a career are to graduate from SFSU, get into UC Davis' vet program, and become a vet. There are things in between that, but that is the basic outline of it. This class is just a requirement that I have to complete in order to get a bachelor's degree. I can't see any connections to how I would use the things I have learned in this class, but I am sure I will be using them in the future. I think this class has helped me with dimensional analysis for future chemistry classes. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1672,"My goals for this year is to have a general understanding of physics, which is not asking a lot for myself. I don't really see myself pursuing a career related to physics, so I hope to just pass both of my physics lecture and lab class. Over the course of this last month since I’ve started classes again, I notice I try to relate or think back on more of what I do in the lab portion of physics. Lectures are useful too, but I think practicing on my own with the material is a lot more beneficial to me. So, all in all, I’m glad I took the lab along with the lecture so I feel supported in both classes. I think it might be required, but I’m grateful for the requirement I suppose. Lecture helps my grade in the lab as well as the lab helping me in the lecture, helping me reach my goal of passing both classes with a grade I can be proud of myself for getting. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1659,"Reflective Journal 2My goals in life are simple: enjoy my time here and leave a good memory after I die. I consider myself a serious and shy person but I never take things too seriously. Of course I’m not saying I don’t care about things but rather I don’t stress too much about things outside my control. I know life can suck sometimes and I am aware of that so when something bad happens to me, I tend to take it as a lesson and learn from it. Like once I failed my pre calc class back in high school. I was disappointed but I knew I was gonna get another shot at the class the following semester. So I still enjoyed my summer and the next semester I got an A in my class. So I think I am a person that doesn’t let bad things affect me emotionally too much. I keep moving forward with my goals in mind and the support of my family and friends."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1661,"My goals is to pass physics with a great amount of knowledge that I have learned from the class. And possibly get into the next physics class next semester with the knowledge from this class. This class is helping me a lot in many ways. Such as, learning about new topics and terms which help me better my understanding about physics. I also learned how certain topics can be used in real life using physics. I am a biology major, so I know that physics will be a huge part of my learning. I hope this take this knowledge for the next physics class that I will be taking. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1680,"I know what I wanna do with my life, I wanna be a surgeon. There is no question about that. However on my journey there I am also trying to pursue my childhood dream of becoming a twitch streamer. So I'm doing both and whatever happens, happens because at least I tried. It's a win-win situation for me because if I don't become twitch famous, then I become a surgeon and play video games on the side for fun. Overall I know what I wanna do with my life for the last 5 years. This class is helping me by being the pre-req that I need to advance towards my bachelor's. Physics does interest me as well, so this class is not just another class I just need to take. It's a class that I actually kinda have an interest in. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1682,"My goals are the graduate San Francisco State University with a Bachelor's Degree in Biology, with a concentration in Zoology. This will help me achieve my future goals of working with animals in a professional setting or being a part of a zoo, aquarium, or museum staff. Ideally, I would love to be a part of the California Academy of Sciences' staff. This has been one of my favorite institutions and inspired me to move here to San Francisco. Personally I think it is one of the most impressive museums I have visited. The idea of housing and presenting all fields of science, living and non-living, is such an interesting concept. This relates to studying Physics as these concepts are what control the natural world around us. This class will help me learn more about the process of setting up experiments and the elements required to reach concise results. This is crucial to any member of the STEM community. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1658,"My goal is to have a better understanding in physics and to receive a good grade for this subject. I struggled with physics during high school, I did not learn much. I am trying to do my best to comprehend everything that is being taught in physics this time. So far the labs have been really helpful in practicing what we are learning in lecture. I have found the moving man helpful where it shows us the position vs time, velocity vs time and acceleration vs time graphs. When we choose the different velocity and acceleration, it shows us clearly what the direction, speed  and more the man is going on the graphs, but also in the image on top with the tree, brick walls and the house. This class helps me practice and reinforce what I have learned in lecture. Also working in groups is helpful to learn from each other. If you are confused you can ask someone to clarify."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,678,"My goal at the moment is to get a biology degree, and taking this class will both satisfy requirements for that degree and better preparing me with knowledge I can use along my educational career. I feel like learning physics (even if I suck at math) is essential to my being a well-rounded student. I also feel like having a basic understanding of physics can help you in your everyday life and help you understand more about your surroundings, as well as have your brain questioning further too. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1669,"I hope by the time I die that  I will leave this world with only memories and no goals or dreams left to achieve. That sounds difficult, but conquering each day is a goal of mine that will push me toward those dreams. My goals range from small to large, from just getting out of bed for the day to actually getting my degree and moving forward with my career. I suppose this class can help me by providing support, in difficult times or just in general, in order to succeed. I am not too sure what else this class can help me with. The majority of my goals consist outside of school since I can't really do anything more than just succeeding each semester. I guess it just goes back to never-ending support. I think that is what most students need in order to achieve their goals. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1671,"Reflective Journaling #2My goal is to learn physics and know how to apply it in my real life. This class can help me achieve these goals by completing the lab exploration and post-lab knowledge check summary. For the lab exploration worksheet, I can explore the subject and learn about physics. For the post-lab knowledge check, I can apply the situation in real life using what I learned in class. The post-lab knowledge worksheet can help me see what I have learned so far in the class. The lecture class is also helpful for preparing me to do the lab activities. The professor is good at explaining each slide and it has helped me a lot for completing the lab exploration worksheet. The stimulation has also helped me to understand more about acceleration, position, and velocity graphs. All of the labs are important and it can help me a lot in the future as well. I am looking forward to learning more about physics and participating in more lab activities."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1673,this class is aiding in my progress through college and that's about it the tutor is pretty good but zoom is a flawed system and improper to really learn anything on at least for someone with my type of learning. also i think this is a survey i am starting to think this will be sold to some survey company or maybe the school will keep it but either way this seems sus but ill type away and get a grade and get this class over with. this doesn't seem lil e200 words i don't know what to say to use 200 words but here we are. i wonder what mechanical engineering sis like i would try to answer the questions you proposed but they do not interest me in the slightest so i do not want to waste my time on them. one goal in life to not hurt anyone.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1683,"One of my biggest goals would be too pass all my classes this semester so I can be on track to complete all my required classes for my major. Doing this will make me feel accomplished because I am excited to take more classes that create to my interest like biology. courses and sciences. This is a goal that I am really pushing for because I have felt that I find myself taking a lot of courses that haven't made me feel I am studying something I want and like. This class with clear this goal and another that I have. Passing this class will complete a requirement that will let me continue with higher education courses for my career. Another goal that this will satisfy is learning a new science, I have taken chemistry and biology in high school and in college but I have never taken physics so this will let me learn new material that will help me in the future. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1678,"my goals are to merge my passions of marine biology and climate change mitigation/ adaptation?  Physics is certainly an integral part of understanding the climate, our oceans, and the science necessary to add to these fields. In this class specifically, Im hoping to recharge my understanding of trigonometry and calculus a bit, grasp the central theories of physics in a way that is applicable to the real world, be confident enough with the material that I can explain it to someone else, and get a good grade! The group work is definitely helping me to solidify these things; though sometimes I wish there was more participation from my peers in the breakout groups! In-person its definitely easier to collaborate. so zoom is a new challenge :-)"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1676,"My goals as a student is to learn anything and everything that I can. I love to learn new things and also to learn more about science. This class is definitely doing this for me because physics is something that I have never learned in my life, so to be taking in school is nice. This class in particular would have been nice to take in class because I always see the professor doing cool things with objects online and such, and would've loved to learn everything hands on. But going back to my goals, I think this class is helping me find science in a cooler more physical way than most other classes. Also it is integrating what I already learned from previous classes (sort of) the way to think about some of these problems. None the less this is a great experience for me to have to learn more."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1674,My goals right now are to become a better student. This seamster has started off very rough and organized for me. Already about a month in I am still struggling to get ahold of everything. This class is helping me achieve my goals by being very organized and helpful. The professor goes over the material well and helps those who struggle. It is also a great supplement to the main lecture class because I feel like I get extra practice in learning concepts. It builds off the lecture in a way so it makes it a little easier to understand topics and is another outlet for me to seek help. This class is also helping me achieve another one of my goals in ending this class and the lecture class with a good grade. This class makes it possible. I hope to learn a lot about how things work and this lab gives me the opportunity in doing that.
