2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1686,"Journal Entry #1  Why am I here?     Well depends why I am where. At SF State, it was a place that I was introduced to through a program I participated in while at community college and it was the place where I felt I would do best. It was not  a massive school like a UC so I would not get lost figuratively and literally and I knew people here so the transition here would be much easier. Also it was the school that gave me the most financial aid. As for the class I need to complete my requirements for my major and this lab is a corequisite for the physics 111 class. I am not a physics major but a biology major. I have not taken a physics course since high school so I was a bit nervous about taking it since I remembered getting all the equations mixed up."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1687,"Why am I here?I'm here for multiple reasons. Academically, I'm here to build the foundation for my future. To be the change for future generations, and it begins with education. I'm not so sure what I want to do or who I want to become, but when I think of a purpose for school it is to create better and positive changes within this world. Physically, I'm here to breath and live in harmony with every living thing on this planet. I continue to build relationships with people in my classes or work and consciously find purpose in nature and other species. Mentally, I am here to challenge my emotions and allow myself to overthink and feel the feelings that I feel. I am here, and it's hard to do so everyday, but I remind myself of my purpose and my importance in this world. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1688,I am in this class honestly because I need to take it for my major. I am a biology major with a concentration in zoology so lots of bio ahead of me and I thought I would take more than a semester of physics. At first I was not too thrilled to be in this class and lecture because I thought I was going to struggle right off the bat. But as the lecter classes went on I actually understood the material so far but I need to practice problems on my own. Mainly for this class I was really scared for the math part. Math definitely has not been my strongest suit ever since I started school haha. I struggle a lot and I think I am a slow learner but that’s okay. Also I need a lot of examples to help me learn and if I get lost in my homework assignments then I can go back and follow to see if I’m doing the problem right or if I get lost I can see which step goes next.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1689,"I’m here taking this class because it’s required for Physical therapy programs I’m trying to apply for. This class is important to me because I really want to get a good grade but also being able to understand the material. I believe this class will help me throughout my career so I really need to focus and try to understand everything. Online classes have been hard lately because it’s too hard to focus. I could just go to zoom class and do the homework but I’m literally not learning anything. So, this is why I need to take more time and go over what I learned so the material stick with me. I’m also here because I want to have a college degree. I know that it’s not always the perfect way to make money in the future but I feel like if I have a diploma  I can feel a little better about my accomplishments in life. Having this degree will help me pursue my dream of being a physical therapist. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1690,"Why am I here? Well that can be a loaded question. Like why am I here in this class or like why am I here in respects of where I am in life is what I interpret from this question It is a question that can be difficult to answer if you really dive deep into it. One thing I know for sure is that I am here today, taking this physics class because I need it to advance forward in my scholars. I want to get my degree in Biology and this a required class. In order to get me where I am now I had taken a 2 1/2 year break from school to try to figure out what I was looking for as a career. It was supposed to be just a semester or longest a year break but ended up being stretched. There was a small chance I may have never come back. However, I'm happy I have a better sense of where I want my life to move towards and excited to be here in my first semester back in college!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1691,"Honestly I took this class because this class because it is a requirement for my major. I have never taken Physics before so I am a little excited for it as. After taking Physic lec I did find it to be a little bit interesting . Because I have mostly learned about Chemistry or Bio so it is a little bit different for me. I am aware that Physics is mostly math and algebra so I think I will enjoy it because I do enjoy algebra but Calculus is not a strong aspect of mine. I am just curious to learn more about the physical aspect of Science, such as Vector and Displacement and Gravity and the acceleration. I took Physic lec 3 times and I was pretty excited to learn few things and hopefully we will be able to demonstrate and learn more in Physics Lab. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1692,"Why am I here? why am I in this class? I'm in this class because I need it for my astronomy minor, but more than that, I quite enjoyed learning about physics in high school, and I want to see what else there is to learn about it at the college level. I'm sure there isn't much space for going into detail at an intro to physics level, but I'm excited to see if there's more that I can learn while here. I will admit I was hoping for a more hands-on experience when taking this class, but this class works best for my schedule so here I am! Why am I here at sfsu? I wanted to go to sfsu for many reasons. It was close by, so I would be able to stay with my family, which was one of my concerns, and commute to school. I'll admit it wasn't for much more of a reason than that I wanted to stick close to my family while experimenting potential courses and from there degrees that I'd like to pursue. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1693,"Honestly I am here because it is a requirement for the degree I am trying to obtain. I am a biology major on the pre-med route so taking this class and doing well in it is essential to being successful in my near future. This class is also a pre requisite for classes I will take the following semesters. There is a physics portion on the MCAT and one of the tougher topics students complain about, which gives me some anxiety. By being in this class I hope to understand the fundamentals of physics and apply it to studying for the MCAT and getting into a good school."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1694,"The reason I am here is because this class is a pre requisite to becoming a Physical Therapist. Becoming a Physical Therapist is something I have always wanted to do, so what ever class I have to take, I will gladly do so. Although this is still a pre requisite, I am still excited to learn in this lab and expand my knowledge. Learning is fun and I hope that learning in this lab will be fun to do and not too stressful. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1695,"I am here because the last time I took this course I failed the lab portion. My goal is to pass this course with a far better grade than last time.  COVID has really affected my ability to learn and I hope now that there is some sense of normality in my life, I can continue my degree and graduate on time.  This class is really important to me and I hope to do well in it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1696,"Why am I here?Because for some unknown reason, physics allowed my physical being to be stabilized into a life form. Or so I've thought. Really, we just don't know the absolute true meaning of our existence. So far, our ideas have constructed us into thinking we just do things for the sake of doing things. We ""strive on"" because that's our purpose, our reasoning. It's crazy to think our brain cells (which feed us our thoughts and is the core of bodily functions) are just made of atoms, molecules, whatever microscopic particles you call them. As much as we consider ourselves life forms, we're just as much as a function. A really advanced one. I don't know, oppose me or not, this is something philosophy should deal with, not me. If you were asking why am I in a physics class, then I'd just answer: physics is cool. Maybe I'll pick up physics knowledge in a moment of time and use it for whatever action it serves. Maybe I can try to understand ballistics, electricity, magnetism, buoyancy, driving, even eating my damn frozen yogurt. And hopefully see why it's a part of our existence; a part of why we exist, and understanding why physics itself exists."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1697,1)why am I here??I am here mainly because I need to take this class for one of my general ed classes but honestly physics is something that I completely am interested in and learning how physics is in our everyday life no matter what we are doing. I love that this class is kind of what I am interested in. When I think of physics I think of a mad scientist that will solve the wonders of the world like rick and Morty but I feel like that's a long shot. I hope to learn a lot about physics in this class because I am going into a field that you need the maximum energy output from a person and physics will help me understand that a little bit more than what I already know. I also enjoy bit of a challenge so that's why I chose to take a semi hard class but a fun one that will interest me in the long run
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1698,"When I saw the question for the prompt “Why am I here?”, I thought first about why am I here where I’m currently at today. Well I am here in the Physics lab because I have to take it alongside the other Physics course. After that it kind of led to a chain reaction. Well I am in the Physics course because I did not pass it at community college before I transferred to SFSU, so I have to take it here again. Then it got even broader. Why am I here in college? I am here to chase my goals and get a degree in computer science. I have always been interested in technology and perhaps working in the tech industry one day. Not only did I pursue college to better myself and earn an education to further boost my future. I went to college for my parents as well. They have given up their education in order to work and provide for the family. So in turn not only am I doing it for myself, but also for them. In the end, even in a broader sense I think that every individual that is here has a purpose or goal in life. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1699,"I am in this class because I have to take this course for my major. One of the reasons that I am in SFSU was because I wanted to go somewhere where there is a big diversity and everyone is accepted and included and I think that SFSU is one of the best campus which does that. I am here to also get a degree in Biology with a focus on cell and molecular. I want to eventually work at a crime lab so this is the first step for me to get there eventually. I was originally studying Computer Science, but while studying I realized it wasn't for me personally as I needed to talk and interact with others unlike in Computer Science where I was in front of the computer for like 8 hours a day. I want to give back to my community so I think i am here to eventually get to the point where I will be able to help and work to give back.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1700,"""Why am I here?"" I found this question very interesting because even though life is a journey and everyone endures obstacles, what's the reason why I am here? I feel like that I have a purpose to here and I'm supposed to be something great. I love my family and friends and want to help those around me and one day when I become a doctor, I'll be able to help strangers. That purpose of learning, experiencing and overcoming challenges are preparing me for the harder stages later in life. I feel that if i'm able to show someone love, friendship, courage, guidance and laughter then i've done at least something right and that's enough for me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1701,"I am majoring in Physiology, and I have to take physics 111 with the lap and physics 221 with the lap. So if I need to graduate with a degree, I have to take these classes. I am also here to learn more about physics because I am planning to go to medical school. And I have to pass the MCAT test to go to medical school, so if for me to pass the MCAT, I have to take physics. Also, it is fun to learn about physics because it makes us understand how things around us work. I only took physics for one year in high school, but I forgot most laws and equations. So I am thrilled to be here; the class is fun. I’m a person who learns from practicing. I am also taking SCI 111 to do well in the lap and to be prepared for the next semester. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1702,"This is my first semester at SFSU. When I transferred, I decided to change my major to biology. This class is a requirement for me to take in order to get my bachelors in biology. Ever since I decided to change my major, which originally was early childhood education, I am now motivated to be in school and looking forward to being in this course which is why I am here today taking this course. My goal in majoring biology is to hopefully use this degree to become a forensic scientist. I have dreams of one day working in a lab. Never would I ever expect myself to major in biology. I honestly have always hated anything relating to science or math but now I LOVE it. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1703,"This is a little off-topic from the reflective journaling itself, but I really just wanted to say that I genuinely do appreciate these kinds of assignments. I had a chemistry professor back at the community college I transferred from do the exact same thing when it got closer to the end of the course. The prompts were like ""How is your day doing"" or ""What shows have you been recently watching to de-stress?"" It took a lot of weight off my shoulders even if no one reads the discussions. Anyways, I ask myself this question a lot since I'm struggling a bit with my mental health. I typically am well-collected, but life decided to hit me recently with a 16-wheeler and backed up on me. I don't want to say that my purpose here is to make others feel better emotionally, but I always find myself being the mediator between people's problems. It's like waking up to a firey pile of shit on your doorstep. On a more spiritual sense, I just know that there is something to be learned from this lifetime that I wasn't able to complete in the past life. In this moment of time though, these ""lessons"" are not hot. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1704,"I am at San Francisco State University so that I can get the education necessary to become eligible to apply for medical school. I didn't exactly choose to go to San Francisco State, it kind of just fell into my lap as an option and I used it as an opportunity to go to a new city and find myself. I think I have a pretty good idea of who I want to be in the future, but I don't have an idea of who I am right now. I clearly know my name, my favorite color, my likes and dislikes, but there has to be more about me to discover. Whatever I uncover while on my journey at San Francisco State would hopefully push me in the direction of who I want to be and where I want to be in the future. I want to go to medical school because I the medical field is so fascinating to me. I love learning about the different biological processes that occur in the body and how the body works in general. Once I get into medical school I plan to focus on becoming a sports medicines physician because I love sports and I've spent my entire life being surrounded by athletes, so what better way to combine the two things I love most by becoming a physician for athletes! I also want to open up a private practice in Inglewood, CA. I am not from the city of Inglewood but it is the city where I spent my entire high school career learning not only educationally but personally and spiritually as well. I owe the city of Inglewood a lot for giving me the space to grow and mold myself into the person I am today and I think helping the city fix its access to health care by having a free clinic as a part of my private practice is a great way to do it. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1705,"""You ever wonder why we're here?""""It's one of life's great mysteries isn't it? Why are we here? I mean, are we the product of some cosmic coincidence, or is there really a God watching everything? You know, with a plan for us and stuff. I don't know, man, but it keeps me up at night."" - Simmons and Griff, Red vs. Blue, animated series. In all seriousness, this is a question I've pondered for ages. Why are we here? What is the meaning of it all? Is there a reason that I was born into this life, positioned as I am, and is there a reason why there are others who are positioned the way they are? Why are there people who are homeless, and who go through hell on earth, and people who are born into a life of luxury, never having to lift a finger to get anything and everything their hearts desire? Is this life fair? Does God, or do Gods, exist? In all sincerity I have none of the answers to any of those questions, at least none that would satisfy my agnostic ever inquisitive heart or mind. That being said, I know why I am here in this class. I am here in this class because I chose to be here. Whatever the cosmic coincidences of life may be, once we are in it, we each have a degree of choice in regards to how we ""play the cards we are dealt"". I played mine is such a way that I am in this class now. Further than that, I am on the road to achieving a Doctorate in Occupational Therapy and this is one step towards reaching that goal! I also love physics, so being here is a bonus for me. Life is a combination luck, choice, chance, etc. Me being anywhere at any point in time is a combination of those things, at the very least. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,697,"The reason I'm in this class is because it's one of my requirements for my major. I'm a biology/physiology major in order to become a physical therapist. I've never taken a physics class here, not even in high school. So this all new to me. However, I've always wondered what physics was all about and had interest in it. And now that I'm taking it this semester, I'm very excited but nervous to learn all these new concepts that I've never used before. I'm just a bit scared because I never took advantage of taking physics in high school, even when it was free and was offered at my school. I could have came into this class having some experience at least. Instead, everything is new to me, haha…"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1706,"I'm here because it's a requirement for my major but now that I'm learning more about physics i'm a lot more interested in the content and information that i'll be learning. I'm also here because I want to be the first person on both sides of my family to graduate from college. I think that I am setting the standard for education in my family, which will in turn motivate and help the future generation of youth coming from my family.Currently i'm in the library and I'm here because I just had my physics class in person only 15 minutes before the lab started so I didn't have time to go home. I would like to go home because my feet and shoulders are a bit sore, but I have to push through for my own future. I do like this class though so I wouldn't wanna be late without a serious reason like breaking a leg or something."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1707,"Why am I here? I'm am here based on the decisions I have made in my life. Since I was a little kid I was always interested in learning sciences and how things in nature lived/ worked. As I got older and went to high school I took classes based in science like biology, life science, and a medical program; that all peaked my interested even more in chasing a career in biology. Now that I'm in college and had the chance to chase my dreams and it has put me into physics. I'm not the strongest in mathematics nor solving word problems. But in order to complete college and retain my degree I need to push through my struggles and pass physics. I'm here to create better study practices and to make sure I have enough time to review lectures, so I can do better on the testing materials. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1708,"I’m here for the second time to learn about Physics. The first time my professor from my other school was not quite approachable. I would like to earn the best knowledge from this class. Although, this is a requirement for my pre med requirements. I want to be able to understand how physics works in the medical field. Understanding the value of medicine and physics and how and where it has connections with patients. I hope by the end of semester, I will have a better understanding of physics. I hope to memorize it in the back of my head without constantly reteaching myself or reviewing. I am well sure this is used in radiology and cardiology. Also, I do enjoy physics slightly more than chemistry and biochemistry. I hope to also be a physics tutor as well since there is more theoretical concepts of physics "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1709,"Why am I here? There have been many times where I've caught myself asking this question. Whether on a small scale such as why I'm here in a class or why I'm here on this earth. I'm in this class because I have goals and I'm striving to do something great with my life - this class is a very small stepping stone to get to where I need to be. If you were to ask me that question on a much larger scale I would say I am here to experience life, make meaningful relationships, and to learn about how the world works. There's so much to this vast life that a single lifetime is simply too short. My purpose is to find happiness within myself and grow into a person I am proud of... to also enjoy the different walks of life around me. Many people get caught up in the little things that won't matter in a year or two but there's more to life than just the bubbles we currently live in. "
