2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1690,"My first and main goal is to get my degree in Biology. In order to achieve that I need to pass this class. I guess another goal for that would be to earn an A in the class but actually leave this class with a good understanding of the material I was taught. Im curious how physics will play in my future career when I get my bachelors degree. My goal for a career are still being formed at the moment. I don't know if I want to specialize in a certain field, or not. Ive looked into doing work in Forensics and possibly working for a private lab for a company, who knows. But hopefully I still have time to decide! "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1710,What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?My goal is to become a medical doctor and this class will help me achieve this goal by completing my pre-medical requirements and learn more about physics!
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1705,"My goal is to become a Doctor of Occupational Therapy and to live a life where I can consistently grow and learn. I want to lead a fulfilling life and continue to develop my own understanding of the life and world around me. This class is crucial to my goals, in that it is quite literally a series of lessons in understanding how the world around me moves and interacts. In my humble opinion, Physics, along with all of the sciences, is an intimate art which, through practicing them, can help one develop a deeper appreciation of life, along with a more critical and open minded lens through which to view and experience life. For example, rolling down a grassy hill as a kid is fun, but understanding why and how that rolling happens is so cool. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1688,One of my goals is to one day become a veterinarian. This is of course my major goal I am trying to accomplish and it will certainly not be easy. I think this class is helping me achieve that goal by teaching me what I may need for vet school. Also this class is helping me open up more to my classmates and the professor. This will help me in the future since I'll be working with other workers and the animals' owners.  This class is also a requirement for me to be able to graduate in 2024 which I am going for. My plan is to graduate in 2024 then go onto vet school which is about another 4 years. Hope all goes well and smoothly but this is going to be a long journey.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1686,"Lets see, my goal at San Francisco State would be to graduate with a bachelors in science. This would allow me to move to graduate school where I could pursue a doctorate. Ultimately I want a job as a researcher in the industry. This class is a requirement for my bachelors degree which is biology in concentration in microbiology. But the information in it is more than just that. Microbiology and molecular biology are heavily linked to chemistry which is linked to physics because like anything life happens in the real world and is governed by its physical laws. In fact the next class that I have to take is biochemistry which is probably going to be like my organic chemistry class but with larger molecules. But regardless the same laws still apply and understanding this is important to understanding many concepts in biology and the world despite the fact that I am not physics focused."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1708,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""I hope to succeed in becoming a Pediatric Cardiologist. my main purpose of going into medical field,  specifically medicine is to make a change for children's needs. I have a purpose of my goals as much as work and dedication it takes those goals will bring more value in the future.  my love and desire is to help children I need. I want to be able to find the purpose and a reason to help or fixate the health solutions.Unfortunately, cardiovascular disease has run in our family for years and unfortunately some have passed so soon.  the youngest in our family is 1 years old who has ASD( Atrial Septal Defect.) Best class will help me achieve those goals as to learning and building more conception of physics and how it relates to Medicine, Cardiology, and  Radiology."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1706,"My goals are to become a forensic pathologist in a crime lab and become a mother. This class is helping me achieve this goal by filling up a pre-requisite for my major to become a forensic pathologist. This class will help me with getting my career, so i'm very much grateful for the opportunity to learn physics as a part of my career goal. It is also in turn helping me become a mother because without it, I wouldn't be able to have a stable income to support my future child. Another goal that I have is to keep myself focused and motivated to finish this semester, and I think that how much effort and time that is going into this course is definitely helping me with that. I want to learn about physics and I want to understand it since I know a lot of people struggle with it, so I wanna get it down in one go. I should have this energy with everything in my life, but it is a start."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1711,"my goals are to be an O.B.G/Y.N and to succeed in life so that I can take care of my family, so that they would not have to worry about that. Also, to better my knowledge in the science department like biology, physics, chem, and others. Also, to understand physics since I've never had this class before even in high school I was not able to take this class its new for me. This class will help me with my life goals so I can understand the graphs and motions of what im going to deal with as a doctor. How this will help me in physics is it will expand my thinking and help me understand what I am going to be doing in this class. To help me pass this class as well so I can get credit for my requirements. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1695,"My goal is to balance my school work with work and get my bachelors in the next 2 years. To achieve this, I will push myself to manage my time better and engage in studying important concepts."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1696,"I don't really have a set goal. Or well, I just want to live and enjoy life. I'm going by ""winging it"" in college and just let the outcome play itself. I understand that this class teaches the fundamentals around physical objects and interactions, which I place at a basic level of universal understanding of the world. I don't know how it's going to help me specifically in the future, but I know there'll be moments where I could apply the ideas of physics into the real world, such as in architecture or travelling. Physics also shows me how much patience and vigor I should have not only for itself, but also for the real world. Additionally, I really shouldn't slack on this class especially, since understanding the concepts of physics can be very complex, even if they've been simplified as much as they are. What I like about this supplemental lab class is that it helps with the visuals and actual execution of a physics moment as opposed to imagining and mathematics behind it. If I want to effectively see my goal, I should tackle both the planning and the visuals of it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1694,"My goal is to be able to become a Physical Therapist. To get there I am going to need this class to help me pass physics so I do think that this class will be able to help me with my goal and to help me reach what I am aiming for. I need physics to be able to apply to DPT schools, so whatever it takes to go through Physics 111, I think that the lab will definitely help me pass the class and show DPT schools that I am able to work hard. The lab is really helping learn more on the things that I am struggling with the most in the lecture classes. So overall I do think that taking this lab right now is going to help me achieve my goal of becoming a Physical Therapist."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1691,"My goal is to be able to understand Physics. I have never taken Physics before so I just want to learn the basics of Physics, because I have no idea about vectors and velocity or anything about Physics in general. I feel like this class is helping me my bringing the words into actions. I feel like usually in class we listen to words mostly, but in lab 2 it was nice to see the man and moving him around and seeing  the Velocity and speed work together. Mostly the words I hear in Class is what I am able see in front of me in this lab class. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1707,"My Goals are to successfully pass physics with a B or higher. I would be completely happy with achieving a B in physics and that is because I find physics to be completely challenging. I have never been good at word problems in general. So attending a class that is mostly made up of word problems; is a little bit more difficult to maintain. So I believe with me passing physics with a B or higher will ultimately make me happy. I am going over the homework a lot more in detail to take my time and understanding what I am trying to figure out. Drawing out the problems is also helping me in understanding the concepts as well and I believe if I stick to these habits it will help me succeed. In the end, this class is what will lead to my ultimate dream by graduating from college and obtaining the career of my dreams. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1689,"My goal is to graduate college, then apply to Physical Therapy school. This class is helping me achieve that goal because this is a requirement in order to get in. This class will help me look at graphs when I’m helping a patient and also apply the basic laws of physics to my craft. Physics is important because it can help us know how much force we can apply to a patient or measuring range of motion. We are concerned about how they move their body and want to teach them how to do it correctly. "

2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1693,Some of my main goals in life right now are to get into med school and get a md. In order to do so I must graduate with a bachelors in a degree to meet the requirements to get accepted into med school. Currently I am a Biology major with a concentration in Physiology. One of the requirements or prerequisites is physics for my degree and to get into med school. By taking this class I will learn the basic elements for pre-medical education and complete the requirement to achieve my future dream. Each stem class I take feels like I'm taking a step in the right direction.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1699,"My goal is to graduate from SFSU and then work in the forensic science field. For that to happen first I need to take this class and pass it. This class is helping me with that by teaching physics which I will need not only for my future career, but also my future classes. I would also like yo get my masters forensic science. While that's a little far from now this class is one of my steps to get there eventually. I know I will also need physics for my career path and hopefully this class will help me get there eventually. One of my short term goal is also to get an internship or be able to help with a professor on their studies and research and this class should hopefully help me with some of the math which will probably be required to be able to do that also. I think this is a important class for my pathway in my career.   "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1712,"I would say that my current goal is to simply take care of myself and focus on what makes me happy. With everything going on in the world right now, on top of my health issues, I've been really unfocused and feel ungrounded with myself so I've been trying really hard to stay on top of all my assignments. I was only able to spend one semester on campus before the shut down so my goals of learning more about chemistry and working in a lab were interrupted. I've been struggling with finding myself lately and have been trouble recognizing myself. Coming out of high school and getting into SFSU, I was super driven and had a lot of energy and now, I can't help by comparing myself to the person I once was. I've lost my passion for chemistry and I've lost my passion in simply living so I would say that, that is my main goal now, is to simply find myself and be happy. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1702,"My goal as of right now is to pass this class. As mentioned before, this class is a requirement for my bachelors in biology. This class is helping me achieve my goal because it is opening my eyes to how much physics really is involved in the real world. Whenever I do the post labs, it makes me think of real life scenarios or anything really that relates to the topics of what we are being taught. In a way, this helps me better understand the topics and helps me remember the topics also. I have always struggled trying to remember literally everything I learn in class but when I find ways for me to relate it to my life it helps me remember and learn better which is what I feel this class has done for me so far. Outside of this class, I do have a goal of passing another class of mine which I'm taking at another college in order to get my associates in allied health. :)"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1698,One of my main goals is to graduate and get a degree in Computer Science. Eventually finding work somewhere in the tech industry. This class plays a role in helping me achieve that goal because it is a class that I have to take as a requirement in order to move up to the next level in terms of requirements for GE. In the long term this class will also help me with my other major courses by also teaching me how to critically think and methods of problem solving. In which I will need those tools in my career and just throughout moments in life. It is essentially just another building block and step to climb before reaching the next.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1701,"My goal is to do my best in this class and to be prepared for the next semester. I have to do one year of physics for my major. This class is helping my achieving my goals by helping me understand how physics work. It is also helping me prepare for the MCAT test, I plan to go to medical school, and I have to take a year of physics in my undergraduate major. To pass the MCAT test, I have to have some knowledge of physics.I am majoring in Biology, so physics isn’t exactly my strongest subject; however, I really like physics. And I am also interested in how things actually work around us."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1697,this class is a pre requisite because I am a kinesiology major and this will help me out in the field because we can give measurements to a persons speed acceleration etc. this class is super challenging so my goal for this class is to pass it with a grade that seems reasonable but I am definitely still pushing my self to get the best grade possible 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1709,"Career wise my goal is to become a surgeon. I've always seen myself wanting to be in the medical field and surgery is what currently interests me the most. This class is just a small stepping stone in helping me get to where I need to go. Although online classes aren't ideal for me I still hope to thrive in this class and learn as much as I can. I've been good at school my entire life however college has showed me how easy it is to fall through the cracks. Therefore, a shorter goal of mine is to graduate on time with exceptional grades - meaning no more procrastinating and to prioritize the right things. Lastly, an overall goal of mine in life is to be happy and make great relationships with my loved ones and friends. I want to enjoy the little things and explore more than just the bubble I'm in."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1704,"I have many goals and I think they are all achievable, but because many of my goals are career related, I've created smaller short term goals. My goals for this semester are: Become better at time management Get better at asking for help when necessary Do my best in each class Become better at coding in R studio Learn the basics of Python These are my short term goals because I am doing a lot of new things this fall semester. For one, this is my first semester on campus and I am also joining my first research lab ever! So I am so excited to be here this semester. I need to become better at time management because I am taking 19 units again and 7 of those units are dedicated to learning two different coding languages. I recently learned the basics of R over the summer with Rori Rohlfs and I loved the challenges I experienced so much that I ended up joining the PINC program and her forensic genetics course. Through the PINC Program I am also learning how to code in Python, which is kind of like R, but sometimes I get the languages mixed up when doing homework. Besides my computer programming courses, I am also taking my first Physics course. Which I was kind of scared of, but now that I am in the class, my nerves have gone down. My long term goals are: Get into medical school (Either Stanford, University of Chicago, Emory, or Baylor) Become a physicianspecialize in Sports Medicine Get signed to a pro sports team and work with them for about 5-6 years Open up a private practice"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1703,"My goals right now are to pass physics with flying colors. I am pretty much aware that I am extremely weak at math and physics is just an add on to whatever I've learned from there. I'm really hoping that this semester I am able to grasp the concepts that are being applied and use them through a variety of means throughout the entirety of this course. This class is actually one of my favorite courses because of how active the students and the professor are at helping each other out. I also really do love the reflective journaling since it takes a lot of stress out of my day. I seldom do these kinds of things and I wish I had done them more often. I do have a ""finsta"" which is like a private instagram page for your close friends where you can rant or even talk about the smaller things that bother you, but I haven't touched that thing in ages. A social media break really does wonders for the body and mind. Perhaps I should erase the rest of my social media and see how that goes...."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1700,"My personal goals are to be able to finish my pre-requisites in order to apply to medical school by next year. I have many short term goals, like passing this class and learning enough to feel comfortable to continue to Physics 2. This class in particular is helping me understand more of the physical aspect of physics, compared to my physics lecture class. It's been difficult to get back in school mode after being out of school since 2018. I hope that even though the normality of a LAB class should be in person, I hope I do well in adapting to taking it online. As I am pressed for time and don't wish to repeat any classes due to a failing or low grade. This is my first introduction to physics in general so my interest is definitely high. I'm going to continue using physics in my everyday life in general and see how it can relate to any other part of my professional goals."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1687,"My goals are to graduate with a bachelor's degree, in whichever major that I believe would suit me and my long term self the best. I am currently a Biology major but I was originally a Nursing major but I sadly did not get into a nursing program. So, this class at the moment is helping me reach my goal as a Bio major and fulfill the classes for this major. I hope to re-apply again for Nursing for the Spring and Fall to fulfill those career goals. However, if it doesn't end up working out I will plan to finish out Biology and see what's in store for me there. Regardless, my main goal is to be happy in whatever I do regardless of what or where it may be. I don't want to be in this capitalistic society only to survive, I want to be happy and create changes in this world. Impactful, and positive changes. After being asked this question so many times, I'm still not sure. "
