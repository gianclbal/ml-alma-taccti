Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1778,I am here to expand my knowledge in the biology field to further my education towards medical school. While med school is the ultimate goal I am not opposed to experiencing or learning about other careers in the biology/science fields. Ultimately I would love to become a licensed dermatologist.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1779,"Why am I here? That is a good question that I think a lot of us just need to ask ourselves every once in a while just to keep us in check with reality and our goals/dreams in life. I am here in San Francisco to pursue my interests in science and use it to gain knowledge and help those around me. I’m an Earth Science major which is a pretty darn broad science major which is perfect for me because although I don’t know exactly what I am going to do with my major I know that in my future I want to do something science related because all my interests for careers are science based, like I really like cars, aquariums, and farming. As of right now my interests lean more towards farming, and I’ve actually gotten really into cannabis cultivation and with that I am now working on making my own cannabis genetics, but that’s why I’m here in San Francisco to learn about Earth Sciences and apply it to my interests and make a career out of them!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1780,"​​Why am I here, I am here in this class to fulfill the requirement for my degree and try my best to get a good grade in this not only cuz I should but also to try and understand the concepts of physics as I never really understood it before when I took physics as it was confusing and I really didn't understand it. I am here to pursue and receive my degree in biology and pursue my career in dentistry as that is what I want to do in life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1781,"The reason why I am here at SF State is that I decided to go to college for a four year degree. This allows me to be able to get a successful career, and there are many things to do while in college. Some of the activities would include going to classes and meeting new people, but sometimes there are stresses at school such as homework and exams. This school seemed to have the best surroundings based on what I know in terms of the schools that I applied to. Many of the buildings can be very interesting for a school in terms of the architecture. However, this class started at the trailer, but we are now in Thornton Hall due to ventilation issues. This would seem counterintuitive because the trailer has open able windows while the new room has an air system from what I assumed. This can show that we still must be flexible to new updates. Another reason why I am here is to learn more about physics and be able to get a prerequisite for my degree. This can be fundamental for learning about more advance topics, and these topics can rely on many different sources for information. Also, this class was able to meet my schedule."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1782,"I’m here to complete a requirement so I could graduate in 4 years. Even though I like to do math it dose t mean it’s a hobby. However, I’m here at sfsu to learn advance concepts so I could master or use in my career or goal for the future. Sfsu is my 2nd choice if I don’t attend a Uc, first starters it close to my house and cheap. Even though I decline 2 Uc acceptance letter I think that I did a good decision in a economical perspective because I would be in depth in my 4 years of college . Even though I’ll need to take a loan  for Med school I guess I did the right choice. Also I’m thinking of going to Med school but I’m not sure what branch or career I’ll apply because I’m not going to make a decision this early and might regret it. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1783,"I am here because I want to become a scientist. In order for me to do that I need to take the necessary classes to fulfill my major, and get THAT DEGREE. Physics has a lot of similarities with chemistry, and I also have to take plenty of chemistry classes, so it really helps me to have two classes with similar foundations. Interestingly today is also my birthday, which is another way of explaining why I am here today, I was born 22 years ago, today! In the sense of belonging, I am here today because I love San Francisco, and I love my major, and what better way than to study Microbiology in the city of San Francisco. I used to attend USF, but I was a psych major, and I made a promise to myself that I WOULD come back, and here I am today!!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1784,"I’m here in class because it’s part of my school schedule, I’m also here because I knew this would be a challenging and interesting class. I’m here at the school to because I want to finish my undergraduate school here and to be closer to my girlfriend as well as exploring and experiencing new places. I’m here because I knew this would be a good school for me because of the campus, weather and the city of San Fransisco would be a great experience to have. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1785,"Why am I in Physics? That is a question similar to “Why are you in Bio?” “Why are you in Chem?” Well, because they are classes that I need in order to work at places like Genentech or any bio/bio medical company. A lot can be connected to physics, whether I like it or not. Chemistry is bordering on physics, as it mostly touches upon the physics of elements, chemical compounds and how they interact in the world. Physics however, its looking at the world mathematically. Now unless you like math, are very passionate about what Physics does, or a masochist, this would be one heck of a subject to take. For me, I’m trying to be optimistic about this class, mainly because I’m terrified to look at my calculus grade because I know I failed. What does that have to do with Physics? Again, physics is bordering around mathematics itself and my brain is now wired to fear math because of the countless times I tried, failed, tried to get help, failed again… Just when I thought I had everything together it just falls apart. Its precisely because of that that I want to do better this semester. I want to understand, I don’t want to feel helpless when I’m doing a test or lab. I want to prove to myself that I can do mathematics, that I can learn and am capable of doing so. Whether it be desperation or genuine need to understand, I just want to be able to trust myself again. So again, Why am I in this class? Because I know I need to. I know it’s going to get tougher. But its because of that that I want to be in this class; to reassure myself that I can be okay in a tough class. Things will get harder, and I want to be prepared for it all."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1786,"I am here because Physics helps me fulfill a general education requirement that I have yet to fulfill. With that said, there were numerous classes to choose from and I specifically chose physics because I find it very interesting. As somebody who is pretty good at math, Physics is easily my favorite science course to take. Physics gives logical formulas and equations to explain a world that is filled with numerous illogical things. I like the fact that Physics tries to explain certain phenomena that some people didn't even wonder about. For instance, why are certain colors the way that they are. Physics helps explains this, and that's something I love about the science. I also think physics is the most applicable to the real world, and it allows me to use my intuition more than any other science class. I'm here because I had a great physics teacher in high school that made me very interested in the subject, and I wanted to continue learning about it in college. He always found interesting ways to explain things, similar to you, so it's why I'm here."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1787,"Why am I here? That’s a big question, why am I sitting here in this classroom? Well to answer that I am here because I am a biology major and as a bio major physics is one of the classes I must take. Why am I here in this major? Well because science is one of the few things that truly interests me and I feel is something I can learn about that’s applicable to life beyond just school Why am I at sf state? I am here because I was granted the opportunity to be able to attend college and pursue higher education which is a huge privilege  that I feel given the opportunity I must pursue. I am also from the city so I always liked staying nearby. Why am I here in general, like on this planet? Now that I don’t know, but I like to believe there is a reason that I’m here and continue to be here, I like to believe that I have a purpose and something to give to the world that keeps me here. I hope I am here to add to this world and make it even a little bit better than it is. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1788,"We are here to heal, help each other heal, and learn. These actions show up in our daily lives even to the littlest extent but as humans, we often find clarity in our lives by  reflecting on these three things. I find that being in a state of clarity is the closest I feel to true alignment, a direct reflection of fulfilling our purpose on earth. To answer this question for myself, I love learning. Especially about the physical world around me, which is why I am studying science. Science has always been the class that brought me that feeling of alignment to my true self. Being in SF away from my parents brings me that feeling of clarity because I find that it is a part of my healing journey. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1789,"Since I can remember, education was important to my family, so I grew up in an environment which education was a big part of it. My parents always encouraged me and my brother to study. So, one of the main reasons that I am here is because of the fact that I like learning and I think it is kind of necessary in today's world, though it is a personal choice and No offense to those who do not choose education. So, I chose a path to reach my goal and physics class is part of that path. I always like learning new things so I like being here."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1790,I am here because I need this class for my major. I am majoring in cell and molecular biology. My goal is to go to the medical field and become a pediatrician. I am really good working with little kids. I have always been passionate about helping people. I mostly need this class because I need to get ahead in other classes and this is a prerequisite. I am actually quite intrigued by this class so I am not stressing about taking it. These last 2 weeks have really shown me that I enjoy learning physics and this class is pretty fun. I really like working in a group and sharing ideas. I am excited to see what else I will learn in this class. Once I pass this class I hope to learn even more in the higher physics classes. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1791,"I am here taking this class as a prerequisite for my biochemistry degree. I am in school to further my education and to pursue my dreams of becoming a scientist. I have a knack for science and mathematics, but I am also very passionate about giving back to the community. I want to utilize my skills to somehow help improve the quality of human lives, whether that be through research or acts of service. I find fulfillment in being able to help others and my life centers around this belief, in all areas of my life. My education sets me on a path to be of service in the biotech industry because my ultimate goal is to develop treatment on diseases. Following this dream gives me the sense of purpose to get through my education."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1792,"I chose this physics class because I did not want to do the accelerated class that has calculus involved. This class is a course requirement for some of the upper division classes that I will take for my major. My major is biology and I chose that major because I personally find it interesting, so learning about it will not be a pain and a boring time. Physics is more interesting than normal math classes because there is science and real life application involved. I like learning about the different theories like how the universe started, how things work, etc. It’s also very helpful to have a good understanding of how everyday phenomena work. I think physics should be a pretty comfortable class that is interesting and not stressful and can give us a basic understanding of forces and motion and algebra. Physics is not a bad class, even as an requirement, for example, if you are majoring in math, they make you take a lot of boring and stressful courses that probably have a ton of homework everyday as then you have to search up a bunch of videos on khan academy and then you won’t get enough sleep."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1793,"Why am I here? I want to provide a stable environment for my family. I decided to go back to school and pursue a career that I would enjoy. I love science and medicine. Since I did not complete my lower level sciences at City College of San Francisco I am taking them here at San Francisco State. Why am I here at 9:30 in the morning, this class allows me to get from Pleasanton to SF early enough to be home for dinner but not too early to where I miss getting my children ready for school in the morning. Plus I take BART, traffic is crazy coming to SF in the morning. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1794,"Why am I here? I am here, taking physics 111 because of my major. My major requires me to take these different science classes in order to graduate with a biology major. I chose this major because it's something that I am interested in. Although I'm not sure exactly what field I want to specialize in, I feel like I am doing my job by trying it out and actually going to school for it. I am sitting in this class today because I feel like as a full time student it is my job to attend class, take the classes that are required for the major. I am here to complete this course successfully as well as learn something new. Even though I chose this class because it was a requirement, I still want to get something out of it. I would like to learn the concept of physics and be able to take what I learned in this course and potentially use it in a real life situation."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1795,"I’m mostly here for my family. No one in my family has ever gone to college and left home. Everyone stays in our small town, and eventually just dies there. I didn’t want that to be me. I have goals and aspirations that I hope to someday reach. I also want to inspire those around me who look to me for guidance and direction. I had no one to help me throughout high-school and my associates degree.  I was dual enrolled, played sports, volunteered at church and still had to help my family all at once. There was no one to stop me and give me words of encouragement to keep going. I had to tough it out. Navigating life without role models or parents can be draining sometimes. But I have done it and I know it isn’t impossible anymore. Sometimes I do wish I had the support. Coming to San Francisco has been probably the scariest most reckless thing I have ever done. This whole time I’ve just been convincing myself that I’m not afraid and that I will succeed. I hope that I do, but nothings ever promised. I have to work hard to get what I want, because sitting around doesn’t get you anything. I’m here for the people I care about, and for the life I want to live someday. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1796,"Why am I here, as a student I'm in this school to prepare for my future. I came to SF State as it was one of my most affordable options to save money for my future when I enter grad school in the Veterinary program. As in my major I'm studying zoology to facilitate my entry into the school and with hopes of completing my 4 year bachelor on time. In this semester I am working hard to complete all of my general ed in order to complete the upper divisions in the next semester. This semester I am taking physics, as it was one of the requirements for my education in zoology. Im here because I want a good future for myself and I know that If I work hard I can complete any goals I put my effort in. This is why I'm here, because I know that this hard work will come in handy for my future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1797,Why am I here? I’m here in class today because I actually got up on time today. I was planning on nit coming today but I had a feeling that I needed to. I’m not particularly feeling well today(no not COVID) but I know that it’s a cold. Well today I forgot my laptop charger so I can’t go to my second class because it’s online and my computer is about to die. Why are you here? Is such a heavy question cause it can mean alit if things to someone. I’m here today because I need to pass my classes to get into med school. But I don’t even know when to apply to them. I guess I’m here cause everyone expects me to be here so I have to. I want to be a doctor but I’m tired of classes already 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1594,"I am here because I was conceived on this big blue rock in 2002.  I am here to live life and have fun.  I am here to become successful and achieve my goals.  I am here to further my knowledge and education.  These are all reasons I believe I am here, but why am I truly here?  Do I have a destiny?  I believe I have a destiny.  I believe people don't meet each other by accident and that everyone has a lesson to be taught.  Many things go through my mind when given this question, but when relating to currently, my answer is changed. Currently, I am here, sitting down typing this Reflective Journal #1 to reflect on why I am here and to be able to learn physics in order - to continue - to pursue my degree. During this journey, to my destiny, I hope to achieve personal success and true happiness."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1798,"I think that’s a difficult question. In the purest sense, I am here for absolutely no reason: there is no real reason why I, out of millions of possible people, was born, no reason why my life has happened the way it has up til now. I think that trying to explain why things happen is futile, and since they’ve already happened, the best we can do is to roll with it and try to make better decisions for the future. However, in a less philosophical context: I am here for a number of reasons. I am here in this classroom because I am in this physics class, I am here in this physics class because it is required for my major, I am here in my major because I wanted to try something new, I am here trying something new because I don’t know what I want to do with my life, I am here not knowing what to do with my life because… I’m not really sure on that one. I am here at SFSU because it is close to home and not as expensive as my previous university, and because this is a new place, it doesn’t come with as many bad memories and routines. I still sort of want to go back, but I can’t. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1799,"""Why am I here?""I am here because one day I looked around and noticed that there was not one persons life whose I wanted or aspired to one day reach. I wanted to break a cycle in my family and be the first to attend college and graduate. I am here because I promised that and much more to my parents and family. Being the first person of the family to leave home to chase my goals and become independent has brought much attention and I know now that the younger generations of my family look up to me. I am here because I am being watched by my younger brother and nephews and I want them to want to be better than me and start a new cycle that the future generations will become inspired from. Lastly, I am here to answer the questions to my family that they never got answers for and I will be the help my brother and nephews will need at the right time. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1800,I’m here at school because I really want to get a degree in order to go to medical school and be able to work in or own a medical spa. My goal is to become a doctor and open a medical spa that specializes in cool sculpting and skincare. I'm here in physics because its a fundamental basis to understanding other sciences and although I'm not completely interested in physics I'm fascinated by things in physics because I feel like understanding physics helps with other things in life. I'm happy to be in this class and will try my best to understand and excel in learning physics. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1801,"The question ""Why am I here?"" is very broad, and for that reason, I will connect it to why I am in your class. I am in your class because it is a checkpoint to my major goal in life: to become a dermatologist. To become a dermatologist, I have to graduate from SF State with a Biology degree. For me to do that, I must take Physics 111, 112. I believe that this is a chapter in my life that I am unlocking as each day goes by. Physics is not my best subject, and I am willing to admit that. But by being here and learning will make me stronger and more intellectual in every way possible. I am here to pass this class and get closer to becoming a Dermatologist one day."
