2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1651,"When I consider this question I realize I have so many resources to support me. First of all, I have stable housing, access to food and clean water, access to safety. I also have the support of my friends and family. I have people who value me and care about my well-being. I also have natural resources, like access to outdoor spaces to learn about and interact with nature. I also have the support offered by being a student here at SFSU like mental health support, the library, peers in my classes, professors. I feel so lucky to have these supports and realize that not everyone does. It is a privilege for me to even pursue a college degree and am lucky enough to have rent control in a city such as San Francisco which allows me to do so and be able to work less while doing it to better focus on my studies and hopefully retain the information I am being exposed to. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1645,"I feel as though I have a variety of resources to support me. Firstly, it's nice to know that I'll always have both my friends and family to support whatever goals I choose to pursue, whether they be personal or academic/career goals. Next, I appreciate the organizations that I am a part of on-campus for continuously supporting and guiding me as well. For example, I am a part of a pre-health fraternity on campus called Delta Epsilon Mu and, since all of the members are like-minded individuals pursuing similar careers as me, it brings me a lot more peace of mind knowing that I can always go to them if I'm stuck or need further assistance on anything."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1642,"Some resources I have to support me are SFSU programs in which support me academically. Those programs are EOP and METRO in which have supported me financially as well as academically by providing tutoring and advising. I am glad to be part of those programs because I do not think I would had been able to navigate all of the universities requirements on my own. Also, METRO has supported me by having their own classes only for METRO students, that fulfill some GE undergrad requirements. Without them, I would have had more stress on my plate trying to figure out which classes to take and also trying to save my spot in a class. I have learned so much and now as a 3rd year, I do not feel as stressed in the sense of having to navigate classes because I was guided and it has saved me so much time. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1649,"I have personal, academic, and professional help to support me. At school, I am in a group with other physics students in PHYS111 and we share notes and hints on how to solve homework problems. I could always fall back on my therapist who helps me understand that life has its ups and downs and that we do not know we are happy if we never experience the low times. I can depend on my mom to release some of my stress about classes I struggle with but at the same time, I also have tutoring and office hours available to me at school. I find it hard to share my vulnerable and relying on others and others reaffirm me that I am doing a goo job by reaching out and identifying the problems and taking steps to solve them."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1654,"As a college student, having access to resources is very useful in order for me to be successful and be able to manage my way throughout college during undergrad here at SF state. The main resource I always make sure to use is taking advantage of speaking with my academic advisor. I remember during my first-year online at SF state, I was so stressed trying to multi-manage everything (e.g. class schedules, registration, etc.). In addition, I have a few mentors from the Biology Department (former SF State alumni, including some of my own family members) who are very helpful especially when it comes to any career related questions or concerns I might have. Now of course, there are the main campus resources too, some I have used before and others not so much as for the moment. Finally, the most important resources of all are my professors and instructors, now it's easier to communicate with them and I especially think having office hours is another great way to gain additional help or insight outside of lecture. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,684,"Sorry for a late submission I had no idea this was do but I will complete it! I like to think I have a lot of resources and I try to make new ones everywhere I go because you never know how and who can help you when and where. For school I have a great support system and resources because of family, like my amazing sister who graduated from cal and just got accepted to medical school. I also have a cousin who just graduated from Harvard and is soon to be attending medical school as well. I also have about 4 cousins who are all in pharmacy school, I have such a huge family but I love how we’re all interested in school and we all do amazing things and are able to happily help each other whenever anyone needs anything."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1644,"Luckily, I have lots of resources to support me. I have my friends, family, and my coworkers to support me through difficult times. Also, my instructors and SFSU advisors are very supportive, accommodating, and ready to assist me during hard times. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1647,"I have a good emotional support system like my family and boyfriend when things get rough for me emotionally. My professors are all very accommodating and understanding. I think at the end of the day, all teachers want their students to succeed in SFSU and try to create an environment for them where it is possible to do so. Furthermore I have the privilege of having a good internet connection and access to various tech to get homework and projects done in a timely manner."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1643,"This semester, a lot of my professors have made themselves really available to help support their students which is something I'm super grateful for. As this crazy time in history is happening to all of us simultaneously and collectively, I think professors are feeling the same drain and exhaustion as students and are realizing that this might be the most opportune time to be as supportive as possible for their students, which is definitely a silver lining that's come out of going to school during the pandemic. This collective unfortunate experience that we're all enduring has turned our school into a system of support and I could not be more appreciative. Big thanks to all the wonderful professors who are actively working to make life easier for their students and to help us all make our mental, emotional, and spiritual health top priority :) "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1653,The only resources that I have that support me is what san Francisco provides for me. I don't have resources at home that support me with school work. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1650,The resource in which I have to support me would be my family and friends. They are really considerate about my education and are always there whenever I need help or feel stressed out about anything. I mean other terms in which resources would be available would be like going into counseling and being able to seek help on things in which I don't understand or really need help on. My parents are really the ones who tend to be the most supportive in my learning environment and are always there if I am in a harsh condition or need help with anything. My sister is also a good push when it comes to education because she wants to make sure that I have enough income for me to survive and that I become successful in my life rather than having to struggle and live on the streets. Something in which I have learned one thing in life is being able to stand on your own feet this is because no one in life is really going to support you and you really need to be able to learn to live on your own. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1652,"I have noticed that in the every beginning of being a college student, I was always grateful for the resources that the students in general would receive. Wether that was grants, free tutoring, scholarships, access to wifi, anything essential that a college student would need to 'survive' college. I always tried to take advantage of that. Later after socializing myself with new people, I was starting to realize that the most important 'resources' a person can get and connect themselves with is, people. You begin to surround yourself with who you think is best for you. The emotional support is what keeps college students going. The connections that people make to get further into their career goal. To further themselves in life and make something out of nothing. It's other people that influence the people and it sticks to them.   "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1646,"For me, I think my classmate is one of the important resources to support me on classwork and homework. Sometimes we tend to be afraid to stand up and ask the instructor questions. Classmates can be very helpful. We can discuss the question first and try to figure out the answer first. If it really stuck on the question, then we can approach the instructor for questions. I personally find this really helpful. "
