2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1643,"Of course graduating with a degree in ecology is a goal of mine but I guess what's more important is what I want to do with that degree. Basically I want to be able to rehabilitate ecosystems that have been degraded and damaged by human intervention and/or climate change through the use of plant plants and the understanding of how things cooperate in an ecosystem. This class helps me achieve that in the sense that it's a requirement for me to complete this course in order to graduate but physics gives me a basic understanding of why and how things happen in the world around us. So far, it's helped me understand how vectors work, including how basic things like velocity acceleration affect us in our everyday lives which I think is important for anyone. And since physics can be notoriously complicated, this class is also making me think and awakens my mind which helps me in all of my classes and helps me do better overall. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1644,"Hello,I am in this class to fulfill the lab requirement for Physics 1. I took Physics 1 in my first year of university and I enjoyed learning the material. I believe that my knowledge from physics 1 would be helpful to complete the labs. Moreover, taking this lab is going to refresh my memory of the previous material. In general, I like taking physics classes since it is very helpful to understand the world around me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1645,"My goals are to figure out exactly what it is I want to pursue in the future, whether it be a physician's associate or a doctor. I know I want to pursue something revolving around the brain, behavior, and emotions so as long as I do something similar to that, I'll be happy with it. This class helps me achieve these goals since it is a prerequisite."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,684,"I love when I'm asked the question, ""Why am I here?"" because I come up with so many different ideas. I'm here for myself, I'm here to do the best I can with what I have in order to do my very best in everything I am doing and to succeed. I'm a first generation college student in my family so I try my best to make sure I get what I have to get done to make not only myself proud, but also my friends and my family. I'm also here to pursue my dreams that I have for myself in earning my bachelors degree here at sfsu in order to then be able to apply and attend pharmacy school in the future. So I do ask myself this every time I ever start to doubt my abilities in succeeding in school because it's a type of motivation for me reminding myself why I'm here and what I'm doing it all for."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1646,I think attending lab is very important for me to have a better understanding of the class material and connect the materials to different activities. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1647,"""Why am I here?""I am here because Physics, as well as Biology and Chemistry are the building blocks of my Microbiology degree. It's essential for me to know and remember at least the basics of these subjects in order to be successful in a career that relates to my major. Out of all the subjects I have to take, Physics is probably the scariest one of them all for me because I have no prior experience. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1648,"My immediate goals are to complete all the classes that are required of my biology major. While I signed up for this class since it was a major requirement, I am hoping that the class helps me broaden my knowledge of other science fields besides biology and chemistry. I think this will help me decide whether or not I want to follow my plan of entering the field of medicine. I am currently following a plan to become either a nurse practitioner while also looking into orthodontistry and biomechanical engineering. I have always loved working with my hands, and I am hoping that this class helps me in the decision of which path to follow."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1649,"I am here because many coincidences led me to be born. The big bang must happen, Earth must be a habitable place, genetic coding such as RNA must be formed, humans need to evolve and survive. It has led me to where I am now. The purpose of me being alive is simple: To live happily and experience the ups and downs of being only human. We have to pursue happiness because our time is limited and to do that, we have to work and communicate together effectively."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1650,"My goal for this class is to mainly pass the physics course with an A however, I am new to this subject matter and it is making me have a more difficult time being able to learn the concept and objectives. This class is helping me achieve my goals by being able to collect notes and being able to take down concepts such as being able to learn physics little by little. However, I am also struggling with the homework assignments because at times it can be overwhelming when not being able to know the material. Sometimes I feel that there is no moral support to do homework because I am at times stuck on concepts but however, I believe that if some of our homework can be completed in lab then it would feel easier to complete tasks. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,708,"I am here to learn more about physics. In high school I was not the biggest fan of physics due to my teacher and her way of teaching, but I have enjoyed it in college so far. I also want to learn about why the way things work out the way that they do. I love learning about the why and the how things turn out the way they do. Overall, I know physics requires a lot of dedication and determination as it is not the easiest class to take, so I know it'll challenge me as an individual and push me to strive for the best. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1651,"I am here to try and solidify concepts that I am currently learning in physics. This week in lecture we started projectile motion and I feel a little overwhelmed with all the aspects to consider for these problems. More practice can never hurt and I'm hoping it will only get easier the more problems I do. I am hoping that my trigonometry skills don’t throw me off with this topic, but it is all kind of coming back to me. A cool thing about projectile motion is that I can think of many real-life examples, but it is strange to think of things in separate x and y components. I think trying to visualize these components while I am in the real world may also help me understand the topic better so I am going to try and think about it outside of doing problems and see if that helps as well. Now that I look at the lab assignment for today it looks like we are looking at acceleration in 1-D, so that should be a good review."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1652,"I have several goals that I would love to achieve throughout my life. It has to do with personal growth goals, academic goals and even mental health goals. I want to be able to control my anger and not put it all towards my younger siblings because I know it’s not their fault that I’m so angry. I want to graduate college and not just because it’s what my parents want me to do but because it’s something that I want to accomplish. I want to be able to find a job after all the years of schooling because I know it’s going to be something that I am passionate about and get me through this life. I do question if this course is helping me accomplish all these goals. I’d like to believe that it’s a small step in helping me accomplish my goals. Maybe not all goals but at least the important ones. Without taking this class, I wouldn’t know how the world functions and it’s important to know how the world that I live in works. I have to pass this class in order to move on with my credits and graduate. Which is one of my goals, this class helps me with the career that I want to pursue"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1653,"I am here because this class is a requirement to my major. Besides that, I always thought physics was an interesting  and fun subject whenever you get past the headaches of trying to understand that concepts."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,6,"I am in this class/lab because it is a required lab that I need to take as part of my major. I am in Phys 112 because unfortunately I started my required major courses very late and have now fallen a bit behind, when I probably would have been close to finishing by now."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1654,"My goals this semester specifically for this class is to gain a better understanding of physics and be able to apply the concepts and material in lab as well as be able to identify the types of forces and also be able to demonstrate it in my work. Aside from this class, this semester my goals are to get good grades in each of my classes and remember the material. This class helps me achieve my goals by applying what I already know as well as improving my understanding so I can learn. Sometimes I will make mistakes and that's all part of the learning process, it takes a few tries to understand the material but with a little dedication and perseverance I believe I can get through this class and this semester. Also working with my peers and working together in breakouts rooms can help me get to know my classmates more and also be able to collaborate on the concepts we learn in class."
