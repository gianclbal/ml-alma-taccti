2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,684,"The values of my community and family helped me navigate through man things throughout my life such as college. I love when my people let me know when I'm wrong or when they try to give me knowledge that I can use and benefit from it in life. I feel like Im the best person I can be at the moment, I try to do everything I can to be successful in school which always my top priority because I have come so far with it I want to make sure I finish hard. I recently watched the show suits and it made me realize that while watching this show I fell in love with the show. It was so great, it was about a law firm full of lawyers who were basically family and fought day to day with others as lawyers trying to win cases. It made me think about if I wanted to ever be a lawyer and I considered it but only after pharmacy school. I felt like that was crazy to me because I have been talking about wanting to become a pharmacist since I was in elementary school believe it or not. This was the first time I have ever questioned it with something else. While I was going through a fake mid life crisis about my choice of careers, I went to my friends and family to help me with it. Then they gave me advice and I took everyones and compared and thought about what I thought and now I set myself straight. "

2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1654,"Managing my way through college with the values of my family and friends have helped me immensely when it comes to my overall state of mind. Although its different for every student, in my opinion its so important having a strong support system to lean on when you need an extra reminder of advice, having someone to talk to and be there for you when things get tough. One main important figure throughout this whole semester has been my mom and my cousin a.k.a my big sister, these two important female characters have helped me move through college feeling supported and loved. I remember whenever I need someone to talk to after a long day or even on the weekends when I am piled up with tons of homework or assignments, they always reassure me that no matter what's going on, I am never alone. At the same time, when I am not busy we all get together and do something to get my mind of of school work and just focus on life. Meanwhile, my best friend, Dariana has also been a big support system for me, since we are both medical/healthcare majors and are both sophomores it is easy to find some common ground due to our similar interests and having both shared similar experiences during this semester of college. Also, although I don't say this much, I am also grateful to have such great professors this semester, there have been sometimes where I would come to office hours or ask for an extension because I have so much on my plate and my professors really care for their students including myself and really know when to ease the load for their students but also provide the mental and academic support we need. Finally, another source I've relied on a lot this semester are study groups, they really make me feel comfortable studying and preparing for my exams, etc."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1644,"The values of my community and especially my family have taught me patience. I learned that with hard work, anything is possible. I also learned that spending quality time with loved ones and opening up about your feelings can make the process smother and easier. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1650,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college would be by being able to help me focus on what my potential is. My family is the one who has really been supportive throughout my learning and always wants me to succeed and be beneficial in life. They have always kept encouraging me to make sure that that I keep studying and never lack any potential. Their positivity is what drives me to do better each day and thrive for a better future. My community really does not have a say, but I can say that people really need scientists and people in technology for the future because this is the way in which most jobs are really looking to grow and tend to receive more opportunities each day. My parents also show that the importance happens when it comes to science in technology especially when it comes to women it is important to have both kinds of skills so that they can be successful in the future.  "
