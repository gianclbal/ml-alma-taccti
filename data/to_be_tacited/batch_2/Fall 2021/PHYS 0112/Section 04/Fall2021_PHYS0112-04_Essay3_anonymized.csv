2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1645,"When life gets challenging, I like to take time for myself. As simple as it is, I feel like spending quality time with either myself or those who are close to me really helps me out. Especially when it comes to being around my close friends, they really have their own way of bringing my mood back up and/or holding me accountable so I really appreciate that. Along with all of that, even just cooking new food through recipes I've just discovered, binge-watching new shows, or going to the movie theaters to see a new movie really improves my mood too."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1642,When life gets challenging at time I will just cry to relieve the stress and pain. Once I am done I sit back and reflect where I went wrong and what I could've done better. I then prepare for a future situation by thinking how can I apply what I learned from this situation. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1654,"When life gets challenging or when I feel down and unmotivated I would usually do a variety of things. One, I like to journal and reflect on my inner thoughts in a way it feels like my worries are being released from my consciousness or psyche and I can transfer it onto the paper. Doing this also helps me let go and detach. Other ways I like to destress or find my way through a difficult time is by reading, baking, listening to soothing music like classical or lo-fi music as well as meditating, taking a bath or working out. One thing I like to keep in mind during difficult times is that no matter what I may be experiencing will pass my by, meaning everything at the moment is temporary. Also, sometimes listening to TED talks or podcasts helps re-motivate or inspire me to keep going. On the other hand, if I'm feeling super down or out of the blue I like to watch movies specifically animated Disney movies or even kids T.V. shows to make me smile/laugh or feel happy."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1646,"When life gets challenging, I will stop and think of the problems. What are the problems that makes thing challenging and what are the possible way to solve it? "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1647,"I used to just give up and let the challenging things pile up. I realized that by doing that, I was letting a lot of good opportunities pass by me. I know personally, (and I know many other people do as well) that it is so difficult (mentally and physically) to push through when life gets challenging but I just remind myself that there is always something to be gained from finishing a challenge. You only have limited time in this world and I've learned that gaining coping mechanisms to overcome challenges will help you feel like you're not wasting time.   "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1644,"When life gets challenging, I sit down and write down my challenges. Then I try to find a solution to fix those problems or find ways to ease my challenge. I also remind myself that it is ok to feel stressed out and overwhelmed. Sometimes I can't find a solution because my challenge is not something that I can control. Therefore, I always remind myself to only worry about things that are within my control. Speaking to loved ones and asking for advice has also been very helpful. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1649,"When life gets challenging, I would fall back on myself and remember all the times I doubted myself but still took on something more difficult an succeeded. I know I could always talk to my therapist and she has helped me get through the most difficult times in my life. She helped me understand that everything will be ok even thought it feels as if the sky is falling down on me and to regularly take walks to relax."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1648,"When life gets challenging, I try to focus on the positives in my life. This helps me feel better in the short term, but I often find myself more stressed in the long run when the challenges arise again. Personally, I do not like asking for help as it feels like I am burdening other people with my problems. However, I am getting better at opening to my close friends and family, and I have been developing better problem solving and coping methods. Most of my problems, like most college students, comes from the college classes themselves. With all the homework deadlines, exams, and projects, it is easy to get caught up in the torrent of school work. I have learned that if I find myself in this position, it is best to step away for a little bit. Once I separate myself from the immediate stress, I am better able to look at the work overall and begin to formulate a plan to take it down piece by piece."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1652,"When I start to realize that whatever I am going through and life starts to get hard, then I simply breathe. Sounds cliche but it’s true, I step away, take a step back for a while, gather my thoughts and go over with myself on why I feel it is getting hard. Is it something that I can control? Can not control? Was it a reaction that I was expecting to happen? Is it my fault, my actions that caused this? And how can I fix this. It’s not easy to admit that you need help, for me personally it used to be really hard to admit that I was struggling. Not necessarily admit that I was wrong but that I needed help to begin with. So I learned to ask for help when I feel like life is too much. Sometimes things start to happen all at once and I start to feel like I have no control or order so I, little by little, start to tackle the smallest things."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,684,When life gets hard I do as I am doing now work hard and pray for the best. Throughout my college experience I realized after time flew by how I kind of messed things up by not taking physics my second year like others usually do instead I left it for my senior year which is now causing me so much stress because of all the other challenging classes I am taking. And now Im going to have an even more challenging semester spring which is really making me scared but I wont let it intimidate me because I feel like I have already come so far and I literally see the finishing line. When life gets tough I like to manage my time better to show myself theres nothing I cant handle. I focus on what matters and I go handle business and take care of everything in the order it was received in.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1651,"When life gets challenging I try to remember to slow down and focus on the things that matter. It's really important to keep self care in mind because being healthy mentally and physically will help make challenging times much easier to cope with. Even when I am stressed and say....have MIDTERMS coming up, I still try to make a point of doing things for myself. No matter where I am with studying each day I always try to take a break in the evening to go for a walk and call my mom to catch up. This takes care of two important things at one time and also benefits me mentally because I can take a break from studying and think about other things I care about. It also gives me a break physically from sitting in front of a computer for so many hours a day. Also things as simple as making myself a good meal every now and then as opposed to eating out or heating something up out of the freezer help me to feel like I'm taking care of myself more. And getting enough sleep! Sleep is so important."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1653,"When life gets challenging I tend to freak out at first. But overall it depends on the challenge. If its school work, I panic. I realized though if it has to do with something that is hands on like work, Ill strive to overcome the stress."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1643,"Lol what an aptly timed reflection, this past week and a half has been so unnecessarily chaotic I can't wait for everything to just mellow out. But when life gets challenging, I always remind myself to slow down and not worry about things too much. Even if something is important, like midterms or all my school assignments or doing a good job at work, it's not worth draining my soul and stressing my body. Everything will always turn out okay and it's important to remind ourselves of that. Sometimes as students, we feel like how we do in school is like life and death; like if we fail an exam, our world can come crashing down. But if we fail, that's okay, it's not the end of the world. It's an opportunity to learn more which is what being a student is all about. Just pick yourself up and keep moving forward to be your best self. Life can be hard sometimes definitely, but that's just part of life, it's not all of life. Just take a breath, remember that no matter what, everything will be okay, and keep moving forward to be your best self. I feel better now, thank you for assigning this :)"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1650,"When life gets challenging I usually like to go out for walks or sometimes like to go to the beach in order to get fresh air. Usually, when things get rough I like to keep a schedule and have my things be prioritized before anything since workload tends to be high and sometimes it can be stressful. Music at times is something that makes me calm down during stressful situations. Usually, if I do challenging things and listen to music then it tends to give me peace of mind that way things don't get too overwhelming. My life this semester is a bit too overwhelming because of the amount of workload in which I have and the number of units in which I am taking this semester. My life is currently bust always having to work 24 hours each time. This is because of handling the business having to attend lab and lectures and also having a bunch of homework to complete at the time being. "
