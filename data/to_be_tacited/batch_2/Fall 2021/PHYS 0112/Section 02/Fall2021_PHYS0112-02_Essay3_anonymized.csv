2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1640,"“What do I do when life gets challenging ?” When life gets challenging, sometimes I’m not exactly sure how to react. I may feel like everyone and everything is out to get me. This often makes me feel bad for myself. If I ever react that way I try to correct it immediately. Instead I try to understand the challenges, and see how exactly I can conquer them or just get through them. When I’m going through something I tend to isolate myself because being emotional and complaining is not often socially acceptable for men. Once I am able to cool down, take some time to myself, and evaluate the situation, I am able to deal with the challenges I am facing.  Life has presented me with a variety of challenges from my household, friends, and school. Going through and understanding how to push yourself through difficult times builds your character and makes you who you are."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1614,"For me when life gets challenging, whether it be my school work or I don’t know how to do something. I take a short break and then come back to it later. I find that after my break, most of the time I am able to figure out what to do. For example, when I’m trying to figure out a physics problem, i’ll attempt the problem but if i get stuck i’ll step back, take a break from it, and then try again.  But sometimes my approach backfires on me because I tend to take very long breaks and then the next thing you know the due date is near and I feel like i’m pressed for time. However when I don’t take long breaks, it works wonders for me and I feel really good about myself when I realize how to do something. To dilute my ramble, be patient because patience is a virtue. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1623,"What I do when life gets challenging is I force myself to take a step back for a moment from the problem that is making my life challenging and taking the time to reflect on how and why it became challenging. I am a person who is huge on self reflection and a person who is in their own head a lot so taking time and gaining that space to take a step back and breathe is very much needed especially when life suddenly becomes hard. Some things that I turn to when I find myself in such situations are listening to music, gaming with my friends or reading. I find that listening to my favorite artists or something as simple as discovering new music are ways that are able to clear my mind and get me back on track to deal with life when it becomes hard. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1617,When life gets challenging I like to take some time to myself. I like to do things that I enjoy and take some much needed alone time. I’ll do things like exercise or take a drive.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1633,When life gets challenging I try and focus on what I can control instead of stressing on the outer things that I have no control over and try and succeed in overcoming what I am facing. I also try and get the help from friends and family. especially the ones who may have already experienced what I am going threw. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1641,"I think typically when life gets challenging one can either raise to the occasion or fall back and give up. Honestly, throughout a lot of my academic career, I have tended to give up and try again later. Since transferring to SF State I have been trying to not do that and regain control. I have learned that it is ok to go through challenges as long as you adapt and improve. So far I have been taking control by trying to be more organized and keep track of all my assignments on a planner which has helped me not forget to turn in assignments anymore. Another way I try to overcome challenges is by trying to be more optimistic and not letting a bad grade or missed assignment discourage me from putting effort into new assignments but rather encourage me to try harder next time to make up for it. I use to have I think more of a pessimistic view and I would let missing assignment and bad grades make me think that there was no use in trying anymore as I already failing but having an optimistic view and not letting one failure define your potential success in a class has really helped me overcome challenging times."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1636,"When life gets challenging it's difficult for me to not throw my hands in the air, call it a day, and just have a pity party. To stray away from this, I like to take a second and refocus myself to be able to prioritize my goals. I also like to acknowledge what’s challenging me and not invalidate it, but instead work through it. When I feel like just giving in, I remind myself that I have too much counting on my success. Growing up a first-generation student, I don’t have the luxury to succumb to whatever may be challenging. I have to fight and persevere, and it's so exhausting sometimes. But what’s the alternative...mediocrity? I will never be such a thing. I challenge whatever is challenging me, with my persistence, my relentlessness, my ambition, my anger, my hunger."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1634,"When things get difficult in my life, my response depends on the situation. Often it is advantageous to ask for help from a teacher or fellow student. During former semesters I have exchanged phone numbers with students and participated in study groups; Zoom class makes this difficult because nobody wants to turn on their camera or interact during the lab section. In addition to other students not wanting to interact, I have a tendency to work very slowly and I almost always fall behind my lab partners; because of this, group work often ends up becoming solo work (as I get left behind). Asking my partners to slow down seems unfair, so the alternative is to quietly fall behind. Alternatively, I could attempt to keep up by relying on my partners for answers, but that also doesn't feel right; I have also been given wrong answers before. For this reason, I have not exchanged phone numbers with other students from this class.Another strategy that I use in his office hours. I have not done so for this laboratory however I routinely do so for my general physics lecture class.Another tactic that is useful is strategizing ahead of time, if I know a challenging time is approaching. Even so, just because something is planned out does not mean it will be executed adequately. At times I get stuck on one difficult assignment and neglect other assignments; these smaller assignments build up and present a challenge."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1622,"I've always struggled with intrinsically helping myself to overcome feelings of stress when things get challenging. It has been hard, but I believe that over the course of the pandemic, I was forced ( for a good reason) to change this about myself. There was so much change and chaos going on around me that I had to learn how to take care of myself on a deeper level. I didn't realize until recently how much I was being impacted by the small things around me. I now practice self-care activities, and by decreasing my stress levels, I feel more confident in my ability to tackle hard situations. The best thing I've learned when handling stressful situations is to just approach it head-on, and not shy away from handling it. I feel like it's kind of a no-brainer that someone should just handle stressful events immediately, like studying for an exam, fixing classes by talking to a counselor, or talking with a professor about a bad grade, instead of letting it sit and stressing them out. However, I have done that forever and it's been really hard to change over the years. But again, I feel like the quarantine gave me that opportunity to change. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1616,"When life gets challenging, I like to take a step back and take a short break from everything. I will try to take a nap, or perhaps get something delicious to eat. I feel that by taking a quick break, it helps me to recharge and clear my head so I can properly plan what to do next. If I’m having problems in school, I like to plan out my week with what I need to get done to understand the material instead of trying to do it in one day. This way it gives me more time to ask more questions or seek help from others. If I’m having personal problems, or am feeling stressed from work, I like to cook or bake to help me relax. It’s something about the process of cooking a good meal that helps me to unwind and I love to see the smiles on people’s faces when they’re enjoying my food. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1628,"What do I do when life gets challenging? I cry. I cry and cry, and cry a lot. Crying helps me feel better. After crying, I face the mirror, then cry more. Of course, first of all, I stop whatever I am doing. I pray to God, sing praise and worship songs. Then I let it out by crying. I look at the mirror and remind myself of God's promises that are written in the bible. Not just think of it, but actually say the verses out loud in front of the mirror. I also talk to my leaders, best friend, and fiance about it. After crying and stuff, I treat myself with good food and spa treatment like pampering myself. Then, I go back to my challenge/problem and start to really think of a solution. I think of a solution, write it down, and do it. I have been through many challenges in life, and these are by far the most effective way to overcome them."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1638,"When life gets challenging I either eat candy (when I'm sad), run when I'm mad or sad, or I eat food to wallow in my feelings. I also started talked to people more when I'm sad because I'm very passive aggressive because I grew up keeping things to myself and not reaching out to people because I noticed when I need them the most they're not their for me so I just stopped. I also try not to get myself into challenging positions because I'm a magnet for negative things in my life. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1619,"When life gets challenging, I either don't do anything and just let the world keep spinning and tell myself “it is what it is”, or I do plenty of things out of stress, I guess it all depends on the situation. For example, this past year and a half it’s been pretty challenging for me to adapt to online school all thanks to the pandemic, this year has been the worst so far. What I mean by that is that it's just been super stressful and I’ve had a really hard time with my classes. The classes I am currently taking aren't even the ones I wanted to take to begin with. I have the classes I have today because I wasn’t vaccinated and they dropped the other classes that I wanted to take and so I just had to look for classes to fill in the spots of my other classes that were dropped and that was super challenging. It was super overwhelming and I started to freak out because I don’t want to be behind. Literally, all of my classes have been really challenging for me and I would be behind and that would stress me out. At some point during this semester, it got super challenging that I just gave up and just told myself that it doesn’t matter because I’m going to fail anyway, but then I have slowly realized that as long as I try my best then there’s not much I can do. I can literally just do my best and put in a lot of effort and that’s that. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,633,"When life gets challenging I like to focus on other things that will calm me and my mental state. For example, when I am stressed with something in particular or because of school assignments I like to play and listen to my favorite music artists. Listening to music allows me to relieve my stress and it also allows me to take a break from real life. I also like to play video games as I can usually take out my stress on a game and not on my self or the particular thing that is causing me to become stressed out."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1631,When life gets challenging I lean on my family and friends. I have a small group of friends that I can vent to and get anything off of my chest. I feel safe and like I have an outlet when I talk to people I trust. I even use music as an outlet and I also resort to working out when life gets challenging. I like to take my stress or anger out in the gym and get a solid workout in. I automatically feel better and like I can attack the rest of my day with a better mindset. I am constantly reminding myself that when I feel down or defeated that some people have it way worse than me and to try to be grateful for the blessings I have. I also enjoy being in the kitchen when things get hard. There is something therapeutic about cooking as it helps me get my mind off of things that feel like they consume me. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1625,"When life gets challenging sometimes, I like to take a quick breather from whatever has stumped me in the moment, this might be taking a break from school and relaxing for a bit, since school is basically my life still right now and for the next 2 and half years. I will either watch my favorite movie or listen to music or play a video game or even just scroll through my social media for a bit until I feel I can get back to my school work. If I can't take a break from whatever I am doing I would usually just take a quick moment to collect myself and push through whatever I am doing. Usually I do feel life gets challenging especially because of school, this year feels a bit more harder on me because I feel that online school is wearing me out and it's a bit more harder to keep up with my classes as well because I have a little this semester so I get lazier everyday and procrastinate even more as well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1630,"When life gets challenging, I get easily overwhelmed and anxious all the time. However, I take care of myself by focusing on my mental health. I do this by taking longer naps, taking breaks between studying, eat my favorite snack and take a day off from school/work. I also tend to watch my favorite Netflix shows when I take breaks to free some stress. When life gets challenging and I have trouble keeping up with assignments, I usually talk to my professors and let them know what’s going on. Just this week, I had to ask for an extension on an assignment for the very first time in my academic career. I was granted the extension and it released a lot of stress that I had this week. Furthermore, since my biology class has been getting challenging, I find myself going to tutoring when I have the chance to get a better understanding of concepts. Overall, when life gets challenging, I take care of my mental health and seek help in my academics if needed."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1632,"What do I do when life gets challenging?I think that when life gets challenging, I tend to stress a lot. In turn, when I stress, I choose to relax rather than work, which makes me even more lazy than I already am. Ever since the pandemic began, I’ve found that my motivation to do things that produce stress, such as school work, has gone down greatly, and I’m actually quite sad about it. I used to think that I was quite a studious person, but the pandemic has shown me otherwise.When life gets challenging, I like to do nothing. But I think that is my downfall, since I should instead be problem solving in order to make it less challenging. I would rather avoid my problems than face them, but I’m glad that I am able to acknowledge that this is a problem that I must work on. Problem-solving would overall just make my life less challenging and less stressful. I think that it is a long self-journey that I can continually work on to better myself as time goes on."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1627,This semester has been one of the most challenging semesters at SF state. This is not because the classes are hard but its mainly due to my poor time management skill and the drive to complete my work. I have been very distracted lately by too much entertainment. I recently moved Daily City so I am trying to manage living on my own as well as working and school. This has been challenging to maintain. One thing i need to do to get over this is by decreasing my entertainment time and focus more on school and work on my time management. I really need to set small goals to achieve and reward myself accordingly. That's the main thing to over come these challenges. I also want to work on some yoga to help with my stress and other mental problems. MY physical health has been ok but I want to work on that as well and maintain a good balance.  
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1618,"What do I do when life gets challenging?This week I learned in another class that every step matters and that even though they are small steps, it will still help you get to your goal. Through life, we will go through many things that will make things even more challenging, but this does not mean stopping. The challenges in my life have recently included challenges like hard work, busy scheduling, and just the struggle of going through a pandemic. Experiencing all of these challenges I have learned that things start to move really quickly and what I do when it gets too much for me is take a step back to care for my mental and physical health before I continue to start moving forward again. Some things I do on days where I take a day off, is stretch, hydrate, eat healthy and hearty meals, and spend some time outside. I love to move my body through dance and exercise so I would also focus on taking the time to do this for myself, besides teaching dance when I have to. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1613,"Now with this semester more than ever, I have found myself feeling very stressed, as I am taking on 7 classes with a part-time weekend job. I have found myself having to divide my time up between certain classes, omitting time from studying for one class to study for another. I find myself having less free time, as well as with less time to truly absorb the concepts. I find myself developing a vague understanding so I can tackle exams and assignments. When I get stressed, I find that dividing my time up daily, per hour, really helps my productivity. In some cases, either due to fatigue, feeling swamped, or perhaps both, I push back certain things I NEED to do and focus on things that are not urgent. Planning my weeks out on Friday night (for the following week) has really helped me during challenging points in the semester. Having an actual, written ""to-do"" list really helps as well. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1626,"Most people have probably experienced major life, work, financial, family, emotional changes in the past few months. These days, many people require flexibility, adapting to new standards of life. But the reality is, even in the face of fundamental changes in lifestyle, some principles hold true even in difficult times. The human brain is the easiest to adapt to. If people can find those principles to deal with chaos, they will not be burdened by impulses or passivity, because life is a good teacher. With my own experience, I realized there are a few things that can help me become better and ready to face my challenges. First, it's confidence. it's really hard for our self to gain confidence in the face of difficulties and we don't know the consequences in advance. Therefore, confidence in power is very important to help us overcome challenges. when we are confident, it motivates us to step forward and bravely to resist and tackle challenges. Second, it's effort. we must always be determined and try to take on the challenges so that we can gain more experience. it may be a failure but if we try we can train and improve ourselves to create a more complete selves. Those are the two things that I always prepare myself for before making a goal. I must always give myself confidence that I will succeed and create my best efforts to achieve the goal that I desire."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1635,"When life gets challenging, I tend to find myself in a funk for a good amount of time. I used to be a more optimistic person but now I find myself having a hard time staying positive. Of course, life doesn’t stop when you’re feeling low. I have a lot of responsibilities that I need to handle everyday, whether its school, work, taking care of my dog, cleaning, and if I’m in a bad mood then it just makes living feel far more dreadful. Some things I like to do to lift my mood is go for a walk, watch my favorite shows, retail therapy, or spending time with my favorite people. With every challenging thing I’ve been through in my life I have found that time has healed almost everything for me. So whenever I am going through something challenging I male sure to remind myself that this rough patch isn’t going to last forever. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1620,"Life can get challenging especially when you do not have a blueprint of what you should and should not do. As one gets older, there are many shifts that occur in life; you get a job, get in a relationship, have kids, you need to clean attend to your family, worry about your job , house and tasks, etc. What should one do to balance their life out and not become overwhelmed? They should breath and realize their self worth; they should realize their importance to try and gather their thoughts and get some alone time or surround themselves with people they love or with people that bring out the best of them. This time during the semester, everything can start to pile up; on one hand you have your life and  assignments and homework and on the other hand you have your body telling you to relax and it is almost break time; you develop maybe a lazy side or an anxious side and become even more stressed. At that moment take a day off in my opinion, because mental health is so important. I now do that because when I am overwhelmed I cannot think and even cry so it has gotten to the point where when I give myself a day off I become refreshed and eager to do my work the following day. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1624,"Reflective Journal 3   During this point in the semester, it has begun to start to get challenging. Not with this course but with other courses as well. The best type of help is the help from others is best. For some time now the classes are becoming difficult in the terms of being online fully at times it seems there is a disconnect with the students to one another. So, although the challenges of the pandemic has led to online courses it has been barrable with the help of online resources. At times the tutoring center sometimes feels short sighted because for its mostly students teaching students through a zoom call. It is hard to get on track right away so you can get to the studying and help. Ultimately the best help would be online at the moment but it is hard to convey message properly even though the devices used are the best to try to get the full interaction."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1629,"“What do I do when life gets challenging?”, well this is honestly a great question to ask someone that may be dealing with something difficult in their lives. As for myself, I have currently been feeling a bit off, more than I normally do, and something that I have found myself doing when I tend to feel this way, or feel more stressed out about what I am doing with my life or what I am doing in life, is to clean I really enjoy cleaning when I feel that my life is getting a bit challenging, this may be because I feel that cleaning is a form of therapy for myself and it allows me to destress on whatever stress or challenging issues I may be going through in life. I also enjoy being outside where I can receive some form of sunlight since it gives me more energy and it makes me feel happy as if I am receiving a huge hug from the sun, which is really great. Another thing that I enjoy doing is reading self-help books. They really boost my vibration and make me feel a lot better. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1637,"I'm probably the worst person to get advice from when it comes to what to do when life gets challenging. 90% of the times, I go through many difference phases and I must go through these phases every time when life gets hard. First is the stage of denial. I tend to ignore the problem, until it gets really bad. For example, I purposely do not check how much money I have in my bank when I know I don't have much money. If I were to get a ticket, I would ignore that ticket for a while until the payment is literally due (I just remembered that I have to pay for a ticket). Then I get sad and depressed for days because I feel like my life is such a mess and I mentally can't get myself to do anything productive. After this stage, I start thinking to myself and comfort myself by saying ""it already happened, what can I do now?"" I was depressed for months because I couldn't get into a nursing program. But what can I do? I can get a degree in biology, that's what I will do. I would not recommend anyone to do the same, it's a terrible habit and I need better ways to deal with my problems."
