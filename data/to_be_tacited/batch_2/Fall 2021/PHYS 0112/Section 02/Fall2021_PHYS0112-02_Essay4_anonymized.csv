2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1624,"Reflective Journaling #4  The resources I have as a student is like a computer to someone who doesn’t know how to use or the very least understand how to turn on. Its only as good as the user in the terms of using its max potential. As a student there are almost every avenue of resources but if I do not know where to begin can be discouraging. Ultimately, I find the best resource is human interaction next to online help i.e the resources on ilearn or “google”. I find the best to use the professor as the resource although I am one of many trying to contact and it is always appreciated when there is a student-professor interaction that is as close as it can get rather it be in an email with a fast reply. Although students are many it can be still confusing trying to find the right direction to explain a concept. Many of the students are good help out each other but at times we all can be trying to figure out the same issue with no success.    "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1637,"It's the middle of the semester and everything is so hectic and topics are getting harder and harder. The topics are definitely frying my brain up but all my professors that I have this semester are so kind and helpful. My physics lecture professor offers help sessions, responds to emails regarding our homework with lots of details, and always make his students feel welcomed to ask him questions. My physics lab professor has a really nice and bubbly personality so I'm not scared or intimidated to ask her questions. She responded to emails really fast too when I needed help. My other classes are more a-synchronized so I don't get much help but I'm doing okay! I'm pretty sure that there are much more other resources available on campus that I'm not taking advantage of. I hope I will use them next semester when more of my classes are in person. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1627,These are some hard times for many people because virtual learning is not efficient for the classes I am taking this semester. I feel like I'm much more productive if the classes are in person. The resources I feel like are making a differences are my friends and my classmates. I have met some of the nicest people this year because everyone is very helpful and understanding. I feel like some of the profferser are understanding but some aren't. But friends are also very helpful because they have been through this all these classes before so they are very supportive and helpful. My coworkers are my friends so that makes it easy because they been through this process and understand what to takes to get to where they are. I am really looking forwards to this semester ending beuase i feel like i wasn't not as productive and i what a frest start. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1631,"The resources that I have to support me are widespread. I have the internet and media at my fingertips that can help me and guide me throughout life. I have podcasts, interviews, and the internet that can educate me on matters that I feel will support me and any struggles I face. I have my family and friends that I use as outlets for support. They help release my stress, give me advice, and can just be an unbiased listening ear when I need them to be. I have many resources at school that also support me. I have professors who are willing to listen. I have counselors who are trained professionals and I have books that can also support me when I want to be alone and in my own thoughts. I have mother nature that can also support me and make me appreciate life when times get tough. I have many resources that surround me even when it feels like I don’t. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1625,"The resources that I have to support me are my professors first, because my entire life at the moment revolves around school and my professor provide me with he support to be able to pass my classes with their office hours and being able to meet up with hem outside of class for help on concepts I do not understand. I have the school as well, SFSU and they provide me with multiple of resources that will help me strive and succeed, from health care to finding jobs and more. I also have my friends and family they provide me with help in understanding things I don't understand in life and my family helps me stay in school and go to college to be able to achieve academic excellence and find a career that I am passionate about and will last me till the day I retire. Other resources I have is myself because I rely on myself to keep reaching for my fullest potential so that I can achieve my goals and keep crossing off those goals on my list so that I can create a good life for myself and the people that I hold closest to my heart. Achieving those goals help me keep climbing up the ladder of life so that I could keep moving forward and graduating college is on that list and I am half way there by the end of this semester, hopefully all goes well by December. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1616,"What resources do I have to support me?I think I have many resources to support me. The first that comes to mind is the internet. There are many different websites I can go to, to teach me the material. One of my favorites is YouTube. I like hearing the subject taught in a different way to help me understand the concepts better. There is also khan academy. I believe they do a very thorough explanation of the material without it being too confusing. I also have my professors that I can ask questions to that can help me understand certain parts of the subject. And last but not least, there are tutoring services that can do a great job of walking me through the confusing parts of my courses. I have been tutored before and with the right tutor, it makes a big difference. Getting one on one help is very effective. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1613,"I have multiple resources that I can use to help me with the course. The primary source of information that helps me with the lab are the notes that I take during lecture; usually they are applicable to the content in the simulation and post-lab knowledge check. If the lecture notes do not help me, then I use the textbook assigned for the main lecture. I can usually find some information, either equations or context, that help me get a better understanding. There are also countless resources from the internet that can help me as well. There are YouTube videos, internet articles, and problem solving websites which are good practice to enhance my understanding. Most importantly, I really good resource is my fellow classmates. Working in groups has really helped me. Either I am explaining a concept to others which helps demonstrate that I understand the concept, or they provide me with insight into something I was not understanding clearly. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1632,"I consider my family, friends, and the school I attend to be the resources that can support me. I think depending on my family and friends to support me is a healthy way to find motivation to continue my work. I know that I can go to them to seek advice, find new opinions, and motivation for success. I consider the people around me to be my role models along with people that I can depend on for anything. For example, I think my oldest brother, who is eight years older than me, to be my biggest role model. I know that I am able to go to him for advice and support when I face certain troubles and am in need of help. Additionally, I think that SFSU can be a great resource to support me as there are constant emails about different resources on campus that are aimed to benefit my college career and possibly my future career. My classmates and professors are also a great resources to go to for help as I know that I can go to any of my classmates to ask for help. My professors are also always providing office hours or suggesting certain help groups that students can attend to search for support in their classes. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1622,"I have a lot of support that comes from my peers. They are experiencing what I am experiencing, and it is easy to reach out in class to ask questions, or even outside of class. I can count on the fact that a potential problem I have is being shared by at leats one other classmate, and we would be able to talk it through. Sometimes this method of trouble-shooting a problem is easier and more timley than waiting to hop into that professor's ofice hours. I also greatley appreciate the immense flexability of all of my professors this semester. I would have a lot more difficulty navigating my workload if i didn't have the kindness and understanding of my professors. On hard days, I never feel stress or pressure from my professors because of this. I also have other recources, like class TA's that have really made a difference. In some of my classes, they prepare exam study material and practice quizes. They provide just one more recource of practice and in-class support that has really aided my retention of information. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1628,"There are a lot of resources that I have to support me and my learning. One is the campus, associated student program, my DEM family, library, tutoring, gator groceries/basic needs, etc. My community and family values have helped me throughout college because of the support they have shown to me since the first day I started at SFSU. My family is helping my college years. My family is helping me by giving me the space I need to do my homework. My parents' words of affirmation are also helping me to keep going because they constantly remind me that I am doing things correctly and that they are happy about what I do. My community has been a lot more influential than my family because I am the only one in the family pursuing a STEM major seriously. My older sister graduated with a public health major, but she chose a different path after finishing college. My community, such as my friends outside my parents and siblings, are there always to help me complete my homework, motivate me, spend time with me, give me money when I don't have enough, and, more importantly, pray for me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1618,"Resources I have to support me include all of the tools in the student center to make sure I am taking all the classes I need to so that I can graduate. I can also use things like the degree progress planner, and the gator scheduler. A couple other resources include people like my tutor, my friends in other classes, and my teachers who continue to have open office hours for me to attend when I need extra help with an assignment. I also depend on group studies we have to support me in the success of individual classes. Other things I have for support that does not have much to do with school is the people and the programs I have going on at dance so that I have something other to focus on other than school. I also have a physical therapy clinic that I volunteer at which is something I enjoy. These two things are resources to take care of my mental health and are something I really enjoy! "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1638,The resources that I have to use for class and in general would be the school and my connections with people. I love to meet new people so I have new friends everyday. New people to learn from. I also have the advisors at the school and other faculty. I have my parents to fall back on as well when I need them and they are there for me. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1623,"Some resources that I have to support me school wise would be professors whether current or pass that I had before who are happy to help students in any questions or recommendations that may be helpful to the student. Resources that I have to support me outside of school would be people that are close to me such as my mom or my best friend when things become overwhelming in life it is very important that people have a support system they can lean on to help them get through that stress that they are dealing with. What I have came to discover is that having resources that support you doesn't always mean having a physical person there, it could mean simple things like having access to the internet which could provide at a lot of support to someone or listening to music which in my case provides me support by distressing what ever things get hard in my life.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1639,“What Resources Do I Have to Support Me?” I would say that office hours and zoom meetings are resources that can help me whenever I struggle with a subject. I haven’t really reached out this semester even though it’s been really difficult keeping up with my classes. Since I’m also living on campus it’s easier to reach out for help such as going to tutoring hours in person and having a library that is open until 10pm.  Simply talking with other classmates can help with my learning and it’s easier doing work with others instead of just working on everything by myself. I honestly feel like I only have myself as my own support since I do most of my work all by myself but it would be great if I had guidance such as counseling. I’ve also thought about going to the school's Psychological services due to my deteriorating mental health. I felt like school has gotten much harder due to the workload but it will all be worth it in the end.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1620,"What resources do I have to support me? This question is in the minds of everyone and when one is stressed one can black out and not realize the resources around them. Stress is so bad; it is just bad! It makes you negative and makes you blind and does not allow you to see the good around you. What are the resources that I have to support me? First is my family; when I feel down, I turn to my family to help me and distract me; even if it is with school work and even if my family can not help me with an assignment, me talking to them about my distress relives me. If I need help with an assignment, students and teachers are also a resource. They know what one is going through and will try and alleviate issues. Another resource is the internet. I love how the internet can help me find a formula for problem solving. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1630,"A resource that I have to support me for my education is Metro Academy. I applied during my freshman year of college and they have helped me a lot. For instance, I’ve been able to have fist pick on textbooks through the ASI project connect because I’m part of Metro. I was also able to plan my first two years of college and have first pick on classes because I’m a member. Overall, it’s a great resource that has supported me in my education and it’s a great program. Another resource that I have to support me are office hours for my classes. They become really useful during exam week to get a better understanding of concepts. It’s also less intimidating since it’s a one-on-one conversation with professors. Furthermore, I’m also part of the Genentech Foundation program and they have helped me gain experience with certain programs, lab equipment, etc. I consider this program a resource that supports me because I’m funded by them and they have exposed me to helpful knowledge on what to expect when I join a lab."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1641,Some resources available to me right now would be my professors which I could reach out to through office hours. I would also like to think the school offers tutoring however I am not sure where to sign up or how to access it so that is a resource I will have to look into more. Lastly and I would say the largest resource I use most often would be youtube. Sometimes when I don’t understand a certain concept I try to find a youtube video explaining it as sometimes looking through the slide after the lecture isn’t as helpful as when it is explained by an actual person again. If I am still having trouble with a certain topic or problem I think that is when I typically ask for help from another classmate or the teacher. Sometimes I also reach out to my roommates but I would like to see if there are any other resources available.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1619,"When I think of resources as some type of support all I think about are my peers or my family/friends. Yet again, I have no peers that I can go to when I'd like some kind of support. I've been online for about a year and a half. I started college online and I have never set foot on campus, so I have no peers that I can go to for support even though I would really want that. It's ideal to have peers who can support you for homework or for study groups, since that tends to be really beneficial, which is something that I haven't had for the past year and a half due to the pandemic. I haven't been able to socialize and it's not ideal meeting people online let alone socialize and interact that way. So what resources do I have to support me, well I guess I can just say my family and friends as of right now and even myself. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1635,"I feel like I have many resources that support me. First off, I have my familyand friends. They always encourage me to be the best person I can be, and whenever I am feeling down or stressed, they remind me of what's important. They always know how to help during a difficult situation. I also look to my dog for comfort and support. I think having a pet is great for my mental and emotional health. I also have a great consulor that helps me with all my education problems and questions. I really appreciate being apart of the Guardians Scholar Program because they are always providing resources to all of the members and they have helped me find many scholarships. I also think that I do a really good job at supporting myself. Even though I have many people that I can lean on, I would consider myself a very independent person. I know how to get myself out of a hard place and bring things into perspective. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1617,"The main resources I have to support me are the people in my life.I have my girlfriend, my brother and my mother. I would also say that I have the support of my coworkers at Starbucks "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1640,"I have plenty of resources to support me to succeed. I have my family behind me to help motivate me and help me pay for school. I have my classmates that I interact with during lab. I have my lab professor and lecture professor to go to office hours and get help. I have study groups to attend in order to keep up with class. Most importantly, I have myself and my motivation to help me succeed. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1633,"There is so many resources available for us students to help us connect to our purpose and for me my purpose is to graduate with the highest gpa possible. There for I am using all the support I can in class, whether it was from classmates, group studies and rewatching lecture recording. If I can't get the help I need I can ask my professor who would be a very helpful resource in this case. In general I have noticed that SFSU has a variety of resources, like councilors and tutors and pals during classes that will help support the students during their journey. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1629,"Reflective Journal #4            Throughout my entire life I feel that I have always had a variety of resources that have supported me in the past or that I have to support me in the future or that will support me now in the present moment. As of right now, I have many resources within the university that I know I can count on and attend to anytime I may need their help. I am constantly receiving school emails of mental health awareness clubs that are in the school and are willing to provide me with helpful and healthy tips if I am ever dealing with anything difficult in life or if I ever need to talk to anyone in general. Since I am now back home, I have my sisters and family members who are always there for me and will help me if I ever need anything. Whenever I am mentally stressed, I personally like to talk to one of my closest friends and let her know how I am feeling or why I am feeling these types of ways. She always finds a way to make me laugh and feel better. I also find reading self-help books to be a really good resource for myself."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1626,"The resource that keeps me motivated to overcome any challenge is my family.  My family is my strong support.  they always support everything that i decide.  Besides, they also give me useful advice when I encounter difficult problems.  My family is always by my side when I fail.  they will always cheer me up when I face difficulties.  they are always willing to support me mentally and physically which helps me to overcome challenges.  that's what motivates me to overcome all challenges to succeed and repay them.  I want to be someone who can take care of and protect my family"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,633,"""What resources do i have to support me?""For starters I have my financial aid to help me with my academic career and to help pay for my tuition. Another resource is my job that i have outside of school, I know that the majority of students coming to SF campus usually find a job on campus to help them pay for their expenses but i work at a movie theater and right now that job is paying me well. Another resource that i have is my family i know that if i ever really need help with something they will do their best to help me out in my situation."
