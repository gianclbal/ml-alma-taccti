2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1613,"It can sometimes feel extremely overwhelming when analyzing my situation as a college student. Outside the context of this course, I am worried that my efforts in university as a whole will be in vain. I never seem to forget about all of the tribulations that have been overcome to get myself in this position, especially those tribulations which came before myself. Being the child of immigrants to the US, there is an immense and overwhelming amount of pressure to succeed, to build off of the struggles that were painstakingly gone through to get the very best out of the difficult situation of picking up and moving to a different country. I want things to continue going forwards and cross new limits, both for myself and my family. While we have been very fortunate, I carry a lot of weight on my shoulders to succeed. Its not necessarily that my parents are forcing me to do well or pursue a certain career path, but I understand that I carry a lineage of struggle, poverty, and determination that I must see through, that which the efforts of my parents and grandparents are not thrown under the rug. I am fortunate to come from a very supportive background. My family supports and back my decisions, and I truly believe that I have instilled in them confidence in me, that I will make the right decisions and pursue the right leads to succeed. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1641,"I think coming from the Hispanic community I was raised to believe that education is a privilege and I should take advantage of my family’s sacrifices to come to the U.S. Therefore when I told my parents I would be moving out to be able to transfer to SFSU after what felt like forever at community college I thought they would be happy for me and supportive which my mom very much was, however, my dad just told me that he didnt think I should come or to reapply to a closer school under a different major that would be in a field that paid better and I felt like he didnt really care about education per se but rather finding a well-paying career which discouraged me because I felt like I had tried so hard to please him but at the end of the day it wasn’t enough. However, now that I am here I am thankful to have found the Biology department to be very welcoming and helpful which gave me hope that I will be able to find a good career despite my dad thinking otherwise."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1631,"The values of my community and family have helped me navigate through college by allowing me to have a very determined and driven mindset in life. Based on my upbringing, my family has instilled values in me that encourage education, self worth, determination, professionalism, and drive. They have allowed me to want to live a life that allows me to provide for myself and others around me. The values my family has instilled in me has allowed me to want to pursue an education in medicine and create a life for myself that I have always envisioned. They have allowed me to stay focused in school and my professional career endeavours. They have inspired me to prove that women can uphold strong and courageous careers and be a “breadwinner” in a household too. They have sparked a fire in me to want to be successful in life no matter what I choose to do."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1639,My family has helped navigate through college by supporting my decisions and help me whenever I'm struggling with certain subjects. My mom specifically managed to convince me to keep moving forward and to stay up to date with my classes. My Asian background has also impacted the way I go about school. I'm more disciplined when it comes to school work and I manage to always do whatever needs to be done when it comes to having a high GPA. Without my family I wouldn't even know what I wanted to be since I'm always conflicted on what I want to do with my life. Most of my family also works for the medical field which helped influence my decision on going to college and soon going to graduate school. I come from a really poor family who all lived in a single household and many of my cousins are going to the medical field for my family to have a better home. Whenever I feel like I'm not doing good enough I always focus on knowing that my family need me to focus on my school work. Staying disciplined and focused for college always helped me whenever it comes to any task and knowing that my family wants me to stay in school motivates me to get a college degree.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1633,"Coming from a background of young divorced grandmother and mother, I believe impacted my college decisions. I have been raised on the values that I need to be able to get a degree and not depend on marriage and raising kids only as most middle eastern girls do. My grandmother continued college and became a nurse after a divorce at 27 and raised 3 children at the same time. which makes me think if my grandmother can do it I can do it too.I watched my mother struggle to get a job until she finished her GED and even that got her a minimum wage job back home she worked her way up in her job and I think If I can put all the effort in college I would be able to skip most of the struggles that my mother had to go through to raise me and my brother.During our time today, Education is the key for success. there are very competitive jobs out there and higher education. is now required to get to the top of your career. Therefore, I always think hard work in college will pay off later. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1630,"I think that the values of my family have helped me navigate through college by keeping me motivated. Going to college and getting a degree is a great accomplishment within my household. Especially since my parents migrated from a different country, it’s very important to have an education and make a career out of it. My family’s background is another factor that has motivated the values and point of view of college. Furthermore, I come from a community that is low-income and their values have also helped me navigate through college. An example of this is the high school that I attended. One of their values was “never too late to learn” which assured students that learning is a process and it gave us second chances to finish missing assignments and retake tests without penalties. This value has motivated me when going through a rough time of turning in assignments or learning new material in college. Overall, certain values that I’ve come across in my community and family have helped me navigate though college within these past three semesters of attending SFSU."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1628,"My community and family values have helped me throughout college because of the support they have shown to me since the first day I started at SFSU. My family is helping my college years. My family is helping me by giving me the space I need to do my homework. My parents' words of affirmation are also helping me to keep going because they constantly remind me that I am doing things correctly and that they are happy about what I do. My community has been a lot more influential than my family because I am the only one in the family pursuing a STEM major seriously. My older sister graduated with a public health major, but she chose a different path after finishing college. My community, such as my friends outside my parents and siblings, are there to always help me complete my homework, motivate me, spend time with me, give me money when I don't have enough, and, more importantly, pray for me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1616,"My mother and father are immigrants from Cambodia. They came here during the Cambodian genocide that occurred during Pol Pots regime. During this time, about one third of the Cambodians were killed. The first to go were teachers, doctors, any one intelligent, or even if they looked intelligent, such as them wearing glasses. They gathered those that fit the criteria and claimed it was because they needed them, then bombed the building where they all gathered. The fact that my parents managed to escape the genocide and were able to start a new life here is amazing. They had no education, no money, and could barely speak the language. They’ve always wanted me to do well in school. Becoming a doctor was always their dream for me. Even though my goal isn’t to be a human doctor, I hope that they’ll be proud of me in the end. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1620,"My family has always been big on education; they value it completely; they think education is one of the essential keys to success. Growing up I remember my family being so harsh on me at school; one bad grade and I would hear it for a couple of days. That not only made me sad but it made me wonder why and made me wonder  if they ever got a bad grade in an assignment and if they ever felt bad; they indeed did but they would still push me to get good grades as they wanted me to succeed. Studying for tests became like a coaching environment. I would get checked on every couple of hours to see how I was doing and if I needed water, food or even snacks. My family values school so much that they babied me in the process of studying for exams. I would get good grades  when I properly studied and that made me believe that I could survive college and I pushed myself even harder so I would uphold my family's values in that aspect. I am forever grateful for my family building me in my studies and navigating me through college because without them, I wouldn't think I was able to pick the major I have chosen today. Without me finding my study techniques, I do not think I would be in this class and I owe that to my family and their values. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,633,"Growing up I've had to quickly determine what these values were within my family as most of my aunts and uncles are Hispanic immigrants who came to the U.S. hoping to make something better of themselves and to give their future children a good education. Most of my other cousins have tried to attend college or a high education but as what happens to everyone, life gets in the way and had other plans in store for them which ultimately resulted in them dropping out or not attending or obtaining a higher education. I am the first son/child in my immediate family to attend a 4 year university and it does no go without saying that my parents have pushed me really hard to finish school and obtain my degree and needless to say the stress does not help but knowing that they have motivated me for this long for this far tells me that I cannot give up that I must obtain my degree not just for myself but to also give my parents some kind of satisfaction that they have done the right thing sacrificing their own dreams in order to give me a shot at mine. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1625,"The values of the life that I dream of outside of my home has helped me navigate through college the most. Ever since middle school I haven't had the best relationship with my mother and I made a promise to myself that when I graduate high school I would choose the a good college that would not only help me strive in academics to obtain a degree but to also get a good distance away from home and I completed that goal I got accepted to all the universities I applied for most of them out of the country or state, but that didn't help because obviously my mother had a say in which college I went to so she chose the one closest possible to home and out of all of them it was either Sonoma State or San Francisco that I could choose from. And now that I'm at San Francisco State- not really because of remote learning still -I have a new goal for myself and it's to get my degree and work so that can get out of my house once and for all and covid or this pandemic can't stop me anymore. Although it did back in march of 2020, from going to the actual campus, but now that there's a sense of normality, I finally have a chance. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1632,"I grew up as a first generation Asian-American in which my parents did not attend college. Although I am the youngest of five siblings, I think I have always felt a lot of pressure to be academically driven and to succeed for the happiness of my parents. My oldest brother, Nick, is 29 and has already experienced all the things I am currently going through. He successfully graduated Pharmacy school and has pretty much ben successful his entire life, which makes me look up to him a lot. I think being surrounded by this type of community/family has helped me in always striving for success and seeking help when I need. I hope to one day make my parents proud! Although I know that I do not have to see my brother's life as a minimum standard, it is difficult sometimes as I may compare my progress to his. Despite this, I try to remind myself every now and then that my parents will be proud of me no matter what."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1627,"The community I live in is a big part of how I treat college and what I do with my life. They are all highly educated and well-motivated to achieve bigger and better things. My dad is one of my biggest inspreation because he came to this country with 0 knowledge and help from others. I feel like i have some larges shows to fill. recently i feel like my drive and goals have not bee up to standards mainly because i have been focusing other things. I need to start focsign on school, work and other aspect of my life that will overall make my life better. But overall i have a great support system but i just need to know hot to use them and become a better person. The first step is to become less lazy and worry less about having fun and enjoying life. Set small goals to achieve and build up the motivation. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1635,"I think the values of my family have greatly helped me navigate my way through college. My family has set a strong appreciation for school ever since I was in elementary school. Having this idea in my head of the importance of my education has helped me stay motivated in my college academic career. It has helped me stay on track and have goals for myself. My family is also a great support system and helps me whenever I am struggling in school. My family has taught me that my education is the key to my success and that it will help open doors for me in my future. Another thing my family has instilled in me is to follow my passions and interest. This mindset has helped me figure out my major and figure out which courses best fit my interests. College is a challenge, but it has been a great experience and opportunity. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1626,"I am a person who always gets influence from family to motivate me to overcome challenges in life and also in career and education. My family is my support mentally and physically when I need help. they also gave me useful tips to solve the problem. they also always support them almost all my decisions. When I'm wrong or fail, they point out what I'm lacking or not good at. that's what helped me fix my mistakes. Because of all that, my family is the driving force for me to navigate through university. They never forced me to do anything. they allow and support what I want to do so I feel I am responsible for their support. I wanted to become better so I could take care of them so I chose to go to college. it was my goal to be able to be more successful in life through college."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1617,the values of my community and family has helped me greatly when it comes to navigating college. whenever i feel any type of doubt or fear its always the people in my life that help me. my friends that are school serve as a reminder that i'm not alone in this journey. my family remind  me that i will always have people to support me when i need it.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1638,"My values of my community or my family has helped me navigate through college by the choices that I make being based on those values. For example, one of the core values that my parents have instilled in my head is never giving up when things get tough because that hard moment is only a small portion of my life and I shouldn't have any regrets if I do give up. So I try not to give up on one class when I have a bigger goal in mind. Another example of when I wanted to give up was when I took a chemistry class and the professor made me want to drop the class and because I wasn't doing so well and I knew if I didn't pass chemistry that I wouldn't get into medical school but my parents told me that I should be comfortable with the uncomfortable because life isn't going to be easy especially not the healthcare field. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1624,"Reflective journal 5  The values of my community or family I would say in a sense has guided me through college. In the sense that I would like to secure or make my situation for my family so I use that as a factor in my decisions for school and outside of it in daily life. I live in a small community or grew up in a small community but was raised within a big family in my immediate family. I understand that everything else in life needs to be done with time. That everything that I am doing is ultimately affecting my future self for my future family of my own. Ultimately navigating through college within the pandemic has made me realize how everything in life takes time and in order to succeeded we must use our energy to keep pushing us into our next steps, we are not going to be able to get to our destination right away but the progress slowly is unlimitedly the teacher."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1618,"The values of the community I have grown up with have helped me figure out who I am as a person which has led me to navigate my college career independently with strength and courage. I have always been taught to strive for the best, to try my hardest, and that it is okay to fail. I think failure is something that many people see as scary but because of the community I grew up in, I was never afraid to fail. I knew that failure only meant getting closer to my goals. Another thing that has really helped me is independence. For as long as I can remember I was taught to be independent, maybe this was due to unfortunate circumstances but this has really helped me on my way through college. Not only does being independent really guide be to achieve what I want to achieve, but it also helps me recognize the resources that I have in front of me to help me succeed. That asking for help is perfectly fine."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1629,"·      I come from a really big family such as my mom, dad, two sisters, three brothers, myself, and of course my five dogs. I also have plenty of aunts, cousins, uncles, etc. who are constantly supporting me in whatever it is I decide to do with my career. My family has always been a huge part of my life and they have always told me that no matter what career path I decide to endure on, then they will always be there to guide me and to help me through the difficult times I may come across with in life and in my career journey. The values within my family have helped me navigate through college by allowing me to pursue what it is that I want to pursue in life without any hesitation. My family members have always told one another that “we can do anything in life” and that “anything is possible” therefore do not take anything in this beautiful life of ours for granted. We as a family believe that we are nothing without each other, so with each of our support, we will continue to prosper on and do whatever it is we decide to with life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1637,"My parents used to want me to pursue something in the science field when I was younger. I decided to listen to them and realized that I actually really enjoy learning about biology and chemistry. I did really well in my community college and tried to take classes and apply to a few nursing programs. I was really confident that I was going to get into one, but I didn't. I was really depressed for a while but my parents tried their best to encourage me through that time. They told me that it's okay if I didn't get into a program. They told me to drop school if it's too hard or stressful. I know they said all that because they worry about my health but there's no way I'm giving up here. My parents supported me through so much so I cannot just stop. They struggled even more growing up. My parents immigrated here, going through all the hardship, just so that my sister and I would have a better opportunity in the US. Every time I think of all that, I don't want to give up."
