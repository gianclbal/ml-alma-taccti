Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1613,"The purpose of the weekly physics lab is to provide a more in depth perspective of the things being taught out of the lecture, textbook, and homework. Aside from the fact that the my degree progress requires lab, I think that the lab is standardized because it allows students to become more hands-on with the material and explain concepts from a different angle to create a new bridge of understanding. This could include the utilization of tools or programs, group work, or small projects. Physics, like many of the sciences, is an extremely diverse and, at times, can be rather complicated. The opportunity to work in a lab setting can allow for concepts to truly blossom into the understanding that they were meant to be taught in. Having already acquired the necessary pre-requisites to work with the mathematics involved in physics, added to the content from the lecture portion of the class, I should be able to get a better understanding out of the weekly labs. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1614,"“Why am I here?” To put it short, I am here because I need this class to fulfill prerequisites for my major and that this class is a corequisite for physics111. I think this subject will be challenging for me because in my past I had trouble understanding physics. I took physics in high school and I couldn’t wrap my head around it. Then I also took it again in community college but the professors were not helpful at all because they just assumed we knew all the basics and foundations. I remember on the first day of class we started off with this formula but the professor did not define the variables in detail and they just assumed that we knew them. Granted, I could have taken a different professor but I heard from my peers that they are all the same. Now here I am at San Francisco State University and I think I am in good hands now."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1615,"I am here to learn a lot more and experience a lot more than I could've in high school. I am also here because I am curious of the goals I could reach and the amount of strive I will have throughout the class. I would also love to figure out how living things work and why they work the way they do so I could better myself and help others better themselves. I am here because I've been interested in science ever since I could remember no matter it had to do with animals, chemistry, or just fake Phineas and Ferb science. I am here because my high school mentor was a bio teacher and it was one of the most interesting classes I took throughout my 4 years in high school. I also want to figure out more on the natural world because I live in Daly City so I only get to see whats on trails or the zoo or the ocean but I know theres more. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1616,"“Why am I here?”This is a question I ask myself from time to time in different states of mind. Some days I’m so tired of work and the people I have to deal with, I’ll ask myself, ‘why am I here?’. Other days I’ll feel bored while waiting in line for something or for a class to quickly end and I’ll ask myself again, ‘why am I here?’. And there have been a few days when I’m feeling so down and out, perhaps from a breakup, an argument, or when I can’t see the end of this path that I’m on, I’ll ask myself once more, ‘why am I here?’. It’s easy to ask yourself that question, but at times it may be hard to find an answer. Naturally I’m at work to make money and in school for a better education, but what about other situations? I’m still unsure of the answer to that question but one thing that I am hopeful for is that if I continue to to push through, I’ll eventually find my answer. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1617,I would say that I am here for my family. My little brother specifically because we are very close. I am here for my friends at work and my girlfriend because we are apart of each other’s lives everyday. As I go through life I’d like to believe that I will affect the lives of anyone I get to spend time with even if it’s for a little. So basically I’m here for the people in my life and the best way for that to occur is to be the happiest person possible 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1618,"I am in this physics lab not only because it is a requirement but it also gives me a chance to put to practice what I am learning in the lecture portion of physics in my actual lecture class as well as the lecture portion of lab. During the lectures we are to learn what certain words mean and use different formulas that explain the motion of certain things. In this lab, I am able to use the formulas to really see how they work and why they work, it also gives me the chance to really test if I understand what I was taught during the lecture portions of this class. The way I am able to tell if I truly understand how to use the formulas and my knowledge is constructing the correct formula and sometimes reconstructing them given the basic word problem to figure out what is being asked. For example, using velocity equals distance over time and being able to reconstruct it to distance equals velocity times time. Knowing when I need to reconstruct formulas and how to do this is what I do in lab. Thus, the reason I am here is to put my knowledge to practice and perfect practice makes better understanding of the laws of motion in physics. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1619,"Why am I here? That’s a broad question and it’s honestly something I ask myself all the time. I ask myself if it's really worth getting up and attending class pretty much every day, 5 times a week, and I remind myself that without education I can’t get to where I want to be. Without attending college and attending the classes that are necessary for my major I won’t be able to pursue the career that I’ve been wanting to get at nor would I really get anywhere far in life. I tell myself that without furthering my education, I won't really get much out of life. That being said, going back to the original question, why am I here attending this physics class? Well for the most part I'm taking it because it's a prerequisite for my biology major. In all honesty, I’m not taking physics because I enjoy physics, rather the complete opposite, I very much so strongly dislike physics ever since I took it my freshman year. I didn’t find it to be interesting, and I don’t know if it was due to how much I struggled in understanding or if it was the subject in general. If I don’t take this class then I won’t be able to get my degree for my major, as simple as that. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1620,"Why am I in this class? Why am I taking it now? This class, specifically Physics has been a subject I have been avoiding since high school! I have not taken a physics class in high school and I delayed taking one in college. I took one semester of of it then had to drop myself out as I barely understood what was going on as the professor was very fast for me. This is my final year at SFSU and I have decided to take it and I am coming in to this class with an open mindset; I will not let my previous experience with physics affect my role in this class. So far, both my lab teacher and lecture teacher are good in my opinion which is a plus for me. They both seem as if they want to actually teach the knowledge rather than finish their job. My previous teacher at a different college was nice but a good teacher, but he felt everyone in the class was on the same page and was understanding in a similar pace so he went fast. All in all, I am happy with taking this course now with the teachers I have now as I need this class in order to graduate; so with great teachers, I feel at ease. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1621,"Why am I here? That is the question I have been struggling with this past month. At one time I knew precisely what I wanted to do. The lofty dream of attending medical school and fighting to give patients a better medical experience than my own. I wanted to be the end to a cycle of being overlooked and laughed away.      Now, the idyllic plan seems to have fallen by the wayside. I am broken after the years of abuse. Re-evaluating my life and who I am after these past four and a half years has left me frightened and confused. Do I still want the same things? Am I worthy of even trying to reach my goals?     I suppose I am here because I have not yet decided on the answers to the above questions. Perhaps a part of me wants to believe I still want this and am worthy. In the meantime, I am here attempting to keep my head above water and relearn how to succeed on my own. Hopefully, my efforts will be good enough to succeed academically as well. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1622,"I am here in this class mostly as a requirement for my major. I took physics during the summer of 2018/2019, and it was the hardest class I've ever taken. I learned a lot about physics, and actually enjoyed the concepts. however, cramming three chapters per class, and having an exam every week and quizzes every day was super stressful, and I couldn't keep up. I feel confident going into the material this semester, and I am here to keep trying and moving forward, despite not passing the summer class. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1623,"If I were to think of the actual reason I am physically here would be due to an accident as I was not planned. I like to believe I am here to one day be able to take care of my mother and siblings, since life growing up was a little hard for us. I am able to keep going everyday due to my drive of wanting to be able to provide for my mom one day and possibly give her an opportunity to be able to retire earlier in life. I also see my purpose of being here was also so I could meet my forever best friend who I have known since we were 2 years old. Growing up was a very difficult time for me as a child and during those times if I were to be asked the same question as today I think my answer would be on the darker side of things. I am happy I was able to overcome those obstacles and be able to be in a place of contentment."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1624,"For this reflection having to think about on why someone is here is hard to put in words for I believe there are still unknown variables we may or may not be aware of in future settings. I believe I am here sometimes in various routes. At times I believe I or we as whole are here just by luck. That nothing has a correlation at least when it comes to existing as individuals. With physics you come to realize that everything in life translated and seen in the scopes of chemistry, biology, and maths, that these fields ae meant to help understand and explain but at this moment in time we are not to know why we are actually here besides to live on. Another thought I have usually is that everything is connected and we are not in this time to know why we are here but to also ive on until the right time is permineted."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1625,I am here for m second year of college at San Francisco State University to get my degree which I do not know in what yet. I am here taking this class online because of the coronavirus pandemic that is ruling the world everyday and is not stopping for everyone even is people get the vaccine or wear masks because of ignorant people that choose to not get the vaccine or wear a mask and follow social distancing rules and tactics to keep yourself safe when outside. I am here in this class to check a requirement off of my degree plan so that I can keep persevering through my years at SFSU to get my degree. I am here because the physics course I am taking requires me to take a laboratory class with the course. I am here because I want a future after college and try to be successful for myself and for the ones that I care and love for. I am here because I am on a journey to pursue a career path that is still unknown to me but will reveal itself soon to me because I am hoping to choose this certain path in the year to come. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1626,"My pathAs a new student of SFSU, this is my first semester here. Physic is one of 4 classes what i am trying to take to complete my requirement as others . But, it doesn’t mean I dont like it. I love physic when i was a middle student and started working in lab. It was amazing to get know how everything work. It’s not a fact anymore when i see something moving or working. I could explain by physic. On other hand, to be honest, I am not good at physic, specially applying number to formula to calculate something. So, it mean physic is my weakness, but I don’t want to give up. It motivates me to learn, practice, and improve my physic knowledge. I want to get better and better. So, I am taking this class or being here that is not just for fun or something like that. I am here for studying and improving myself "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1627,"There are many reasons for me to take this class. One apparent reason is that this class is a pre-req for DPT school. The other reason is that physics helps me understand the world from a different perspective. I indirectly use physics concepts in my line of work on a day to day basis. When I am working with patients, my goal is to strengthen the individual while preventing further injuries. An example is when a patient comes in with a knee injury, I look for either the individual has a valgus or varus knee. This will help me determined the type of exercise to work on. If they have a valgus knee they need to work on the lateral muscles to prevent injuries due to greater Q-angle. If the patient has a varus knee then the medial muscles are important, to prevent internal forces pushing out and causing knee and hip pain. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1628,"Hello my name is Maria Angela Sanchez but I prefer to be called Angela. I am here primarily because my prerequisite for my major, but mostly I want to learn and understand physics. Physics has been such a hard, overwhelming, and tedious subject for me. It has been by far the hardest subject for me next to trigonometry. Also, I am scared to take any physics class because of my senior high school teacher. It was not a fun class at all and I didn't take anything from it. Since that day, I dislike physics. That's why I am here today, this semester, and in this class to prove myself that I can do it. If everybody else can do it, so do I. I can learn the materials, have fun, and pass the class. Not just to myself but also to my friends and family. I hope my professors both lab and lecture, will not give us a hard time because the subject is hard enough. I am excited and ready to conquer this class. Thank you."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1629,"When I read the question “Why am I here?”, I thought to myself what is my true purpose for why I am meant to be here in this exact place and in this exact moment. What I truly believe is that I am meant to help others and provide the world with my healing senses. I have been told that I am a very genuine, soft, kind, and helpful person. By this I have taken into account to always be my true self and to learn to express my higher self as well as providing others with kind advice that will only benefit them in the long run. As a human, I would like to continue to spread kindness and awareness to this world and help out as much as I possibly can. For this reason, I will become a Registered Nurse and continue to heal people in which I feel that I am meant to do. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1630,"I am currently enrolled in this class because it’s a requirement for my major. Physics has never been a subject I’ve wanted to learn mostly because of its difficulty. It requires a lot of math and looking at situations from different perspectives. I like things to be straight forward which is why I think I’ve never been interested. However, these past few sessions between physics lecture and physics lab have been very interesting. I can tell that things will only get complex as the semester goes on but I’m kind of looking forward to it. I also think that by working together in groups, it will help my understanding more so I won’t struggle as much. I am really looking forward to learning more about physics and how it applies in our everyday lives. I also hope that I learn to like physics as I might need to take future courses."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1631,I am here to better myself from both an educational and personal developmental standpoint. I am here to get one step closer to my goal of going to dental school and becoming the dentist I always knew I could be. I am here to make my family proud and give them a reason to believe in me. I am here to attain my own personal career endeavors in so many different aspects of my life. I am here to make my friends and loved ones proud and give them something to smile about. I am here to change the world and make it a more kind place. I am here to make someone's day a little better. I am here to become the business woman I always knew I could be. I am here to overcome the obstacles that come my way. I am here to change the way people perceive strong-willed and independent woman. I am here to love and be loved. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1632,"I think that I've had a long journey to where I currently am. As a junior transfer student, I've been in many classes already and I hope that this Physics lab isn't as hard. Since moving here to San Francisco to be closer to school, it's been a much different experience compared to San Jose. Even though these two cities are not that far a part, the lifestyle is already so different. I hope that through the courses I am taking this semester, I can grow much more as a student. Especially since I've felt so discouraged and unmotivated since the pandemic forced all of our schooling online, I hope that this semester has a little effect on that because I am able to attend one in person class. I am here to complete my degree, and I enjoy learning new subjects!!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,633,"""Why am I here?""I am here to graduate with my degree and be the first one of my immediate family to graduate from a 4 year university. I also wish to make my parents proud of me for accomplishing this. I am also here to make a better future for myself and to also pursue my interests in animals specifically reptiles. More importantly I wish to have a career in an area where I can interact and work with reptiles. I'm not sure in regards to what I will specifically specialize in reptiles but I just know that working with them has been a dream of mine and to be able to understand these creature more thoroughly. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1633,"Why am I here? I will start by looking at the bigger picture and zoom in to this physics class. First, I am in school now after taking 2 years off to apply to nursing school after finishing an associate degree. I then decided to not waste anymore time waiting and I chose to finish my Bachelor degree in Biology and then pursue my career in Physical therapy. Physics 112 is a core class for this degree therefore, I am taking it. I have always been intimidated by this material, but so far I have been enjoying the process of learning it without having any difficulties. I believe this class would be helpful later in my career because it allows me to study movement and motions at a deeper more detailed level. I am also learning to relate it to some of the materials I enjoy like Chemistry, as it includes some key point like mass, speed, graphing the process of going from point a to point b like we do while studying the rate of a reactions in my chemistry class. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1634,"Physics Reflective Journaling Brenden Collett-Grether  						The reason I am in physics 112 is because I am fascinated with the natural world and am pursuing a career that requires I understand basic principles of physics. I hope to better grasp the patterns of the world in which we live. My personal interests have led me towards other sciences such as biology and geography, but the field of physics is one that I have yet to explore. Moreover I hope that physics can be helpful in life, though I'm not entirely sure how.  						I have never taken a physics class, in part because it has always seemed intimidating. Partly this is due to my challenges with chemistry, which is often difficult for me to wrap my mind around. In part, by taking this class I hope to demonstrate to myself that I am capable of understanding this topic, demystifying it in the process. I appreciate how the professor of this lab section and the professor of my lecture have both been very accessible and approachable during these early days of the class.  					 				 			 		"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1635,"I've thought about this question a lot, however I never could really come to an answer. I think I'm here to learn. I think I'm here to grow and figure out what I like and what I'm good at. I think I'm here to be kind to others. I don't think I owe anybody anything. However, I do want to be a role model for the future people that are going to look up to me. I also want to be able to give advice. I think I'm here to do what makes me happy and make life worth living. I'm here to survive and be happy. I’m not sure if this question was asking why am I here in this class, but if it is then my answer is that I am here to grow my knowledge and achieve my academic goals. Taking this class gets me one step closer."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1636,"When I first read the “essay” prompt, I actually asked myself, “why am I here?” Then it dawned upon me that I had never really asked myself that question before. Which I now realize is absurd, because I’m far too into the game to have not asked myself that question before. To answer that question, I need to first tell you who I am. I’m a 17 year old Latino, who recently graduated high school, and has a baby at home. I’m a first-generation student, and the oldest of 3. My mom is a single mother, and I’m here because of her. I’m here because I AM the oldest of 3, and my success will inspire theirs. I have no other option than to do my very best, although it will be a struggle, I’m here to succeed. Success for me in this class means to actually learn the material I’m being taught and apply it to other courses. Rather than memorizing a bunch of material for a test, and forget it later on."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1637,"I am here in this class because I have always been very intrigued by how physic works in our world. I really have no idea, if you were to ask me right now, what physic even is. I personally enjoy learning how things work because I'm naturally a very curious person and I love to talk about the things I learned in class to my friends. I don't like the learning process, but enjoy knowing things. I'm majoring in biology, hoping that I can get into an accelerated BSN program, so I know a few random cool biology and chemistry facts. I sometimes ramble to my boyfriend because I thought it was cool learning about how our body works and how chemicals work the way they do. Although this is a very new topic for me, I hope I can end the semester with some knowledge in physics and share some cool facts to my friends "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1638,"I am here taking PHYS 0112-02 because I plan to go to medical school and Im not very good with calculus so taking physics 220 was out of the picture. Hopefully I can pass this class with a B or an A so that when Im in my last year, I wont have to worry about my grades as much as I would if I get a C in this class. And for the medical schools I do want to go to (UCSF), I need to have a grade above a C anyways so im killing two birds with one stone. Im trying to work smarter not harder. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1639,"“Why Am I Here?”I’m here for a reason and that’s to help others as I grow older. I felt like this path of my life has been chosen for me especially by my mom since she feels like I need to become someone that’s not average and to stay on the path of becoming a physical therapist. I’ve always thought everyone needed to go to college but as I got older, I realized I was wrong but, in the end, I still want to make my family happy since I’m their ticket to financial success. My family has always been classified as lower class especially since I come from a third world country. I feel like it is a calling for me to be part of the medical field and that path in life calls for a lot of schoolwork. I actually like school since I can connect with my peers but sometimes it causes mental issues for me since I always feel like I’m not as smart as everyone else. Overall, I’m here for my dream job which is a Physical Therapist."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1640,"Why am I here ? This is not a question that I often find myself asking. My purpose here has not been defined yet by what I have done. I have realized that I am still finding my purpose. For now I am playing my part as a brother, son, and student. I know I am here in order to help make the world and everyone around me better. Spreading positivity and love seems to be what I enjoy most about school and life. As the oldest sibling of 4, I know that I have to help guide my younger siblings and help direct them in the right path. As the first in my family to go to a university I will be able to help my siblings apply and succeed in schooling if they decide to pursue a college education."
