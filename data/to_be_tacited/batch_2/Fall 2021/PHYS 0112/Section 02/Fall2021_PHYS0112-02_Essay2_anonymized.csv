2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1625,"My goals this year are to hit all the courses on my degree progress report that I planned to hit and complete them with a good grade that I find satisfactory because this year is feeling heavy on me and Im starting to feel worn out by these online classes which I'm very grateful for but it still drains you and it takes all of your efforts and energy to do it just as it was in the beginning when this pandemic started. The lack of motivation has resorted me to be okay with whatever grade I get this year as long as it's not failing or close to failing.  My other goals this year is getting my drivers licsence which has been a goal of mine since senior year of high school but I believe I can do it this year and get it over with because it's a goal that's been on my list for far too long. This class is helping me achieve these goals because by taking this lab course it is helping me hit the B3 requirement on my degree progress report as well as giving me a moment to reflect on what path I am on which direction I want to lead myself in since I am still undeclared, these set of classes I am taking this year has made me realize that I don't want to major in biology because it's always been a general path that was easy for me to choose and I really don't see myself working in a career that I believe I would've chosen which is nursing, I feel that there are other career paths I could take and other careers out there that would make me happy in doing but I just don't research them because I don't know how and that's my problem with choosing the easy path which is the general path of majoring in biology. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1634,"Physics 112Reflective journaling #2Brenden Collett-GretherSorry for the late submission, I overlooked this assignment by mistake.My ultimate goal with this class is to increase my knowledge of physics and prepare me for potential future application of physics knowledge in my professional life. Potentially this could be also useful in graduate school. That said, I don't expect to pursue degrees that are intensive in physics and will not be pursuing a career in physics. Physics is certainly fascinating though, and the more I am experiencing this class, the more I see applications for the knowledge being provided. Trying to understand the natural world is something that I enjoy, and I especially like the fact that physics can help explain some things in nature.As far as future careers go, I'm most interested in the fields of geography and environmental science. These disciplines do not necessarily directly require a lot of physics, but they do intersect with physics in a number of ways. Certainly global atmospheric circulations can be understood better through application of physics. I am looking forward to learning physics principles and then hopefully being able to apply them to the natural world that I encounter."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1624,"Reflective journal 2  My goals or goal is to just be better than I was in the immediate time of better than I was than yesterday. The goal is to pass my classes to move onto the next and so fourth to graduate. Also, to graduate and have an opportunity to pursue a higher education in health. At the moment we are being introduced to the concept being good at solving problems even if the problem is on paper, the problems given are usually a practical application to a real-life situation but in order to solve the question one of the best things to do is to write down what we know and what we don t know or what we are trying to solve. This helps identify the situation and gives you information right from the issue to begin with. This helps or is starting to help in real life more so in my other classes because at the moment I am a student. This hep clear up questions on many of my other classes and helps make a better picture to actually drawing a sketch next if need be with the data."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1638,My goals are to be an Anesthesiologist or a Lawyer or both. This class is helping achieve those goals by allowing me to complete a small portion of my medical school requirements and further bringing me to my goal of attending medical school in the bay area. Im not very good with chemistry or physics so those subject will definitely be harder for me to complete. But Im going to keep moving forward and not let those classes hold me back. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1627,"My goal for this class is to understand the world differently to get a basic understanding of physic concepts. By the end of this class, I want to use the basic concepts and relate them to the human body. I work at a physical therapy clinic, so I want to explain the cause of the injury to the patients in a way they can understand. Many of the injuries that I encounter on a day to day basis are low back and knee pain. Due to the current situation, many people are getting minimal to no exercise and sitting for prolonged periods. This is mainly due to improper posture and lack of strength. Bad posture can add 30-50 lbs of additional force to the spine. Over time the added force will eventually catch up and result in back and knee pain. To prevent this using good posture and prevent the additional forces acting on the spin is necessary. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1626,"Every goal is never easy to achieve by a straight line. My initial goal was to become a nurse but there were some problems that made my path a curve. it's really not a big deal when I have to go on a longer path than the one I chose. I didn't expect this curve to take me further than my goal. I feel it is the luck in my life and i will enjoy this trip. This physics class was one of my first steps on the road to achieving my goals. it was one of my subjects in my first semester at SFSU. I can say it is the foundation of the process of realizing my dream. It can bring me closer to my goals and beyond. On the other hand, physics class helps me consolidate and improve my knowledge of everything around me. it forms the foundation for me to gain more knowledge."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1637,"My goals for the next few years are very straight forward but I know it is going to be hard. I was not able to get into a nursing program, so alternatively, I decided to major in biology get a bachelors before moving into an accelerated BSN program. I am very scared that I won't be able to reach that goal because I was very confident in getting into a nursing program in the first place, but I didn't. To be honest, this hit me really hard mentally. I was depressed for a bit because I felt like I wasn't really ""special"" or ""smart,"" I'm just average, or even below average. I overcame that thought process (kind of) and I just want to focus on getting all A's. I'm working on my lower division courses for biology even though I'm a transfer student because I didn't plan on getting into biology at all. This course is one of the lower division classes I needed to take so. Passing this class with an A is my short therm goal!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1613,"My goal is to finish the homework due tonight but I can't do that so I guess I'll work on the lab. My goal is to get as much as possible out of the material covered during the activities today involving acceleration. Considering the program is the same as last week, I expect the problems to be relatively similar, only with the addition of concepts of acceleration drawn from velocity and position. This class is not really helping me with the goals of doing well considering I don't get much out of the labs other than another due date to remember, but I'll try my best to get something out of it. I am confident in my understanding of acceleration, so I don't think I will have to spend too much time on the lab activities themselves. However, this combined with the other things I have to finish is going to be a pain. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1635,"One of my goals is to graduate college and go onto medical school. I know that this goal is going to take a long time but to be able to achieve it in the end will be worth it. Another one of my goals is to be able to have all of the knowledge to explain how our body functions and what components make up every part of it. I never really understood how physics correlates to being a biology major, however, taking this course will indeed help me achieve my goal in graduating college. A short term goal is to pass this class with a C or better. I plan on achieving this by making sure I manage my time efficiently amongst the rest of my other classes and my job. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1633,"My goal is to graduate with a highest GPA possible, in order to be one of the competitive students entering Physical therapy school. In general, if I understand what's being taught in class, it would be a lot easier to solve the homework properly and get a good grade therefore, my goal for this class is to review all lecture material and master the topic before starting on the homework for lecture and lab. Also, by working hard on my homework and focusing on problem solving and proving solution by providing evidence in form of equations I am able to rethink my answers if it is not correct and if it cannot be proven correct. For me, in order to stay active with a topic I have to relate it to a goal of mine in life. So what I try to think of for this class is in order to understand the study of movement of the body I need to understand the motions around it and I believe this class is very important for my degree even if it's introductory because I need to understand the smaller details of movement before I look at the bigger picture. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,633,My goals are to graduate from San Francisco State with my degree in zoology and hope to find a career in that field. I also want to achieve this not only for myself but also for my family who have pushed me to achieve acedemic success. This class is helping me reach that goal not by just being a required class to fulfill but also by teaching me real world problems and mechanics that I would use for my major or research! 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1617,My goals for this semester is to become a student who actively participates in class so that i can truly understand the material that is being taught to me. i don't want to be simply tying to get an A in class. i think what will help me are all the break out rooms meant to help me connect to my peers. i believe that these reflective journaling that we do in lab and lecture will also help me stay focused and grounded.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1641,"While in high school I was in FFA and was able to raise a lot of animals for the county fair including 2 pigs, 2 lambs, a heifer, and a pair of chickens. This resulting in my interests being based around working in nature with animals however I felt like the agriculture fields based on animals were ultimate to prepare them towards consumption and my love for animals wouldn’t I think let me go through with that because I wanted to help them not hurt them. So this lead me to be a vet however I always feel I haven’t been the best at school and considering community college took me twice as long as it should have for now my goal is just to get my bachelors in Biology and hopefully find a passion I can pursue into a career. This physics class is helping me towards receiving my bachelor’s which is my short-term goal for the moment however im not sure if it will be relevant to whatever career I plan on pursuing and I am taking it because it is required for my major. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1616,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""My goal is to graduate from SF State and get into a vet school of my choosing. I then want to graduate from vet school and open up my own veterinary clinic. Later on in life, I would also like to open up my own book shop with cats, something like a cat cafe, but with books. I also would like to donate my time as a veterinarian to an organization that gives cats and dogs that were abused a second chance at life. I’m honestly not sure how this class is helping me achieve these goals aside from the fact that it’s required of me to take. Physics can be interesting and even though I don’t see exactly why I need to take this class, I like to think of it as exercise for my brain. It never hurts to learn something new, and who knows, I might really like this subject. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1630,"My career goals for the next few years is to graduate San Francisco State University with a bachelors in biology. After that, I plan to apply for dental school or a dental assistant program. It all depends where I stand at that point in time. Furthermore, my current goal is to pass all my classes with decent grades and manage my time well since I’m a full-time student and I have a job. I think designated classes in every major prepares individuals by building onto each other for future reference. Therefore, I think this physics lab class will help me achieve my goals by building onto my problem-solving skills. The problems that we encounter during class can be confusing and we may have to look at different perspectives as to how to solve it. Problem solving skills grow overtime and is very much needed in the future for all types of environments."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1629,"Thinking about my goals always excites no matter the situation that I am currently in. This is because I am a very optimistic, motivated, and hard-working person which is one of the best character traits that I personally have. One of my goals is to graduate the university with a Bachelor’s of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree. I aspire to become a registered nurse very soon in which I know that I will be able to take care of people and be able to treat them with health issues they may have. Another goal of mine is to never stop learning. I will be sure that I am continuously learning new topics in life and new things to do because we are not limited to learn only a few things, if we wanted, we could learn anything we want to learn which is what makes life beautiful. This is helping me achieve my goals by opening up my mind to new topics in life and allowing me to continue to education and allowing me to become closer and closer to my future job as registered nurse."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1620,"This class will help me reach my goals. This class will allow be to finish my prerequisites in order to get a teaching degree. I am struggling with getting stuff in with the proper dates but I am slowly starting to be on track. I recently got married and moved into a new house; new furniture, cleaning all above has interfered with my homework turning in dates, however, I am slowly starting to get the hang of things which will allow me to properly be attentive to due dates. My goal is to finish this class with a proper understanding and getting good grades in this criteria in order for me to apply such to my teaching credential and maybe apply it to future students.  I would like to be a biology high school teacher. In order for me to achieve my goals, I need to be more organized and attentive to dates and giving myself time to work on my homework and understanding of the material. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1628,"My goal is to be a channel of blessings to people especially those who have been there for me since day 1. Since the day that my parents stopped taking care of me and my siblings, I was only 13 years old back then. My siblings and I had to learn everything on our own and even figure things out on our own. I learned to provide for myself and the toughest thing is that I learned to motiivate myself, be determine to go to school, work, study, and everything in between because no one will. One of my goals is to pass all my classes this semester especially my physics classes because this class will help me achieve my earnest desire and that is to earn a bachelor's degree and hoping to get into med-school. This class will help me become a doctor. This class will help me become an inspiration to younger generations and the generations to come that physics is for everyone. Lastly, I want to make my parents proud. Even though, they were not there when I needed them the most, but still I am grateful for their lives."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1622,"My goals are to complete gollege soon, and to find either a nursing program, or a job in my field afterwards. This class has very in depth concepts that are very applicable. Because of the complexity of some of the topics we are learning, I have also had to reshape how I learn once again. I believe that college really teaches you how to learn, and I believe that this class really demonstrates this. I am modifying how I study, take notes, and participate in the labs. Another goal I have is to actually do well in this class. I took physics over summer two years ago, and It was the hardest thing I have ever done. We were learning three chapters a day, and taking exams every two days. I actually understood the concepts, however I did hoprribly on the exams. I hope that with previous experience in this class, I can do better, and feel like I actually acheived something by taking that summer class. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1623,Some of my goals are to score an internship in a field of science I decide I want to focus on and then graduate from SFSU. I am currently in my fourth year of college with at least two semesters left to go due to the fact that I was unsure of what classes I was supposed to take during my first and second year of college. Some of my goals for this course and some of the other courses I am currently enrolled in is to be able to take the knowledge I learned from these classes and being able to accurately apply them to whatever job I may have in the future that I hope is in a science field I would be happy to be apart of. I hope that I do have a great understanding of the material I am learning and I am able to remember the contents of these classes and the others I have in future that would provide to be helpful for me in the career field of my choice. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1631,"My goals are to graduate San Francisco State University with a biology degree. I then plan on applying to dental school and going to a dental school to pursue my career as a dentist. This class is helping me view the world in a different way. It is also helping me to get my degree and fulfill prerequisites for my future plans of higher education. This class is helping me gain knowledge in physics since I have never taken a physics class. It is allowing me to ask questions and wonder about the world around me. It is causing me to be more curious and learn new terminology. It is enhancing my understanding of forces, vectors, and directions. It is also allowing me to apply what I learn in class to the real world. It allows me to see how I apply physics in my everyday life by doing simple tasks like going to the grocery store, getting in my car, filling up gas, etc."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1632,"My main goal as of now is to graduate with a B.S. in Biology. I think that this class is helping me do so since its not just one of my requirements, but is also giving me the assistance I need in my General Physics class. Another goal of mine is to pass all of my classes this semester. Since it’s my first semester at San Francisco State, I think it’d be nice to pass all my classes within the first semester since it’ll give me a good head start on my journey here for the next two years. I am determined to pass this Physics Lab along with my Physics class, which I can add to my list of current goals! With the help of my classmates, I think that this class is allowing me to fully understand the logistics and basics of Physics. My farthest goal right now is to apply to graduate school, which I have not looked into close enough yet."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1618,"From the knowledge I have attained from this lab I am able to confidently read a graph and use what I find to calculate other necessary things I need to find. My goals for this lab was to be able to calculate velocity, and position based on given information, but not only am I able to do this but also exceed my goals and really analyze a graph. Going forward, this improves my confidence on being able to Read other graphs and given the knowledge I already have I am able to make predictions on what other graphs can tell me. In the work field I would like to go into, reading graphs will help me learn what is working and what is not and provides me with another way to organize and analyze things I will need to keep track of. It will also help me when actually making graphs for different procedures. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1619,"What are my goals? Well, that's certainly a broad question. I have many goals in life if I’m being quite honest, but I can say that one of my top goals out of the handful that I have would have to be getting my dream job and get accepted to the medical school that I want to get into. I really do hope that I become what I’ve been dreaming of for several years already. Getting into medical school would be a huge step into what I want to be in life and what career I’ve been pursuing. I really do hope that I become a pediatric oncologist. The only way that this class is “helping” me achieve this goal is only because I have to take it, it’s literally just a miniature step. It’s not that I want to take this class because physics fascinates me, it's quite the opposite. This is what I have to take for my major in order to keep moving forward."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1621,"My goal is to work in the medical field. In what manner I am unsure. Whether through clinical work or research, I know that I want to end up in this field. The field of medicine is ever-changing and focused on continually making the experience and outcomes of patients better. This combination of scientific work and human interaction is very appealing to me. Later in my career, I would like to teach in some capacity as well. I value the power and freedom that education can give, so I want to ensure that I pass those along to other people as well in the hopes that they will better themselves and continue passing them on to other people as well.      This class is a necessary step in my career goals. It is a prerequisite, so I of course must be here. However, this class is also a good introduction into the type of critical thinking that I will need to hone as I progress through more difficult classes and the difficult concepts that I need to master in order for me to meaningfully contribute to the medical field."
