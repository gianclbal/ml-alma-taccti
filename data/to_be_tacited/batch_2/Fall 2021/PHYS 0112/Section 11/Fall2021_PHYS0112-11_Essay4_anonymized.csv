2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1804,"I think that my purpose is become more clear the more I interact with the people around me and how I apply myself in succeeding in school. I felt like I was stuck for such a long time, working a dead-end job, making very little money and enjoying life without giving it my full potential.I really want to make my family proud of me graduating from university and pursuing an interesting career. I don’t know many people around me, friends and family (outside of school) who have actually done more in their lives than just get some job and have kids…which makes staying in this path a lot harder. I feel alone a lot of the time and it’s hard to ask for help since I’m not used to doing it anymore. I find myself being more involved in the work I’m doing to get my degree and be a successful scientist. This makes me feel like I have a purpose. I aim to get my BS, then probably graduate school somewhere outside of the country and do a program there as well to finish my goal of become a virologist. I know it’s a long road but I see myself doing great things, different things, and anything else feels like it is not going to make me truly happy. My support system is made up of the resources in school around me: peers, tutors, professors, etc. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1822,"Resources I have to support me in this class is the homework as that is what the quizes are based off of. In addition, there is office hours to go to when I am confused on a problem. I need to start going to office hours, especially for the final project presentation as I am confused on if I need to add how Bernoulli's Principle is related to the lift of a helicopter or if I have to make an equation for it. As we have not gone over Bernoulli's Principle so I do not know how to solve it, but I do know how to explain its effects on the helicopters blades and how the high speed on the top of the blade allows low pressure, and the bottom of the blade is slow speed causing more pressure. The high amount of pressure on the bottom wing is what pushes up the blades of the helicopter, giving it lift. This concept is important to understanding how lift works, but the equation for Bernoulli's Principle is about elevation not atmosphere.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,543,"When it comes to resources, it has always been a somewhat of a challenge for me. Asking for help should be considered one of the easiest tasks on Earth, but for some reason, it has always been hard for me to do so. Everyone wants help, "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1818,"What resources do I have to support me? Hmmm very very very very good question. First of, I have my friends and family. My friends are always there to hang out whenever I feel burned-out and needed a little break. We often go out to get some good food. Also, I always have my family whenever I need someone to talk to. They can always make me feel better regardless of the situation. They are my main source of supports. Besides friends and family, I can also get some support from other students if I need help with certain homework. Tutoring is also available but it's kind of a long process to make an appointment with them. In short, they're not always immediately available. If I just need to relax on my own to get away from reality for a bit, I have a console and some games I can always rely on to. They're a great way to unwind and forget about all the stuff that going on with me for a bit whether it'd be work, school, etc related."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1819,"The resources I have available to me for this class are the professors office hours and the schools tutoring for physics. The only problem I am facing is that I am always really busy with my other classes and commuting because I live in the east bay. I also have a hard time finding the motivation to get help a lot of the time because I think that if I keep pushing it off the problem will go away. Which 9 times out of 10 is not the correct way to go about it. I also have classmates that I can go to for help with homework or other class assignments. I used to have a tutor for math who was also a physics teacher at a high school who I could contact for help, which I will probably do because I feel like I need more support in this class. Non academic related resources that I have to support me are therapy. I am going to start going to therapy through my health care provider which I am excited for because I struggle with depression and anxiety a lot so I am hoping that it will help me with managing that and finding ways to keep myself motivated and be less stressed."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1817,"The resource I have to support me in college is the Metro program. Metro is a program for first-generation students to have access to academic counseling, tutoring, and degree planning. Recently I had a question about financial Aid and they were able to help. I appreciate the Metro program because as a first-generation student, I am intimidated by the college process and get overwhelmed easily. Sometimes I feel embarrassed about how little I know about college and what I need to do. The Metro program gives me the space to ask silly questions and know that I will be supported. Metro Program also has classes for metro students which puts us in smaller classes with each other so we get more one on one time with our professors."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1814,"I have a strong peer network, fantastic mentors across multiple different walks of life, and a strong desire to make my dreams a reality. I am incredibly grateful to have so many amazing people in my life, and would not be half the man I am without them. To those who support me and my research endeavors: I will be forever indebted to your willingness to take a chance on the first undergraduate visiting scholar in the history of UCSF from SFSU. Being able to work on graduate level projects is nothing short of a daunting task. Yet, with diligence, faith, and a strong motivation to change the way we view the etiological components of A.D, I strongly believe that extracellular vesicles can be identified as having a significant component in altering the expression of transcription factors, glymphatic vesicle thickness, and angiogenic factors in brain microvascular endothelial cell models. My lab, thanks to fantastic support from world-renowned doctors, is pioneering the way we view the endoplasmic reticulum's functioning in pathways key to neurodegeneration, such as N1kb, NLFRP3, and MAPK/ERk. Ultimately, it is contributing something to the world that has the unique ability to fundamentally alter treatment models and study models of neurodegeneration that keeps me going and leaves me ultimately feeling supported. In addition to that, having a fantastic therapist has proven spectacularly helpful in my pursuit of loving myself more. The imposter syndrome is real, and is something that ultimately deserves to be addressed. While my PI may view me as an eccentric genius, I strongly devalue my own self-worth and capabilities to succeed,"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1805,"I am a very independent person, so most of my resources are based on what the school provides me. I do not like asking for help. Although I think most things are generally easier now with almost everything being submitted online, I wish there were more resources to study on campus. San Francisco is a cold city, places where we can study inside, eat and drink would be great but unfortunately, this school's approach on Covid is a little strict (in my opinion) so those places do not really exist. This school does offer many resources for various things; food, housing, health, tutoring (although tutoring hours suck) etc. I think this semester they did not do a very good job disclosing that information to students. I also have a partner who I would consider a resource as far as emotional and mental support, however, we do a long distance relationship. Overall, I feel like the school did a better job offering resources virtually last year. This semester, it has felt half-done with disclosing the information, hours of operation, and in-person resources. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1810,"Although I may not use all of them, I have quite a few resources around me. I am current taking BIOL 231 and the professor is quite helpful in every way she can be and helps us navigate things such as finding advisors, reviewing our CV, letters of rec, etc. In addition I know I can go to tutoring at the library or online via zoom. I know my professors are also resources I have who can support me. I also have my friends who are ahead in my major and who are able to help me with my classes. Although I have all of these resources around me to support me, I find it quite difficult to reach out to them and ask for the help. I know I am technically paying for the resources provided by the school and should use them to my advantage, but It's hard to reach out and ask for help when needed. A lot of the times I feel like I am too far down the rabbit hole to be helped and that keeps me from reaching out. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1820,"The resources that I have to support me? One, well 2, things that support me emotionally are my dogs. They just make me feel warm and happy, especially when they're in bed with me watching a show, or when we go on walks and I see they're happy waddles and tail wags. As for school support, I know there's tutors and stuff. Also, I am in EOP, and they have a lot of resources too. 10K degrees also offers tutoring and stuff. Another thing to help emotionally and mentally I think are counselors, like school counselors and like therapists. but like the thing is, I feel like I don't have the time to be able to make the time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1813,"When I think of resources to support me, I think of people before anything else. People provide that strong foundational support that's needed before anything else can help. I consider my family to be that foundation because they're always supporting me in my academics and beyond. They give me the time and space to do my work when needed and spend time with me for the rest. My close friends also support me greatly just by being there to hang out, get my mind off any stresses, and listen to my venting when I need. Having fun with them is in itself a way we support each other with our happiness."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1811,"A huge resource are the people around me. I often ask my roommate, my parents, or my siblings for advise. SFSU also have a lot of resources that can be helpful to students. The school offers advising and tutoring services. The wellness center is also a great resource for students who may not know how to get healthcare services. The campus also has gator groceries as a resource for students who are struggling with finding meals. The internet is also a great resource. People can find a lot of great info on other resources or advise. I often like to use the internet as my support resource. Theres a lot that I can learn from the internet. They have a lot of online therapy, tutoring, and support groups available online. They are convenient because you don't have to leave the home to use these types of services anymore. I also have my physics team as support for this class. We are good about helping each other on stuff we are stuck with and we all have busy schedules so we can relate to each other. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1803,"Educationally, I have the tutoring services offered on campus, in-class, and from upperclassmen who have taken a similar course as me (regardless of which topic). Aside from those, there isn't many other services since both parents only have their GED and the only relatives that could help are typically pre-occupied with work or completing their own degrees. There's also the online textbook and the internet to reference. Mentally, the only people I turn to are my closest friends, (mainly) partner, or (rarely) my mother since I didn't have a good experience with therapy growing up. I've tried for years and they've been little to no help, but just sitting there and making awkward eye-contact for an hour or so. I guess my mental support group is pretty narrow and needs improvement. It's just difficult finding people that I can connect with that'll understand what I need/want."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1823,"One of the resources that I have available to support me is my lab group. In class when I have a question or while doing the homework I can talk to them or get in contact with them in order to work it out together. Another resource if I get stuck is office hours, which will be helpful as I work on my final project. A third resource that I utilize are my notes and the slides and textbook. I find it helpful to go back through them and look at the equations. I also like to look back through the sample problems in order to refresh my memory and get an idea of where to start the problem and what it should look like as I solve it on my own. A final resource that I find helpful is the internet. When I can't find the answer or figure out which concept to use, there are many other online textbooks and YouTube videos that can explain the concepts; sometimes it can be helpful to hear or see a concept reworded in another way in order to get a different understanding of it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1816,"I would say that my primary source of help would be my peers and family. They provide me with a lot of emotional and spiritual support. This is crucial for any college student since their mental state could constantly be swinging due to stressors such as exams, homework, outside work, etc. I also know that a good resource of support for school would be my professors themselves. I have found their office hours to be a good place to discuss what I can do to stay on track in class. I also know that there are a plethora of resources around campus that are meant to support students in many different ways. I always like reminding people, especially incoming freshmen, to make sure that they take advantage of all the resources that are available to them on campus. Not only can they find something that probably never knew about, but they would also learn a skill such as a resource navigating that can become essential in anyone's adult life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1821,"I could go on and on about all the support I have and every day I remind myself to give back to my parents because they have done more than I could ask for to make sure that I got to college and am doing well mentally and physically. They always support me and my mom is always there when I need to rant about how stressed I am or just to give me a hug. I also have my friends who understand that most of the time I can't hang out because I have homework and they never get upset with me for it which is honestly great. They always make an effort to work around my schedule and understand that I want to do better for myself. Also, a big support system I have is my siblings my sisters always try to celebrate my wins no matter how small by buying me a pie or a simple text which honestly makes my day. Lastly, as corny as it may sound I have myself because sometimes I get a mental block in classes and the concepts just don't click on me but I do everything in my power to lessen my anxiety of bad thoughts and just push through. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1807,"If resources are things that help get through life or through specific situations then it would be the support of my people. as I personally don't feel like there's any outside resources that can help me. I also don't feel supported by the already existing ones. However, having the support of my people can provide me with some resources that lead me to others that are can be very helpful. I think part of it is the fact that it's hard to reach out for help or to try to use the existing resources because I'm not used to depending on others and feel better off relying on myself and doing my own thing. But having people that would the best they can to support me and be there for me can always give me the strength to keep going. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1809,"I have a lot of resources to support me. For my academic issues, I have my classmates, professors, and tutors that can support me. If I need extra help, I can stay with my professors during their office hours to receive support. In my personal life, I have my friends and family that I can talk to if I need support. I do feel more comfortable talking about my issues with my friends though. I also love talking about my issues on the internet for the whole world to see. Since no one knows who I am on the internet, I find it a lot easier to talk about my problems on there. I can also go see a therapist but something about talking to a therapist feels way too intimate and it feels awkward. I have lots of resources that can support me, but I don’t always take advantage of them. I have been in college for over 5 years but I’ve only gone to office hours a handful of times. I need to start communicating if I am in need of support "
