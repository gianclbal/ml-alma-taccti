2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1807,"What are my goals can be the hardest question for me to answer at this time in my life. I don't think it's bad to not have clear goals, but not having any can lead to lack of motivation since I don't really know what I'm working hard for or if its even worth it. One thing I know I have to work hard for, because I have no choice at this point but to do so, is completing my degree. And since this class is a major requirement, it will help me get to that degree. Although I used to be very interested in physics when I was younger, all the college pressure has stripped that away from me. I feel like college and the education system became a thing that drains all your energy out until you lose all your interests and passions, and end up feeling lost in this weird world."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1810,"I have a couple of goals that I'm focused on right now. Right now a goal of mine is to improve the state of my mental health and get the help I need. I am slowly achieving this goal, but am having a few setbacks. As difficult as this class is for me it's helping me use the skills I need to cope with difficult things instead of just shutting them out and ignoring them. It's helping keep me accountable. Another goal of mine is to graduate with at least a 3.5 and go to PA school. This class is helping by allowing me to complete the classes required to graduate as a Biology major. I think this class also help by forcing me to ask for help and speak up for myself, skills that I know will benefit me in the future. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,712,"My goal in life is to make something of myself. Why? Well, I was raised by a single mother who raised 4 girls on her own, and well she is my mother and father figure. She has gotten 2 out 4 through college and me and my younger sister are on our journey through college right now. I just want to be able to show my mother that all her hard work, dedication, and sacrifice were worth it. Yet that is not my only goal, I want to be able to show myself that I can make it in life. I know that once you are out of college things are difficult in the big world with finding jobs that meet your major but I want to make it to dental school. That is why I am taking this class because it is a requirement for me to be able to make it to my next destination point. The moment I make it to dental school is where all the sweat and tears will come because it will not be easy but I know that at the end of that point comes my goal to make it into the dental field."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1809,"My goals are to work in the veterinary field. SFSU doesn't actually offer any veterinary majors. The closest thing they offer is zoology so that it my major for now. I am currently looking for a job in a vet office. I can't actually work with the animals because I am not licensed to do so, so I will work in reception. After I graduate, I will probably take a year or two off to save up some money. Then, I will attend Foothill College where I will get my veterinary technician license. After working for some years I will probably go to UC Davis and get my DVM license. It's a very long path but I am looking forward to it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1816,"My goal in life is to be able to establish myself in a career where I feel like I'm contributing to something with a purpose and that I enjoy what I do. So far, I feel like I would enjoy a career in medicine or something that is STEM-related. In order to be able to reach those goals, I have to work hard to not only achieve good grades but to retain the information that I'm learning from my science classes. This physics class is one of the classes that I have to not only take for my major but also because it's a requirement for almost all medical schools in California. This class will also help me gain a little bit of lab experience which is something I really need since my first two years of college were spent primarily online due to the pandemic. Having skills regarding conducting a lab is crucial as a science major in my opinion."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1821,"I think lately I'm having a hard time trying to realize what my goals are. I am trying to remind myself that it is okay to feel that way but it's kind of a bummer when I thought I was set for college with my major and future career. My goals have always been to complete undergrad and pursue medical school to become an OB/GYN or not do surgery but study neurology or the heart. However, I feel like I am currently in that awkward stage where I am realizing that I am now entering my 20's and I have to really think about if my major is something I really want to pursue. I feel like covid didn't allow me to fully experience the transition from 18-20 or maybe without covid, it would've still been a big change that felt extremely fast. However, to sum it up my goals are to be in the medical field but I have been very unsure. This class can help me figure that out because it is challenging and I know medical school can be challenging. Also, we can always try to find ways to integrate physics into the medical field to help solve cases or understand the patient's story better."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1815,"My goals include graduating with my bachelor's as soon as possible because i was technically supposed to graduate may 2022 but due to covid and other things caused a delay in that plan. After graduating undergrad my goal is to either do to PA school or Medical School depending how i feel and how much longer I want to stay in school for. But one of my ""short term goals"" is to find a job with the field that I want to go into, whether that is in research, an internship, or an job. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1811,"My goal is to be a physical therapist. This class is helping me achieve my goal because it is a requirement for graduation. It is also helping me work collaborative with a team. I have a really good team in class. Usually in other classes were are forced to work in teams as well but I have not have good luck in previous group work. In my past experience, most people do not really care about working together or communicating with each other. I am lucky that my group is willing to communicate with me and help each other out. It makes the class much more enjoyable. Working with others is a huge skill needed for PT. Once you get into PT school, you are with the same small group of people until graduation so this is good practice as well. Physics is also a hard topic so this class is helping learn how to better delegate my time and muster up the courage to ask questions. I am usually very shy and cannot bring myself to ask, so this class is good because you walk around and check up on us periodically. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1805,"My goal right now is to pass all my classes with good grades and graduate on time (Spring 2022). After that, I am not sure what I will do. I may end up moving back to San Diego. Life has been difficult for me in San Francisco, and I am over it. If I decide on attending graduate school, this class will be a pre-requisite to apply. Now that we are on force and have been talking about that for some time now along with energy, I could sort of see how understanding Physics can apply in a physical therapy setting where you are often thinking about helping your patients regain function. From my understanding, there are certain movements that are normal and analysis of degree of movement is often measured and graphed. By having the knowledge of one component, we can figure out how much of another component we need so the person can walk again, for example. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1802,"My goals are to graduate from SF state with an earth science degree. I would eventually like to end up in the field of earth science but not exactly sure whether I want to go into oceanography, geology or meteorology. This class is definitely helping me achieve my goals because I’ve never taken a psychics class before, even in high school. I’ve taken lots of math throughout the years but this class really connects the math with the actual earth (which is actually the only reason I find math relevant). I’m learning a lot about speed, distance, forces, energy and why it’s important with the earth."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1812,"What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""My goals is to finish my undergraduate and go to medical school to become a pediatric doctor, specialize in kid with. disabilities. In order to pursue this goal , I will have to push myself the best that I can in my classes, study, work hard and reach out when I need extra help. This class helping reach my goals cause its a science major class that i need to graduate and continue to be successful, although it might be difficult I try to look for resources when I need extra help. I need this class to understand my lack in area I need more help or also help me understand science and if its actually something I want to do for the rest of my life "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1813,"The only goals I can think of that this class can help me achieve are, of course, academic goals. My goals are to graduate university with a degree in biochemistry. This class can help me achieve that because I quite literally need it to graduate, it's a requirement for my major. However, the knowledge I gain from this class will definitely help me once I go into a career in STEM. With biochemistry, many sciences converge in one, and I can enter lots of different fields in the future. So even if my major isn't physics, it's always good to have an understanding of physics concepts for general life and my future career. I hope that this degree will open many doors for me and allow me to explore my interests while still getting paid. It can be really frustrating sometimes when I have a lot of homework and I find myself spending the entire day just working on it. In those times I should try to remind myself why I'm doing this and think of how much it'll be worth it in the future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,685,"My goals are to become a physician's assistant either in emergency, primary care or dermatology. Also, 3-5 years into my career I want to open up a clinic or a small hospital and help people that doesn't have the funds to receive proper and full healthcare. After I receive my bachelors degree I want to go to graduate school of course to receive my masters degree in PA studies. Honestly, I don't really feel like this class is helping me in the sense of the medical field, but it's helping me achieve my goals because I have to take this class to graduate and to get into PA school so I guess it's another stepping stone towards my goal. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1804,"My goals are to ace my classes, even if they don't directly relate to my major. I aim to brush up on my math skills and understand how to break up word problems into numbers I can use. I aim to build up knowledge, resulting in learning a new skill that I could apply in my future courses or career. I believe that this class is helping me think in a different way, one different than my other classes, and I think it is essential to me gaining a new perspective.I would like to make my parents and remaining grandparents proud, and the first step to that is them seeing my get my Bachelor's of Science in Microbiology. I want to be the first in my family to graduate college with a degree and apply it to my career. I want to make the future generations of my family see that we are capable of greatness in the world, and that they could do whatever they want to, regardless of the difficulty it takes to get there."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1822,"My goals in life is to understand what interests me, and personally I love understanding how the world works, especially how the body works. That is why I really want to work in pathology, specifically with human remains and doing autopsys'. When I first got into the field it was very difficult as many people look down on me or get grossed out by it. Also, there is not too much information about the different fields I could go into. In the beginning I wanted to go into forensic pathology cause I love it. Though my problem is med school is not based around forensics, instead its based on how to care and treat patients which is something I have zero interest in. The thing I love the most about pathology and forensics is I don't have to deal with living people cause normally they are draining and a pain to deal with. On the topic of what field I want to go into, I have been talking with different pathologists and I really like the work for a pathologist assistant and autopsy technician. So I am hoping to find other jobs simular to those because they do not take medical school to get into. Side note this may be a shorter writing cause I got distracted when my cat started chasing my crows.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1814,"My goal in life is to be a doctor with a doctorate (MD - psychiatry specialization/ PHD - neuroimmunology OR astrophysics). Doing medical research in the field of Alzheimer's Disease (A.D etiology) alongside being a practicing psychiatrist is my dream. Somethings I am currently working on is addressing the role of composite mutations in the brain as an etiological cause of A.D. In patients with neurodegeneration, just like cancer, there are disordered activities of proteins. Tau and Amyloid Beta, for example, are two famous etiological proteins whose dysregulation contributes to symptomatic experiences consistent with neurodegeneration. My research thus far indicates that Chromosome 19, q 32.2/3/4/5 play a massive role in the regulation of lipids in the bloodstream. An upregulation of lipids induced by certain alleles in the genes found in the aforementioned sections of chromosome 19 may trigger a cytokine response that alters the vasculature, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis, activities of the brain. This could explain why APOE4 carriers and homozygotes experience impaired healing proceeding head trauma. By taking a physics course, I will be able to better prepare for the MCAT and apply this knowledge of physics to my understanding of the human mind. Additionally, the similarities between neuronal structures and the universe may yield fascinating insights into the functioning of both the mind and the universe we reside within. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1823,"My goals for this semester specifically are to keep my grades up and understand the material so that I can do well in the next level for this class. In general, I want to keep my GPA up and understand the information from all my classes, and I eventually I hope that I can get into a good medical school and enter the medical field. This class can help me as long as I can continue to understand the material, especially since I have to take the next level of physics next semester as well. Hopefully some of the concepts that we learn here help me in some of my other classes, too. For instance, my math class recently had a topic on forces and work similar to the one in this class, but with slightly different math. Having an actual explanation in this class about the actual concept and another viewpoint on how to do the math and formulas was helpful because it was like I had a double pass at the information. Hopefully I will have similar experiences in some of my later classes, where I can view the material again but from a different perspective, and be able to get a better understanding of it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1803,"I believe I mentioned in the last journal that my goal for taking this class is to work in emergency medicine. Physics is relative to all if not most things that involve modern medicine which is why taking this course is pretty much mandatory for me on top of needing it for my degree. With respect to medicine, physics is used to determine anyone's diagnosis and future course(s) of treatment. Volume, pressure, force, and energy are a few topics relevant in the field of medicine that are included in the study of physics. The concepts in this course are fundamental in every day life as well, so if the future doesn't go as intended then there are other fields that involve physics. Such as engineering, business, education, research, radiology, etc. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1824,"My overall goal is to become a research scientist so I've noticed that taking this class is helping me understand the world and how to evaluate empirical data that can help shape my mindset for doing research. While I believe this class can be confusing at times, mainly in the mathematics aspect, I am still motivated by the overall picture of how things in the universe operate and why I should care about it. I think I've always been fascinated with how things in the world operate, so outside of my career, learning basic principles and laws can help me understand how to navigate the world and know my limitations as well. Outside of this class being necessary for my degree, I am motivated to learn principles that can facilitate my understanding of things to progress science and humanity. "
