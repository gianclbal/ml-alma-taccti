2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1818,"what do I do when life gets challenging? hhmmm. Very good question. What do I do? To be honest, I don't even know myself. Like I don't have any protocol to follow when I feel like life is getting a little bit difficult. There's this one time where my tasks for about a month just keep adding up on top of the other. I tried to do them all at once and man, it's kind of hard. All I know from that point was I know my priorities which are school, my relationship, and workout time. Knowing my priorities were, I immediately drop those who were not on my lists. Those includes giving favors to some of my friends because they didn't have a car, partying which I kind of want to attend but not really a must, and doing some extra curricular activities which are not really school focused.   "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1804,"When life gets challenging I look through why it makes me feel so challenged. Then I try to relax a bit by walking around and going outside to mellow out my anxiety. Sometimes I'll send a meme to a friend in order to ease the tension or look at something that makes me smile. When I've done that I go back to the problem at hand with a clearer head. Then, I look for resources to give me a solution. I look for multiple possible solutions in order to try them all out and settle on the best. Resources include notes, lecture slides, classmates and online tutorials. When I've tried on my own and cannot seem to get an answer I save what I want to ask and come to the instructor for help.At the end of it all it makes me feel really accomplished to have gotten to an answer, that at one point, seemed overwhelming."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1816,"When life gets challenging, I try my best to follow my Mother's saying; you can't fix anything when your mind is too busy being mad or frustrated. I always try to calm myself before I come up with a plan on how to tackle the specific challenge. I also believe that it is really important for people to sometimes take a break from a challenge and dedicate some time for themselves. School can be considered a challenge for me, and sometimes to relieve myself, I do things that I personally enjoy to advocate for my own well-being. For example, I like playing m guitar whenever I feel like I need to let go of my challenges for just a moment. I've noticed that this allows me to clear my mind for a little bit to allow me to get back at tackling the challenge in a better mood. Everything in life can be done as long as you have a good mood about it. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1805,"If I get really stressed, I tend to get sleepy and fall asleep. However, I know that is not the healthiest way to deal with challenges in life. I have learned from past experience that I can not just solely work when life gets challenging so I make it a point to stop and relieve some stress first to help re-center myself. I do this by going to the gym or going rollerblading. After, I am able to focus a lot better and can tackle some challenges. I try not to dwell on anything for too long. If I messed up, said something wrong, did something wrong; I will reflect on it briefly on what I did wrong and work on preventing it from happening again. However, I try not to dwell and I try not to live my life with any regrets because that is the cause of more stress. Besides, I like to be happy as much as possible. I notice as people get older, people become bitter and uptight. One of my goals in life is to keep a smile and curve negativity from affecting me no matter what. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,543,"Kimberly Ramirez 10/14/21 Life, as a whole, is a challenge every day. Sometimes, something out of the ordinary happens and you don't what to do with the outcome. Stress can play a part in our daily life and nobody likes it. We can't get rid of it, but we can try to find ways to cope and destress. For me, that's not always easy. I have been through a lot of hard times in my life and it has effected my performance in other areas, particularly. Plus, most people in my family are not as good as dealing with stress as I am. They tend to lash out and make the situation worse without thinking thoroughly about what to do. In these times, I tend to breathe in and out, and not randomly lash out at anyone or anything. Plus, during the past year and a half during COVID restrictions, I gravitated towards exercise because it has been proven a great way to deal with stress and anxiety. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1811,"when things get challenging I tend to avoid them. I have a big problem with procrastination and put things that I don't want to do or don't think I can do until the last possible minute. I do similar things in life. I avoid the issue and ignore it externally (don't do anything about it). Internally though I am molding over the situation and analyze my feeling about it. I try to find solutions. Sometimes I ask people around me for advise, but a lot of the time I keep things to myself because I am shy and don't want people to know that I am struggling. I guess it depends on what the issue is. If it has to do with mental health, I will often work on it quietly on my own. If it is work or school related I will seek advise/ help. The internet is a great resource to find people with similar issues and maybe see what advise they were given or took. Even if life isn't fun temporarily, I am a huge believer that things will sort themselves in the end. Whatever issue I am having will pass because everything is temporary and after all, it can't rain all the time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,712,"What do I do when life gets challenging? Well just like very one else I feel like I want to give up. Why is that my first resort? Well honestly I don’t even know but I don’t listen to that resort. Instead I clear my mind and take a break because if I continue to tackle over and over from the same perspective well then I will not improve in anything and it will Just frustrate me more and more. Now the last thing I need to be doing is frustrating myself when dealing with something that is challenging, during my break I draw to relax and maybe even just talk with friends then going back in on that challenge I come with a clear mind and not a frustrated one and this helps because it lets me see things from different perspectives and maybe even see the approach I needed to take but it all comes with time but when under fruition and a crowded mind I would not be able to see that."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1810,When life gets challenging I tend to runaway from my problems. I hide away using sleep as an escape or just avoid it all together and pretend that it does not exist. I’m actively working on my coping skills so that I am able to face any obstacles that come my way instead of avoiding them or allowing for them to consume me and become paralyzed by them. Therapy is helping with this and I feel as if I am slowly unlearning all the bad habits I picked up in my 20 years of being alive and learning to take things slow and lean onto my support system when things get hard. I want to be able to face things head on rather than running away whenever something becomes difficult and hope to see the fruit of my labor in the future.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1807,"Whenever life gets challenging or things become too much to handle, I tend to shutoff. By shutting off, I isolate myself from my reality and especially from the people around me. if possible, I'd rather go away for a while to take some time and be alone. This always helps me clear my head and think about my choices and examine my set of beliefs. When I go back to my usual everyday life, I feel like I can make better decisions that are based on legitimate reasons which helps me make more realistic adjustments to get through these challenges. Or sometimes makes me realize that its not worth the challenge and its best to let go of the thing that's holding me back. Although shutting off isn't always good for my emotional well-being, because I'm not used to depending on others or reaching out, shutting off is my best option to take care of my mental health. after getting over it, I can open up about it to my close people and feel less alone."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1821,I personally have very bad anxiety and sometimes it takes over my mind. When I start having bad anxiety I get a very bad mental block where I cannot find a solution to anything because it doesn't feel like I am capable. When it comes to school I feel like I am not smart enough when I get into these mental blocks as well and my body gets a rash and I feel super cold. When I feel like that I usually sit down and write everything I've ever accomplished to remind myself that I am capable and that I can go through with what I need to. I also enjoy going to the gym I love weightlifting and running to get my mind clear. Living here in SF now I also have the ability to go to the beach when I'm stressed and just look at the waves. Being in nature and listening to Hertz for some reason also really calm me down. To sum it up just reminding myself that I am capable and going into nature. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1808,"When life gets challenging, I tend to turn to outside sources to help distract me. I will talk to friends, explore nature, or just walk around the city. A lot of the times I just take a nap, which helps me feel more refreshed and able to confront my challenges later. Yesterday I felt overwhelmed, so I took a nap, took a walk and then was able to come home and get some work done because I was well rested and was able to have some time to myself that didn't focus on my schoolwork load. I also like to write, so I tend to write about my issues in poems or journal entries, which help me diffuse idea of it being so challenging, when in reality, it isn't always so hard."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1812,"What do I do when life gets challenging What I would do if life gets challenging is I usually try to refresh myself by taking a break, I try to do things I love and spend time with people I love. When life gets challenging I try to set a schedule , a routine that’ll help me prepare me for what’s next. When life gets challenging I try to find a way to figure out what I did wrong or what I can do to fix whatever went wrong. Reflecting on myself and giving my mind some peace is what I do when life gets challenging. It’s always hard to get back to not challenging because you keep doing something wrong if you don’t reflecting and reflecting has always helped me find myself again or mediate on things I love to bring me motivation to keep going !. This happens a lot for me when I’m not to sure what I want so I also try to figure that out and look at things that will help me with that and find what I wanna do with life. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1815,"If I am being honest whenever life gets challenging I don't think I cope with it in the most efficient way. If something is really challenging I tend to get anxious and kinda shut down and have like a freakout moment in my brain. Other times I really just go into my shell and sleep for a really long time to avoid my problems. Other times I will avoid it by doing other things like playing video games or spending an insane amount of time on social media like tik tok lolol. And even though I know these aren't the best way to happen challenging situations It's sorta like it's my default. If I try really really really hard I can definitely face a challenge head-on but I like to stay within my comfort zone so most of the time I won't face it until the very last second. And in the end, things always seem to work out which I think feeds into my procrastination. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1825,"I try my best to begin by cleaning my room when I feel overwhelmed with work and school specifically. I believe it is impossible for one to change their life for other people and affect others in a positive way if they are not unable to do that same thing for themselves, so I clean my room and make sure everything is organized at the beginning of the day. Once my brain is cleared I try to hit the most pressing task head on and finish it before taking a mental break. As long as I begin gaining momentum at the beginning of the day with these two things it feels only natural to get more things done. My end goal is to buy my parents a house before I am 35 and having to support myself financially through school and living since 18 it has not been easy. I am constantly being challenged from many corners of my life but I see them as reasons to grow and change. It is hard for me to redirect my habits but I can proudly say that I have improved my work ethic by some amount every single year. Cleaning my room when things get challenging allows me to be thankful and express care in the things that I have in order to fight for working towards more."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1809,"When life gets challenging my first instinct is to take a nap so I usually end up sleeping a lot more than usual. I also find that I’ve been forgetting to take my antidepressants so I remind myself to take those again. I don’t usually talk to anyone when I’m going through something, and I know I should but talking about things is tough. I haven’t talked to my therapist since I was like 17 so I should probably see her again when things are tough. On another note yesterday I shadowed at a vet clinic and it was really fun! Helped the vet clean this dogs face after a teeth extraction, which was kind of gross but it was all very interesting! When life gets challenging I forget to eat so sometimes I have to force myself to eat even though I don’t want to. When life gets tough I also cry sometimes. Crying does not solve my problems but it is a great emotional release and I do feel better temporarily after crying. Antidepressants do make it more difficult to cry though so sometimes I don’t cry even though I really want to cry. Sometimes I also say “damn” and just move on."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1823,"When life gets challenging, I try and figure out another solution to whatever the problem is. A lot of the time I get super fixated on one little thing, but what I sometimes need to do is take a step back and focus on something else so that I can go back and look at it with a new perspective, even though it can be hard to change focus from the problem. Another thing that helps me it to find something to distract myself from the problem so that my brain isn't focused on the problem and sometimes the solution will suddenly become obvious. Something else that helps me is to talk through the problem. A lot of the time I'll talk it out in my head or out loud to myself, and then later with a friend. It can help to hear the problem differently (out loud and not just in my head) and sometimes random side tangents when talking can help me find a solution."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1820,"The first thing that comes to my mind when I think about what I do when life gets challenging is that I tend to stop caring about most things. It's not for that long, but it happens. When I start thinking about it more, though, then I start getting my doodoo together and try to get back to where I was before things went downhill. For when things get tough in school I usually cry a little, get stressed, and sometimes I ask for help but not always. Sometimes I try to get things done on my own because..I don't really know why. I've never really been one to ask that many questions, which I know is something I should start getting into the habit of since school is starting to get hard.For when things would get tough in life, in general, I used to see a therapist but I stopped going. I don't like crying over something that I think isn't worth crying for but I'm a crybaby so there's that. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1803,"When life gets challenging I try to tackle it head on as much as I possibly can, ask for help whenever I can. However, if or when it gets too difficult to continue, I take a break from everything if the circumstances allow it. During my break, I’m either exercising, sketching, napping, or anything else that can get my mind off the topic(s) for a while. Then I return to whatever challenge I was working on with a clearer head. I don’t believe anyone does well under too much stress from any challenge, there’s always a limit to what someone/anyone can handle. I used to power through challenges and didn’t care too much if I cried during the process. Eventually, I found that pushing myself too much made it even harder to concentrate since it left me with a negative mindset of “you have to do this or else this and/or that”."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1822,"When life gets challenging I have a tendency of disassociating to finish everything that I need to complete. I don't think this is very healthy as I only concentrate on the main challenge and begin slacking on my other daily tasks. Lately I have been doing this to finish all my genetics and calculus work but I have been putting less time into my other classes. I need to start creating a schedule so I don't keep falling back in assignments and study time for classes. With the schedule I need to actually follow it instead of getting distracted and doing other work. This has been going on for the past three weeks, but this weekend I am going to finish all my assignment so starting next week I can have a clean slate and keep up with all my classes so I can bring up my grades. As the last few weeks have been rough for the grade book. I've noticed I also have a tendency to do less than I am capable when things get more challenging and stressful because I start to question if I can do anything at all. I need to stop overthinking about everything cause that is my biggest downfall when it comes to getting things done."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1813,"When life gets challenging, such as when I have too much school work and a lot of tests, I typically try to look forward to any fun plans I have after I'm done with them. I try to remind myself that while I'm currently spending all day doing homework, I'll be done by Friday and have a fun weekend. Like last week, I spent all week working on homework to prepare for my chemistry exam and I was really feeling down and frustrated. But eventually I finished it, had a fun weekend while still being prepared, and did good on the exam. I also try to give myself some breaks and just take time to myself to relax, watch some Netflix, and not worry about anything. I usually can't relax until I've finished all my work, but that's okay because then I feel more relaxed after knowing I'm done with everything and I don't have any assignments to worry about. If it's not school-related and I'm going through something, I hang out with family or friends to get my mind off things or talk to my friends to let it out."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1814,"When life gets tough, I try to sleep. It really helps with calming me down. Also, what can be good is to have someone to talk to. It’s critical to have someone to be able to discuss your life events with. Without a key support system, your mental health does decline. Loneliness also changes protein expression in the brain and can lead to altered signaling of TREM2, a receptor that helps your brain function properly. In summation, meditation, sleeping, a good mindset, therapy, regular exercise, a good diet, and self-care pose as essential in mediating the detrimental impact of high stress on your body. Funnily enough, Today was a really tough day for me. I made a big mistake at my lab, which kind of made my PI upset. It was not a big deal, but it kind of infuriated her to see that I vaguely mentioned “the studies” instead of a proper source. Also she seemed confused about the role of APOE isoforms in the bonding of TREM2 -mediated angiogenesis, which made me look a like a buffoon. That was tough, because I found something breathtaking that could not be effectively conveyed in the context of such a short meeting. I wanted to share with my mentors a fantastic novel discovery that could cure up to 60% of patients with A.D, reduce heart disease, etc. Sadly though, I just gaffed. My heart faltered. I felt like the world was ending. I may have crossed the line and now have spiraled into anxiety regarding my poor performance culminating in termination as a result of my poor speaking skills. Fun times."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1802,"I feel like there are so many different things I do when life gets challenging depending on the situation, but the first thing I notice I do is completely shut down. I’m not in a good mood at all and I don’t want to really talk to anyone until I have a plan of what I’m going to do or until I’ve began executing the problem. I always know that I have the skills or capacity to handle whatever is thrown at me, but I always let myself acknowledge and validate that I’m either extremely stressed or overwhelmed. In fact, just last week I was feeling really overwhelmed with school, work and having to spend time with my family that came to town to see me and I talked to myself as if I was a friend and basically agreed with myself that I was going through a stressful time and it was okay to feel that way and then I cried for about 10 minutes but it was therapeutic and I was able to get some homework done after that. "
