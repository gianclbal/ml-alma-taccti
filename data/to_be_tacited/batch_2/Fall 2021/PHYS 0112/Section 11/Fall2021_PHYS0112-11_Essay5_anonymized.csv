2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1814,"The values of my family of origin have taught me what not to do during the college process. Yesterday, I had one of the hardest conversations of my life. I told my grandmother that her problematic drug use and failure to take care of herself has negatively impacted our family this holiday season. On Thanksgiving, she decided to do opiates. Consequently, she was too high to care about showing up and seeing the family. It is tough to be candid with the woman who raised me, but ultimately necessary for my piece of mind. It was by having this hard conversation and by being assertive that I spoke my truth. Being vulnerable ultimately provides me the hope and ability to stop the pattern of intergenerational trauma that has plagued my family for years. My strengths are that I understand how to navigate extreme hardship. When I was 19, young and new to the college experience, I was diagnosed with Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. In light of this diagnosis and my family of origin, I have gained strength. Sometimes, the most painful experiences can culminate in a stronger sense of self. Without having gone through a harrowing childhood, I would have never learned the skills needed to survive hardship. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1825,Ever since I was young I wanted to be a doctor. My family would give me support and tell me that I am capable of becoming the first doctor in our family. My mother has been a huge source of strength for me. Along the way there have been many cases in which I had questioned my competence and even my ability to reach my life goal throughout college. My mother has always helped to put me back together the through a simple phone call and has acted as my lifeline all throughout my college career. The stresses of funding my own education and being the first to finish college in my family is horrifying and uncertain at my lowest yet fills me with pride when I am at my highest. Every semester gets more and more uncertain yet closer to my goal. My family gives me support in every way they can and love hearing about the new science topics that I learn in class every time I visit. Being the oldest of 4 I am trying to desperately carve a trend of education into my family so my children will not need to work through school and go through the struggles that I or my parents before me have had to face. In a way it is a lot of the future that pulls me forward and a lot of the past the pushes me to continue.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1820,"Coming from a family in which no one went to college, I thought it would be cool to be one of the people in my family to graduate with a degree. On my moms side, my great grandma, grandma, and my mom and her siblings and aunts and uncles never had enough money to go to college. I don't even think they had enough money to go to high school (in Mexico you have to pay like tuition and uniforms for all levels of education). On my father's side, I don't know much, but I know that my dad probably didn't even make it to middle school. When my mom and dad came here, my brother was like 4 years old. He was the first to get a degree in our family (including cousins). My brother got a degree in computer engineering so I think it would be cool to be the first in my family to get a Bio degree."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1817,"My community has shown me resilience and dedication to your family. Everything I do is for my family and I try to make them proud. My mom always tells me that my education is the family's education, I have to seize my opportunity because my mom and grandma couldn't. When things get hard I have to try to push through for them. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1807,"The support of my people and their constant effort in encouraging me to take my time and not be rushed with my progress in college has been a great help. As I remind myself to do my best but also pause when I feel burned out to take care of my mental health, and having the support to help me get through that is very important to me. Not letting other factors influence my decisions in choosing my major or what field I would be interested to get into after college helped me be more focused on pursuing what interests me or what I feel passionate about. In times I feel overwhelmed, I try to remember my goal and why I am in college and what I want to accomplish with my degree. As I try to navigate through college even at times where life feels overwhelming or other things hold me back. One thing I keep in mind is to see college as an opportunity for learning about life from different aspects and meeting people from different backgrounds with an open-mind, and having this experience lead to personal growth."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1811,"My parents always stressed that education was very important. Throughout my schooling career, I was pushed to get all As in my classes. For the most part I always received A's, but on occasion I would get B's. I would always get lectured that Bs were not good enough. I guess because A's were always expected from me, I was never proud of them. It was just routine for me. As I got older, I think that I got burned out and stopped caring about getting A's. I also had a really hard time in high school. Now in college I still get mostly A's, but because I struggled a lot in high school I feel like I never learned how to properly study. I didn't get to form good study habits. I'm trying to learn how to get better at studying though. I always start the semester strong but then it's hard to stay focused half way into the semester. I guess I never had a good relationship with school so it's hard for me to stay motivated. I feel lost a lot of the time and my parents never went to college. Two of my siblings dropped out of college. The one sibling that graduated I don't feel like I can ask for help. So I'm just trying my best to finish. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1822,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college would be my dad as he has always supported my academic decisions and always try to find interesting articles that are related to the field I am going into. In addition, he helps me pay for college as long as I do not fail any classes. My mom's side is not very supportive of my decisions and thinks that I should be worrying more about finding a husband than my education, and thinks going into a field with death is weird. So some of my fuel to go through college and go into a medical career is through spite. I am grateful to have one parent that supports my decisions. In addition, I have friends who help me as we are all going into simular fields so we look at different opportunities together. I have also been recently talking to pathologists about programs and shadowing to better support my understanding of autopsy work. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1818,"I came from a family who value education like it's a treasure. Or at least the older generation of my family. I remember years ago my grandma would always remind me, my siblings, and cousins ""Do not get married yet. Finish college first."" I thought that was kind of funny because I never had an intention to dive into a relationship with someone. At least that was my logic back then because there are more stuff to worried about than getting a relationship with someone while in school like video games and such. Even then, especially in my high school years, I never took schooling very seriously. I don't even know how I got through high school by doing the least minimal effort. I never did my homework and barely paid attention in class. I went away for about five years to work first after high school. After that, I went back to school as a college student. I am a brand new man with a wiser mentality. I took my classes very seriously and study hard. My aim is to have good grades to that when I go into the career that I wanted to do, it'd be easy because I studied hard. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1803,"I'm not really sure how they've helped me navigate through college. My community is ever-changing so I suppose that's something I picked up over the years; to be flexible and change whenever the time came to it. This aspect has led me to be more carefree (whether that's a good thing or not) in most situations in life. A constant, despite which community, is the motto ""it is what it is"", so it's taught me to not dwell on things for too long which makes things less stressful whenever something unfortunate has happened. This motto is similar to what my family (who're Buddhists) value in their spectrum of this religion which is to, in simpler terms, to not dwell on small issues. Along with the other values that come with Buddhism my family (mom specifically) has passed down to me as best as she could. Having been surrounded by that carefree environment has made it so I breeze through college in a way that's mostly supportive of my mental health by not layering on too much if it's going to hurt me more in the long-run. I've never been much for religions so that personal choice is making college life a little tedious. Everyone I've met recommends joining a sorority, but most support religious groups that I'm not fond of so getting the full college experience (on-top of starting college during covid) has been.. an odd journey to say the least."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,543,"Kimberly Ramirez 11/30/21 In my family, success is very important. My parents and grandparents have little education, but have a lot of real-world skills that make them very bright and capable of many things. As the first-born child, there is a lot of pressure that has been thrusted upon me from day one. My mother had me at age 19, so all of her hopes and dreams were passed onto me. From an early age, I have been fascinated by books and reading has grown into not only an important skill, but also a leisurely pleasure. I was very good in school and always came home with outstanding grades. My mom even has a folder containing all of my honor roll and excellence awards. But she always says that I shouldn’t just succeed and work had for them, but for my own sake. The skills I learn in school will help me prepare for the real world and help me make a great living for myself, if I choose to want it. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1810,"I definitely have not always seen eye to eye with traditional family values, but like it or not they have led me to where I am today. As I look back now they have really pushed me to persevere through school despite all the struggles I have gone through. Even though I feel like I regret it at times I know at the end of the day I would have regretted not going to college and seeing it through so I am glad that that family value stuck with me this far. As for community values I feel like I have learned to reach out for help and have a support system to rely on. Community is based on unity and at the end of the day, we are all struggling college students so there's no shame in asking for help or guidance and I'm thankful my community has taught me that because it has definitely helped me in my college journey. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1813,"The values of my family and community have taught me to be selfless and always help people when you can. When applying this to college, I try to help my classmates out when I can but also open myself up to get help from them as well. I also chose my major of biochemistry with one of the reasons being that I could help people in the future, hopefully in some type of medical setting. Furthermore, as an Arab Palestinian and Muslim, I grew up learning a lot about the injustices my communities have faced and the activism done to fight it. This has helped me in college with my ethnic studies and history classes where I apply those experiences to writing essays about historical inequities, social justice movements, etc. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1819,The values of my family have helped me navigate through college by trying my best at everything I do no matter the outcome. My parents are constantly telling me that in whatever I do they will be proud of me for trying my best even if it doesn’t always mean I get the desired outcome. I love my parents because they encourage me to go towards any career I am interested in and they will support me no matter what. In Italian culture the children of the parents often live with the parents for much longer than here in the U.S. and my parents are always telling me that I have a place to stay wherever they are so i am currently living in berkeley with them as I commute to sfsu everyday. Even though bart is annoying sometimes I am very grateful to be able to live at home and go to school.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1802,The values of my family have allowed me to take a kind of a gap year during the pandemic that was necessary for me. I only took one or two classes each semester. I know personally I am not an online learner and struggle so instead of putting myself through that my family supported me in not taking online classes. My family has always wanted me to pursue something that I love so not until I knew I would love Earth Science as a major did I chose that. They have always just wanted me to complete college so just pushing through and knowing I will graduate with their support has helped me.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1821,"As I believed I have mentioned before as the daughter of two immigrants realizing the opportunities I am given because they sacrificed their whole childhood, life, etc. for me to be attending a university and having the ability to pursue my dreams is a big factor for why I don’t take for granted what I have. However, I think there can be cons to this factor and it can be that sometimes it feels like something we are forced to pursue when it gets hard and sometimes it’s more reminding myself that this is something I want to do instead of a chore I have to fulfill to make my parents happy. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1804,"They’ve helped me see the value in my own intellect and dedication. I always get positive motivation from my family when it comes to talking about school…even though a lot of them haven’t actually gotten a college degree. The few that are working on it are a little relatable but not to the extent of a science degree like me.I still rely more on my peers, notes and my professors in order to succeed in my classes. I am still trying to get used to seeing counselors more often, I just have to squeeze in the time.My colleagues/friends who have gone through this before are very helpful and provide me with their knowledge of the subjects I am currently taking, in tutoring form. I really appreciate that they do this and take time out of their day to help me succeed. It is a great resource to have."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1809,"Both of my parents are hard workers, so that kind of motivates me to work hard in college. My parents immigrated from Mexico to the US in the late 80's. Neither of them spoke English, but they somehow managed to raise my four siblings and I pretty decently. My mom stayed at home alone raising us while my dad worked construction jobs to provide for the family. After some years, my dad managed to start his own carpentry/construction business, and he still works every day.At the beginning of my college career, I really had no idea what I was doing. To be honest, I still don't really know what I'm doing I know that I want to work in the veterinary field, so I am majoring in zoology because it's the closest thing to veterinary stuff that this school has to offer. Sometimes, I find myself losing motivation and my grades slip. In times like these, I think back to all the hard work and struggles my parents went through to be able to put me through college, and I feel incredibly guilty. I should have graduated by now, but it just hasn't happened. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1812,"I think my family have been a big part of navigating through college not because they were helpful in case of how to do it because I am a first generation student they helped me by motivating me and telling me that I was able to do what I have done. They motivated me in pushing to be independent, they helped my by making sure I looked for the right resources and as much resources I could find. I know they have been my biggest supporters, they haven't been able to help me in the way they also want to because they don't know how it is but they have forsake been 100% been supportive with my dreams"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1823,"One way that the values from my family have helped me in college is with learning to adapt to a new place and keeping up the motivation to continue going to class and putting in the effort. Another value from my extracurriculars that has helped me is perseverance and not giving up on something right away. This year was an adjustment in everything from where and how I live, meeting new people and figuring out those interactions, and getting back into the flow of things with in person classes. Some of the most basic actions that I've been doing the same way for a long time had to change and I had to adjust with that. For example, one of the constants in my life for a long time was my dance, which is suddenly different. I have to figure out new ways to get to class, and have to deal with finding my place in a new studio. My values from home don't consciously affect my daily life, but have prepared me to adjust and fit into a new environment and to be able to take everything in stride and do well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1805,"Many people in my community and family have not gone through college. In a way, they have helped me because I have always persisted because it was something that I felt was important and not something I commonly saw within my family. My aunt is the one that I attribute to this perseverance. She embedded the importance of college unto me since I was little. I have been side-tracked along the way, many obstacles or because of serving my country, was not able to complete college until now. Although I do not think college is a must in this day and age, I still make it my goal to finish my degree and attribute my willingness to finish school no matter what due to my family and community of where I grew up. On a slightly different topic, I think the curriculum in college is outdated and there needs to be major changes. "
