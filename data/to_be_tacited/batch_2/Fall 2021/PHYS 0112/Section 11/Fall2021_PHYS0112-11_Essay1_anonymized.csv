2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1802,"I’m taking this question quite literally, as I’m only here due to evolution. Over thousands of million years fish have evolved into reptiles and amphibians and then into mammals and humans. I’m sitting in my chair right now and not floating up or to my sides because of the force of gravity. I’m in this classroom right now because I used my legs to walk here at a constant speed. I’m in San Francisco again because there are in person classes available again. I am here in physics because this is a class that is required for me to graduate as an Earth science major. I’m here to help the Earth with climate change and global warming.  I’m here to heal others, learn from others, heal and teach."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1803,"I’m here because honestly it’s one of the classes I need in order to graduate with the major I chose. If I could, I’d avoid physics entirely because my first experience in a physics course was wayyy below my expectations which caused me to dread anything physics related. I do hope this class will somewhat change my perspective of things. I took some physics in high school since I was dual-enrolled in an emergency healthcare class at CCSF and thought it was useful, but in the end I practically learned nothing I didn’t already know or had assumed about physics. I expect to not only learn but to truly understand the concepts in physics since going into emergency care is still my career goal."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1804,"I am here because I am trying to finish my B.S. in Microbiology and move on to possibly a research lab or a hospital clinic to focus on microorganisms in our world. I aim to make my parents and remaining grandparents proud. I took a little break form school, so getting back into it has been challenging but I am determined to push through and finish. I am in physics class to help achieve the goal of getting my B.S. degree and hopefully get to a more prosperous future. I am not the best at math, but I am trying my best to apply my previous knowledge of algebra and take rigorous notes. I am more of a life sciences type of person, but I do like to understand the world around me in any capacity, so this class peaks my interest into how the world works in terms of mathematics that actually apply to my everyday life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,712,"Why am I here? Well if we want to answer that in a way that is quick and logical reasoning that would be because I have to take this course in order to meet my major requirements. As well as I am here at this school because well because I had no other choice... I'm kidding haha. I chose to be here at SFSU to complete my 4 years and still be near home a bit, although I am living on campus because I would be spending a total amount of 4.5 hours on Bart in one day just to get to school and back home. Yet that is another topic for another day, I am here as a Bio(physio) major and I chose this major because it has most of the required classes needed to get into dental school. Yes that is right I want to get into dental school and well I know I get asked but why come to SFSU well I was still deciding on what I wanted to proceed in my major and what I wanted to do till mid-semester of my second year I decided to become an orthodontist. So I am here to meet the requirements of schooling needed to be able to specialize as an orthodontist."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1805,"I am in this class because it is one of the pre-requisites for my major. I see my degree as a stepping stone  into graduate school which is to become a physical therapist or physicians assistant which serves as another stepping stone into a higher purpose. That purpose is to open wellness temples that will serve as a sanctuary that promotes wellness in mind, body and soul. It will be a refuge and place of healing for people of all walks of life. The rich, the poor, from people that desperately need solace, to those are already in a state of happiness. I want it to be a space where all feel accepted and wanted. The reason being that I feel like it is something that our world, especially our country which is so consummated by capitalism, needs. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1806,"In the sense of why am I here in this class, I need it for my GE's for my major. In the sense of why am I in my major, I want to be a role model to people like me who don't have anyone that is like them in the field. I never had someone that looks like me to look up to in the STEM field, so I want to be the role model I never had to kids like me. In the sense of why am I here on this planet in this world, I am here to help people I think. Although I don't know what exactly I want to do/ what job I want to go into, I do know that I want to help people. As long as I am doing that, I'll be satisfied. I don't exactly know why I'm here, in fact, I don't think ANYBODY does. We're all just kind of living just to live. We don't really know why we exist, we just know that we do and we try to make the most of it. I've noticed recently that my attitude has been kind of bad. I think I need to try to have a better, more positive attitude about things so that I can be a better person. I'm kind of a bitch sometimes. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1807,"Why am I here in SF? Trying together my bachelor's degree in physiology to get into vet school. While being half across the globe away from my family. It's definitely a choice I made to get out of there, but is being is SF really were I want to be? Although compared to there, it's a definite yes. But thinking of completing my studies to get into vet school puts a whole different pressure on me. Do I really wanna become a vet, or is it just the easier option to keep me from having to go back there for longer. But how can I decide that being here is the best choice I have, when I haven't looked into other options. Although I'm okay with being here now, but do I want to continue to live here after completing my degree?"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1808,"I am here in this physics class because I am an environmental science and geography major and need to know basic physics in order to graduate. I, surprisingly, have found to really enjoy taking this class, but have been rethinking my major. Of course, this is my last year and I will not actually be doing that, but I wish I had majored in English. I was always afraid to because the lack of jobs, but now that I have reached my last year and the realization of life after graduating becomes more visible, I am beginning to face the fact that I don't really want to work a job in either geography or environmental science. I love the subject and learning about it all is so fascinating, but I have felt restricted with creative endeavors as all of my focus is on logistical thinking when it comes to school. I love reading and writing and my yearning to know more about its history is more prevalent than ever. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1809,I am here for a better future. My parents moved here from Mexico for the sole purpose of giving their kids a better future. I kind of hate them for it because there’s so much pressure on me to succeed but I am also very thankful for it. They gave up their own goals to help my siblings and I pursue ours. I am also here to earn money. I am also sacrificing my own goals to make a better future for myself. I really love art and graphic design but realistically I know that I cannot make a living in that career so I am choosing something else that I also like. I am here out of spite to prove those who told me that I couldn’t go far in life that I can. I am here to beat statistics. Statistically most low income Latino transgender people do not go to college but I have been blessed with circumstances that have allowed me to get this far and I am going to use them to my advantage.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1810,"I am here in this class because it is a requirement for my major. I have never taken a physics class before and was/am a bit intimated by the subject. As of right now I feel a bit lost, but do understand some of what we’re discussing. Although I meet the pre reqs to be in this class, I feel as if some of my classmates are at a higher level than me. It’s a bit intimidating because it’s clear they’re more knowledgeable on the topic than I am and it makes me hesitant to ask questions since everyone seems to be on it. This goes the same for the labs, my group seems to understand more than me so when working together I am often the last to speak to avoid making myself look like I’m lost. That being said, I do want to be at the same level as my classmates and am trying hard to put the work in to understand these topics. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1811,"I am here because life is weird and that is just what happened. I used to live in SoCal when I was younger and then my parents moved our family to Mississippi for my high school years. Those years were not fun and I had a lot of desire to move back home and see all my old friends. After high school I did move back but I realized that nothing was the same and I felt out of place. Feeling like there was nothing else for me there, I decided to move in with friends who were living in Daly City for school. It was a big risk for me because I have traditional parents who disowned me for moving away from the family. Women don't usually move out of the family house if they are not married in our culture. I moved away from my house with only my first month's rent and only had a penny in my bank account. I eventually made up with my parents and got their support again. Now I live in the bay area and feel like I can call this are my home. That's important to me because I've never had a place that I felt like was my home."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1812,"I would say I’m here because I want a better future for myself and my family! For my family I would say because it would show how hard I worked to accomplish what I would be in the future. They would see that I didn’t just cheat myself through life but built my future from scratch. It would also start a better future for future generations, a more successful life instead of working super duper hard for little pay when I could just work 2 times less and get paid better and do something I actually love to do. I do this for myself because as of right now even a part time job is so hard for me because I always dread to actually go to work. I hate working so hard at something that is only paying me the bare minimum and I just want to work a good job and a job I love. I am here for a better life, I am here for a better education , more school, more money, get a job I love to wake up to, a better future for my future family. I am here for my education. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1813,"I took this question to mean why am I in college and that answer is pretty simple, a university degree is a must-have goal for me. I want to be able to live the life I want and I don't think I can achieve that without a degree. I want to be able to help my family, be financially stable, enjoy my hobbies without constantly worrying about whether I can afford stuff, travelling, etc. I can't get the career I want in the science/medical field without it. I'm also here to make myself and my family proud because while I know college can be stressful and hard at times, I also know that I can do it. It'll all be worth it once I'm able to do what I'm studying for, helping people with science. Lastly, I'm in college because at the root of it all knowledge and education are very important to me and I know I'll be very proud of myself once I can officially call myself a scientist/biochemist/pharmacist or whatever I end up doing."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1814,"Why are we alive? The answer is simple: there is no answer. We can try as much as we may like, but ultimately there will never be an easy, certifiably concrete means to definitively ascertain the method behind the madness of our existence. By doing the math alone, you will probably know that we should not be living, yet here we are. Our essence is that of dead stars, long lost to the eons of time. At one point, the entire universe was one. Now, with the big bang, we have oscillated into distinct particles, waves, protons, neutrons, and molecules. From quarks, and the fusion of hydrogen over time, we eventually became separate elements. From hydrogen, there arose all sorts of new elements, which originated from nuclear fusion within stars. Over billions of years, these electron and protons stabilized into elements that react with one another to form the chemical foundation for galaxies, stars, and, over the eons, planets which could support life. From these planets, the proper circumstances took place to allow for reactions to form amino acids and abiogenesis. From this soup, we arose as a bacterium capable of evolving over time. Over billions of years, we grew into the sentient beings we are today - and we are the only known ones in the entire universe. Why did all this happen? Was it destiny? Was it fate? Or, was this all just random happenstance, chemical reactions, and luck?  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1815,Why am I here? On this planet I am here because my parents decided that they wanted a crying baby. I am in this country because my parents decided that our home country wasn’t safe and they wanted my brother and I to have a better life. Why am I in California? I am here because it is a highly Hispanic populated state and they knew one person here who welcomed them with opened arms. Why am I in the Bay Area? I am here because my parents settled here. But I’m also still here because it was either I accepted a full ride to college through outside scholarships or I went to a college far from home (like I have planned for) but I would graduate with thousands of dollars in debt. Why am I here at SFSU? Then though I only applied to SFSU as a safety school and I have very strong negative around the school I am here because it allows me to graduate college debt free and further advance my education. Why am I here in physics? I am here because I was too scared to take the AP Physics course in high school and because it will help me get my BS in biophysio and further down the line obtain my MD or PA school.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1816,"The reason why I am here, at San Francisco State University, is to be able to get my bachelor's degree. My future goal in life is to practice a profession in medicine. In order to get there, I have to first finish my undergraduate studies so that I can be able to apply to medical schools. In terms of why I'm in this class, first of all, I need this class since it's one of my major's requirements. Second, I'm in this class because I've never taken a physics class at all in my life and I have always been interested in what it is about.  I'm here with a purpose to learn new things and to graduate in order to be able to make it closer to meeting my ultimate goal. I just have to make sure that I enjoy whatever I do since I've always noticed that I do really good in anything as long as I enjoy it. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1817,"I am here at SFSU because I want to help my community when I’m done with school. I want to be able to get the education my family couldn’t get. I want to setup future generations in my family for success. As a person of color going into stem I want to be the person that advocates for my community. I grew up in Watsonville Santa Cruz county, and we rely on our beaches and rivers. I want to continue to protect these environments so I can protect my town. With climate change rapidly increasing, I can already see its affects in my hometown.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,543,"Kimberly Ramirez Being in college is an ever-changing experience for me. But I am trying to figure out exactly why I am doing what I am doing. Over the past few months, I have been having thoughts about wanting to change my routine and career path. Originally, I wanted to focus on becoming a marine biologist, but I am not as enthusiastic about it now as I was before. I am now leaning towards a career path towards biology or medicine. After talking with my parents and myself, I am planning, after graduating from SF State, to enroll in a 2-year program that focuses on a medical career such as pharmacy or technicians. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1818,"Why am I here? That is the question. To be here or not to be here. I think I am here because I have to. My body and consciousness are in auto-pilot. I wake up at my alarm this morning, groggy. I didn't want to wake up. I want to stay in bed and sleep in, but the alarm went off again and again. I didn't want to turn off my alarm even though I was getting annoyed by it. I am afraid I might fall asleep again and not wake up super late. I finally stood up and make breakfast. I had 2 pieces of bacon. Yumm yumm yummm. Some two eggs, scrambled and rice. The smell of bacon while it cooks in the pan was the best smell ever. It definitely woke me up. I ate my breakfast with banana ketchup. Most people that hear banana ketchup feels so disgusted with how it sound. Banana ketchup, who eat that? Me! I love banana ketchup. It's the best ketchup in the world. Add some mayonnaise in that and some black pepper, yum. Anyway. I finished my breakfast brush my teeth and went to the gym. I couldn't find any parking. It was getting kind of annoying but I finally did at the end. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1819,"I am here because 19 years ago in Bari, Italy my mother gave birth to a little baby girl named Jennifer Ashley D'Ambrosio. After 5 blissful years in Italy my parents decided that our life was too easy and peaceful so we moved to the bay area with my two older siblings. I grew up in the same house as my mother in North Berkeley with my grandfather. Growing up in Berkeley opened my eyes to many possibilities. In high school I was able to learn about animals which I had always had a yearning passion to care for and learn about. When I was younger I was a huge horse girl and every Saturday morning at 7:30 my dad would take me to San Ramon which is an hour away from where we lived to go to horseback riding lessons. I loved it there, well partially. I loved being with the horses and grooming them and just watching their behavior. I would sometimes try talking to them to get some sort of response. However no matter how hard I tried to talk to these horses they never responded. That did not stop my desire to be with animals. In middle school I started volunteering at my local animal shelter so my parents would get me a dog. Then in High school I learned about rhinos and elephants being endangered species. That was when I decided to go into zoology. Therefore the reason I am in this class is because I want to get a degree in zoology and this class is a requirement for this degree. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1820,"I'm interpreting this as ""why am I here"" like in this school, or in school in general. Well, for why am I in this specific school, it was either SFSU or SSU (Sonoma State) or East Bay, and honestly I had never heard of East Bay until junior year of high school and between Sonoma and SFSU I feel like SFSU was a better-known school, plus it was in the city so I liked the idea of being over here even if it is an hour drive here and back home (Novato). Also, my brother went to SSU and I want to be able to show my mom a degree from somewhere else. Now as for why I'm in school, I have no idea. I'm seeing where the road takes me, but I know I like biology so that's why my major is biology and I can have the degree as like a backup plan for later. I really don't know but I'll see where the road takes me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1821,"I think today this question got to me a lot more than it would have on any regular day and it is because right now I think I'm at a position where I am so happy we are back on campus but I also really miss my family and I realized that it is affecting me more than I would like when it comes to school. I am here because I want to learn about physics because frankly I do find it interesting and it is also something I have to learn and I mean really learn if I want to take the MCAT and go to medical school. I am trying to get back in the groove of loving science because my first semester was amazing I loved BIO 230 and I loved how it was taught and I did so well in that class. However, this last semester in chem I was very lost most of the time, and my lab professor was very passionate about chem and always wanted us to know that he was very smart so he got very frustrated with us whenever we didn't understand something and it made me dread science for a while. So right now I am here to remind myself that science can be fun and enjoyable and that I can learn what I need to learn without feeling dumb for asking questions. Also, here to remind myself that I can do this even when it gets hard. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,11,1822,"""Why am I here?"" I interpret this question as why I am here in this class. I am here in this class because it is a general ed requirement for my cell and molecular bio major. I wish in the requirements for each major they would explain the use for each class you have to take and the advantages of the class. I know I may sound negative about the class but it reminds me of how college wants people to be well rounded individuals. Which I think is annoying, cause I could finish my required science classes within two years and the next two years take electives like human anatomy that would be useful for my future career. I don't understand why I must take philosophy and geography when I want to become a pathologist assistant. I want to cut into human remains not look at random tectonic plates and go over philosophical questions. I wish college allowed people to just take the classes they need for their future not instead of adding all these excess classes. On the topic of being able to take electives that could help me understand my field. I really want to take the human anatomy class because the lab is based on cadaver work which is very useful for my work."
