2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1771,"One major value that I was taught by my mother is that ""it's only temporary"" This statement alone has got me through so many things. Any time I've ever encountered a hard time, I've never really let it get to me. Granted, at the moment, whatever situation that was going on, affected me, but I always knew that it was only gonna be a few days, and then it'll be like it never happen or I made the adaptions that were needed. I have most definitely taken this statement through college because I've always just known that whatever the struggle is in the moment, ill get through it, and eventually, it'll be a minuscule part compared to the overall story of me. Values, whether they come from community or family, are very important because they shape the next generations. Just like my mom taught me that it's only temporary, I will teach this to my children and hopefully, they teach it to their children. Although such a simple and small saying, it holds so much power.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1777,"My family is very ordinary. My parents have low education and simple jobs. My parents are not strict in my education. I can do whatever if I can. Although they asked me to take my studies seriously, they didn't ask me to get high grades or go to famous universities. I've never been hard on myself. So I won't give myself too much pressure in college and choose some easy things to do. My choice for myself is also simple, ordinary university, major, and work. Simple, but also rich college life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1761,"Brook Miller  November 18, 2021  Reflection Journaling #5     “How have the values of my community or my family (of the origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?”     How my values of my family have helped me navigate through college is that I grew up thinking that I can do whatever I put my mind to, that if I want to do it I should do everything in my power to get it done. I have always been pushed to do my best and keep working hard. Also, the fact that you want to have a job that you enjoy and don’t have to work hard in it. So, with these mindsets that I have what type of job I want and how I should act. It has helped me in a way for navigating through college to be the best that I can be and do get college done so that I can get a job that enjoys and that I have options for what career path I want to follow."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1773,"My family and community have not helped me navigate through college. My own academic counselor has even provided me with wrong information countless times, due to his lack of competency at his own job. Having little financial resources has impacted me to choosing SFSU, being one of the cheapest state schools, which is the only influence my familial ties has had on my college journey."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1769,"A value that my family holds is that education should be the top priority and you need education and good grades to have a good life. My family helped me in college because all my life they encouraged and pushed me when it came to my studies. They would take me to the library every day even when it's summer break to read. My mom would prepare her own homework where I had to practice math problems and English every day when I'm not in school. I had to do these things at such a young age and I believe it has helped me in the long run. I developed studying skills and learning skills at a faster paste because not only I was learning in school, I was learning outside of school. The extra studying prepared me for college and I'm able to use the skills I developed over the course of my life into college. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1772,"The values of my community and family have helped me throughout college due to the support they have provided for me since the first day I started freshman semester. I would say that community has been a lot more potent compared to my family aspect bec​​ause being the second child to attend a college after my sister, I was always involved in sports and in college. When I joined the soccer team in college, it changed my life completely. Playing a sport made me  more outgoing  and I couldn’t thank college enough for turning me into the person I am today. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1766,"I am the youngest of my family of 6 as well as the first to attend college. I come from a poor, lower and working class family, so college has been a huge eye opener for me. I find myself not really fitting in because of my background especially with my roommates. We all have completely different childhoods, but i think that makes us appreciate what we have. I believe the differnces in our lives can make them become different people because they will begin to appreciate what they have in life. My family values are deeply rooted in me and have made me the women I am today. I have learned to be a patient, open minded,  hard-working, and kind individual. I thank my family for teaching me to be a good person, but also to challenge ideas i do not ethically agree with. I am thankful for my family and these ideals have helped me so far, succeed in college :) "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1504,"If you would ask me this a year or two ago I would say that the values of my family have helped me greatly when it comes to navigating my college experience. That they’ve been supportive and been there for me when I need them. As I explore and come to the end of my college experience, I would say yes, they were there for me financially, but as far as helping me with my education as well as being there to support me mentally in this new environment that would be a big challenge. During my time at state my community has shifted over and over and over again so I would say no one real community has helped me more than the other. Possibly educators at my school like tutors, advisors, and occasionally my peers have been the ones that led me on a brighter path then the one that I’ve taken previously. I think maybe if I ever lived on campus or not with my friends that I would have a bigger sense of community at SFSU and possibly be thriving."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1768,"The values that have been instilled within my by my overall community including my parents, friends, family, and loved ones in general greatly impact the will of my character. Through college the aspects I like best of the ones I love most I exude through my everyday life, and although they may not all be people who are of high success, I exude their characteristics because they are worthy of high success, and through the success, familial wealth, and strong relationships I plan to build I can show that what they've done for me was worth it, and show that anyone could be successful through exuding good habits. For my community, my goal within my career is to make health care more affordable, and or find reason for things that primarily happen in poorer communities. Through my career as being a doctor and or a medical scientists I hope to find things to make health care more accessible to everyone."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1775,"I come from a mixed background. Both my parents are from Brooklyn, NY but my father comes from a very Irish background and my mother is Puerto Rican. These communities my seem very different on the outside but I have found that the values of these communities are very similar. Family is always the number one priority. You are as loving and close to your siblings as you are your 3rd cousins. You would do anything for your family. Having always know that anyone on either side of my family would be there for me, would love and support me has been an incredible gift as I navigate college. When I got a summer internship in New York so many members of my family offered me a spare room or couch to sleep on so I could afford to go there for the summer and work toward my career. I have learned from their kindness and generosity and have been sure to also extend the same to not just my family but my school community as well. My old apartment was always know to be a safe place to go when someone needed somewhere to stay. Whenever someone needs help and I have a way to assist I always do my best to support. My family is also a very openminded one. No matter your sexuality, race, etc. we welcome all. This was something I learned early in my college career to appreciate. I went to 4 years of college in Texas. In October of my freshman year, my roommate, who came from a very conservative family, came out to me. I was the first person she had ever told because she had never met someone during her time living in a small baptist community outside of Waco Texas that was openly liberal and supportive of the LGBT community. Over the 5 years I have known her she has become proud and open of who she is and I hope that the love and support I showed her early on in her journey gave her reassurance that there will always be people who will accept her exactly as she is."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1770,"My values of family and community has had a great impact on my life, especially with college. Growing up in such a bad environment and being the firsts of our entire family to leave it to find a better life is something I constantly look back at to help me see how far I’ve come. Being an immigrant is hard sometimes, I see how some of my friends who’ve had much given to them from the minute they were born and how they value things proves that many of us immigrants must push a lot harder, so we won’t go back to where it all began and to work for all the sacrifices we had to do for this position. I want to be able to make my parents proud and my family in my motherland proud, they push me to continue school even when things are tough, they remind me of why I’m even here in the first place."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1762,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""I owe alot to my family in the way they raised me that has tremendously helped navigate through life in college. They are my support system in every way possible so I value their existence and helpfulness. I could care less about my community though it's literally an ass town that I could care less about. I am planning to move to SF this spring so leaving behind the only people I care about in this town is a little scary. I hope to build a sense of community for myself at the school with like minded individuals and just anyone really. I know that it'll be challenging at first so I'm very anxious but at the same time excited for what's to come. I wish to navigate smoothly academically more than anything."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1763,"Both my community and family have guided my way through life. I started working at 16 and a really important part of being 16 is learning how to drive and getting ready for college. Once you're 18 you go to college for four years and leave with a degree. My community has really helped me spiritually. It's important to move forward in anything that you do and to take advantage of everyday. Also if you enjoy what you do , keep doing it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1765,"The values of my family that helped me navigate through college is the ideal of having and holding myself to a higher standard when it comes to going to college and just doing my work in general. I tend to not put off work when going to school but honestly because of the pandemic I have been getting more lazy since I am at home which makes it hard since I am more comfortable and not in the mindset of school. Though when I did go to high school, I did tend to do my work as soon as possible which because of my family's ideal did help me through high school and will in college when I am able to go to SF State next semester. This along with the ideals that when I go to college it is not only for myself but also for my family who will be able to share in my success when I get my degree. So also with the ideals of independence in myself will continue to grow since at a certain my family can help since with them not having a high education makes it so that there is a sense of growing self independence that we have to learn as we go through college so that along with the ideals of a good work ethic and independence will help me through these years of college as I continue on.   "
