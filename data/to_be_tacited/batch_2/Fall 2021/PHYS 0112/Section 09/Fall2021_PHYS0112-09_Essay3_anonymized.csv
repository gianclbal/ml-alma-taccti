2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1761,"Brook Miller  October 14, 2021  Reflection Journaling #3     “What do I do when life gets challenging?”     What do I do when life gets challenging is, well it depends on the situation because not every challenge that you face in life will always be the same. However, for most of my life challenges, I would stop, take a deep breath, and look at the situation. Find out what the challenge is that I am facing, if it’s one that I can deal with on my own I deal with it, but it’s okay to ask for help when I really need it or just need it. I always work to try my best to get around the challenging situation and look towards a better outcome. I try not to panic and freak out as they would make the situation way worse. I just relax, take a deep breath and get it done with. I would say for the most part that these methods do work, well they work for me and I’m always able to get past this challenge especially when I have help from family and friends."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1774,"When things get challenging I feel like I become inconsistent and let pressure and failure get to me. Sometimes, when I find myself in trouble, I tend to shy away from the challenge and avoid what I need to do. However, I do tend to get it done in the end, even if the path there is filled with ups and downs. I tend to be resilient and pull through in the end, but I need to find better ways to handle my problems and stop running from them. In order to help me with this I recently began seeing a therapist to guide me and provide techniques to counterbalance procrastination and anxiety. This is a big step for me because I usually hide myself away and create distractions for myself rather than reaching out for assistance."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1764,"When life gets challenging, I tend to take a step back and remind myself why I am doing the difficult task at hand. Often with school, I find myself feeling overwhelmed, flustered even. When this occurs, I take a break and give myself some “me” time. I usually go pet/cuddle my dog for 10 minutes, go for a walk, or stretch and do yoga. I do this to give my mind a break and to allow it to reset before sitting back down to complete said challenging task. Over the last few years of my college experience, I have learned how to time manage and have found that self-care time is equally as important as doing well academically. This mental break is a good way to check in with my mental health.If my personal life gets challenging, I will meditate, call friends or family, or go shopping (bad I know lol). Target is my guilty pleasure! At this point in life I have a few good friends who I can count on to be there for me if I need that, and that is always reassuring."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1766,"When I am stressed out, I usually tend to get in my head a lot. I ruminate and think okay i have to do this and then this and also this! I struggle with overwhelming myself for no reason, but overtime, Ive began to learn what can make me fell better and less overwhelmed. I make sure to be easy on myself. I can get caught up with wanting to get my work done or understand a concept without taking a break. Ive realized that when i do work without worrying too much, I do a much better job. Ive also learned that removing myself from my room/ study area i can clear my mind a bit. I have also found that making a list to get stuff done and it helps me spread out the work i need to get done. Its hard to stay calm under stressful times and I'm still learning to that. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1771,"When life gets challenging I typically workout. When my life feels like a complete mess, which seems to be happening more often than not lately, I go to the gym and work out. Working out gives me a sense of calmness and a sense of stability in a way. It also takes my mind off of everything that's been stressing me out. Although I have a novel of other things I need to be doing, taking a break from the overwhelming list for two hours to go workout helps me go back into the list with a set of fresh eyes. Lately, I've also been trying to just sit down and do what's stressing me out. I used to be good and on top of everything, but recently life has taken that control away from me, so I'm trying to get that control back and be on top of all my assignments and such! "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1773,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?""When life gets challenging I either rise to the occasion or I give up completely. I am a very bipolar person, I'm hot -  I'm cold, I'm sad - I'm happy, I am highly motivated - I have no motivation. Honestly, it just depends on my mental space and mood. When I absolutely need to do something that is stressful, I first take a deep breath to calm my nerves, then I use positive affirmations. I tell myself this is only one miniscule moment of my life and I have persevered through worse."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1504,"When life gets challenging, I spend a lot of time talking to my friends and family especially my mom. I usually end up talking to my mom like 6 hours a day that way I don't have to do anything else. Plus, she always ends up giving me a list of stuff she needs done. I listen to music; I’ll turn on my salt lamp and burn a candle and just sit there in something soft until I’m relaxed. I try not to get too deep when I’m in a tough spot I always try to find a little distraction like reading fantasy books or listening to audiobooks. I watch too much YouTube and go out with friends maybe sleepover at their house I just sleep, and I'll sleep in late. I try not to dwell on whatever is going on, so I don’t get overwhelmed and consumed by my thoughts. So, I just try to do a bunch of little things to keep my spirits up. That way I can push through slow and steady."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1775,"When things get tough or challenging I often rely on my friends, family and dog for support. The last year and a half have been so incredibly challenging and heart breaking for so many reasons and I have found the incredibly supportive and loving people around me have been crucial. I have tried things like deep breathing and meditation for times of panic and have picked up relaxing hobbies like reading knitting to relax me. Most of the challenges I feel that I face  are internal so much of the work I have to do is internal. I was also finally diagnosed with OCD and anxiety and the medication I have been prescribed to deal with that has been truly life changing and it has made me feel incredibly lucky and privileged to have access to psychiatric help and resources. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1763,"When life gets challenging one thing I remember is a quote by FDR `` we have nothing to fear but fear itself."" This quote always keeps me grounded. We experience life day to day , and we find ourselves in paths that can be difficult. It's important to understand that these times will pass, and also to be compassionate with yourself. Sometimes bad things happen to us for no reason and most of the times we don't cause it to happen. Life is beautiful and your perception plays a big part in how you approach life regularly.  I ask for help when I feel troubled in my classes. Asking for help is important for any kind of situation. Some people have good advice and you can learn a lot. Asking for help does take time but its important that you do it. Another quote I think about is “ whatever you do in life will be insignificant but its very important that you do it ""Gandhi ."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1769,"When things get challenging I tend to overthink and stress myself out, so most of the time I sleep it off which is bad. Lately though I been trying to fix that because it's a bad habit to have. So what I do is I try to take breaks and do things that will help take the stress of my shoulders like making stickers or doing anything art. To help with this, I recently opened a small business that sells homemade stickers that I've made. I also play games on breaks to help get my mind off things as well. When I'm done taking a break, I decide to go back on my homework that was stressing me out and try to attempt it once again. Since I'm not as stressed I can do a lot better and think straight when im doing my homework or anything that is challenging me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1768,"Usually when life gets challenging I tend to beat my self up, and think about what I could be doing better. I evaluate the negative parts, or interactions, overall that I've been having and try to cut them out of my immediate interactive circle. While doing this I really tend to focus on self care, and making sure that I'm putting myself to perform at that best that I really can. Things I'll do generally would be: starting to go to bed/wake up earlier, eating healthier, major clean ups, ridding of unneeded or distracting things, spending less time with friends, etc. I generally do these things to ensure on the personal front that everything is taken care of. When faced with these walls of stress I try to remove all external distractions, freeing myself to give my full attention to my responsibilities. I've had the most success dealing with stress related issues this way, but am currently reading to find new ways."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1762,"Reflection #3 - What do I do when life gets challenging? It's honestly a mix of flight or fight and withdrawal. I panic when the citation gets bad and I shut down or do whatever it takes to get through it. Life is a succession of occurrences rather than a single major event. That is to say, if one or more occurrences become problematic, the same cannot be said for the remainder of life's events. If we view life from a long-term perspective and handle it as such, we will be able to overcome the challenges of life's present events or occurrences. So take everything in stride. Appreciate what you already have and approach challenging situations with an open mind. That's the only way to live a life that matters. I try to do what I can to make the difficulties that I'm going through seem like they are a part of the process."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1770,"When life gets challenging, I often try and fix whatever the problem is, whatever is making my life harder. I try my best to not avoid the situation and fully face it because then it’ll just stress me out even more and pile up if I run away from it. I also go to others for guidance and opinions because sometimes I only see one or two sides of things and allowing others to help me allows me to see other perspectives to the situation. Another thing I do is journal. If sometimes my challenges are too personal and I don’t feel comfortable enough to share with others or to ask people for help I do some journaling because It helps me analyze the situation and allows me to get everything out of my chest, all the emotions and challenges that are messing with my inner peace are written down."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1765,"So when it comes to the life challenges I tend to do the flight thing where I don’t really fight it since I dunno, fighting usually isn’t my style of reaction when it comes to things in life. Usually what I tend to do is find a solution that doesn’t require the most force or effort from me because I guess I don’t like to make things worse or complicate an already messed up scenario. Now in the things that I do to actually cope with the situation I just kind of like to drown my sorrows with the help of YouTube, HBOMax and videogames. Other than that I am a Catholic person of faith so I do also tend to turn to the Lord for ways of dealing with the difficulties of the world. So yeah I just kind of let the worries of the world roll onto me and I just let it go which could be a good and bad thing but usually in the end it kind of ends up working out for me in the end somehow."
