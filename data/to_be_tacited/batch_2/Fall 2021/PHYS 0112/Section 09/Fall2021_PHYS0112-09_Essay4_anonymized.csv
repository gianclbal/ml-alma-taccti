2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1761,"Brook Miller  October 28, 2021  Reflection Journaling #4     “What resources do I have to support me?”     What resources that I must support me are? Well, I have many different types of resources that support me. My number one support system is and will always be my intermediate family, my mom, dad, sister, and brother. They are my number one support system that I know I can go to when I need some sort of advice. When I need a second option and they help me so that I can do my best in school. My next support system is my extended family, I am close to my mom's side of my family and they are happy and support me when I made my school decisions, they are also someone I can call when I need help. Now, this isn’t a support system, but they do support me finically. Since my dad is a veteran the states pay for some of my schoolings, so I get help finically. Also, my school is a resource that supports me they have all these things that can help me if I were in trouble. I have all these resources that can support me, do I take advantage of all of them no not really, but I am grateful that I have the ability to get these resources when needed."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1772,The resources that I have that supports me are my class mates and the lectures alone. Putting a lot of direction and willing to learn all the new materials that are give to us. I know we are going through hard times in life and if im Abel to help my class mate achieve there goal in class im wining in life.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1766,"I have many resources available for me on campus and in my personal life. I have support system from my family and friends which much me to be better everyday. Our campus also has many resources available ranging from academic , financial, mental, and health resources. I really don't make use of the resources available as much as i should, but I know there is so much out there that can be of service to me. I currently do take advantage of the Cal-fresh help form the government that essentially helps me pay for my groceries. This resource is perfect, because I have a bill that I do not need to worry about. I realize that i need to sister applying to a lot more scholarships because there are so many possibilities out there for financial help which i really do need! I have to start making sure I'm taking advantage of the resources around me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1770,"I am very lucky to have many resources that can provide much help. My main resources are withing San Francisco State University’s programs. There have been several times through out my college career where I have struggled financially and SFSU has provided some grants through out the pandemic that have helped me a lot. They also have many mental health programs that I have attended during hard times with school or my personal life, they provide a safe space for students to share their experiences and let loose. I also use the help of several advisors in my department to allow me to create a gradating plan, what courses to take, when to take them, or what other things can I involve myself in to succeed throughout college and in my future. There are other resources outside of school like my family and friends, they have helped me get to where I am today."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1765,"The resources that I have to support me are the library from the University which is a nice source of information for us to use when we need it. The other resources include my family members especially my sister since she also goes to SF State University, so she is a very good source of information and is a person who is someone I can relate and talk to about school. That along with my friends are a good source of relaxation so when I want to just forget school I can go to them and let it all go away. So overall I do have a good source of support in my journey of university and hopefully with the fact that I am going to go to SF State next semester and then I can meet new people and have even more support. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1773,"The resources I have to support me are class PowerPoints/presentations, the book, Khan academy, my teachers, my friends. I will continue to ask questions when in need of help and hopefully I will have the support I need. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1504,"I guess the resources I have to support me are my peers and my notes as well as the online videos. I have a tutor that helps me as well sometimes, but they are not always available I wish I was able to go to office hours, but I always have a class or work to do at that time. My best resource is asking questions, but sometimes I feel like I ask too many because everyone is getting the assignment except for me. I do enjoy working in the breakout rooms even if it is awkward usually we can help each other get the work done before class is over. Also watching the lecture videos help the personal ones you do more than the pre-recorded lectures on youtube from that guy. I use the book sometimes to look up equations sometimes to help with the challenge question if we don't go over it as a class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1774,"The resources I have to support me when life and school get challenging include my family, friends, and the therapist I recently began seeing. I have a bad tendency of keeping quiet and keeping to myself when I am having anxiety or falling behind in my responsibilities. To help with this I have been talking to a therapist and I also opened up to a couple friends I made in my physics lecture class. We are a study group and it is filled with a bunch of young women who have shared similar experiences and worries. It has made me feel less alone and more confident in opening up. This pattern of not reaching out for help has become a pattern for years, so I am focusing on becoming more consistent and reading the signs for when I need help and using the resources I have around me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1763,"I am a FAFSA student, I receive financial help from them and I'm currently applying for CalGrant. Until I got older I realized that the money that my family earned was very important and we needed that money to survive. Before transferring to SFSU I worked at Tesla and I was very happy that my FAFSA could help me pay my tuition. Another resource I have are my teachers when asking for help. Other resources I have are my parents and friends to help me with my school work if needed."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1776,I have a lot of resources to support me while I'm in college and away from home. I know that college is not cheap so I apply for fafsa every year in October and I also search for other grants and scholarships to reduce the cost of my attendance here. This school year I am living in manzanita square and I was aware that these dorms do not come with a meal plan included so I take advantage of the pantry on campus and I also applied for EBT and it has really helped me a lot. It's such a wait off of my shoulders to know that I won't go hungry and I'll always have food in my fridge due to EBT and the pantry on campus. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1769,"The tutoring program they have at SFSU really helps me with school, especially with calculus since I'm not the best at math. That's the only resource I use at SFSU. I mainly use resources that I have access to on my IPAD. I use a few apps that support me and just help me in general with my life. I use this app called Notion, which is a planner app. It helped me so much with scheduling and time management. Another app I use is notability which is note taking app on the iPad and its helps me keep organize and have my notes organized in one place. These resources had helped me better my time management and it helped me not fail any of my classes so far. I could use a little bit more resources from the school because I feel sometimes the online tutoring that sfsu holds is not the best because we have the schedule ahead of time/"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1771,"Lately, I've been struggling with figuring this out. However, after taking some time to not only assess the situations life presented me but the resources that I have to support me while going through the hands I was dealt. Initially, the one and only resource I could think of was my mom. I've been going through a really tough time this semester since separating from my narcissistic father. Throughout this difficult and exhausting time, my mom has been my lifesaver. I would have not made it through any of this without her. Besides my mom, I have my grandma and grandpa who are always there and willing to support me no matter when and no matter where. I know that I also have my professors and the resources the school offers, I just wasn't at a place where I was ready to go and talk to people other than those who I had too. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1775,"In terms of resources my parents are immensely helpful. They support me in all ways. They let me live at home without having to pay rent, they pay my tuition, they pay for a private physics tutor. They support me emotionally as well and are always there for reassurance or comfort. They have very kindly put me in a position. that allows my full attention to be on school and my future which I am incredibly privileged and grateful for. My mom taught me from a young age to appreciate education. She always told me that someone could take a home, a car, etc but when you have a degree no one can ever take that away from you and it will help you in so many ways. That is a lesson I am very grateful for. The resources I most take advantage of in physics is the tutor I go to. I get to learn the topics we are going over at a slower speed and they are explained in a way specifically designed to my learning style. That combined with the financial and time freedom my parents have provided me are my most valuable resources."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1764,"I have many resources available to me. For this class specifically, I find help within my other classmates. I try this option first and then if I am still struggling, I will reach out to the tutoring center. Sometimes a simple google search is the answer to my problem - as much as I would like to, I don't always have the formulas memorized lol.My friends are also a great support system. They are always there for me if I need a break from life or school and remind me that sometimes it is okay to have a life outside of school too!I am feeling pretty distracted today (personal life), so I don't have much to say - unfortunately. I will say though that when all else fails, my greatest support system is my dog. I live alone and her and I have the best time being there for each other! She is currently sitting with her head in my lap - she is the cutest thing."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1762,"""What resources do I have to support me?""I remember seeing a flyer for a program that they offer at the school in my email a couple weeks into the semester. The Cooperative Education Program offers students an opportunity to receive credit for academically relevant field assignments in which theoretical course work can be applied to real-world problems. Students may receive from one unit for part-time work to 12 units for full-time work. I just pasted its mission statement or whatever because i couldn for the life of me really tell ya. I mean I literally use whatever is  available to me whether that be my classmates or the advisors or even the internet when needed. Honestly being your own support system in itself is a really good thing as you have the ability to do things yourself. If not just go with the flow and look through the resource and support services tab on the sfsu website."
