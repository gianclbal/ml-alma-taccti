2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1772,"Know exactly what I need to accomplish and what I hope to gain from doing so, is to finish homework early each week. Homework turned in at least one day before the due date every week for one month.  I will find a study system that works best for me so I can do well on in the class and I will also look at a minimum of three different study strategies to better understand my options. I’d like to find a study strategy that plays up my strengths. That way, I can better prepare to get an A in the class. My goal is to take all the knowledge that I've learned in to the out side world and help others if need it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1771,"My goals for this semester are to just pass my classes. This class is helping me pass my physics class. Being able to come into a smaller group and do a task that is more hands-on approach than the lecture offers, which is helpful. The only reason I'm taking this class, as in physics, is because I have to as a prerequisite for my major which is Cell and Molecular Biology. Otherwise, I would not be putting myself through this much stress. I also want to get this degree so I will be able to go into the medical field after I graduate. This will make it so I'm doing something I enjoy, but can also do all of the stuff I want to do without having to worry. I know that putting in all of this work right now will be well worth it in the end."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1766,"My goals this year are to change the way i learn. During the pandemic and now transitioning back to in person classes, I've noticed that my way of learning has changed a lot. I have seen that i pay more attention to the material now comparing to before where i would just go with the flow of class even if i was confused. I specifically have seen a change in my learning with the subject of Physics in particular. During lecture, I find myself struggling to understand the concepts, but Ive made sure to advocate for myself. I have been attending the help sessions for the class and I feel that has changed my learning a lot. In regards to this class, I've also learned that I need to talk through the process of problems and I've been able to get the help from my classmates. I really do think my learning has changed and i hope to be able to understand my classes more and more. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1773,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""     My goals in life are to be successful enough to not have to worry about money. This class is a prerequisite to getting my degree, thus is a steppingstone to achieving my goal of getting a well-paying job. I do not hate physics, however, other than being a prerequisite, I see no real value in it for my future."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1767,"My goals are to keep learning new things in life and to keep an open, curious mind. I think that physics class can help me to approach different problems in life, scientific and personal, with a controlled and fruitful approach. I need this class to graduate, but I took it simply because it sounded interesting. Like with a lot of things in life, there's a lot of factors intermingling to make me take the course. Besides learning how to observe and summarize those observations, I believe the class can also help me to stay organized and focused, and to bring this to other areas of my daily life. I think it can teach me how to use previous knowledge, and to rely on my skills to understand different phenomena. Overall, I hope to be as much of a sponge as possible and to absorb what I can during this semester. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1768,"My goals, heavily intertwined with the science community, include either being a doctor or medical scientist, although not knowing my specification of field. This class is helping my goals, heavily intertwined with the science community, include either being a doctor or medical scientist, although not knowing my specification of field. This class is helping me to further achieve procedural knowledge that can help me in either field, such as: knowing lab safety, gaining critical thinking skills from the experience of completing labs, and also learning from the professor on what advice he has for us throughout this learning process. me to further achieve procedural knowledge that can help me in either field, such as: knowing lab safety, gaining critical thinking skills from the experience of completing labs, and also learning from the professor on what advice he has for us throughout this learning process. Aside from the procedural aspect of this physics lab section, I also learn a lot from the material we go over in class. Although the material we are learning in class doesn't always directly correlate with what we are learning in the lecture section, when it does it's really great for our learning process to get a different person teaching us the material, and going over it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1760,This class is mainly to help me move on in my studies for my major classes. I havent taken physics since highschool and i didnt do the best so i wanted to take this course as a sort of refresher and for me to not fall behind my other peers in terms of just general knowledge of certain topics and to help me move on in my biology course to help me get my bachelors
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1763,"One of my goals is to become a pharmaceutical scientist. I really like biology and chemistry , i like using the periodic table because we don't use it in our day to day lives. Physics is a really interesting topic, one of ,my goals in this class is not let math ruin my experience. Physics seems fun and less complicated than what  it really is."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1775,"My goals for this class is to be able to apply my physics knowledge I will learn in the labs to my dreams of working in prosthetics and orthotics. I think it will be extremely helpful in being able to understand the body's motions and how we can recreate them using biomedical engineering and physics. This career is a dream of mine and I hope that doing well in the lab will help me get further in that dream. By doing well and understanding the material hopefully I will get into a good graduate school and after graduate school I can use this knowledge for board certifications and then finally in my career. It is a long road ahead but I'm hoping that if I just take it one lab at a time and keep my individual goes small, the day to day of this journey will be exciting and well worth it. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1761,"Brook Miller  September 16, 2021  Reflection Journaling #2     “What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals”?     My goal for school while at SF state is to pass all the classes I want to say with an A, but B’s and C’s are fine. I want to graduate from SF state in a couple of years and get a degree in my major which is Biology with a concentration in zoology. I also want to get the job that I want, whether it be working in a zoo or as an animal control officer. I just want to be able to live a good life where I have fun doing my job and not regret life as well. How this class helps me achieve this goal is because I need to pass this class to graduate. This class is a part of my prerequisite to graduate in my major so if I don’t pass this class then I can’t graduate and can’t graduate in the time I want to and it’s going to push back my plans by a couple of years."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1764,"Allyson MartyReflective Journal #2 My goal is to graduate from SFSU and then apply for my master’s in healthcare administration. I have worked in the clinical setting for many years, and I now wish to take on a more professional role that includes leadership and hospital management. This class will help me do so because it is a requirement for graduation for my major in Molecular and Cellular Biology so completing this course will bring me one step closer. It will also give me a better understanding of why the world around me (and thus my patients as well) acts the way it does. Furthermore, physics is the most fundamental of all the sciences and a firm knowledge of physics will help me gain a deeper understanding in chemistry and biology as well. It also requires a very precise, detail-oriented, and astute way of thinking and forces you to think critically and problem solve, which will be extremely beneficial within the job I want to obtain."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1774,"My goals are to gain a foundation in physics in order to take Physics with Calculus 1 & 2 in the upcoming semesters. This will help me to achieve my BS in Computer Science. Once I have more experience in programming I am hoping to get a job at a aerospace company and I know understanding physics will help me there.Apart from my career goals and the immediate requirement for my degree, I am interested in this class because I have read books on physics, but I was ill-equipped to do the math that went with the concepts. I have read books on quantum mechanics and astrophysics, so I especially love space and understanding how the universe operates. The more outlandish the idea, the more fascinated I have become!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1765,"What my goal for this year is gonna be is to pass Calculus class with at least a C so I can do credit or no credit and get an A since I do need this class for my major requisite, and I never have really struggled in class like this before so this to me is new and I just want to do the best that I can and put my best effort going forward. This class is actually one of the classes where I am learning to be more independent since in reality no one really talks in my group so I can just end up doing the work mostly by myself so it teaches self learning in a sense. Now my goals do kind of stay consistent in that I just want to be able to pass and get my degree. Hopefully I can fulfill my dreams too and not just that of my parents.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1769,"I have a couple goals I want to achieve in my life. Goals that I hope to acheive in the next few years is to graduate on time and get my bachelors, pass the MCAT, and hopefully get into medical school. Other goals I want to achieve right now is to have a successful business that I just started recently. In the next couple of years I want to have graduated medical school and have my first job as a doctor. This class is helping me achieve these goals because I need this class for my major and it is also a prerequisite to apply to medical school. It is also helping me prepare for the MCAT. It is also helping me learn how to work with other people since we do a lot of labs together.  It is also helping me be better at math since I'm not the best at math but this course is helping me at it since it's very math based."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1504,"My current goal is to try to get at least a 3.5 gpa this semester, and be able to complete all my classes this year. My goal for the rest of the year and new year is to find a new job that can hold me over until I finish graduating from phlebotomist school (program) and can start practicing. So I can get started on my requirements for grade school and only have to take one year off of school which I hope to use for travel. I would also like to get my own apartment in the next 2-6 months so I can have my own space for my last year of school. I hope to past this class with an A and to be prepared for physic 121 lecture, spring 2022 in my last year of physical science so anything I learn here will prepare me for that. I believe I can do all the things I mentioned above and have made changes in my life to be able to do so, but only time will tell."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1770,"My goal is to learn as much as I can about my field, I want to expand my knowledge, not just show up to my classes and get good grades, but to really understand everything being taught. This class is helping me achieve this goal by really testing me, I'm not very good at physics, but with the all worksheets given out and knowledge checks, It helping me get a true understanding of physics. I'm not just turning in my assignments I'm discussing them with others, I'm actually learning. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1762,"If I had to tackle this question it would be geared towards my goals as a whole as my gialos in this university ultimately tie to my career goals. I plan to acquire my bachelors of science degree in biology with a concentration in physiology. While completing the classes I need for my degree I will also be completing any courses needed for medical school. My goals career wise are to become a general surgeon by the time I'm 27-30 years old. I want to have a respectable occupation and I don't see myself attaining that if it isn't in the medical field. Hinesly haven't really thought past that as the prospect of becoming a surgeon is so far in the future that i'm barely thinking what comes after. I'm going to be completely honest, my life revolves around batting my dream career. I don't really care for anything else basically in my personal life."
