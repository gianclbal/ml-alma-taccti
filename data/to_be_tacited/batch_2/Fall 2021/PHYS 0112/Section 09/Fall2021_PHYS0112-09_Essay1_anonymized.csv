Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1760,"Why am I here at this university? I am mainly here firstly because no other college accepted me for my intended major that I really wanted to do in my life. I wanted to be far from home but not too far, and a 7 hour drive is smack dab right in the middle. San Francisco is also just a different environment then what I grew up with in Socal, being in the desert for almost my entire life. I loved the scenery here and the cold weather was just the cherry on top, and making new friends with different backgrounds and being able to socialize and go out without the peering eyes of my parents was so freeing. I ultimately chose to stay and pursue my career here in San Francisco because I don't think transferring is a realistic choice for me, and I would rather stay and learn at a place I have already become comfortable with and not to lose connections for future plans just in case. I'd like to think that I am here at this university because it is quite literally the best one that fits me so far. I am nearby many job opportunities in my field, and there are a lot of places in where I can further my own personal learning, and the weather here is perfect for my liking. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1761,"Brook Miller  September 2, 2021Reflection Journaling #1  ‘Why am I here?”  This type of question is very broad it can mean a lot of things, like why am I here in the world or why am I here in this class or why am I here in this school? To be honest for the first question I can’t answer that not yet that is. I believe that people are put in this world at the time they are meant, and, in the place, they were born because everyone has a purpose to do something. It can be as big as curing cancer to as small as saying hello to someone who has suicidal thoughts. Everyone has a reason to be on this earth my is I have no idea yet.  However why am I here at this school taking this class because I want to. Here at SFSU I can get a degree that will help me with my career choice. From the start of college, I wanted to be an animal control officer, so I wanted to major in animal science, but when it got to the time to transfer, I decided to go to SFSU because they don’t have animal science, but zoology. With a degree in zoology, I have more options on what direction I want my career to go.   Now why am I in this class simply because it is part of my major. I have to take this class is required of the school if I want to graduate. I’m going, to be honest here I have never taken a physics class before, so I don’t know what to expect, but I know that I am here in this class at this school in this plant for a reason and some of the reason I don’t know why, but the other reason is because I want to be here and I’m also required to be here at one point or another.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1762,"""Why am I here?""That's such a broad topic to ask someone but if i had to break it down to an academic standpoint it would actually be rather simple. I'm in this class for the sole reason that it's required for my major and is a prerequisite to future classes that I need to take. I'm not here because I'm actually interested in the study of physics. I'm here because I have to be. All the  classes I take aren't out of curiosity but of obligation to succeed and attain a degree for the advancement of my career to one day attend medical school. It's that simple if you really think about it. If I had to guess, that's probably what my peers alo thought when they signed up for the class. I'm in this university as it is a stepping stone for me to pursue the goal of attending a medical field to one day become a doctor. I know it's bad to think this but the reason for my career choice is also aout of obligation to get a suitable job."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1763,"I am here to share my experiences. As human we walk around the earth wondering what will come next. When I go outside I'm very curious with what is around me, I appreciate nature and the non living items. As I continue life I enjoy to learn, learning makes me wonder about everything. I've always wanted to learn about the small things in life, the kinds of things that most people particularly seem to ignore. I am here to learn about biology and eat when I get hungry. I am here to eat and drink good food. Listen to soothing music and to be kind with myself. I am in this class to learn about physics, I am here because when I went to community college my teacher made physics fun. I am here to reach a goal. Being a student is a lot of work. You have to balance many aspects as an adult. I am in this planet to have fun and to enjoy each second of it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1764,"Why am I here? I don’t know. I feel like being in this class, at this university is something that I “should” be doing. It isn’t necessarily something I wake up and love doing, but I do it anyway because more people I talk to tell me it will pay off in the long run. But will it? I would honestly rather be in cosmetology school, but I know my parents would side-eye me at the mention of it.  Anyways, I am passionate about science also. I love to learn about the world around me and why things work the way they do. I guess I am here, in this course, to cross off another box on the road map to finishing my degree. I don’t even know what I plan to do with my degree, but I guess I’ll figure it out soon enough. I have thought about doing research, but the pandemic has made it hard to get on campus and make connections. At any rate, I am here in this course to succeed, as it is one step closer to my end goal of securing a financially stable job in the future. Oh – in a more general aspect, I also know that I am here to make a difference in this world – someway somehow. But for now, I just take it day by day. One class at a time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1765,"The reason why I am here is to pursue a better education for myself and through the bettering myself I can get a degree, then a stable job for the future. Other than that I am here because of the expectations of my parents that want me to go to university and do the things that they never could, but sometimes it does seem to me that I am only pursuing this because of them and I'm not really doing this for myself since the things that I am passionate about don't really fly well with them. So pretty much the reason for why I am here kind of boils down to the expectations and pressures put on myself from my family but also from myself since I do want to get a degree and have a successful career but maybe just not the one they are looking at. So yeah the reason I am here in this class is to continue the path to education and become a successful individual. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1766,"The reason I am in this class is because I need to fill my major requirements, which makes me take Physics. I have always been afraid of taking physics because thee concept is completely new to me. I hope to be able to understand the material in the course. With answering the question, Why am I here... I am in college because many like many of us, are looking for a better future. I am currently studying Biology in hopes of becoming a doctor either for children or adults. I know i want to follow this career path because growing up i wasn't fortunate enough to have a great pediatrician. As a child, they told me something that truly stunted my confidence, and I wouldn't wish that on any child. Also, my parents struggled with having adequate care in the medical field because there has always been a language barrier for them. I hope to be able to make a change in either a chid or adults life by providing them a safe space. My parents and myself never had the opportunity, so i would like to be there for someone."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1767,"I am here because I really want to understand and know more about physics. I like problem solving, which has been involved in both my academic and professional career. Being able to analyze problems and understand concepts about life has been a pursuit of mine for a long time, and I have a feeling this class will teach me a lot about how to approach many different problems. I have always loved observing the world and using those observations to make some kind of theory about how things work and what our own individual purposes in life are. I hope to get better in logically explaining certain phenomena, and to be able to discuss certain ideas in a more scientific way than before. Additionally, learning to take in things like graphs and other scientific visuals quickly and easily would make processing media input a lot more helpful. There's many facets of life that I want to be able to learn more about, if only to satisfy my own curiosity. In a way, taking this class is just like tacking on another hobby to an ever-growing list of them. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1768,"Although I don't necessarily feel comfortable answering the question, in terms of myself, because the professor said it would be used to better this course rather than seeking an answer to the question itself, I am here in this class because I am looking to forward the knowledge I have to somewhere in the future carry me to my desired career. I know because Physics is a very fundamental portion of the sciences and explains things such as the simple motions we do everyday, that I would need this assortment of knowledge that this course has to offer. Throughout this course I hope to gain better insight into what it would take to reach my desired career, and find information that would help me do so through interacting with those who have already accomplished what I seek out to do. The people I hope to reach are teachers, doctors of all fields, medical scientist, etc."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1769,"Why am I here ?I'm here because I have a lot of goals I want to fulfill in life, both career wise and personal. I believe everyone has a purpose in life and it can be anything you want it to be. I'm here because I want to learn almost everything about life and live life to fullest and not regret anything. My fear is to live an unmeaningful life so I hope the things I did and will do will lead up to the path of a meaningful life. One day I want to look back and tell myself that I've come a long way and that I made it through everything. This questions can mean a lot of things. One thing I think of is like why am I here in school. Well, I'm here in school because I need it to be successful in life since I want to go to medical school to become a doctor. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1770,"I’m here at San Francisco State University for many reasons. My first was because it was the closest school to my family and the farthest from my hometown that I could go to. I originally wanted to move to the east coast, but my mother said it was too far from her so SFSU was the choice. Along with its location I genuinely liked San Francisco State University. I like that they’ve been part of so many revolution, historic moments, that its so inclusive, so diverse, etc. I also enjoyed all the programs they had to offer. At the time of college selections, I wasn’t still quite set on what I wanted to major in but looking at their majors and how well the school is in all of them was part of my choice. I’ve heard and learned so much about SFSU, I fell in love and moved here."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1771,"I am in this class specifically because I'm currently enrolled in Phys 111 and it's a requirement to also be taking this lab course while enrolled in the lecture. Physics 111 and 112  are both courses that I need to take and pass in order to graduate with my cell and molecular biology degree. I am at this university because it was the best option for me out of the ones that I got accepted into. I am also here to honestly just get to where I want to be in life. I want to be able to enjoy my life later on and live a comfortable lifestyle and the only way to do that is to get a good education and get a good job. Many years of schooling and training are needed to become a doctor, so I'm just taking one step at a time and this class just happens to be one of the next steps that I needed to take. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1772,"I'm here because studying physics will strengthen and help me problem solving skills that are valuable in areas beyond physics. to approach problems using what we'll be learning in class this semester. learning how to speak about things in a way that I actually understand beyond a dictionary definition and apply what I'll be learning, even if I don’t understand necessarily how to go about a problem. To label my axes and units, and be as specific as possible because I still struggle, my goal is to keep trying and practicing difficult problems and making mistakes in order to ultimately learn something important. I'm very terrified when it comes to physics, but I'm here to learn and see how far I can get in the sciences. I want to be able to have the ability to solve problems that I still think are impossible and have trouble with."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1504,"Right now I’m not really sure my life is all over the place with work, school, and friends I barely have time for anything. I’m not sure if I am contributing to anyone’s life or to the university at all I’m just free-floating for the moment. I hope that I am here to change some folk’s minds and to add some love and warmth to those that have turned bitter, and nurture the spirits of those left behind. Why am I in Phys 112? Because I need to graduate, it’s my last lower division physical science I need in order to move forward with my degree. I am very grateful to be in this class this semester without it I wouldn’t be able to take most of my upper-division classes next semester, so I am here to pass. I also really enjoy physics I actually read many physic books and I have a few audiobooks as well. I went to Portland for my 24th birthday and I was deep in a hole of science books and the clerk I met there was a science teacher and we talked about all our favorite books and he recommended me some of my now favorites -- which have prepared me for this class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1773,"Payton Russum  9/2/2021  Physics 112  Reflective journal  I am here, in this class, because it is one of many prerequisites for a Master’s degree in Athletic Training. Personally, I hated Physics in high school, so if I could, I would avoid taking this class entirely. No matter my opinion on the subject, I will strive to be present and actively learning in each lesson. Mainly, I am here for an “A,” and will do what it takes to achieve that goal."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1774,"I wrote this in my other 112 lab, but when I transferred classes I forgot to copy it over. I wrote about how I took this class as an introduction to physics because I never took physics in high school and will eventually have to take physics with calculus 1 and 2. This will help build a foundation in order to succeed in those classes. Overall, I would like to gain my BS in computer science and these classes are needed to reach that goal."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1775,"""Why are we here?""When it comes to challenging topics, I do best when I can think through material in context. Chemistry was so much easier to understand when I learned about it in the context of a geoscience course. Biology makes much more sense when I learned about it in the context of my physiology class. Physics is a subject I don't believe comes with as much context. But that is where the lab can come in. We are here to give physics context. To understand the applications of what we learn. I am at this university so I can go into a career that will allow me to help people. I want to build prosthetic limbs for people and to do so I must understand physics. Why do I want to help people? I think it is important to do what you can to leave the world a little better than you found it. I don't really buy into the yea that we are all here for a reason but at the same time I'm a human with mortals and values that I try to live out and I hope that the steps I am taking, like taking this physics class will help in that pursuit. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1776,I'm here because none of my older siblings went to college or even graduated from high school. I never really thought about going to college when I was younger until I moved in with my dad when I was thirteen years old. My dad kind of pushed me into this direction and made me feel like I couldn't let him down or disappoint him by not furthering my education. I'm really happy that my dad was there to push me to do better than what I've seen because I discovered a lot of interests I didn't know I had. I really love science and I'm very passionate about getting a career in the health field. My interest in science and medicine led me to major in biology and now I am in this class because it is a pre-req and also to get me closer to my degree.
