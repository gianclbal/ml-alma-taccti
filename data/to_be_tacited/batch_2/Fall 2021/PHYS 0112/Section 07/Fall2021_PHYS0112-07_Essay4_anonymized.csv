2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,669,"I have many resources that can support me. We have multiple services on campus that allows us to seek help and guidance depending on whatever we need. For academic help we can go to tutoring and programs like Metro that can put us on the right path. Also, I know every major has an advisor. In the past I needed help with my path as a Biology major and sought help from an advisor for Microbiology. He was able to give me advice and point me in the right direction which was what I needed. Aside from this academic help, there are also services that can help us emotionally and mentally. I do not know them by name but I definitely know they are out there and can be found very easily in the Student Services Building or website. In the past I have also gone to the Financial Aid office where they helped me process my financial aid. These are just some of the things we have access to as students of SFSU and there are more that cater to our needs."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1725,"No matter what you might need, there’s someone on campus ready and able to help for improving students' learning. There are many different resources that we can use in college campus, such as writing center, tutoring center,  campus library, advisors, financial aid, health center, career service and so on. I personally do need resources from writing center where helps to break down the task of creating different types of writing assignments. Especially for completing research papers that are challenge for most college students, writing center can help a lot. Another resources I need in college is advisors and career service. As long as I have any interest or puzzle, or general questions about major or career path staff, I can always be benefited form there. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1716,"Q: What resources do I have to support me? A: I have resources to the library at school, or even tutors if I need them. But what I have been using to support me, is either go to the study room/library on campus; use discord chats; and/or use chegg sometimes if I really can't understand how to work on similar problems. Besides from academics, I can't really say I have much resources to support me. I mean nothing out of the ordinary like the usual grocery stores, mall, etc. I have some family/roommates that support me socially. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1724,"To support me specifically in physics, I have the SI course on Friday’s. What really helps me is going over the lectured videos and examples over and over again. In school, I know there are tutoring resources, but I’m not sure how they’re working since we’re hybrid. Mental health, there’s CAPS, I’ve been to their online workshops and they’re semi helpful. I also know about gator gatories, otherwise I’m not sure of many others! "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1728,"Resources I have to support me are the campus resources but this is a challenge since I am not on campus but I can make a zoom appointment with someone on campus to help. I also have the professors to help as needed with any confusions or concerns. My partner helps as needed and if he understands the material that I need help on. Watching youtube videos have also helped with any problems I am stuck on because some people have experienced the same problem or maybe have been asked to solve this issue to be solved before so they make a video to help others who may need it. For me personally, I have done a lot of solving on my own due to the support system I have. Eventually I am able to figure it out unless I really need help and can't solve it on my own."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1723,"In terms of resources, I would say my biggest would be my immediate family. They really can’t help me academically since they did not attend college, but they are a good support system. I’m able to live both rent and bill free, which is something I’m very grateful for. I also am very grateful that I come from a background where I don’t necessarily have to work. I do have a job, but I do not have to work a lot of hours because I need to make money for necessities. My family pushes for school to be my priority, so I don’t work that much just so I can have money to pay for extra things. In terms of my academics, I know there are a lot of resources on campus that I genuinely just do not take advantage of- the biggest being SEO. The application for that comes out soon, and it can definitely be a great resource, but I can’t honestly think of another professor I could ask for a letter of recommendation. A resource I did take advantage of though was joining my organic chemistry professor’s lab. I’m currently an assistant to a masters student, and I think being in the lab has been a massive resource for me. I’ve been able to get technical lab experience, talk to masters students about their experiences both in undergrad and as a masters student, and I have a professor that I feel comfortable with asking questions to. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1714,"I know some resources that I have to support me is the schools tutoring and well as my family and friends. Recently I have been having a very rough time with my family life and my school life so it has been a lot for me to juggle. Just yesterday my dog broke his leg so I had to take him to the emergency room and they wouldn't accept him because it wasn't life threatening. So today I had to take him to the Vet and they told me he broke his leg and that he has to wear a splint for 3+ weeks. I'm just glad he didn't need to have surgery, but it has been a very crazy Halloween weekend for me. :( I know on campus there are tutoring things you can sign up for. I have tried the physics tutoring online and I signed up for one session during the beginning of this semester to help me with some of my homework assignments. Not only is tutoring helpful, but my family and friends have supported me a lot through everything that I have been going through. This semester has been very hard for me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1720,"There are plenty of resources that support me whether they be from the school, provided from the school, or my personal situation set up. We are allowed the use of a school library, computers, free access to certain computer programs or apps, deals, and student discounts for many things. There are also means of support through, advising, student health services, psych services, and multiple social groups. I think having mental/counseling services is just as important as having educational resources. The social clubs and groups support because it gives people a safe and familiar space, good for mental support. The free access and discounts help more students to access/use and or buy certain things(needed items). Last, the student health services provide support to students who might not have healthcare or access to certain health resources. Other than that I have support from my family, being in a fortunately good setting and environment with parents who support me as well. Overall I have a good amount of support from various resources."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1726,"I think the resources I have to support myself are many. If we speak academically, I can say that the campus has many facilities, tutors, teachers, a library, etc. Every time I do not understand a topic in class, I go to tutorials and they clarify all my doubts or also the class instructor himself in his office hours. On the other hand, if we talk about emotional support, I approach resources such as my parents, my family, or friends, since they make me feel better when things are not going as planned. If I have a problem in my work and I need support with the person I go to, it is with my supervisor and so on in each different area. I think this question is very extensive and there are different resources to support me but each one in its respective area. I honestly believe that I have many resources that I can rely on and that makes me feel better."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1722,"Some resources that I have to support me are provided at SFSU. My advising for success as a biology major class provides a lot of insights on how I can get help for things like mental health, workshops regarding research projects, help with CV, job application, personal statement, research statements. The professor provides a lot of resources and offers to help read our drafts. She also gives good insights on how to be successful in our other classes and how to communicate with our professors. Other resources that are provided from my other classes are office hours. I have attended office hours for physics, biology, chemistry and the professor is very helpful when I don't understand something. They usually put it in other terms to help me understand. I also feel like when I cannot attend office hours they are easily accessible through email and most of the time they email back promptly which is a very helpful resource. I am also supported by my family. Whenever I need a break, I can always count on them to give positive feedback."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1733,I have great friends that help me when need it they are overall the best guidance I have and I am truly amazed at how great friends I have. One of my friends named Bryanna helped me get a job and overall it has been going really well. At SFSU there are great tutoring and classes you can take for extra support which also gives you credit. I do love how professors have office hours and are willing to meet with students individually to help them succeed throughout the course and I went to those the most. I was gonna sign up for a physics guidance course but did not have room for it but I am considering it for next semester. I do know advisor is a great help and guides me through what I need to do which is what I really appreciate. I am part of this metro course that help first-year students and since being in it i have been receiving great guidance from professors and making great bonds with students and getting to know them over the years. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1719,"The resources that I have to support are both physical supports and mental support. For physical supports, I have the internet and school resources to look for help when I have trouble. I also have teachers I can email for extra help and office hours I can attend. For mental support, I have my family and friends. Whenever I am feeling down and struggling with work, my friends will hype me up and tell me that I'm doing great and not to stress too much. Whenever I feel like I don't want to do work, my friends will motivate me to get my work done so I can feel less stressed."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1734,"I have my family and friends to support me if I feel the need to ask for advice or just need to vent to them. Classmates can provide similar assistance when it comes to questions specific to a certain class or study groups can be help to get in even more content focused time prior to an exam or to go over tougher topics in class. SFSU provides me with resources as well such as classes with office hours, class materials and links, the library, tutoring services, or discussing content questions with a professor. In addition, there are various services offered online through sites such as YouTube. Here, I can watch videos about any topic I need support in so I can learn additional information about a topic or get access to practice problems with explained solutions. Internships can provide support with real life experience whether it be learning how to have a specific job, getting introduced into the field, or connecting with people in the community."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1732,"The reasources I have to support me go beyond materialistic things. I have a family that supports me and motivates me to not give up. I know that when school, work, or just life in general they will always have my back. Another resource I have is my boyfriend who is also a student which understands what I go through in my academia life. Another resource I have that supports me is some of my instructors that are understanding when it comes to me not being able to turn in work on time due to life just being a lot. Another resource I have to support me is my own room thankfully. I've had to share a room in the past but being in a room by yourself is very helpful when you have a lot of work to do and you just need to focus on yourself I can be in my room and get work done. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1718,"Looking around me I have a lot of resources around me. My family is a big resource for me because they are always there for me when I need them and they always support me when I’m feeling sad or down. When I tend to have a lot on my plate they always talk to me and give me words of encouragement and I feel like that helps me a lot because as a person I tend to overthink and I tend to doubt myself sometimes. Also, my cousin who is a year older than me, we always face time when we have a lot on our minds and us talking to each other about it makes the stress go away and hearing encouragement from each other makes us stronger. Also, my dog is a resource for me because when I had a stressful day at school, I would take him on a walk and it just makes my stress go away.  And also our school has lots of resources that I haven't used yet. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1713,"There is a lot of resources I feel that support me at this school, in my classes, and in life. All my classes the teachers and my peers have been very resourceful when it comes to helping make sense of anything and everything. The office hours that teachers always put aside for students is so nice and useful. But I really like that in all my classes when we work in break out rooms having the option to call in the teacher when working with a smaller group to get more help from the teacher themselves right then and there. I think outside of school having my family, friends, and boyfriend is always a great support system and is a great resource for anything else I need help with in life. Having people that have supported me all through the six years of college that I have been doing has been very uplifting and encouraging. There is a lot more resources in life that can be used such as nature that can be grounding, working out which can be used to clear the mind, and another one that I probably should have used here at SFSU is the disabilities center. I have a couple learning disabilities and I have been in high school I had to take a couple classes to help me understand my disabilities and how better aid myself in classes since I learn and retain things a little bit different than most. So the DSS program at SFSU would also be a good resource to get some extra help, a note tacker, or extra time on tests but so far I have not really needed to use it since all lectures/labs have been recorded its easy to go back and watch again the information I might have missed. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1721,"I understand that I have many resources that could support me but it's just about my willingness to reach out and ask for it. I know that I have my professor as a potential resource and coming into office hours would have been a good idea since you're the primary expert on this subject and you know to expect from us in our work. In addition, I have my fellow classmates in my breakout rooms from this class and maybe even from my lecture class that could answer my questions. I feel like I'm more comfortable talking to my classmates because they are in the same position as me in regards to learning the new material and I feel like they have a better way to explain things than a teacher would. I could also get a tutor to help me and explain the topics in a much simpler way. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1379,As a student I have many resources available both at San Francisco state to help with academic and emotional support. Each department has tutoring available which is one resource. I am also part of EOP so they also have their own tutoring services. The most important academic resources is how accessible the teachers make themselves for the students and willingness to help no matter what. SFSU helps students emotionally by having counseling services. We don’t think much about our emotional health but our school reminds us. Outside of school my school has academic resources other than the interment and textbooks. But I did have many resources that help me with my emotional state.  I have a family that is always there for me to support me. One resource that many don’t see as a resource for mental health are my dogs. My dogs bring such comfort and happiness to my life. If I feel down I just take a break with them. The hospital I go to also offers  counseling services.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1735,"I feel like I have a few resources to support me during the school year. I'm a part of the Metro program, so that means I have access to a Metro advisor as well as tutoring from Metro. I also have an academic advisor assigned to me from the school that I am able to talk to if I have any questions. The school also provides tutoring help in the library, so I can always go there when I have any questions. My professors are also a resource that supports me. Most of them respond really fast to emails I have about what we're learning about in class, so they are super helpful. Another resource that I have is my older cousins. They went to San Francisco  State as well, so I can always ask them questions and advice since they know the school better than I do. My friends and family also count as a resource since they have always been there for me when I need help."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1715,"The resources that I have to support me is my lab exploration notes that I take during class as well as the group work that we have been looking into, this resources have really helped me out getting through the tough situation in class it's something that I use all the time especially during our group activities where it's a lot of information that you have to keep in mind and it really helps having some notes aside and resources that can help me move on in order to not take too long on one question and just get to it with a clear understanding of what's being asked using the support from my resources. The few things that I could be doing in order to have more resources is to take notes with all my other classmates have been doing and what they have been sharing since a lot of it is enough to help me get through the work."
