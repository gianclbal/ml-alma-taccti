2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1734,"People in my family such as my Mom have always pushed me to do my best. They let me know that I should always work hard, especially when it comes to my education, but they have also stressed the importance of taking care of myself and not overworking. This has helped me throughout college, because I have tried to always do my best when it comes to completing assignments or studying for a test. However, I have also tried to give myself some breaks and some time to relax or do something fun so that everything I do is not based solely on getting schoolwork done. Whenever I have been stressed about an exam or a lot of schoolwork, my Mom has also reassured me that she believes in me. This makes me want to try even harder to do my best and show her that she has a reason to believe in me. This also encourages me because it shows me that even if I do not fully believe in myself, my mom does and she is here to support me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,669,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college by teaching me to always try my best. My parents taught me to never settle for less and give 100% of myself into the work I do. This has shown me to be tough on myself when it is necessary and to pull through any situation no matter how difficult it may be. These values are not only from my family but is something that is praised in Mexican culture, which I am very proud of."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1724,"How have the values of my community or my family (of the origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?My family didn't have too many values that I believed helped me in college, but more motivated the heck out me to do well. their mantra for me was to get married and have kids and that's a nooo for me boss, can't do it. They didn't really value education, so I do. My community now feels like a place of encouragement over the competition. My school/work community values communication and collaboration and I believe that's what helped me do so well, especially during the stay-at-home orders. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1720,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college. My mother’s support and love no matter how I did in school was definitely a big value held between us. With it, I knew I had constant support and the pressure to be an overachiever was lessened on my shoulders. To me, it’s a value because I feel that the expectations to do well in school is in itself a family or generational value. Being in college a lot of things can pile on you or make you stressed, so naturally, you’d want to relieve that stress, and having less pressure is one way. Another value from my family would be to take care of responsibilities and stay on top of work. This has helped me navigate college in a sense of asking for help when I need it, reaching out, and taking care of my own school needs(with help if needed of course). Also, staying on top of schoolwork helps me navigate the delicate self-care/school line when in college. It helps me balance and get work done when it needs to be done.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1715,The values of my community and family has helped me navigate through college from the advice that they have given me over the years always pushing me forward to pursue my dreams. I have gotten help from many of my teachers in my community by doing things such as giving us lessons of why it is a good idea to go to college and reach those goals that we have had in mind for many many years. These values that I have received from both my school community and my family has been something so meaningful to me because of the people that I have had in my life I am where I am today and I continue to receive that advice from these people and for me I see this as a reminder to always keep my head up and reach the goal that I have set for myself.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1714,"Growing up I always had a difficult relationship with my parents but I always had a great relationship with all my aunts and uncles and cousins. They were the ones who helped me the most when I was struggling. When I was finally able to move out and live on my own this year it brought me so much freedom and joy that I never had before. I felt less stressed and not always feeling like I never wanted to go home. I have learned that people will always have something to say about what you do and who you are as a person, but if you are proud of what you have done then stand up for yourself. I have always learned that if you have a set goal in the future then do everything that you possibly can to reach that goal no matter how many times you fail, and that is what I plan on doing right now. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1723,"My values of my family haven’t necessarily helped me navigate college, but they have pushed me to go to college as a whole. I am the first one in my family to attend college, and throughout my whole life I was told by my family that I needed to go to college. In order to better my future and break cycles within our family, I needed to attend college. Therefore, although I have an amazing support system in terms of feeling supported overall, I have no one to help me go through college. I feel like often times I’m asking friends or finding other resources to ask college related questions, like FAFSA, opposed to my family. It is a little frustrating at times because I feel a massive pressure to go to college and do well. Although I can vent to my family about my issues I'm experiencing, I can't get actual advice from them. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1735,"The values of my community and family have helped me navigate through college. My parents never graduated from college, but they instilled values in me when I was younger in order to help me navigate college in the US. They have always told me to work really hard for what I want and to never give up. They never wanted me to take the easy path and life, and always pushed me to chase my dreams. I feel like that relates to my community as well. The Latinx community has always had this value of having a strong work ethic, which I think has helped me to not give up when things get hard in college. Being from an immigrant, Latinx background has certainly helped me navigate college by making me feel like I can always accomplish what I want if I work as hard as can and not give up."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1721,"As I grow more as an individual and a college student, I understand to be more patient with myself. I would always beat myself up for not understanding or clicking onto a subject fast enough or fulfilling the expectations from my professors but I came to realize that it's okay to be stuck once in a while. Being more consistent and pushing myself to be more motivated in completing my schoolwork has been a struggle but I feel like I overall became so much better at it this semester … shame that I had to wait this long in order to realize that. Being patient with myself has really helped, it allows me to take a step back and reflect on what I need to do better moving forward and giving myself a little break so I don't get too stressed or overwhelmed with the schoolwork I need to complete."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1733,"My good friends, I have made during this semester in physics really help me understand concepts of certain subjects and even navigate how to sign up for classes and work student center. It was a struggle even taking physics because science is not my strong suited subject but I really wanted to try because life is not easy and I want to get into medical school. With hard work, I believe I can get there but I was truly lost on how to navigate or understand a lot of subjects so I really had to study and with my friend's help I got where I was. I try getting help from advisors or what sfsu provides but they didn't really help me. During this pandemic they also made me feel better when I am feeling down or stressed they are amazing people. I hope I can transfer from SFSU but if not I know I have good people who are willing to help me understand the subject. My family never went to college so they do not understand a lot of information and each college works differently so it is hard. I finally feel like I know what I need to do and with hard work, I can accomplish my goals along with my amazing friend's help. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1725,"The important values from my community and my family that drives me navigate through college is being supportive and encouraged, without those, I would even dare to initiate it. My parents do not have even a high school education, but they always encourage me and my sister to pursue education as more as possible when we were young. Lacking of empirical academic success from original family, I was very easily approach self-doubt which leads me lay down my goal and put the small task away and do nothing. Now when I am getting old, I realize that there is no excuse for self-laziness, I am just being lazy. Nothing about intelligence, all about attitude instead. Thus, I was encouraged to navigate through college by my husband who values persistence deeply, I hope to carry along with the supportive and inspiring values from community and family, and complete a college education eventually."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1713,"The values of my family and community have defiantly helped me through college in different ways. My community has come together a lot to stand up for what they believe in and in my family, some/most of my family either did not go to college or just went to a junior college for a couple years and never completed their education. Both my community and family influenced me in these ways to complete my education. I have been in college for 6 years now and I have thought so many times to just finish my biology degree and just do nursing get into nursing school already or not finish my biology degree and just get into nursing. But I have realized that I am still so young and can complete both because it means a lot to me and my family to finish my degrees and continue to further my education no matter how much time it has and will take me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1726,"I think my parents are the support that I need to keep doing what I'm doing right now. It has been a long journey with many challenges but I know how to get ahead. Since I was a kid my parents always encouraged me to go to college and succeed in life. My goal is to be a medical doctor one day, and with my family on my side I feel like I could everything I want. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1730,"I have always had conflicting values tossed my way throughout my academic career. As a child, I was taught that if I got nothing less than an A, I wasn’t trying enough and just being lazy. As I became an adult and started working and going to school full time, I learned to go easy on myself. All of my best friends wouldn’t put that kind of pressure on me or take it as a personal affront if I didn’t go well on a homework or an exam. Any values that stuck? Just do the best you can. Life isn’t always kind, and if life is ragging on you because you’re just trying to cope with something, then maybe this life that society claims isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be. No matter what you’re doing, you’re doing what you can with the tools placed for your disposal. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1718,"My family has helped me by guiding me in college. They always check up on me when I’m doing my work or stressing out. They always tend to make sure I’m doing good and they try to help me if necessary. I try my best to finish all my work on time and get good grades because none of my family members went to college and I want to be an example to my little brother, to show him that anyone can graduate from college even though it might be a little hard. But my parents always taught me to keep pushing through any hardships because it’s going to be worth it in the end. And also they told me that not everything is going to be perfect, everyone is going to encounter some hardships but everyone is going to overcome it. But my family has always been supportive in me and they try their best to let it be known. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1722,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college by reminding me constantly what my ultimate goal is. I am the first generation in the United States, my parents came here for a better life, for the American dream. My parents have sacrificed a lot for my siblings and me to get an education to have an easier life than theirs. They have taught me to always give 100% in everything that I do. They have taught me to fight for the things I believe in and stand up for those who can't do so for themselves. This has helped me navigate in college because I am asking questions when I need help so I can succeed in the things that I am working on. I stand my ground when something does not feel right but luckily I have been treated fairly at SFSU. My family taught me to always share and help the people that need it. I feel like this is helping me in college because I'm helping my colleagues when they get stuck on a problem and I'm receiving the same help when I get stuck on a problem. Through this process, I have made friendships with a solid foundation. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1728,"The values of my family are pretty high standard when it comes to college because I am expected to get A’s speaking from my mothers side of the family, my grandmother in particular. One the other side of my family, which is my fathers side, is more laid back and is proud of me getting through college by doing my best. I am the first generation to go to college in my family because my mother only received a CNA certificate and never used it and my father has not finished high school. College is important to me specifically because I have a set goal in mind that I wish to achieve and I feel if I am able to work hard to achieve those goals then I can, the main thing is to at least try your best and put all effort into it and if you do that then you will never be disappointed in the outcome regardless."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1732,"My values have guided me through college with a lot of support and motivation. My family is for sure one of my biggest values, and so are my beliefs. This particular semester has been very tough for me and I have had days where it has been easy for me to give up but because of what I value in life I have not given up on this semester. Although not doing so hot in many of my classes this semester I did come to realize that I have been doing my best and my values understand that. I realize my values in my culture as well have been reasons why I push myself harder some days because many people in my family have not come no where close to where I am now. Although I feel I am not doing my best sometimes I know I have a lot of people looking up to me and rooting for me, that is what is getting me through college"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1719,"My value of my family, mainly my dogs is the prime reason I'm getting through college. I allied to college so that I can pursue a career in Veterinary science and help the animals around. This love for animals originated from my first dog. My family took him in after a family decided they didn't want him after buying him from a pet store. He was not in the best condition. He was very small and skinny and had patches of hair loss from the other dogs in his kennel. We adopted him but we knew nothing about dogs. That was when I decided that I would pursue a career in Animal science to help him and the other animals like him around. It was a pretty far stretch to try and help all the animals around me as I had originally hoped for. Now that I have actually had some experience in this field, I know my limits and there is only so much I can do, but in the future, I still hope I can open up a rescue for the animals in need."
