2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1734,"My goal at SFSU is to continue studying kinesiology so that I can graduate and eventually become a sports physical therapist. During classes, my goal is to do my best and create beneficial study habits for myself so that I can learn and understand all of the information I can. By doing this, I will be preparing myself for more of my major courses where I will really start to learn more about what kinesiology is in my field. This class is helping me with these goals since it is along the pathway for my academic calendar and is giving me more time to work on creating beneficial study habits since I need to learn the information provided in lecture and apply it here during lab. Ultimately, this helps me further understand the topics I am learning in the lecture. Physics will also help me understand the different topics of motion which is important in kinesiology since I will need to understand the motion of the body."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1727,"My main goal is to do really well in college this semester and the following semesters. My other goal is to figure out and decide whether I want to major in biology or physics. I like both topics and have taken multiple biology classes but I don't have a huge understanding of physics or whether I'm good or enjoy it as much as I'm sure about biology. I am, however, very interested in the way things work and I enjoy doing math, which I wouldn't be doing as much of in biology. This class is pushing me to work harder and do better in school than I ever have. I want it to keep pushing me so I can be better and learn more. I'm hoping this semester's course load will help me decide what I want to major in as well as what I want to do with the rest of my life. I also hope to gain a better understanding of physics and decide whether that is what I want to major in specifically."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1723,"In terms of a long term goal, I’m not entirely sure what mine is. I know I want to obviously graduate and get my Bachelors in biochemistry. I think I do see myself going to grad school, but I don’t know what I want to focus on, nor what I want my actual career to be. I’ve considered studying neuroscience, immunology, or even just sticking with biochemistry, but everything is still very up in the air for me. Ultimately, I do know that I want to be successful and live a comfortable life, regardless of what particular career field I end up in. This class is helping me achieve my short term goal of graduating college because this class is required in order for me to graduate. This class, along with the physics lecture component, help set me up as being prerequisites for more advanced courses I’ll need within my degree, like physical chemistry."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1713,"My goals in life right now is to become a nurse. I want to be able to help people as much as I can. I really like school and learning new subjects especially ones that I can use in my everyday life. I know physics plays a huge part in understanding the world around us and how things work, which is why I took this class. I felt like this class would help me further my goals on having a better understanding of this world. I want to have knowledge in different categories so I can take that with me into my future. Physics is honestly kind of. hard which is why I never took it in high school, but after a lot of experience in the science field I felt that I was ready to take this course. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1717,"My first definite goal is to obtain my bachelor’s degree. This class will help me reach my goal because it is a requirement for my major. I can where I might discuss physics later in the future in my workplace, maybe when I am helping my son in the future with his homework and in other environmental settings. I am here because this is my second time taking this course. Because the first time, I was not ready for how challenging this class would be to me. I do believe that this class will help me advance to the other level of physics that is required for my biology major, and I am honestly too scared to increase any further because this is not my most vital subject. I have a strong dislike for it but I can’t do anything about it. I need to stick to my goal no matter the obstacles."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1736,"Whenever the subject of goals is mentioned, I feel as if it's a very powerful tool for us because it can be our motivation to do better in our life. I have huge goals in my life but realistically it will take a long process to be able to accomplish them. While I am attending college, I am planning to graduate a year early, become financially stable, buy a car and improve my mental and physical health. I know that this is hard for me to complete within three years before I graduate because becoming a full time student, tackling two jobs, balancing a social life and studying in between is not the easiest thing for students in their early 20s. But life isn’t made to be easy for us because that’s the point of adulting because college is the time that everything changes for a person's perspective, mindset, responsibilities and time management. I feel like taking PHYS 112 will be able for me to achieve my goals by having me be able to pass this class therefore I will be able to become my career choice, Physician Assistant, in the future. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1737,"I have been up since 6 am since I went to sleep around 11pm last night. Which happens to be pretty early for me, but I have been bored out of my mind doing nothing since. I scrolled through social media, but my feed was mostly filled with those sfsu confessions on instagram. People in this school are wild, most of them talking about what they did to their roommates, and It caught me by surprise some were funny some were weird. I have an interview today at the Target at the mall near campus. I hope it goes well since I really want to have some income before Christmas so I can see my family, the cats, and my friends. There hasn’t been much in my mind lately. On the topic of physics, I really just want to pass and get this class over with. I used to be so into physics, but It has slipped from my focus and honestly I don't find it fun anymore. The only class I really enjoy is biology. Physics will help with future classes that I need to take. I can take the knowledge of what I learn here and use it in future physics classes, and I hope those classes are somewhat better and not boring. I was hoping to get a different lecture professor this time but my lecture was the only class that fit my time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1732,"I am reaching towards a degree and license in Veterinary medicine. I believe the reason this class was a requirement for my degree not only in undergrad, for my undergrad major but also as a requirement for veterinary school is because calculations are important in the field everyday. Calculations and accuracy and precision are important as well. Knowing the right amount of dose you want to give to an animal is important because it can cause harm if given more than the right amount. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1379,My main goal is to continue my studies and become a doctor. Another goal is to do well on all my classes. This class is a requirement for my major and it is one step closer to my goal of becoming a doctor. I fell behind in this class before and do not want to make the same mistakes because it is holding me back on my dream. I have to stay on top of my class and I will do good. I hope to full.y conceptualize what I learned in this course and use it in my everyday life. Physics is used in our everyday life and it is important to understand the work around us and why thing happen the way they do. Physics is needed for my career because I learn laws or motion and pressure and they are important to help with the understanding of how the forces operate in our body. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1715,"When I Think about my goals for this class there are many things that come to mind the first being, Getting a clear understanding of what physics is and how it’s something that’s a part of my daily life I want to have this class and heavy clear understanding of how this is a part of life and how it shows up in these aspects. I believe that this class will help me achieve these goals as we have been covering many topics of physics and some of these have already in a way shown up in my every day life even though it’s more technical than it seems. Overall I know but I still have a lot to learn about physics but once I get a better understanding and more information I know I’ll be able to apply this to my every day life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1719,"my goals are to not slack off and to do my work on time this semester. I tend to be lazier during online classes and wait till the last minute to do my work. Being in this class forces me to do my work during the time period that is given to us. In the past, I would just sit there through the class as we were in breakout rooms but this class is different. All of my peers are working hard to complete the lab work and we are all talking and participating. I now have one less homework to worry about because of the productivity this class gives me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1716,"Diana Garcia Physics 112-07September 17, 2021Reflecting Journal #2""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""My short-term goal is to pass this class. This goal will carry my understanding and perseverance of adapting to the life/equations of physics. Lab is slowly helping me achieve these goals, because in general I struggle with both the lecture and lab work. This lab section is encouraging me to do our own self practice situations in lab explorations and post lab checks. In the beginning it is hard to grasp the subject, and expecting to do a whole lab mainly on your own is a different process, however this is what will push my mindset to getting to the goal of understanding physics through words, graphs, and in other quantities. I would love to reach this goal at the end of the semester to reflect on how far I’ve come from not really knowing what I am doing to what I can take with me for my future medical career and classes."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1735,"I have several goals this semester. My first goal is to pass all my classes with a passing grade. That's a goal I have for every semester so far since I don't want to end up repeating a class. My second goal is more specific. I want to be able to understand and pass physics. For physics, in particular, I also want to be able to understand the material, not just pass the class in move on. This class is helping me achieve this goal in multiple ways. The first way is by having office hours available. I can go to the office hours, and ask for help if I really need it. I've only been to one office hour so far, but it has been super helpful! The second way this class is helping me achieve my goal is by having breakout rooms. Sometimes, having a classmate to ask questions to is super helpful when the instructor is busy. Having these resources will really help me understand this subject, and pass. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1718,"My goals as of right now is to pass my classes, get my Biology degree and to learn a lot while my time in college. This class is helping me because my instructor is really nice and she cares for us, when we don't understand something she walks us through it as a group so everyone can get a basic understanding on how to solve the problem. Also this class is brining me closer to my Biology degree because this class is a pre- req for my last physics class and I know I'm going to pass it and this class is teaching me a lot about physics even when I'm confused in my physics lecture this class helps me understand certain topics better. And working in groups helps me to understand my partner's point of views on certain things and if I don't understand something they help guide me and teach me when I'm confused. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1714,"My goals is to complete this class and physics 111 because it is a prerequisite for my major. Physics is my hardest class this semester and I’m trying my best to stay on top of it. My major is speech language and hearing sciences and I needed to take this class or a chemistry class. I plan to become a speech pathologist and work with little kids. I have always wanted to work with lite kids because it is never a dull moment with them and you are never bored when working with them. In order to become a speech pathologist I plan on going straight into the masters program here at San Francisco State University. After I graduate and receive my masters program, I hope to find a speech pathologist somewhere here in San Francisco. I have already done research on speech places here in the city that I hope I can have a future job in. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1721,"My goals right now is to just finish my last year of SFSU strong and graduate with a good gpa. This class is helping me achieve this goal because it is a required class that I need to pass in order to graduate. I also hope that this semester my motivation is high so I don't have the urge to slack off and procrastinate. So in order to do that, I have to constantly remind myself that if I can get through these two semesters I will be able to finally be free of school and actually look forward to my actual life starting. With all respect, I'm done with school. I just want it over with at this point so if I keep that repeating in my head, I feel like I will have a good chance of graduating on time. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1720,"My goals are to understand not just the technicalities of physics but how it applies to everyday life as well. I want to be able to recognize when it plays a role and how to come to a conclusion based on what I’ve learned. This class is helping me reach my goals by giving me the opportunities and lessons needed to exercise what Ive learned, comparing to actual situations. It also helps me deeper understand how it works by simulating what would be happening. By constantly observing, adjusting, sometimes controlling, and analyzing what's happening, I make conclusions much easier. This class is also sharpening my observation and data recording skills, which I think is a good skill to have no matter what profession you are in and in daily life in general. For my career path-goal, all of these skills that are being used in this class will be useful and very much needed."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1722,"One of my goals is to understand how the world around me works and I feel like physics can help me do this. I want to have a strong foundation in physics by working hard in this class, completing assignments on time, and asking the instructors for help when I need it. This will help me be successful in other future stem classes. It will help me because I feel like in physics there is a lot of problem-solving and decision making. This can help strengthen my critical thinking process in logic development. This class is also a prerequisite to my major. I feel by completing this class, I will be a step closer to getting a bachelor’s degree. Then I can go on to grad school to become a NP. My goal is to continue to continue to help patients.  I am excited to learn from this class because it will come in handy for everything that I do in everyday living"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1725,"My current goal is to get a bachelor's degree. How to achieve this goal? First of all, I need to plan the courses of each semester, and secondly, pass the courses in the plan of each semester, then finally complete all the courses required for the degree to obtain a degree. This physics 112 course this semester is very important which is essential class that I need to pass through. It not only gives me initial exposure to scientific experiments, but also helps me to better learn and understand the theoretical knowledge of physics 111. In addition, it also helps me understand the physical principles encountered in daily life. I hope to successfully complete and pass this physics experiment class to achieve my goal."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1475,"My goals are to gain more knowledge in physics and in general to gain more knowledge in Biology because that is my major. This class is helping me achieve my goals because it is one of the requirements in my prerequisites. Another goal I want to achieve is being better about my time management, being more responsible in my daily life. I tend to procrastinate so my goal for this semester is to work on that. Quarantine has helped me focus more on myself and focus more on my academics. I look forward to learning in this class and achieving my goals. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1731,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""  My main goal for this class is actually to learn something since this is my first time taking a physics class. I love learning new things and I try my best to actually understand every lesson. Another goal is to not fall behind like I am right now. Hopefully I can catch up to the class. How is this class helping me achieve these goals,well I’m actually learning new things. Which I’m enjoying so far. I've had fun with lab 2 even though it did take me a bit long to learn to use, especially since I was doing it through my iphone. Also by not letting me fall behind and actually giving more time to catch up and finish most of the work I missed. I also hope I can pass this class and can actually succeed."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1733,"My goal is to transfer to a UC hopefully or private and go to a good medical school so I can become a psychiatrist. This class is helping me achieve my goals because to be able to go to medical school, and I have to take physics it is one of the requirements.  I hope that taking this course, and it helps me get a better understanding of what my lecture class is about and be able to do better in physics. By taking this course I can know my classmates better and by working together I can build on my social and thinking skills. I am very shy but this class is also helping me speak up and not be scared and science is not my strong suit so by taking this course I am growing my thinking skills. I do hope by taking this course I can learn how the world works even more and get a better understanding of the world we live in because the world is a mystery. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1724,"My goals this semester are to actually learn and not only seek answers, by 11:59. This class and the lecture portion help because they are recorded, it helps because I go back and listen to portions I didn't understand. Both instructors also do a good job at answering questions. Another goal is to come to class prepared and a little ahead and so far I haven't been able to do that for this class. I've found a system that works for 2/4 of other courses, but I'm still working on it for this lab & lecture. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1726,"I think I have many goals in life but one of them and I think the most important is to be a medical doctor. I think this class will help me a lot to reach this goal because the exam to enter medical school requires that you have the knowledge that a physics course can give you. Also this class is a requirement for graduation so I had to take it too. Outside of the fact that this class is necessary to graduate, I believe that each class you take opens your knowledge a little more and you begin to process things in your mind in a different but better way. I remember that when I was just starting college I approached problems in different classes, now I believe that I have the ability to do more difficult things."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1728,"My goals are to become an amazing Pediatrician and this class is helping me by giving me the background knowledge for my profession I am seeking to obtain. This class is a requirement for me to continue with other majoring classes. This class also is helping me learn information that is needed in everyday life and to use the concepts on a daily basis. We use physics on a daily basis without even knowing it so to become aware of this, we take the classes to learn. The concepts for this class are somewhat complicated to understand but I think it is important to learn so we can familiarize ourselves with the physics that happens everyday in our lives. My other goal is to pass this class with flying colors because I like to do well in my classes and when I do not do well then I try to figure out what approaches I used and correct my mistakes."
