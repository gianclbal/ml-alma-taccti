Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1379,"﻿I am here most importantly because I want to. I am always super excited to continue my studies and see what I can learn from my courses. I chose to be here because in my opinion, I know if I don’t get a good education for a good career, I will not be happy with my job. I have worked at food places or stores and I would not like to do that forever. I wanted to be able to get a job that I enjoy and will be happy to go to work everyday. I am also taking this class because it is a major requirement. My major is biology with a concentration in physiology so this course is key for my major. Even though this class is a requirement for my major, I enjoy physics unlike I did in high school. I feel because I want to be here and learn that I find learning the subject fascinating."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1713,"Why am I here?Why am I here can be kind of a hard topic to talk about. I feel like I am here on this earth to help others. I chose the medical field so that I can accomplish this dream and continue helping people physically, mentally, and emotionally for the rest of my life. I have always had the urge to make sure everyone around was helped and felt safe and secure even before myself. That is how I knew I chose the right field. But I feel like I am in this class to have a better understanding of the world around us. I focus so much on people yet do not take a minute to focus on what is living around us. There are some things that I have no idea how they work and why they work. I took this class to gain better knowledge in all of it. This class was always so intriguing to me yet I was always so free to take this class because I felt that it was above my knowledge and then I would never succeed in this class. But I believe I'm here to overcome that and find out that I'm capable of doing much more than what my mind believes I am capable of doing."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1714,I am here because I believe I have a purpose in this world to make a difference. I believe continuing with school and furthering my education will help me to find a job that can create a difference in the world. I hope to become a speech pathologist so I can help those in need that have trouble speaking.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1715,I am in this class to be able to learn more about and get a clearer understanding of what physics is and  be able to understand how things work in a sense that would later help me on I hope to be able to get a clearer understanding of physics to be able to proceed further in both my general physics class and my laboratory class what I hope to do with this information is to further extend my vocabulary as well as having that reflected into my grades. As well as be able to share out my ideas with others be able to receive new information and overall learn from each other’s I am eager to see if this is something that I would be interested in the long run.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1716,"Why am I here? I'm in phys 111 and phys 112, because it is a major lower division core for my Biology major. I'm part of Biology under the College of Science and Engineering, and I would like to carry out this major/career path to potentially lead me to be part of a medical career path. My dream career generally wants to be a part of the medical field, but specifically I'm still not as clear as what I would like to pursue. For biology, I want to use it for learning about physiology to then get into medical school and become a physician or something of the sort. Not only is this class a prerequisite for physics 121, it's very much applied in the world of biology or specifically in the medical field. I never really paid much attention to what physics is and how it applies to anything. So, I am interested to learn about certain units that will be helpful and will be applied towards my future career."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1717,"Why am I here? Here on Earth or here in physics lab?well to start off, I am here on Earth to be a good human who is kind and compassionate to those who need help in situations that I am able to help with. I am also here to be the greatest mom I could be to my beautiful two year old. I am here to guide him, teach him, nurture him and support him in anything he decides.As for my physics 112 Lab I am here for the second time because last semester I was not doing very well. I didn't have my son in daycare which made it even more difficult to concentrate as well the fact that last semester's lab was in the evening and so by that time I needed to tend to other things. I am here to give this class my all and to be able to pass it to move on with my other pre-requisites. Hopefully by next fall I'll be able to graduate if I keep up with this class which I find challenging. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1718,I am here because I’m aiming to get my Biology degree. This will further my studies and help me with my future career later on. I’m glad that I’m here because I’m one step closer to my dreams. I’m a sophomore right now and eventually I’m going to be a junior then a senior and time is going by really fast. I’m proud of myself for all the accomplishments I made during the school year. I’m excited to see what the future has in store for me and I know it’s going to be something great. I’m kind of scared of physics because it’s been a while since I learned physics. At my high school we learned physics in our freshman year and our senior year but that’s been a long time since then. I just hope physics is going to be easy and I have great professors to teach me along the way. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1719,"Why Am I Here?Being realistic, I am here to complete my GE, but I also hope to change my perspective on physics. I don't enjoy physics because I find it confusing and hard. I have never done a physics lab except for a simple one in middle school where we made cars and used balloons to make them move. I want to see what other kinds of labs we are doing because I enjoy labs."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1720,"I am here mainly because taking the physics lab course is a co-requisite to the physics lecture, and both of those are a requirement for my major. Personally speaking, I am here to better apply my own basic knowledge plus the information and skills I gain learning physics to the physical aspect of the subject (doing labs and experiments). Although I would prefer to take this course in person to have a hands-on experience, I am still excited to see how physics works in real situations. On top of that, I want to better my skills in analyzing and recording data coming from these different experiments, use my critical thinking to come to a reasonable scientific conclusion, and just have fun seeing the outcome. This class is to the lecture portion of what putting a name to a face is. Even though we go over examples in lectures, the lab gives us more extensive situations and instances where we get to use the basic fundamentals and rules/ tests to see if we know how to apply."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1721,"I am here in this physics class because my major requires it. In addition, I need to take this class in order to take physics 121 and 122 next semester. I am a biology major with a minor in criminal justice. I'm not entirely sure if my future career requires me to do some physics work but I guess it's nice to know. I would like to become a forensic toxicologist in the future or shortly after I graduate SFSU. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1722,"I am here because this class is a prerequisite and a general ed class for my major. This class is also for upper-division classes. I am majoring in biology with a concentration in physiology. I want to be a nurse practitioner. Physics is important because it will give me a strong foundation for how the world works. It does give us tools and fundamental knowledge to keep us evolving such as technological advances. I feel like Physics is required for my major because it further helps me understand components that make up the universe which living organisms are a part of. It does tie in a lot with Chemistry which could help with understanding this more. I am hoping for a better understanding of energy, dynamics. I really hope with Physics I am able to reach my goals in the medical field. I hope that this can lead to opening other doors."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1723,"To be honest, I feel like I don’t know why I’m here. I mean, I’ve always known that I have to go to college, it was something that was instilled in me by my parents- who didn’t go to college, but I have no clue what I’m doing. I decided to major in Biochemistry because I like science, but I past my Bachelors, I don’t know what I want to do. I was able to decide ‘no’ to med school because I don’t think that would be a good fit for me; which makes me lean towards grad school- but I have no clue what I want to study. In terms of this specific physics course, the only reason why I’m here is because I need it to graduate for my major. When I first looked at my degree pathway, I was so confused as to why physics was needed. To be honest, I was kind of stressed because physics isn’t really my favorite subject. I realized recently that I also need to take physical chemistry courses in order to graduate, so I began to understand why I need to take physics."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1724,"I am here because this a pre-req for environmental science. I also enjoy math so I'm looking forward to it, I am not the best in labs, online labs to be exact, so I'm a bit nervous about it. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,669,"I am here because I would like to get a degree in Biology, which means I have to also learn Chemistry and Physics respectively. My dream career as of now is to be a Clinical Laboratory Scientist which is both in the science field and also the medical field. That being said, I do enjoy learning about science in general and would like to have a better understanding of Physics. I would say I am very strong when it comes to Biology and Chemistry but I always seem to have a hard time with Physics. Hopefully by taking this class, and Physics 121/122, I can become a better scientist in general. I believe it is imperative to have a strong grasp and understanding of all the subjects before focusing on one of them. Not only this, but another reason I am here is because I am eager to take in as much information as I can since I have the opportunity that my parents never had. It would be selfish of me to not use the resources I have and get a higher education that my ancestors could never afford or even think about. I am here to make everyone proud :)"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1725,"Why am I here? I don’t know. But when I try to question myself again: do you really have to be here? Be in a physics class? I got the answer “yes”, then I kind of realize my purpose: to pass physic classes before getting a college degree eventually. Going back to my high school many years ago, I did not like physics class, because everything seemed too abstractive for me to understand, I almost failed in every physics exam. I assumed I would never study physics again. However, today I must pick physics class in college, that is because I want to earn a bachelor’s degree in biology, and physics class is required to achieve that goal. It is interesting that things and behaviors have related laws in real life, just like what physic topics deal with, of the relationship between matter and behavior through space and time. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1726,I am taking this course because it is a prerequisite for my major otherwise I probably will not take it. So far the class has seemed easy and I am really enjoying it. There are many new things that I am learning and I hope to continue throughout the semester. One of the things I enjoy this class is because I like math and I think that makes the course seem more interesting to me. This is the first part of the complete course and I hope that the second part is just as interesting and not so difficult.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1727,"The question ""why am I here"" has many possible responses. If the question pertains specifically to why I am in this physics lab, then the answer is because it is a prerequisite for my major. I am currently deciding whether I want to change my major from business to either biology or physics. I think what I'm going to do is a physics major with a biology minor because both interest me but that would be the easiest route. I am here in this specific lab course because I originally wanted to major in biology and this is a required class for that route. If I major in physics, this class doesn't count for anything but I'm taking it because I'm also enrolled in calculus and would need to have already completed calculus to take physics with calculus. I'm pretty behind and should be graduating next semester but I dropped some semesters and didn't enroll for other ones so I'd say I should technically be a sophomore or maybe junior. This semester I am trying to get straight As and work really hard to learn because, up until now, I haven't really tried much in school and it kind of feels like a waste. I'd really like to major in physics because I love math and I love the world and want to learn more about it. I feel like there is a lot left to do in the world and I want to be a part of making it better. So uhh yeah."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1728,"I am here because I need this class for my major requirements. I am also here because I am curious about certain concepts of why things happen the way they do. I am here on this earth because I am meant to show my full potential. I am excited to get one step closer to my career and future. My son relies on me and that is why I am here but also going to school is very important and my son seeing I am in school too is going to help him understand how important it really is. I also realize that some concepts are a little difficult to understand but if I practice enough and take it little by little to learn the steps, I will be able to understand better."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1729,"Reflective Journaling #1 Why Am I Here?I am here in this class because this is my journey to my purpose in the medical field, what motivated me to want to go into the medical field is because I want to help and make an impact on people's lives for the better, but I want to target people of color mostly because there is a lot of inequality within the medical field on who gets the most access to great healthcare which is why I want to break that barrier. I feel that taking this class will give me some knowledge that can contribute to my career of helping others to the best of my ability. I see a life for myself that I know I can accomplish pushing all the stereotypes and opinions about being an African American woman being a doctor in the field. Furthermore, what brought me to the class is my goal to help the black and brow community. Physics is a way to give me a foundation and open up many doors to showing more of my potential in society and health to make a difference. Additionally, I feel that this will help with coming up with calculations whether that prescribing medicine for people's health or helping with someone's treatment which is definitely a big factor for me in the medical field which I will be taking advantage of every day.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1730,"I am here because I do need it as a requirement. I do like physics as a subject. It is interesting, but it is so broad and so dense with the info needed that it can be a bit scary. Already, as a Bio Major, I have a lot of info to memorize, but it is tangible. There is some overlap with tangibility with Biology and Physics, but there is way more math in physics as well. I love math, and I enjoy math. I do have Dysgraphia. I will, not on purpose, switch things around, especially on tests. 95% of the math professors I have grade on the correct answer, not the method. I have had them say that my method would be right but im docking 80% of it because the answer is wrong. It's really defeating. (The teachers aren't from here.) IM SO NERVOUS FOR VECTORS."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1731,"""Why am I here?""Well I really don’t know where to start but one I’m the first in my family to go to college. My parents came here for a better life. My dad didn’t get the chance to finish school because his parents weren’t ok financially. So he made his way here. At first I had a lot of motivation to go to college and attend it. Like I was so excited when I first started but everything started going south when covid hit most of my classes where online and I honestly learn better in person. So if you see I struggle a bit it’s because it’s taking me a bit longer to understand the subject. And I was also having problems with my financial aid so let’s just say my motivation for school went down. The bit that I have left is making my parents proud. I’m starting to get little by little my motivation to actually get work done."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1732,"I am here because this course is a degree requirement in order for me to receive my Bachelors in Science degree in Biology with an emphasis on zoology. I am reaching towards a career in Veterinary Medicine which requires me to know science very well. This course from what I have noticed so far includes a lot of critical thinking form my part. I think this course is going to challenge me to think about my answers and how to get to my answer by really thinking about the steps that I take. I think the reason this course is a requirement is so that as a person pursing a degree in medicine, we must acknowledge how to get to our answers carefully. The reason I am also here is because today I had my day off work. I decided to take the Thursday lab for Physics because Thursdays are my day off from work and I have more time on Thursdays to take longer classes "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1733,"I am taking physics laboratory and lecture because I want to go to medical school and want to grow my own knowledge, and it is a required course to take for my GE. This is the first physics class I am ever taking, and I also want to learn more about the world we live in. For example, I understand how energy works, weather, gravity, and so many other things.  I want to develop my problem-solving skills and my critical thinking. I also struggle with calculus. I hope during the course I can get a better skill on how to do more problems with calculus. I also wonder a lot about how things were built, for example, roller coasters, transportation services, and GPS signals from my phone. By learning physics, I can learn more about the technology I use, transportation, and movement motion. I am excited to see how I can grow my knowledge during this course"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1734,"I am here at SFSU taking this class because this is one of the labs I need to take in order to continue my journey to becoming a physical therapist. I need this class to continue taking more kinesiology based classes for my major and so I can get my degree. Today specifically, I am here to connect what I have been learning in my Phys 111 lecture class to a lab where I can demonstrate what I have been studying in lecture, which will help me improve my understanding of what we have been taught so far. Today, we will be learning more about vectors which we have just started to learn about in Phys 111. I am also here in this online class because of COVID-19. If it hadn't been for this, I would probably be taking this class in person, where the scenery and learning environment would be very different from me sitting at my desk on my computer at home. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1735,"I'm here today because I need to take this class, and also because I'm a little curious to see how physics labs will work online. I have never taken a physics lab before, so I'm a little excited to see what we do. I'm here today because I want to know if I even like physics as a class. To be honest, I have always avoided taking classes like physics. In high school, I had the chance to take physics, but I choose not to. I didn't take It because I was worried that I wouldn't understand it and that I will fall behind. I thought physics was going to be way too hard, so I avoided it until now. Now, that I'm in the class, I still feel nervous because the subject is a bit challenging. However, I do feel a bit better after meeting the professors and the students here. The class does seem hard, but everyone is so supportive and helpful, that I am not that scared going into the lab. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1736,"I always wondered why I am here in college? I never thought I would make it here and I really never expected myself to take so many classes that will later worsen my mental health. To be honest, the only reason I am here is to have an escape from my household and because my mom nags me constantly growing up about “You need to go to college and finish your degree so you can get an excellent job.”  I do agree with her statement because nowadays in order to get a stable job you would need to show jobs that you have a bachelors or masters (which I think doesn’t make sense because most jobs now don't care what you major in. It’s all about experiences and connections you make). It sucks seeing that our society revolves around students majoring in something they’re not interested in, instead they need to do it for money. Which is the reason why I am majoring in Physiology because I can get this degree in the  medical field. But I have always been interested in Psychology. Many people I knew told me that I would be great in this because of how wise and knowledgeable I am with people and their viewpoint in life. I would agree that this might be my purpose in life but will it help me make enough money to support myself in the Bay Area? (Probably not, if so then I am pretty lucky). That’s why I am thinking about double majoring with both Physiology & Psychology but I am afraid of going into debt and the amount of time balancing self-care, job and studying. But hey it's college. I'd rather live for the experience and go into debt than regret not putting my life to the fullest because college days go by quickly and I'm already a sophomore?! I am going to make the most of it and have fun with what I can do."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1475,"Why am I here? In the purpose of this physics class I am here for one of my requirement for my major, which is biology. I am interested in sports medicine and the human body. I'm not sure what I want to be as a career title, but I know I want to work in the medical field one day. This class would help me on my academic journey."
