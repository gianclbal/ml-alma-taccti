2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1717,"When life gets challenging, I get very overwhelmed with my schooling, being a mom and yet somehow managing self care. I tend to feel frustrated and feel like I'm not doing well in school and then I remember why I am doing what I am doing. I will then look at youtube tutorials on the subject that I am not understanding, which in this semester is most likely physics and chemistry. If I watch several youtube videos, and still do not understand, I will then reach out to my peers and ask for help and guidance. I have not yet reached out to San Francisco State’s tutoring center task yet but that would be my last resort since I can’t be on zoom for very long because I have other responsibilities to tend to. So when life gets challenging, depending on the circumstances most likely would look like this. If it were a challenging situation with my son or my workplace, I will try to make things better. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1727,"When life gets challenging, I try to take a step back. It's important to remember why I'm working so hard and what I want as a result. When I get really stressed I lose sight of my goals and my motivation disappears. I try to remember that life won't always be that hard and I'm working towards something really important for myself. I have been really stressed in the past couple of weeks trying to balance work and school. I also try to find time to relax. Relaxing is really important when you're stressed because you need to chill and not get overwhelmed. I try to take breaks during studying or homework to listen to music or play with my cat instead of working for hours with no breaks. Giving myself frequent breaks makes doing the work seem not as hard. I also have learned that one assignment being late won't be the end of the world and that it's important to prioritize mental health over everything. If I'm overwhelmed and stressed, I'm not going to be as good as I could be. Missing an assignment or turning it in late is better than working all day every day. It's good to find a balance between the two and not let one swallow the other."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1725,"There will be multiple times when life gets to challenge to no matter who you are. Responding to difficult situation takes a lot of emotional energy. For myself, I am shaming to tell that I used to be a weak person to hold my self back when approaching to difficulties in the first place such as burning out with fear, falling into self-doubt, hesitating to move on. But then, I notice those negative emotional struggling do not helpful at all, only drive myself deeply into failure instead. So I learn to write down the challenges, think of the root cause of difficulties, and look for solutions for those challenges. The most important thing that I learn from those people who can be quickly recover is ""real action"", small action does matter, do not let myself sink into negative emotions too long."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,669,"When life gets challenging for me I tend to do two things. One of the things I do is isolate myself. It might sound a little contradictory to what people usually recommend but I like to be alone sometimes. Being able to process what is going on, to think about that particular point in my life and to take it all in without any social pressures or people talking to me. Sometimes what people say can only make a situation worse, which is why having time to oneself can work for many people. Usually I'll listen to music or watch television shows when I'm alone. If this seems to not work for me, I do the opposite. I surround myself with love by keeping myself busy with friends, family, coworkers, whoever is there for me and can take the time to listen. Sometimes even playing a video game with someone can be more than enough to not feel alone. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1735,"When life gets challenging, I usually try to take a step back and try to relax a bit. When life gets hard, I usually get stressed out and anxious all the time, so I take steps to calm myself down. When I feel anxious, I try to take deep breaths to calm myself down. I also usually try to take a break from the work I am working on, or if I am stressed because of a family matter, I try to take my mind off the situation by doing something else. To distract me or when I need a break from school work, I go outside and get some fresh air. I try to walk my dog or just stand outside for a few minutes. When I am super stressed, I journal about what is happening. I think getting how you feel down on paper helps calm you down, at least for me. I also talk with my friends about what's going on, or just talk to them about something else to get my mind off things. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1715,"Not everyday is easy some days are more challenging than the others things tend to get challenging especially during this time, when I feel like life begins to get challenging I take a quick meta moment and reflect on the things that are currently happening to me if the reason comes from classes I usually take time to understand the topic even further which plays a major role when life begins to get challenging. Overall I tend to calm down look at the bright side and try to give it the least attention so it doesn’t drag me down in my own thinking and choices. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1724,"When life gets challenging, I usually respond in two ways. one - my brain shuts down and doesn't want to deal with it, I usually get a headache or something caused by anxiety, and then I binge a series until I feel like I've procrastinated enough, then do random productive things to fill the gaps in time, laundry, clean, exercise, etc. OR I get really productive. I write down everything I need to get down and arrange it in the order of importance, I make sure I eat something and have a yerba mate and my water bottle around and start eating away at my list. I don't really leave the house because I don't feel like I've deserved it. It takes time for me to really focus in, but once I'm hyperfocused on something, I'll go until I finish. I put on a 6-8 hour study video on youtube then go from there! I usually end up finishing my work an hour-ish before it's due because my brain already feels fried. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1713,"When life gets challenging I tend to try and take mental breaks. One of my down falls I do when I am stressed is I shop. I love to go to target and spend too much money on unnecessary things.. But whatever makes me happy lol. Some of my best ways of coping with stressful times is I listen to music or go on hikes. I like to spend a lot of my time in nature because as cliche as it sounds, it makes me feel grounded. I am able to escape so much and enjoy the outsides. It's a very good distraction. Listening to music gives a lot of benefits as well. There is so much music for every type of mood and helps a lot with cheering you up when you're stressed. Another great way to ease through stressful times is journaling. I like to write and take pics and put it into a journal and it very fun to look back on and see how far I have come, the places I have been, the people that have always been around me and just see where I am now. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1379,"When life get challenging I look for ways I can solve the problem I am in. The most important thing I do is try not to stress about it. The more I tend to stress over something, the harder the task becomes. When life gets hard you have to know when to ask for help. Understanding that getting help is okay and will help you in every situation. Most of the time asking for help will resolve the problem. If I am chalked with school I asked for help or try to teach myself. If you teach yourself you will master what you are learning. Another important thing is to take time away from everything to relax. Sometimes stepping away from the situation best helps me. I like to go to a place with a nice view and some good food.  Doing this not only helps with my stress but also helps me recollect my thoughts on how to move forward. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1734,"When life gets challenging, some things I like to do include venting to friends or family, taking a small break to reset, and making sure I'm in a positive environment. By venting or talking out my problems with family and friends, this helps me feel that I am not alone and do not have to keep my feelings bottled up. These people can also help me feel better by offering advice or their support. Taking a small break can be useful since it can keep me from becoming too overwhelmed with a challenge. It gives me a chance to breathe and think about what I am doing rather than stress too much about something while allowing me to come back to the challenge and try again from a different perspective. Making sure I am in a positive environment can be very helpful as well. For example, if I and having a hard time with a certain assignment and I am working on it in my room but it is messy, this can add to my stress. Therefore, making sure I am in a clean space can help my mind relax a bit."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1714,"When life gets challenging, I usually go to someone I trust to rant or talk about my issues. Some days when I need alone time I usually go out and take a walk with my dog or relax and watch some tv. When I am facing a stressful time in my life it's always best to make sure I have time to myself to reflect and relax. When I become super stressed, I like to take a nap or keep myself busy so I don't constantly think about it and worry all day long. I also tell myself that whatever is going on is going to eventually end and things won’t be as stressful anymore."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1721,"I have a tendency to distract myself from the challenge or obstacle for a short period of time before I really try to overcome it. These distractions are mainly just methods I use to calm down and relax myself so I don't get overly stressed out. Once I get too stressed out, my motivation and my mental health completely drop so I try my best to avoid that because for me it's very hard to get out of that state of mind. I enjoy exercising, working out, listening to music, dancing, hanging out with family and friends and eating delicious food. Working out and eating delicious food really does help me during a challenging time because it conditions my mind to believe that similarly working out constantly is hard but I can make myself do that, it'll help me become stronger and more tempted to get through my obstacles. Having a good support system really does help too, I always remember that I have a good family that care about my well being and will always be there for me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1732,When life gets challenging I would love to say that I can pick myself up and get back stronger but honestly sometimes it really is easier said than done. This semester has been very tough for me and getting back up seems like it has been harder than ever. I feel ver burned out and we are only half way through the semester.  I would love to start exercising more to de stress but I don't have the time for it. I would love to start focusing more on school rather than personal life but I've come this far already sometimes sacrificing personal challenges is what will help me succeed so hopefully next semester I will move out to the bay for in person classes. I think it is easier for me to fall behind with online classes. I look forward to being on campus and in person next semester
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1720,"It's hard to say what I do when life gets challenging because I react in different ways and depending on that reaction I take different approaches. One of the things I do when life gets challenging is take everything one step at a time. I try not to think about and overstress the future, rationally of course. I try to slow down and not let it get to me as much, most of the time that just means bottling up feelings. I keep doing well in school because accomplishment makes me feel better and usually treat myself with snacks. I often self isolate but I don’t do it on purpose. If school gets hard I just grind it out and try to keep up. If I get frustrated I set up homework and study plans to keep myself from being overwhelmed. I also definitely ask for help if I need it.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1733,"When life gets challenging I try going for a walk, figure out a new plan, rethink what to do and what is the best option. I know with the pandemic and in school, it is harder to learn and there can always be new challenges. For example, sometimes the internet doesn't work,  harder to communicate with classmates and many other challenges. Life is supposed to be challenging it not suppose to be easy so I  always try to think about what I can do resources that I am provided with and what is the best plan for me or what I should do. Sometimes it s about my mental health and I always think about ways to make it better or what negative events in my life to eliminate it and do something more positive. Going for walks really helps me the most because, with depression, anxiety, and other mental issues I have walking really helps me show I am grateful to be alive and live in such a gorgeous part of the world. It is something so easy to do everyone walks but not to really think or clear air or just admire what is around them. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1722,"Right now, I am dealing with a lot being far from home. My uncle just passed away suddenly on Saturday due to covid and complications. He was getting better last week but he ended up getting a stroke back to back in his sleep.  My family has been calling and texting me all week for preparations. With this news, my father fell ill as well. Luckily, I have my brothers who traveled home to be with him but it has been very stressful. This week has been hectic in school as well with exams and projects due. I'm trying very hard to not fall behind but it feels like I am drowning. I feel like I have been able to keep up with my classes and even do assignments ahead of time just to be ahead. I am losing control. When I feel stressed out I usually go for a walk with my dog to distress but this week hit hard. My friends have reached out suggested taking it day by day and to which is helping. I have an exam on Friday and after that, I am planning to travel home to be with my family.  Hopefully, with support, life will be less challenging. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1719,when life gets challenging I like to take a step back and slow down. I try not to overwhelm myself when I am stressed or else I will be super unmotivated. I like to lay down and take a nap if I've been doing schoolwork a lot recently or go on youtube and watch funny youtube videos. last year I liked watching idiots in cars but this year I tend to watch more mukbang/eating videos
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1718,"When life gets challenging for me I tend to talk to my family about it because I feel like once I talk about the problems I have with someone I love, the problem goes away. That's always been me when I had problems, I would talk about it with someone I love and them listening to me and giving me advice helps me a lot. And if my family/friends are busy then I would play with my dog Bentley because he makes me happy and he also makes all my problems go away because dogs are just happy animals in general. And also I would do self-care things like going to the nail shop or watching my favorite movies/shows and even FaceTiming my family members because those things tend to make me happy and it makes all the problems go away. Sometimes I drive to my friends house and we hang out and having fun in that moment makes me forget about all the hard things I'm dealing with during the day. And I also plant so walking outside and seeing my plants go make me happy too. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1723,"I honestly have the tendency to completely check out when life gets challenging, almost like I go into autopilot mode. Nonetheless, I do force myself to push through because I know life will get even more challenging if I choose to ignore my current issues. When life is challenging, I tend to find everything meaningless, so I often do not put my best effort into anything. I start doing tasks just to get them done, and just get through the day. I recognize that this a really unhealthy habit, and attempt to work on still trying to understand the importance of certain tasks- even when things are challenging. Hopefully with time, I can overcome this issue. I have learned that certain tasks do make me happy, even when I’m incredibly stressed- things like listening to music and organizing things. When things are challenging, all I want to do is sleep, so I try to mix in things that normally make me happy into my tough schedule as some sort of stress relief."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1726,"I honestly believe that I have lived my entire college experience full of challenges. It's hard to get a good grade in science class while you have a full-time job. I think those are the biggest challenges that I face every day, but when this happens I try to give myself some time to rest from the stress of each day. Sometimes I take a full day after finishing all my homework and go to enjoy other places or nature or just think about something other than school or work. I always try to be responsible and do all my work on time without procrastination. When life really becomes full of challenges, I also approach my parents for advice since it is always good to have opinions from another point of view. As I said before, the biggest challenges that come my way in daily life is school and work, but it is always something doable. One of the things that I also do when life gets full of challenges I approach my girlfriend who is always there for me to listen to me and that helps the mind too much, being with someone who knows how to listen to you."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,1728,"When life gets challenging, I take a moment, stop, and think. I ask myself questions like is it something out of my control? Is this going to make a positive or negative impact on my life? As well as, who is involved? Once I ask myself these questions, I am able to be able to come up with a plan on how to solve this challenge. What would be considered the next steps for me would be to meditate, do something good and healthy for myself (for example: fitness or pampering) and surround myself with positive energy with the people who love and support me. Life never comes easy but if we have the steps to overcome the challenges and we continue to remind ourselves we are worthy, we can conquer anything. Challenging times are here and now and they may seem to keep getting worse BUT they do not last forever. Staying strong during tough times is very important because a lot of people suffer from depression and it can go unnoticed due to them not feeling like anyone will listen or care. We need to get through the steps to stop, think, and listen to the sounds of nature and surround ourselves with love constantly."
