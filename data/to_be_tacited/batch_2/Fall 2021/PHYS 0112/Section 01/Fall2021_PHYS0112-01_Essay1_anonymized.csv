2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1589,"I am here in this class as my career goals require me to take physics. I am an aspiring pilot and a Cardiac Surgeon. In the field of pilot, physics is very crucial, an individual must know the in and about of the aircraft and how it operates and stays in the air being extremely heavy. I am also here because of my interest in the field of science, science really fascinates, all three of them, physics, chemistry and biology. I am here to make myself a better person and enjoy college to the fullest before medical and flight school, because then my life would just become studying for 365 days straight. I really want to learn more how the forces work like gravity, centripetal force etc. I believe education can make a definite meaning of your life, and physics lets me know how things work. Even our dad to day commodities have physics principles in them.,"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1505,I believe that we all have a purpose in the world. It may be to do big things or a lot of things but we’re all able to make a difference in someone’s or many people’s lives. I am a first generation college student and came to college with the hopes of studying dentistry after my undergraduate. I chose dentistry because I wanted to be able to make an impact by working in low income areas and helping those out who possibly can’t afford insurance. I would also like to do seminars at schools in low income areas to teach children the importance of oral health and possibly inspire a new generation of dentists. This is something I wish I had experienced growing up because eighth grade is when I chose to pursue dentistry as a career. During career fairs I never got to speak to a dentist which was disappointing for me. I also would like to inspire first generation kids that it doesn’t matter where you come from you can still make an impact and follow your dreams. I haven’t had the easiest first few years in college but I am not letting it discourage me from chasing my dreams. I had many mental breakdowns about this career choice because I wasn’t sure if I was capable of handling the academic work but after speaking to advisors they saw how passionate I was about dentistry and told me not to give up.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1590,I'm in this physics laboratory class so i can progress toward my chemistry major. i'm here so i can learn about physics in a more practical way instead of it being mainly from a lecture. to get a visual idea of how physics work. what i want to take out from this lab is that it would help supplement the physics lecture. Hopefully the lecture and the laboratory can enforce ideas and concepts from each other so that the learning process of it sticks more in my head. the connection with chemistry i guess would be with the electron configuration since chemical bonds are decided by the chemical property of the element. i hope everything goes well in this laboratory.  i hopeful that with this practical experiments it'll be something that would useful in my daily life. i want to get a solid foundation of physics so it'll help me in the next course.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1591,I am here at my desk trying to get a degree in a field I know nothing about and I am scared of what I am doing next. I have great opportunities for jobs but I don't know if they are stable or if they can provide me with a good living. I am struggling to feel stable but I think I'll just do what I do best and keep working. Something will probably work out. Probably. I have dreams and things I want to do but they aren't realistic so I have to have some sort of back up plan. I hope I can figure things out soon.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1592,"""Why am I here?"" can be taken in many different ways, and I will be attempting to answer this in my own way. I believe that every human has a positive purpose in life; whether they choose to follow it or not is a different subject altogether. For a long time, I walked the wrong path. I struggled at school, lost a relationship of a few years, and lost my friends one by one. I had no real direction and motivation and living alone did not help. After a certain event, I decided to set my life straight. In all these classes, I had seen people who knew what they wanted to do – at least somewhat – and thought: well, they know why they are here. After thinking long of what I really enjoy, I discovered GIS (cartography and map analysis) and remote sensing (satellite imagery analysis). Now, I know why I am here on Earth, and it is to help humanity advance through scientific research of our solar system. The world is not at its best, and we must all focus on making it a better place in our own way."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1593,"WHY AM I HERE?I am here to succeed. This is my second and LAST chance I have at passing physics and getting through my last 2 years of college. Before COVID-19, my motivation in almost everything was little to non-existent. George Floyd, Vanessa Guillen, COVID-19, the BLM protests... my heart hurt for the world. The world seemed to be in chaos and I felt hopeless, anxious and scared because I felt like there was literally nothing I could do to help because of quarantine. Along with school, there were other factors that played into my lack of motivation for last semester and the year overall. However, I am back and motivated and ready to retake and aced this course with flying colors. I am going to finish my degree and get this bread. I just have two more years. I am literally half way there. I made it this far, just gotta keep pushing forward."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1594,"I am here because I was conceived on this big blue rock in 2002.  I am here to live life and have fun.  I am here to become successful and achieve my goals.  I am here to further my knowledge and education.  These are all reasons I believe I am here, but why am I truly here?  Do I have a destiny?  I believe I have a destiny.  I believe people don't meet each other by accident and that everyone has a lesson to be taught.  Many things go through my mind when given this question, but when relating to currently, my answer is changed. Currently, I am here, sitting down typing this Reflective Journal #1 to reflect on why I am here and to be able to learn physics in order - to continue - to pursue my degree. During this journey, to my destiny, I hope to achieve personal success and true happiness."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1595,"why am I here? For many other people, they question the same thing. To question one's self and their surroundings is to realize there is no right way to live life and be living in such a confined setting won't get you to acknowledge who I am as a person or 'you'. There is no reason for why we are here other to live and learn and gain experience with understanding our personalities and mind. Nohting is perfect, the only way for life to seem perfect is the way you decided to look at the future and the world around you from everyone's point of view. To be open enough to learn things that peak you and implement new life styles and ideas that make you enjoy where you stand at in life. There is no right or wrong way only what you decide for yourself will determine your emotions and how you react to such bad issues/events. So for as why am I here? I'm not sure, I just wanna be happy, successful, and be able to provide my family feel they've pushed so hard to get me where I'm at. I have no idea what is it that I'll do in my future but present wise, I'm here to fulfill my needs as a student and take the opportunities given to me. No words will ever truly explain the feelings ""why you are here"" it changes everyday and nothing is ever linear with goals and aspirations."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1596,"I am attending sf state to be able to get a degree in biology. Sf state is near my home so i am able to commute back and forth everyday. After I graduate sf state, I want to go to med school to pursue a career as an obstetrician. This class is just a step closer to pursuing this career. It has been my dream career for as long as I can remember. I want to be a role model for my 2 nieces and nephew who I am responsible for 24/7."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1597,"I feel as though I am here in order to grow as an individual. ""Here"" in my case, is defined as the current stage in my life. Everything in my life and all my choices I have ever made have led me here and I feel as though my current state of being is somewhere in between growing up and being a kid. I feel more independent and productive as ever before, and I am extremely happy with how my life is going as of right now. I have grown past many things in my life that used to be considered childish, yet when I look at my age and how I look, I still feel like I consider myself to be a child. I feel as though me being ""here"" is the stage in my life where I should be growing and making memories, while also setting myself up for the rest of my life. I am entering such a large decade of my life, my 20s, in which my entire world will flip upside down, and I feel like I have been trying hard to live in the moment and love things how they are now, while also anticipating and preparing myself for the inevitable changes. I am excited, stressed, and hopeful. The reason I am here is to become and prepare myself to become the several other versions of me that will exist in my lifetime. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1598,"Why am I here?I must be here for something bigger than life itself. I'm here so that I can expand and grow. I am here to learn life lessons. Yes, I go to San Francisco State to help achieve my degree, but it's also to mature as an individual. I hope to grow mentally as much as I grow physically over time. I plan on becoming a Naturopathic Doctor, and studying holistic health. Holistic health provides physical, mental, spiritual and social needs. I want to be able to make a difference in this world whether I help one person or millions. I hope to be able to heal people physically and emotionally. We are all divine people on this world living a human experience. We must thrive in our health and find peace in our minds. That is a big goal in life for me that represents why I am here. I hope we have a great semester and I feel ultimate support from this class. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1599,"To be perfectly honest, I am here in this class because it is a requirement for my major and a co-requisite for physics 111. In high school, I took an AP physics class, but I can't say I enjoyed it too much. It was hard. I struggled. The environment itself was kind of fun though, doing labs and figuring out how things work, despite how it isn't instinctual. Many of the problems I had to solve were counter intuitive, which confused me often, so I can only say that physics isn't a subject I love. I do have some prior knowledge, but it still is a bit scary, just trying to guess what assignment is next, will it be hard, and will I be able to understand it well? I hope I can use what I learn in this class though, for the future whether it's for physics 121, the MCAT, or in my career, I just hope I can retain and utilize this knowledge to help me or someone else I know. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1600,"I am at SF State to fulfill my dreams of becoming a nurse. Ever since I was a young girl, I dreamed of working in a hospital where I can help others because it brings me happiness and fulfillment in my heart knowing that I can comfort and take care of someone while they are sick and vulnerable. I have many personal experiences that play a role in my inspiration to pursue a career in the medical field. The biggest reason being that my mother is actually sick which has given me a lot of firsthand experience being in a hospital around nurses and doctors that take such great care of her. It all started with the hope to become a doctor until I grew older and realized how long I would have to go to school. Now, I am working hard to become a nurse practitioner by obtaining my bachelor's degree and master's degree in nursing. I want to be the first in my family to graduate from college because I know how proud my family would be. It's not an easy path, but I continue to work hard to become a more knowledgeable student and a powerful woman."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1601,I am here to get a college degree and start supporting my family. My goal is to finish here at San Fracisco State and carry on to either nursing school or a clinical laboratory scientist program. I have 2 years of medical field experience and I want to continue working in the medical field after I finish school. I started late with my college career and I feel like I am playing catch up to my friends. I started here at San Francisco State as a transfer student and this is my second fall semester at this school. I hope to finish soon so I can go start working in my career field of choice. I am taking this class to fulfill my graduation requirement for my major. I am hopeful my college career at this university will open many paths in career choices. I know my career is not set so I hope to learn and experience different settings that will set up my future.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1277,"Why am I here? I believe I am within San Francisco State University to get one step closer to my career goals. I’ve always loved the city therefore I decided to attend SFSU. As for my career goals, I want to go into animal conservation or rehabilitation. Growing up I always would watch animal planet shows and grew up having different kinds of pets. This all resulted in me wanting to work with animals and seeing all the possible ways I could help them and the environment. Although SFSU isn’t a well known school for this career path, that's where my major comes into play. Majoring in Biology, it allows you to go into any career path so that you are not limited. As a woman of color and being a first generation student in Stem, I believe it’s my responsibility to show others like me that we can accomplish our goals. College life is definitely not easy but it’s all a learning and growing experience."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1602,"My purpose in this life is to give. I am who I am in hopes of changing people’s lives. I want to impact people in the best way possible and hope when they remember my name it brings a smile to their face. For these reasons, I have wanted to join the health field because it is the best way to not only help physically, but mentally and emotionally as well. I have been born into a Muslim household with a very male dominant father and a passionate loving Catholic mother. Through them I have found my purpose to be a loving, independent, patient person. It gets hard to live in a constant double-standard but through it I have found my power and voice. I am well respected and even though sometimes it can get hard in the environment I am thankful for the person it has shaped me to be. You ask why am I here? I am here to love, to teach, and to inspire."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1603,"Ariana CarraWhy Am I Here?To be honest… I cannot give an exact answer. But I do know that a part of my purpose is to find true genuine happiness and peace within myself. And a part of that includes my time at SFSU. I need to l=dive my feet into topics and gain knowledge that will allow me to serve others in the future. Of course if we’re talking BIG dreams, I'll admit I want to be a pediatrician. But digging deep into my own desires, I’d love to be married and have a family. But in order to get there I know school is important. At state I have seen major growth spiritually, academically, emotionally, and financially. I am currently challenging myself academically, working out, and working 20+ hours a week. I believe personal growth is KEY. And I value my independence and how determined I am. Now the future can always change, but I know that who I am and where I am at right now is enough. And I have faith that I will end up where I am meant to be. And I will always strive to become a better version of myself. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1604,"I am here to learn more about how physics can be used in everyday life. To understand what role it takes place in my career path to becoming a dentist. I have also joined to hopefully better help myself in Biology to better take in the material I need to be successful throughout my college career. I have also taken this class to find a better understanding in the mathematics portion of this subject. I have always struggled in math but this year I hope to overcome this problem and get through this to my understanding. I picked this class as it was down to taking chemistry or physics and in high school, I have had a greater bond with physics than with chemistry. I also feel like my chemistry teacher made me hate chemistry as she wasn’t happy with what she taught throughout that year and she was retiring that year as well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1605,"I am here because I need to take this class. Once I finish this and a few other classes, I will be able to get into my major. Although physics is not my strong suit, I hope I do well. I have not taken physics since middle school. I had a choice of taking chemistry or physics in high school, and I chose to take chemistry because I thought it would be easier. I am not sure whether I am correct or not, but the lecture teacher is making that true. However, I think physics in high school would have been easier than taking it in college. That is also assuming I would be able to pass the AP exam. The teacher, from what I have heard, was pretty tough on the students and did not teach very well. However, I think most of the students that took the AP exam was able to pass the test."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1606,"I am here because I need this course as a requirement for PT school. My goal is to become a Physical Therapist/Sports Medicine Doctor. I believe that I am here to also give back to my parents and the world. My parents and I grew up in poverty and I feel like giving back to them is the right thing to do. Not only that, but I also feel somewhere in my heart that I am here to give back to the world and make this place a better place. I enjoy helping everyone and not only does it boost my self-esteem, but it helps me grow as a person. For example, I remember someone asking me for help with jump-starting a car and I had no idea how to do so. With a little online research, I was able to help the person and learned how to jump-start a car in the process. So yes, I’m here to help others and make this world a better place. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1607,"""Why am I here?""I’m here because I love science and it has always been a passion. I’m in this class because it is required for my major and also because I haven’t take physics since I was a freshman in high school and now I’m a junior. I wanted to take this class to kind of refresh what I learned in high school although I don’t remember that much. This semester I have challenged myself by taking three science classes. I did this because I registered late for classes and couldn’t find any other courses. I started to feel the challenge when I keep opening the ilearn page to check what homework I have for what class. I wish this class was face-to-face because I listen and learn better with no distraction. Hope to enjoy this class and get a good grade and gain knowledge. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1608,"Ironically I asked myself this a lot. In terms of my academic life, I'm here because I'd like to be financially stable and create a foundation for my future family to be more successful than I guess I was. If we're talking about the Course, I'd say that I'm taking it because it's one of the requirements for my major. I honestly never really thought that I'd even take physics. I didn't know science was for me at all, but now I'm here, I feel grateful that I even made it this far. It also allows me to question whether or not I'm as intelligently inclined as I think I am. or if it's just that I'm putting in all this work and something has to come out of it. If we're talking about life in general, I have no idea; I mean, sometimes I feel like we're here to impact people's lives while taking advantage of what life has to offer. Still, other times I remember that we have to live in this social construct, and school is necessary for us to do that. Then I get depressed but then at the same time also aware that there are so many other individuals who don't get the chance to have an education they were highly privileged to be able to do so. Hence, I'm here because I need a grade for my prerequisites to apply to medical school. Still, regardless I'm just happy I'm here. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1609,"I'm here to help animals and people to the best of my capabilities. I believe I was placed in this world to make a difference in the lives of both beings. I love learning, studying, observing and learning new health, treatments and improvements on how to help animals in need (reptiles, avians, exotics, dogs, cats etc.) and their owners. It gives me a wonderful sense of purpose when I'm able to make a difference in the animal's well being or their owner's lives by educating them, being compassionate and understanding. I want to fulfill my passion  to obtain my doctorates in veterinary medicine and continue providing the best support, medicine, and treatment that I can. It's important to be passionate about something, and I couldn't see myself doing anything else more than doing what I love regardless of how strenuous, overworked, tired and bruised I get in this field :) In the end, seeing the client smile when I return their animal to them in a better condition than they were before makes it all worth it. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1610,"Edwin Sanchez-AscencioWhy am I here ? I am here to learn and understand the concept of physics. I took physics at community college and passed the class, but I feel that I have way more to learn. During my first physics class I struggled and did not fully understand the concept. I passed the class with a C+, but I know I could do way much better. My second semester of physics I did way better than I thought I would, I received an A+. I decided to retake first semester physics all over again to see If I can get a better grade but also to be able to understand the subject more. I took better notes my second semester of physics because I knew what was expected of me, I hope to do better this semester. Physics is a hard subject, but I have to do my part. Physics is also a subject that will be on my DAT. I want to apply to Dental school once I graduate and also will major in Biology. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1611,"Why am I here? I am here because I want to learn to have a better understanding about the career path I want to be in. Im here because I believe that this is what I want to do with my life and I think that I would be successful. I am here because I chose to be. I am here because I chose to continue and not give up. I wanted to give up but I think that I am ready to get back into it. I thought about how it would be if I wasn't here and if I was somewhere else. If I didn't go to school, if I had a different job or if I had chosen a different major. I have thought about my decision many times and Im here because its the best path right now for me. I hope my plans don't change and they stay the same for me."
