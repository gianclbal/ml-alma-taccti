2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1277,"I’m currently majoring in Biology. My current goals are to have a career in wildlife conservation or rehabilitation. I don't have a set goal on the ways to get there except volunteer and get an internship to gain further experience. But the career I want to go into doesn’t have a lot of requirements compared to other career choices. This class is a requirement for my major therefore it will help me achieve my goal of reaching the requirements. In terms of Physics helping me, since it's something used in everyday life it can help me with things such as distance, time or temperature. Which will come handy when dealing with animals, knowing their behaviour patterns, survival tactics and physical health. But, based on doing physics problems and such I don’t think I will be doing that. Since the career I want to go into is more hands-on duties than problem solving. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1599,"My goal is to have a better understanding of physics, so I can apply it into my daily life and use it for later in my academic life such as physics 121 and the MCAT. Although this is probably a typical answer, I feel that if my goal aligns with the class objective, my mindset will change and motivate me to work harder in the class. The class itself will allow me to change my perspective on how I think about things, and make more efficient plans such as with the recent lab, I gave an example about force, vectors, and moving objects such as boxed in the post lab. My overall goal is to be a physician, an emergency physician to be more specific. In certain emergencies, non medical related knowledge will be necessary such as how much force will be necessary to get an object out of a wound, without putting too much force in where it will cause more damage. In physics, we have to sometimes thing and piece together information like in a hard problem, several topics will be needed like how difference medical fields work together to solve a problem."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1591,"My goal is to complete college and this class is helping me get the lab requirement  I need. The fact this class is only one credit is whack as hell, it just makes things harder on me. I'm struggling so hard in life right now and I just have too much to worry about. But I'll just do what I do best and get the work I need to get done by the end of the day done so I can sleep comfortably. My hope is that getting a degree will make things easier on me but for now things are difficult. I wish that I could find some time to relax but I don't have that time. I feel so stressed that I'm desperate to feel better. I just really want to do well but its getting harder and harder for me to feel confident in the work that I am doing."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1609,"My goals for this semester and this class is to get better at word problems, I feel most of the time it's difficult for me to interpret a visual aspect of what the words problem is asking & how to set it up correctly without a visual. I usually re-read the word problems last least 3-4x to make sure I am understand what the question is asking me. My goal is to try & improve my understanding of word problems by using piece by piece to try & come up with a visual aspect whether it's drawing a graph or drawing an object & having it move in a different position to give me a better idea. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1610,"Edwin Sanchez-AscencioMy goal in this class is to be able to understand each topic we learn, but also to be able to remember months from now the information I grasped. This class is helping me achieve my goals thanks to you/my lab professor. When you go over the topic before we separate and start the lab you make sure we get any questions answered. The pace when we are going over the lab lecture is reasonable and I do not feel like I'm getting rushed to fit something in my brain.  Another thing I like is that the slides help out a lot. I make sure I write down my notes, because it helps with the lab activity. The lecture lab slides not only help with lab activities, but also during lectures in my physics class, because what we talked about in physics I already went over in the lab so it's a refresher for me."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1602,"My goals have recently shifted.  My original plan was to just focus on school and get into a physical therapy program.  This class would help me with achieving that goal since it is a requirement for my major and puts me one step closer to going into a doctorate program.  My goal was to get my Bachelors, then masters and try to get into a physical therapy program.  However, I have been having a very negative relationship with my father at home and feel that my first priority would be to get out of the house.  He doesn't allow me to be independent and so my first goal would be to move out of the house without worry of someone else's control.  I still think this class helps with my goal because regardless I do need the course for my kinesiology major.  I just think I will put a hold onto my after studies and focus on trying to get a full-time job after I graduate to save up more and try to get my own place.  School has become harder this semester and I don't think being in this sort of environment helps with motivation.  My long-term goals are to become successful and be financially stable so that I don't have to worry about being on my own and then eventually have my own family within the span of 5-10 years. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1606,"My goals are to become a physical therapist or a sports medicine doctor. This class can help me achieve my goals because it is required to take this course in order to get into PT school. Therefore I need to get a good great and do well. Another course I need to do well in for PT school is physics 111 and this class allows me to get a lot of practice on topics I need to know in physics 111. For example, the other day there were a lot of vectors, position, time, and velocity problems in lab 2..? or lab 1 (I don't remember) and those practices helped me get an A on my lecture quiz. Not saying my lecture doesn't provide any resources or practice problems, I'm saying this extra help and work from the labs really help a lot! As for personal goals, I am planning on becoming stronger at the gym and my strength has been increasing a lot already. It was hard bc I lost a lot of strength from my break due to covid, but I'm slowly getting back into my prime, if not stronger. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1611,My goals are to make time for things and be organized. Making sure I start assignments early and don't wait for the last minute. staying organized with a list of things I need to do and keep my calendar unto date of assignments so I don't miss deadlines. I also want to not let stress be too hard on me and practice good stress relief practices.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1593,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""My goals in the beginning of this year were to continue my degree and become and obstetric gynecologist, however, my plans have changed and now, I am at a stage in life just like everyone where I do. not know what I want to study or start over on again. However, I have disappointing myself and not achieving my goals, which is why I vow that no matter how long it takes, I will complete and earn my degree. I just need to believe in myself and find a good school and support system that is going to help support my path in following my dreams. Although this seamster was one of the hardest semesters of my life, I am going to be taking next semester off to be figuring out what exactly it is that I want to do. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1589,"My goals in this class is to be as close to a perfect student as possible. I want this class to help me understand to fundamentals of physics, even hope our basic day to days equipments work.My end goal is to become a pilot and a doctor. Airplanes are all about physics and how to flies in thin air are all dependent on calculations and physics. This class is enabling me to understand the forces behind objects as to how is something so balanced and on the ground or in the air or in water. This course helps me to observe objects and try to imagine what is inside them and how it operates for example an iron that presses our cloths has some physics in it naturally. It helps me to see objects in a much broader spectrum. Physics is a way of life and can't be dodged as our view will be very decreased as to our knowledge about the world."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1604,"My goals for this semester were to not only pass all of my classes but to mostly gain knowledge from what I am doing. This class right here has been showing me that in so many fun ways with the labs we have been doing as I believe I am more focused on what is happening in some type of interactive way. I really enjoyed and was very focused on what the main point of the labs was and made me happier when it asked what I got from this lab and I knew what to write down and showed that I narrowly understood the assignment. This lab has been helpful with my goal also but makes more sense than my regular physics class! I don’t quite understand either but when I don’t wrap my head around what my other professor is saying or teaching, the following lab will make me understand with a breeze."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1597,"My goals are to graduate with my BS in zoology, then hopefully earn my DVM degree and become a veterinarian! I hope to graduate with high honors and not only just get good grades, but actually learn meaningful information that I will be able to use in my future career and help save some animals! In terms of short term goals, I aim to become the best version of myself that I can be and continue to grow into who I am turning out to be. I hope to grow my relationships in my life to a greater extent and make them stronger, while also focusing on myself and figuring out the best pathways for me. I hope to love myself more than I ever have in the past and continue to make myself proud and not worry about how anyone else perceives me. I believe this class will help me achieve my goals, not only academically but in my personal life as well, as this class pushes me to extend my knowledge to places that I never have before, and it has the potential to change my ways of thinking for the rest of my life. Though I am in this class due to it being a requirement for my degree, I feel as though there are reasons beyond academics for us to take classes that are seemingly difficult. I have already approached many of these problems with a different mindset than I would have before, and I am happy to be here and expanding my knowledge!"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1608,"My goal has always been to become a neurologist, but it feels like I'm overreaching at this specific moment. I am unsure if I'm mentally prepared enough for medical school. Or if I even love medicine as much as I did, however, I also acknowledge it can be fear talking because im supposed to graduate soon. I don't know if I will need a postback for a GPA or apply to medical schools without it. I also don't know if ill even gets accepted. I know I will invest in an MCAT tutor, though, but anyway, My goal for this class is to get a B. Ideally, I would love an A, but I started a little rough, and I'm not quite sure I can still achieve an A. This letter grade is high or ""good""  would help me maintain a good standing GPA to be eligible to apply to medical school and hopefully get accepted. I'd also love to retain the information as much as possible to remember when im taking the MCAT."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1594,"For myself I have many different goals in life.  Not all these goals are meant for school. My goals are more spread out because I want to experience and do a multitude of fun adventurous things.   For school, my goals are to obtain my degree with an impressive transcript, experience the best part of college such as making new friends, going to parties and allow the ""freedom"" to wash over my body.  Specifically, this class is helping achieve my goal of obtaining my degree.  This class is a lab class, which is meant to reinforce my knowledge of lecture, therefore offering a better looking transcript.  This class is also helping me make friends and study groups.  I was given permission into this class very late and I am still trying to finish the late work.  So my end goal for this class is to get catch up on the late work and to get an A.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1592,"My goal is to work for a space agency such as NASA, CSA, or ESA (all of which I am a citizen of). I plan to work as a GIS analyst specialising in either images of Earth - such as the cryosphere - with the Earth Observatory of NASA or images of other planets and moons in the solar system, which is my dream. I now realise that although I chose a field which will lead me to this, I am more interested in physics and geophysics than I thought (as I was a bad student in high school and didn't study enough so I hated it) and want to aim my career more in that direction. This class will help me understand physics in a deeper way than I have in the past, and I plan to use it to support my career in geomatics (and planetary science if I can shift my envi.sci/geog double major in that direction)."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1598,"My goals are to understand physics and try to apply it to my everyday life. I'm trying to not make it so confusing or complicated in my mind, its a lot easier than I think I just really have to focus and be motivated. I feel like often I zone out and that can set me back even just a minute. As a student I love collaborating with my peers and in the breakout rooms at first we worked independently but as time went on and the more we continued and ran into challenging problems- we spoke out about them and helped each other more towards the end. I work better in groups something about having that extra validation to check my answers and see if they are similar makes me reflect and feel like I'm on the right track and comprehending. This class can help me achieve my goals because we go into our breakout rooms for the majority of the class. I feel like the more we get comfortable during the semester then the more we can help one another and ask those questions with less intimidation. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1590,"My goal for this class is to be caught up with my assignments. I need to have better time management so I can decide with assignments take priority and when i should complete the assignments. With the many classes that I'm taking time management is key.  This class helps me with this goal by being a morning class. This prevents me from staying up too late at night because I know there is a class is the morning. Since the due dates are on ilearn this helps me plan out when my assignments are due. My other goal is to do better in the class. With the feedback they are helpful in seeing what i need work on. By being an online course I can get lose a bit in keeping up with assignments. I hope moving forward I can plan out my week and do my best in the assignments,"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1600,"My goals are to obtain my bachelor's degree and then my master's degree after gaining some experience in the medical field as a nurse assistant. My overarching goal is to become a nurse practitioner. I thought it would be a good idea to gain experience before diving right into being a nurse because I am still very anxious so I want to make sure this is what I am really passionate about. This class is helping me achieve my goals because it is bringing me one step closer to graduating as it is a requirement. Aside from being a requirement, this class is also teaching me many skills and useful knowledge about how the world around me works. Knowledge is power, so I am always grateful to be taking classes even if they aren't specifically for nursing because it can definitely help me in some way.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1595,"My goals are to work as hard as I can despite struggles I and many others may go through in this off time.i want to be able to pass my classes and feel successful with where I'm at. Not that I am not grateful for the place I've been put in, but it become very hard to be happy to be in a spot where you constantly feel doubt within yourself, confusion, and overall personal growth. Of course, that is the human experience. To not know what it is you're to do with your life other than live it the way you feel is right. Even being at school makes me question who I am as a person and even if I am attending for all the right reasons, it feels so hard to become the student I try to see myself as. I feel as though Im always falling behind on what I am studying and doing in life. However, to question my future and not live in the present, I live more in the fear of what ifs than in living and growing in the 'now'."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1612,"The goal that I am working on right now is to graduate as fast as I can with a degree in biology, so that I can go live life more as my authentic self. This class helps me achieve this as it is a requirement for me to graduate, and it is a class that enhances my understanding of physics, which should help understand biology and botany better."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1603,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?``''What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""To be honest, so far I like my learning process in this class. However, the copious amount of homework can be difficult to balance with other courses. But I do see how this homework prepares me for class. That being said, I hope I can use the community blog post homework assignments more to my advantage. Sometimes I post on there without thinking. But the other day I clicked through videos my classmates were posting, and I found they were actually very helpful. My goal is to take more freetime and use any/all extra resources that are provided to me on ilearn. I found it very helpful last week watching previous semester lecture recordings on zoom. This allowed me to follow along easily in class, and even correct/ add on to notes. It helped me focus! I also would like to make time to attend office hours, and ask questions about Expert TA homework. Sometimes I feel stuck, and coming to office hours would help me get my homework finished quicker. And would be more productive. But so far, I truly enjoy this class."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1607,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""My goals are to go to a medical school, work in a research lab, get a high GPA, and graduate on time. I’m taking this class because it is required for my major and also I haven’t taken physics since I was a freshman in high school. This class is providing me with some skills such as problem-solving and solving puzzles. Physics is required to take during bachelor’s degree in order to become a doctor or go to a medical school. I want to be a good student in this class and learn the basics of physics to develop my critical thinking and solving scientific problems. "
