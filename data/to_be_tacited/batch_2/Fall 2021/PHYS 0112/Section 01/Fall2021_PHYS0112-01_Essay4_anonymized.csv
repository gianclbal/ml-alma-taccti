2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1595,"I have some resources that I find helpful one of them being my old after school program that I graduated from that would always support me from middle school up all the way until college and more! They’ve been such a great opportunity and I am grateful to have been apart of a program tht makes sure that I will be comfortable in college, during my studies, while traveling on my own, they will always check on their students wellbeing and school activities. They are a great resource: it’s called Boys Hope Girls Hope"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1590,The resources that i have that can help me is the library. There are also online study tools that can help me in finding equations and such. There are many videos on youtube that can help in understanding more about the physic concepts. There is kan academy so many useful video about physics. There are also calculators that can help solve some of these equations. There are tutors that help me in certain  classes at the campus. What is most helpful to me is usually watching videos online to understand the concepts. With videos i can follow along so the step they took to figure out the concept instead of just arriving at the answer. Just getting the answer isn't helpful in learning about the concept.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1593,"What resources do I have to support me?I have supportive friends that motivate me and push me past my comfort zone in order to be the best version of myself that I can be. I have been going through a lot of things emotionally and mentally, COVID and 2020 overall has made me really anxious and fearful to go back to what use to be normal. Thankfully, I have secured a job at a newly opened Dutch bros Coffe shops in my town and I’ve made the best of friends there, including increasing my caffeine levels lol. I’m glad I have found a new job where I feel valued and appreciated and made new friends that love and encourage me unconditionally. I am not sure what I what to do with my degree anymore, let alone if I want to continue studying and take a mental break. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1604,"When being asked what resources I have to support me, I like to think about what people I have in my life to support my mental health. This person who has been very helpful and patient with me has been my girlfriend. She has been there for every stressful event of the college experience is always going to help me no matter the circumstance. Even with these labs, as for example, she helped me set up the coffee filter lab which was very helpful but if I ever need just a support team I know that I can count on my one-man or women lol team:) I’ll like to also quickly say that my iPad and MacBook have been amazing resources to support through school as it has been doing assignments easier than I could have ever imagined. I believe this type of tech is so good to be somewhat stressed free because it again just makes writing and turning in documents smooth."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1610,"Edwin Sanchez-AscencioPhysics is a very hard topic there is times where the lecture professor is talking really fast that I do not get the concept. I do not like to be behind because everything connects in physics, meaning the next step will have to do with the previous step he did. What I do is I get stuck behind I write notes and then mark a star next to what I do not understand, I either ask the professor a question if not I like to search the topic we learned on YouTube. There is many instructors on YouTube that talk about the subject and I go at my own pace trying to understand the topic we just learned in class. This helps me clarify anything I did not understand. Another resource that help is Khan Academy, they have videos and more problem solving equations where I can practice and repeat equations, the more I practice solving an equation the more confident I am when it comes taking a test. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1589,"I consider myself the lucky ones, I have vast resources in order for my success. I have wonderful teachers standing right by me to help me. I am so thankful for them as physics is a subject for me that I find hard to grasp, it takes me a lot of effort and time to understand the material but my professors help me to their fullest in order to make sense of the problem. I would say having a place which is quiet and private is resourceful but having a group study is the best resource as different minds and personalities are brainstorming to crack the mystery. I like group studies as I like hearing to different ideas and different methods of solving the problem. I have access to my professors office hours and the lab on top helps to gain a deeper picture of the subject. At home have my computer and my dad who is a mathematics and physics expert to help me understand and be my mentor. I am super lucky for my resources and grateful importantly. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1609,"I have plenty of resources to help support my understanding and growth in this class and my future academics in general. I have a laptop, and access to internet form home which some people may not have. I also have access to email my professors for assistance if something is unclear or if I need assistance with our lab procedure. I have access to my classmates to work together if I want to double check my answers or simply have another person's perspective besides my own when approaching a problem. Putting academics aside I have the support of my parents, my brother and my partner to help me physically and emotionally when my body/emotions have reaches their limitations. I also have amazing coworkers and a wonderful manager who all help me at work whenever I need a helping hand. It's nice to be surrounded by multiple resources to help support me whether its during my academics, work or just life in general. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1592,"My parents are my main source of support. Because of the cirumstances I have been through in the past few years and through my life in general, I do not have many friends. Only one of them lives near enough to me to be a form of constant support, but he also struggles with the same issues as I do. The way I work and the fact that I hand things in late makes it difficult for my professors to be able to support me amongst all their other students, and they can only guide me slightly in what I should do. I had a psychologist in the past as a good resource of support, but have recently not had one, which has been a big downgrade. My parents are my only family on the continent, and they help me through everything. They push me to be better and to expect the best in myself and the best I can be for others."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1601,"As for on-campus, I know that there are many resources that are available for me to support my learning. I can always go to the library to search for textbooks and supplementary information that would further my understanding of the topics I am learning in class. There are also student enrichment programs that are available to underrepresented students at our school, which emphasize social and economic disparities. Tutoring is also available by drop-ins and appointments virtually every day of the week and can be utilized to understand the material that is learned in our classes. I also recognize there are resources on campus that support mental health and awareness on campus. The health center has a lot of information for many students who are not emotionally well that offer services that are easily accessible. The health center also offers health services, such as checkups, lab tests, immunizations, medication services, and sexual health/ gynecological services for students. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1606,"Resources that I have to support me are my friends and family. I can always rely on them if I ever need help with anything including outside of school. I also have my professor's office hours if I ever need help understanding a concept. I got a new apple pen recently that I can use for my iPad which helps a lot with this class especially and my lecture course. Lastly, I actually work as a Physical Therapist Aide and I can always as the PT there or the PT assistant for things like a letter of rec, questions regarding PT or courses I need to get into PT school, and help with courses. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1599,"The main resources that I can think of are the office hours and emailing professors for help. This has always been the main way that I get help since unlike TASC, the professor knows exactly what you are working on and can help explain better. Of course, TASC is also a great resource for more general help, like concepts of subjects, and for lecture classes, but not so much lab classes. Friends are a great support, especially those who have taken this class before and can help me with assignments I'm stuck on. Peers give great help as well when I'm working on homework and don't know what to do. They can explain step by step or we can have study sessions. Apps such as discord, google calendar, notion, etc. help me through communication and planning."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1608,"Like I shared with you earlier this semester, this year has been extremely challenging for me. I honestly felt extremely overwhelmed and wanted to drop. I wasn't even struggling academically; I just didn't have enough time, and I overcommitted, which was entirely my fault. I never felt as if a professor could help me at my community college until I transferred to the state. As faculty, yall did an excellent job at emphasizing resources available to the students. However, I just wanted to say you created a safe place in class through your jokes and overall energy that make me feel like I could come to you when I needed help the most. You responded understandingly, which encouraged me to reach out to my other professors, and I realized I could use faculty as support. Thankfully the rest of my professors were highly understanding, and each individually helped me get through this semester, which I am forever grateful for. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1277,"There are several resources within our school and outside of school. Those within school would be the Metro program, tutoring centers, professors office hours, and major advisors that we can meet with. I am part of the metro program which offers additional help for first generation students whether tutoring or counseling. However, if one is not part of the program there are other tutoring resources. One can go visit a major advisor if they need help on the next steps to take to fulfill their major requirements. Attending professors office hours are also great for additional help on homework, questions or need of clarifications on the material gone over through class. If needed there are also resources within campus for mental health counseling. School can get stressful so it's another reducer to talk to others about what you're feeling and how to deal with it in healthy ways. Outside of school, my resources would be my friends and family. Some have taken similar classes or do well on certain subjects so I can ask them for help if needed. They can also be a resource when I just need someone to talk to as well."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1600,"Luckily, I have many support systems and resources to support me in my life. First and most importantly, I have my family who gives me the motivation and drive I need to keep moving forward in life even at my hardest times. Whenever I am feeling down, I know I can count on my mom to keep my head on the right track and keep me focused on my goals. My other family members like my dad and my brother don't quite understand my struggles, but they do a great job of checking on me to make sure I am always doing okay mentally and emotionally. My friends and I also have a great support system because we always check on one another and find ways to lift each other up when we are down. I also rely a lot on God and the power of prayer to keep me feeling supported and knowing that if all goes wrong I can stay sane by knowing God will lead me in the right direction. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1597,"A big resource that I have to support me is my boyfriend and his family! I honestly have some troubles going to my family for help because I feel like I have a high standard and almost reputation to uphold when it comes to them, and we never really have been much of a sharing/feelings/emotional family, if that makes sense. But I am super grateful for my boyfriend and how we became best friends throughout knowing each other and I am super grateful for the family that I've gotten through our relationship. I feel like I have a whole new support system and out of everyone I know I think that they believe in me the most out of anyone. They are my main resource of support, in terms of school as well as personal life. They know that I work hard and they truly show me that they are proud of me despite me not being blood related to them, which is more than I could ever ask for. They give me a home to call my own when mine does not necessarily feel like my own at the moment, and they truly show me love that I could never replace. Besides them, I would say my friends also show me unconditional love and support and believe in me probably more than I believe in myself sometimes. I find so much comfort and motivation through the people in my life and I feel so lucky and blessed to have these people and say that I am loved by them. I truly would not be where I am today if it was not for them, and I am very very appreciative of this, regardless of whether or not I always show it. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1591,I am so tired right now oh my god. I got sick recently so I feel pretty crappy currently. good news is my test came back negative so I don't got covid. Some resources I have to support me are my therapist. She's pretty great and helps me work out a lot of problems. My only issues is that I am so damn busy I legit can't see her as much as I want to. Because of that I get overworked easily and it becomes difficult to get through daily tasks without feeling overwhelmed.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1598,"The resources I have to support me would be the people in my life they keep me going for sure, and as for school wise my study group helps so much because we all have each others back and we know how difficult and hard classes can be sometimes and its really good to know your not alone in this is a whole crowd feeling the same way I am feeling. SO having them this semester has really been amazing because we all want to succeed so we all help each other if we get lost or stuck and we study for quizzes or exams! It's really great having a study group and I wish I had one like this last year because it has been one of my greatest resources connecting with people in the same class as me while being online! Being online makes its difficult to make friends so having a chat box for students really helps feeling like a class. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1603,"I don't really know of any one on one resources besides office hours. However, I often feel too nervous to attend office hours. In general I have really bad social anxiety and do better in group settings. Something that would be helpful is group meetups. At least on zoom. Another resource I have that I personally find very helpful are the community blog posts in our physics class. Those posts allow me to see what other videos my classmates are watching and are helpful when I feel stuck on material that we went over in class. Most of the videos are short, concise, and straight to the point. Sometimes classmates will post links to articles and regular scientific websites. As for outside of class resources, I would have considered the Metro program at SFSU a great resource. Metro helped set me up for success. They provided me with counseling and resources for jobs, food, and transportation. However, Metro is only a two year program which truly makes me sad. But I am thankful for the wonderful people I met, and those who truly cared for me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1607,"I don't have a specific resource that I considered as support for me. But, I think that the resources I would consider are knowledge, support from others, setting up goals, food, and life. Everything around me is considered a type of resource that would support me. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1602,"There are many sources around me. I know with the pandemic it may be a bit different because I am no longer on campus, however there are still ways I can find help if needed.  I always like to reach out to advising whenever I am stuck about classes and they respond fairly quickly to my concerns.  I also reach out to my counselor whenever I need a question answered about my path in my major.  I also have my emails set up in a way that I can get emails on any important information about school or any clubs or resources that are available.  The sfsu website is also easy to navigate and it can be helpful when trying to look for different resources.  Other than advising though, I haven't really used much resources except for the library database for projects but I know there are so many resources out there for different concerns. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1594,"Resources for students on campus are readily available, but not completely accessible.  There are useful things such as “sci”, which is designed to promote understanding of key concepts and enhance student success, and of course, my supportive friends and family.  Friends and family are big supporters, as they are the ones that give you the greatest motivation mentally and physically.  Although these things assist in success in the classroom, places like mental health and psychological services are also an essential option for students.  In today's society - with Covid-19 - these services are not as easily accessible.  Many service days and hours have been changed and due to the pandemic, some have even closed down.  Other support I have access to is counselors and therapists on or off campus.  A huge support are places like the SF state library, which contains free wifi, computer access and study area.  Resources on campus should be easily accessible and utilized by students."
