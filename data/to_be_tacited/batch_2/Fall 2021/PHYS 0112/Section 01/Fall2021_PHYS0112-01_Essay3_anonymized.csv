2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1593,"What do I do when life gets challenging?If I am being completely honest, I have major mental and emotional breakdowns almost every week. Growing up, I was never listened to and my feelings always felt invalidated, so when I am put in a position of confrontation or a lot of pressure, I do not know what to do. I have major panic attacks that literally make me feeling like its hard to breathe and the world gravity is just 100x more heavier than usual. But my friends and (sometimes) family (mainly my cute bulldog Princess) help me throughout those moments. I come from a strict Mexican, household. I am the oldest and only girl. AND my dad is military... yep, so you can imagine the horrors lol. I do realize that there are resources within the department and school that aren't designed to help students achieve and accomplish their classes, however, the amount of work/workload between both the lab and lecture is quite a lot and the graders have progressively gotten tougher on students (sometimes just for the wrong number of sigfigs). "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1592,"I am certainly struggling with this lab and another lab that I am in. There are two answers to what I do, depending on whether I win or whether I let my depression win. When I win, I go on a rampage, dropping everything I was doing prior to focus on what I have to do. Often, I am already late on my work, and this happens once a semester between the fifth and seventh week of classes. This, however, is when I am strong enough or get a kick in the rear by those around me to do my best. Usually, however, I let it spin out of control until I meet a brick wall of stress. I can no longer push back the problems I have and am forced to face them whether I want to or not. This mentality applies even for random assignments, which I hold off on until the last possible second. I need to work on that, as it is the last real problem that holds me back and hurts those around me. I'm not sure I answered the question properly, but that's what I do and that's why I'm late on my labs now."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1606,"When life gets challenging, I would normally give myself a break. I would take a step back and relax. I remember last year I was too stressed out with midterms, finals, and break that I asked my manager for a week break during Thanksgiving break instead of having the Thursday off and he totally agreed and understood. I also did the same with winter break. School wise I can't really ask for a pause so what I do is that I try to complete my assignments ahead of time so I won't have to stress about them later. I also like listening to music and playing video games with my friends and that really helps me relax and remember that it's not all about completing everything fast, but taking my time with it (this can also apply to life). Another thing I do is go to the gym and work out. Working out lets me enjoy music while working on myself and it always feels nice and refreshing afterward. I feel like I'm getting a mental reset whenever I finish working out. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1599,"When life gets challenging, my first thoughts are to usually take a break, remind myself to relax and calm down for a second, take a second to refresh my mind. This usually comes in the form of music, talking to friends, or watching some shows. Snacking is always great too. Petting my dog is the my favorite way to get my mind off things though, animal therapy. After that though, I try to get back into whatever is challenging and attempt it again. A break is good, but too long of a break if being too lazy. Challenging the problem from different angles, different approaches is one of my methods, but it's hard to do that, so asking for help is always okay from friends, mentors, peers, professors, etc. It isn't considered cheating, it's just tackling the challenge with hints. Resources like TASC is always great, and office hours when it comes to school problems. You can't be afraid of reaching out for help when you need it."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1610,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?""What I do when life is challenging is take a breather for around 5-10 seconds to clear out and calm my mind. Then I like to think about the good stuff in my life and how fortunate I am to have a good life. Then whatever is my challenge either an essay , exam, or homework, I start writing down in my notes or planner a plan into completing what I need to do. Writing down a plan is the best way for me to make sure I am doing everything on track and makes my life less challenging. It's also a nice feeling when you scratch something off your planner once it's complete. Not only does this work for challenges I have in school, but also in the real world. For example if I am struggling at work, I like to write down what was my mistake, what can I do better next time, what are other great options I should be doing instead."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1608,"Honestly, when times get challenging, the first thing I typically do is have a mental breakdown for like 5 minutes. Then make a to-do list. I focus on what needs to get done that day then label them from most important to least important. The to-do ist usually allows me to put everything into perspective. Once that's done, I try to block off time from my day to focus on catching up. Usually, I ask someone to cover for me at work. If they can't, I skip second school activities like sorority meetings or destino meetings. I try my hardest to hit the gym first to hype myself up and then blast hip-hop music and isolate myself in my room to the needed silence. I also forgot to mention I silence my phone and log out of social media, so I have absolutely no distractions. Before I plan on getting all my stuff done, I try to meal prep so I don't get distracted or fixated on something that does not matter. The day I have to worry about is heating my food and getting all my work done."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1591,Dude I am losing my mind just trying to make it through day by day. I don't know exactly what's going on with me but I'm just trying my best to survive. I am Finally back into the swing of things when it comes to school. I think the thing that saved me from breaking down entirely was live streaming on twitch. That helped me out a lot when it came to getting through tough times. Being able to interact with a community that enjoys what I do is great for me.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1590,"When life gets challenging what you can do is to keep trying. You can look for resources to help you to better yourself for the challenges that are ahead in life. By being better prepared you can face the challenges that may come in the future. Another thing is a have a strong heart to not let things bring you down. There was always be sad things in the world but there are happy things also. So having a strong heart to face through these hardship can make you stronger person. You aren't alone in these problems most people may have faced similar problems so they might have experiences that could help you along in the future. There will be another path in life, if one thing does not go as planed you just need to take a breath and see the other opinion that is there. Life may seems narrow but there are many choices to make."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1594,"Everyone has ups and down days, but when life gets challenging never give up.  Personally, when life gets challenging I try to intertwine, relaxing or fun things around the obstacle I am trying to overcome.  Although at times that isn't enough, I like to get my frustration out by going to the gym or punching a weight bag.  Also something that puts a smile on your face and takes your mind off the life challenge, is extremely important to keep sane in times of insanity. Another thing I like to do is plan or schedule out to better utilize my time and keep my day organized, allowing time to focus on the challenge at hand.  When life gets challenging, I believe all you can do is keep pushing and learn from your mistakes.  Like Kobe Bryant has said, ""We don't quit, we don't cower, we don't run.  We endure and conquer.""  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1602,"I have high anxiety, and tend to overthink a lot. This gets in the way sometimes when I try to overcome challenging moments.  All my life I have been put pressure and expected to always act a certain way and be the ""perfect"" one in the family.  For these reasons I don't tend to work well under stressing moments because I feel I just end up being a failure since things go wrong.  When life gets challenging I tend to shut down and just not care or not know what to do.  I don't reach out for help because I feel it is my fault that I am in that situation so its my responsibility.  This goes for both academic and social aspects in my life.  However, I do go to therapy so that has been helping a lot in order to help me talk my feelings and know how to be open to help.  I can also be very shy and find it hard to ask for help sometimes.  "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1589,"When life gets challenging, I tend to get very nervous and anxious, and almost feel like my world is slipping underneath me, in that case I usually go and tightly hug my dog, she is a beautiful golden retriever. When I am stressed I like to pamper and spoil her. I also like to take deep breaths and meditate. Try to open my mind and make it less congested as it is. I feel when my brain is congested I cannot think or work properly. I like to go to a beautiful scenery and get a restart with a refresh state of mind. I like to think that as to what I did wrong and what could be done to fix the situation. I have always been told to believe in myself and think with a cool mind and everything will be ok and back to normal in no time."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1604,"When life brings me down or is just hard in general, I have tried many techniques but only a few have brought me back up and keep fighting. Some techniques include is just go to the gym. I believe that putting everything down and just exercise makes me feel good as feeling healthy in my mind gives me the confidence boost that I needed. But this technique does have its flaws as I come back home with little to no energy left to continue my assignment. What I try to do when the gym isn’t the best option is just go on my Spotify playlist and just listen to soothing music. I feel like music with just sounds helps me concentrate so much more than music with lyrics. Especially if it’s music I know because I will get super distracted. Lastly, is that whenever I don’t get the chance to listen to music, I just try to go somewhere public and draw. Drawing a landscape of some sort or even drawing what’s in front of me on my iPad has given me a lot of relaxation and needed a break from whatever I was doing."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1597,"When life gets challenging, I usually freak out initially for sure. I think over the years I have gotten better at calming down and stepping back from the situations at hand and taking a look at everything from a more clear perspective, and have gotten better at trying my best to deescalate my feelings. I tend to get really overwhelmed and sometimes that can take over how im feeling. If I feel the need to cry, I usually will just to not deprive myself from feeling something, and I feel like I would be invalidating my own feelings if I was calling myself stupid for crying, so I feel like in a way I tend to bring in a factor of self respect to these challenges. I would say that my mechanisms when im stressed include stepping back, taking a few breaths, making a plan, and starting to work and focus on what really matters and what I have on my plate in the current moment, making sure that my stress does not affect the quality of work that I am doing. When I focus solely on what I am currently doing instead of thinking about all of the things that I need to do later, I do a lot better and I don't stress out as much."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1595,What I do when life gets challenging is many different things. I never really know how to positively react to difficult situations because I'm at a loss with how to assess the situation. I do try to take deep breaths and give myself time to think about possible solutions that are in my control or at times I freak out and shut down for a moment of time. I try very hard to continue to keep moving because I know the longer I stay in a state of confusion and frustration the worse I will feel if I do nothing to keep myself occupied. I want to work on relaxing when things don't go my way and I also want to work on asking people for help whenever I feel as though Im not capable of doing the right thing. I tend to let my pride get in the way of things that make me struggle because I am my biggest doubter. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1611,when life gets challenging I tend to distract myself. I tend to pretend that I don't know what happening. I think this a very negative thing because I will ignore it until I can't and it then overwhelms me because of how long I have been avoiding it.  sometimes it leads to a mental breakdown and I hate it. I hate that I do this to myself. I need to start doing more early on. I can't keep distracting myself until It bothers me so much that I break down. I want to find new ways to deal with my stress and fears of the things that are challenging in my life. I also think I need to be more prepared. I know I signed myself uo for something and If I don't apply myself and wait to do it so last minute then I shouldn't do it. I should make time for it especially since I signed up for it and chose to do it but am ignoring it and choosing not do do it.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1609,"Well, life has been pretty challenging for me these past 2 weeks. I've recently found out I'm diagnosed with stage 2 CIN precancerous (neoplasia) cells in my cervix. The news was heartbreaking and I'm very grateful my boyfriend & parent's have been very supportive during this very stressful/challenging time in my life. I know I haven't been on my ""A"" game and on top of my assignments as I should be, but I'm trying to get back on the horse.Right now I'm just dusting the dirt off my jeans and putting aside my stressful thoughts, fears, and anxiety and I'm going to be optimistic that everything will be okay. I have my family, I'm not alone and I know this is an obstacle I can overcome no matter how daunting it is. So thank you for giving me a reminder that regardless of the challenges this semester, I will be okay. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1598,"When life gets challenging I just need to take a step back and breath for a moment. I need to refocus and remember not to take on more than I can handle and also not get so stressed out. This week has been very stressful to me because of homework load and exams but I just need to to breath and believe in myself because I have gotten this far. I must enjoy the journey and take each challenge by my hand and overcome each obstacle.  It's not a journey if you don't bump into a few rocks and ditches in the road. Enjoy every moment and reflect on these times at the end. I think it is very important to destress and reground ourselves, and having a good support network/ system. I need to not get so wrap up in my head and get back in to some hobbies that help with self-care and destress. I love to hug my cats they are amazing huggers, paint, read, and meditate."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1601,"Usually, I try to relax and reset my mental state. I usually try to get active and get out of the house when life gets stressful and challenging. I usually find the best is to be with my friends and family because it usually gets my mind off whatever was stressing me. Food is generally the first option because everyone loves food. My favorite foods are Japanese and Filipino food. I recently started training for a 5k in December so that has been a really good way to relax and reset my mind and body. I feel this has been very beneficial for my health as well. I generally try to do activities that will get my mind off whatever has been stressing me out. This especially helped during quarantine when we were not able to see many people, so I spent most of my time running to keep my body healthy. It was hard to stay busy during quarantine because I was really scared of covid during that time. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1600,"When life gets challenging, I tend to slow down everything I am doing in life to make sure my mental health is stable. I tend to fall back in my studies depending on how hard life is, which is not a good thing. I cope with challenges by spending time with my family, going out to get fresh air, working out, and relaxing without thinking about the things that cause me the most stress. Because school is basically the most stressful thing I deal with on a daily basis, it is usually the first thing I avoid when I don't feel well. I am trying to grow out of this phase and work on things I have to do instead of avoiding it because eventually, it will catch up to me. I am trying to find new ways to cope with challenges, but for now, I feel like I am doing well with the number of things I have accomplished and how much I deal with in terms of stress."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1603,"What do I do when life gets hard? That’s easy! SLEEP. I know some may look at itt as a way of avoiding reality. But I think of it as a moment to give your brain a break and relax. To recharge. A nap can affect  our mood, and can even make us more productive after waking up. While I do not get many hours of sleep at night, I find it crucial to nap during the day! I used to nap for hours, i found it made me feel horrible. But now I've trained my body to nap for 30-45 minutes, and it’s really refreshing. I have really bad anxiety and am stressed out quite often, napping resolves everything. This or going on tik tok to have a good laugh. It’s also nice going on tik tok and realizing i'm not the only one going through a hard time. Being able to relate to others is KEY and social media can be a great outlet. "
