2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1610,"My family has helped me navigate through college in many ways. The first way is by showing me that hard work pays off and no matter how hard one gets one has no choice but to keep pushing. My parents are hard working people and when I look at them I see nothing but courage. I would like to make them proud and myself proud by receiving my major in biology. They have also helped me with school payments, when there is financial trouble they are always there to help me with what they have. I can not ask for any better help than my parents. I came in scared and discouraged because I am a Hispanic coming into the biology community of San Francisco state, there are not many male Latino students pursuing a career in biology, but the fellow classmates I have met down the line have proved me wrong. There are many diversity programs in this school that have been shown to me by fellow classmates which has helped me navigate through college. When I have trouble understanding problems or any material in class group study sessions that are made in discord or group me has helped me, sometimes I learn stuff that I may have missed in lecture, study groups are a big help that was provided thanks to being online."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1277,"The values of my community and my family helped me navigate through college in many ways. Being a first generation student, it motivates me to want to do more not only for myself but for my parents who didn’t have the same education as me. By getting a higher education and putting in the effort to get a good job will help repay my parents for what they have done for me. Also, as a child you want to give your parents the opportunity to live comfortably. Also, being a person of color and a woman, I want to encourage others like me to get into a STEM field. Many often don’t want to take this step due to lack of diversity or being intimidated by others. But if you are putting in the same work or much more than nothing should be stopping you from achieving your dreams. Overall, my family has been a great influence on me being in college today."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1601,My identity as a Filipino American has helped me navigate my college career because there was a lot of pressure for me to finish school with an acceptable major that will set me up with a good career after college. I believe that I did not know much of my culture before coming into college and I have taken a few classes to learn more about my culture and the history of Asian Americans in this country. I believe that there is a big healthcare disparity for many people of color and I want to look into ways to fix that big disparity between ethnic groups that would give equal access to resources for all. Family has always been a very important value to me and I want to be sure that I am set up with a career that will allow my future family to be able to pursue whatever they want and I want my family to live comfortably. I think this is what drives me to do well in school that will set me up with future professional school options.
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1597,"The values of my community helped me navigate through college, as I feel as though I was raised in a very goal-oriented environment in school and in my town. Growing up in the small town that I did, it was really hard to compete with others while trying to do your best. Graduating high school, my class had 4 people going to Ivy League universities, and it was super impressing. I graduated 40th in my class with a 4.3 GPA and I thought it was insane that there were so many people ahead of me that worked even harder to get where they were. My family also taught me to work really hard to get where I wanted to be, and they helped me instill goals of being the best of the best that I could possibly strive to be, which helps me stay motivated and keeps my goals high. Though I hold myself to high expectations, they also taught me that if I happen to mess up or change my mind, that it is totally fine and that I will figure it out regardless. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1598,"My family has been the biggest support in college. I value my family and where I come from as a big part in my life. One of my biggest motivators and inspiration, as well as my core value is my family. My family has had a lot of great influence in my life and have taught me trust, loyalty, patience, love and responsibility. Every decision I have made in my life was based on a matter of personal growth and development. I also questioned in the back of my mind what are my goals, how can I train my mind and body, will this strengthen my motivation, and can I learn from this decision. I have recognized the work I perform and do as well as the decisions I have decided or will decide all take part of a process that will help me reach my full potential of maturity, success, and happiness. Personal growth is my ability to overcome fears, step out of my comfort zone, desire to improve and strive to make changes. My family keeps me a ton in my personal growth. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1606,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""My family has been a great support to me and my success through college because they have supported me all the way. Whenever I feel I need my space to study and work, my family always respects that and gives me my space. On top of that, the community has given me a lot as well such as the on-campus tutoring that is available and FREE to me. I can always get the help I need in order to pass my courses. My professors also offer office hours if I ever need help which is also part of the ""community"" because after all, professors are part of the community right? Friends weren't in the question, but I feel as if they were also a big success and help for me. I can always rely on and go to my friends about a course they might've already taken to get some help or insight. Not only that, my friends are always supportive of me and we would sometimes host study hangouts where we just study and help each other out. I'm not sure if this answered the prompt, but hopefully, it did! :)"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1591,"My family values a college degree above anything else. My family has put such a high emphasis on getting a college degree they are willing to make sure I need whatever it takes to complete it. Because of this college has become my one focus where everything else doesn't take priority. I hope I can make everyone proud but we will see how well that goes,"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1604,"The values of my community have helped me navigate through college by just being available 24/7 with any college needs or questions that my own family isn’t able to provide for me. I believe that it is great to have this because it can relieve a lot of stress and show that there are people out there who care and will give motivation to not give up. My family when talking about my parents, helps me navigate through college by being an emotional support system in my life. Like just someone to vent as asking actual questions about college problems doesn’t really help as they are unaware of what it is like as none of them went to college nor graduated high school. The only person in my family who has a great understanding is my older brother as he is in his last year of college but the hard thing is that he is very busy and sometimes isn’t as available as my parents which I see every day."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1607,The values of my community and family have helped me navigate through college because they are supportive when it comes to education. They always provid with support since I started freshman semester. I would say that community has been a lot more supportive compared to my family aspect because being the first child to attend a college is hard to explain the things I'm doing or willing to do. 
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1595,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""This essay is meant to remind you that who you are, your values, and the people that are important to you are strengths. This is not meant to be a formal essay. It should be stream-of-conciousness writing from the heart. You will be graded on participation only, not on the specifics of what you say.  5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150-200 words. Being in an after school program from middle school to high school, the opportunities given to me have always motivated me to becoming an even better version of myself. My program offered so much support and care that I felt understood. I felt happy with the fact that someone who understands the stress of being a student while fulfilling household needs is a lot to balance at a young developing age. It causes too much pressure to grow up immediately. However, I am happy with the fact that their support and as well as my families, has pushed me this far into the year to continue on with college. It is crazy to imagine myself at this spot when many years ago I was at a different spot in life. I am very grateful that I am pushing myself to work hard "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1600,"College is a very stressful yet rewarding process that causes me a lot of stress and different emotions. Without my family and the values they have taught me growing up I'm not sure how I would navigate college, especially as a first-generation student. A big value that my family has taught me is faith. Having faith pushes me to get my work done when I'm feeling down and it is what keeps me going every day to achieve my goals. Without having faith in myself, I'm sure I would have given up a long time ago, but it gives me the power to believe in myself and know that I can do whatever I put my mind to. Some smaller values that have helped me navigate college are staying organized and giving my all to whatever I am doing. My family did not have an easy life growing up, so I am very thankful for all the blessings I have been given, education being one of the most important. Therefore, they have instilled in me a hard-working mindset because I know I must work hard for my wants and needs. Lastly, the value of support and knowing I have people that believe in me and are there for me has gotten me very far throughout this journey. Support gives me a sense of security that reassures me that I am not alone. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1599,"One of my values is my friends. Although most of my friends chose to go to a different college, one of them goes to SFSU. She's the one who helps me the most since we're the same major as well. We tell each other information and resources we can use such as extracurriculars or help each other with homework if one has already taken the class or we are taking it together. With my friends from other universities, we share some information like using ratemyprofessor and the website to check what credits transfer from community colleges if I decide to take some there such as EMT classes. My value of keeping my grades up has especially motivated me in order to succeed and go to medical school. That has kept me going so far with how hard it is and the changes from in-person to online to back to in-person."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1608,"One of the most significant values and my Hispanic community and my family, in general, has been faith. It's been the only thing that has kept me going throughout the most challenging times and primarily through college. Coming from a very collectivistic environment having to move to a very individualistic one, I've learned to cling to my faith and also the idea that all the sacrifices that I'm making in terms of going to school will eventually be a benefit for my future family as well as my current family members so that they won't have to struggle as much as they are now because they didn't get the opportunity to go to school I constantly remind myself that I have this opportunity to educate myself and that idea keeps me going, my faith in my community has definitely structured my values, but they have also been a blessing in terms of providing emotional support for me"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1602,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college easily.  They did a great job of preparing me for the real world and setting me up to be a responsible independent hard-working person.  At the same time there is a bit of pressure and anxiety that can be embedded within the process.  I am a first generation college student so I feel I have become very expected to do well without any mistakes.  However, I am human and can't be well performing every day of my life.  Sometimes I feel overwhelmed with school and think that I am letting my parents down but I remind myself that I am doing this for me as well, not just for them.  It is my journey and only I can be the one to finish it.  I feel confident in my position at school and know how to ask for help or additional support when needed.  I am glad about the kind of person I am and will continue to fight to achieve my goals.  All of it was made possible by my family's support and values which geared me towards the right path. "
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1609,"My family have been the main reason why I am privileged to go to school today and further my education. Being first generation American, my mom came to the USA when she was only 9 years old due to the Bracero Program that was established by President Roosevelt. This allowed my family to migrate to the USA and become farmworkers in Salinas in order to complete their citizenship at the time. My mom was forced to work in the fields until she was 17yrs old until she ran away in order to do something better with her life and become something she can be proud of. My mom has always pushed me to not give up on my education and find something your passionate in and to keep moving forward, regardless of the obstacles, struggles, barriers and issues that come my way. She has always made sure school and after school tutoring was the most important thing for me and for that I am forever grateful for her giving me a better life to further my education in helping animals :)"
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1589,"I hail from UK and India, easier way to say I am British Indian. To be honest my Indian side had way more culture and values to teach me than from British except we have royalty, trust me better than politics of any world. India basically taught me how to be a gentleman, a man of truth, honor and courage (well hopefully my friends see me in that way but who knows......). My dad was a math and physics wizard. I just don't know why Indian dads are always good with numbers. YES, like every Indian son I got a beating too for maths as I sucked at it and couldn't solve anything and then here comes 100 kg hand slap on my face and then naturally I got correct answers. To be honest I needed that for the person who I am right now, even though I was kept in check I still got some ways to sneak out, trust me Indian can party too big time!The best part of my culture would be that there are so many festivals like Diwali, Holi and the list never stops! So it is like a constant happiness, everyone is happy and wee get to burn fireworks. Why culture gave me good food, come on now who doesn't like some Curry! Some Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka masala, OOOOO get in my belly already. The amount of restaurants in India is crazy from sub par to the fanciest. Even though a lot of things are said about India how it is dirty and politicians are bad, ohh well it is everywhere like USA, I say it is a country must visit and learning the Indian culture is like no else. PSA London is freaking awesome."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1603,"I love my family. I am very grateful to have the love and support I receive from my family. They have instilled in me certain values that have helped me navigate through life and in this case, college. My family has taught me about humility, hard work, and perseverance. I have learned to make the best out of each situation. Even distanced learning. I have worked on balancing my personal life and school. While I do have a heavy course load, I find things that bring meaning to my life, and they keep me going. For example, serving my community through church activities, and working with kids (daycare). Most of my family is undocumented, and I feel inspired to provide for my family and be an example to my nephews. I hope I can one day have a career that makes me happy, and I know I can get there if I stay true to myself and my values."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1590,"Some of the values i value is to be respectful and kind. This is important in life in general because there are many types of peoples in the world and they each value different things. What i what to do if possible is to not hurt other intentionally. I would rather have things be peaceful then chaotic. Sometimes things are out of you hand so you got to make due with what you have. So the best things to do is to keep trying to not give up. Each day is another progress, so at lease each steps would help in one day reaching this goal. When you give up that's when you fail yourself. So having the strength to keep thriving for your goal is important. Throughout college it'll be a long path but at least each step will bring you closer. In life there will another goal to reach. It just which one is important to me at the moment."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1594,"The values of my community and the people that have had the most influence in my life, is a large part of who I am today.  Although not all values and influences are good, I believe both - the good and the bad - have assisted my navigation through college so far.  My family, coaches, and individuals that I have met have not only shown me the inferior, low , but the superior, good in people.  Different cultures and cultural products within my community have helped me better understand cultures, allowing me to be more diverse, relate and bring my own ideas during conversation.  These things have allowed me to open up, navigate, and fully understand aspects of college, in a way I am able to learn, while staying safe.  So far college has been a great experience and after college I will have more people who will alter my values and influence my life."
2021,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1593,"How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?I come from a family of Mexican immigrants, except one major factor that changed my life completely was my mom leaving my biological, alcoholic father in Mexico and falling in love with my step-father whom she met in the United States. Soon after my parents were married and my dad joined the Navy, they had more kids (two more boys specifically) making me the oldest and only girl in my family (no cousins or anything during my childhood, my aunts and uncles were too young, my mom was the oldest).Growing up, I didn't have much, but all of my family members did their absolute best to give me the world and that's exactly how I remember my childhood. I saw them all struggle with life and finanical responsibilities and its the main reason why its inspired me to be the first in my family to graduate from a university. The values from both my culture and family inspire me to continue forward and work hard for the things I want. "
