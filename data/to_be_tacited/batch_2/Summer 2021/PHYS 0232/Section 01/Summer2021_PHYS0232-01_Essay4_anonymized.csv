2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2118,"Online classes have affected me, especially because I am striving to be a Civil Engineer and without the practices with the machines in my engineering lab, I am unable to get hands-on experience and understand how to use certain tools rather than visualize how to use the tools in watching a youtube video on zoom. I have been frustrated that the pandemic has pushed everybody backward as many of us want to go back to school and learn regularly and do the laboratories in class. Self-care-wise would be going to the gym and releasing my stress from the online learning course and it helps me stay active even through this pandemic. I am concerned about going back to school because as of now, many states have been reopening and the new guidelines have been slightly lenient and which can cause another wave of infections. With this happening, we may not be able to go back to school. As well, as of now, it's unsure if we'll go back for the Sping semester as there is a new wave of infections and a new virus being released."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3073,"Well - Taking online classes - I have mixed feelingsI like that I don’t have to wake up early in the morning and miss my breakfast. That was totally a pleasing experience, quite different than what I am used to. When I talk about my learning outcome, I list a few of the points below which were stressful, and I remained unsatisfactory with my overall performance. Sometimes, for the assigned homework, I was not able to ask the question(s) for something that was confusing or not clear. Though I was able to get my answers through the suggested sites, however, it was time taking and sometimes I was detracted due to popup messages and related ads. When I compare it with our last year's physical classroom sessions, for sure we had a focus on assigned homework. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3065,"Online classes have impacted my learning quite a lot, and it got even harder for me especially since I started my new job last about two months ago which cuts my homework time by a lot. I mean with online classes, it's only helpful if it's asynchronous because I can do it on my own time but most classes for my major are synchronous. I also find it harder to focus during online classes or doing homework for the class itself because there are too many distractions. What works rn is since my schedule is morning shifts I get to work on my assignments once I get home. But the only con is that I don't get to show up to class. Some self-care practices I've been doing is trying to get into the gym more instead of sitting down most of my time at the computer. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3074,"During this year, online courses have become a very normal thing for each student. Honestly, if the covid-19 didn't happen in the world, as an international student, I would never have the opportunity to experience all online courses, because students with an F-1 visa cannot choose all online courses or part-time courses. Moreover, International students must choose courses with more than 12 credits or more each semester to ensure the validity of the visa. I think that online courses can allow me to better allocate my time to the study and review of each class. Since I live in San Jose, if I need to go to school every time, I will spend nearly two hours on the road every day (without traffic). However, online teaching greatly reduced the time I would waste on the road, and at the same time, I did not need to pay for the gas on the journey and the parking fee at the school. So online courses are such a kind of good thing for me. And because of the global pandemic of covid-19, we must protect ourselves and stay at home as much as possible to avoid contracting covid-19. For me, my usual outing activities have become a single trip to the supermarket to buy food and daily necessities. At the same time, I will also remember to wear a mask to ensure my safety. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3042,"Online classes have impacted my learning in a negative way. Having lectures over Zoom for each class gets pretty exhausting and it is difficult for me to focus because I am not in the right learning environment. I definitely prefer going in-person for class because the learning environment is much better, there is more room for collaboration and interactions between students, and I don't have to stare at a screen all day. Since class has been held online via Zoom my eyes are glued to my laptop screen for much longer than I normally would if I had class in person. For self-care I have tried to finish all of my work beforehand so I have more time to relax and not worry about what assignments I still need to complete. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3043,"Online classes have impacted a bit of learning. For example, I now rely less on notes and more on asking peers and google. Before online classes, I would try to understand my notes, but I wouldn't want to bother a classmate's concentration with a question. And typically with lectures, I would usually have to wait until all the way until the end, usually by that time, I would forget the question or become too drained by the end. Nowadays, if I got a question, I could write in chat, and eventually it'll be seen and answered. Also asking something to my peers is just as easy with discord. Although I would say there might be parts where googling was actually detrimental, I would say it definitely helped with the flow. For example, if lets say the Monday morning where I forgot everything, I could like google ""capacitors"" or ""voltage equation from current and resistance"" and get a quick refresher. This way, I don't interrupt the class, and before I might've flipped through notes, and I might've been distracted for a minute or two, which might be crucial to understanding the concept or such. So I'll say online learning helped with the learning of the concept. But is probably detrimental in the application part like solving problems or something like that."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2121,"Online learning has its challenges. For one, I found that learning online can be a bit more difficult since there are more distractions as home than if I were on campus. At home I do everything from my personal desktop and often I am tempted to browse the web or do other unrelated things during class. Online learning through zoom also has its challenges, not being able to be face to face with the instructors or students disconnects me from building bonds and relationships and make it harder to communicate in class. I generally feel less motivated during a zoom call and I wish I could see my fellow peers and classmates. Pre recorded lectures are also a hassle and I am very unmotivated to watch through them especially if they are hours long. Being at home while doing school has been “easier” since I see my grades gave done better, but it is definitely harder to stay motivated and actively learn. I am trying to balance my school and live and generally I don’t think I am burnt out, just missing life back on campus."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3075,I would say online classes have impacted my learning negatively. It is much harder to focus on and absorb the material being taught live on zoom. If the classes have recorded lectures it helps a lot but only this class does. The best self-care for me is just working out. Any kind of physical activity whether it be at the gym or even a walk. I prefer doing it alone it helps me clear my mind and gather my thoughts.
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2456,"I'm actually always thinking about this questions because what happened to us is very amazingly weird... like the transformation from doing in class work to completely online work, and it got different when we using different online platforms to fully replace the things that we used to do in real classes.. I would say it made me more comfortable because working behind the screens was so annoying to me.. i actually don't have a lot of things to do because i'm on a different time zone which is about 11+ different than california time.. i'm just making sure to hit the gym on daily so i can get rid of the negativity.. :) "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2521,"I feel like I have lost a hefty amount of motivation with the switch to virtual learning. However, I'm making an honest effort at trying to keep up with everything since I know that the tuition is very expensive and I want to make the most out of my experience. In terms of self-care, whenever I feel anxious or stressed, I always drop everything and take a break. This can negatively impact my academics, but it was advice given by one of my math professors last semester. She said there was nothing wrong with taking breaks, especially with online learning, so I took that advice wholeheartedly. So far, I think I am doing decently in terms of getting work done despite all of this. I hope we can soon go back to in-person since I perform miles better in that environment, plus it's significantly easier to form study groups."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3060,"Honestly, I am pretty happy and glad that we have online classes during this time. I personally always had problems arriving to class on time, especially in my morning classes. So, with everything being online, it really has taken a lot of the stress of commuting, waking up super early, and planning ahead, away. When schools do open back up, I will have an hour’s commute to get to school, and then having to find and walk to my classes just sounds really hard. Not even mentioning having to pay the parking permit fee, driving safely when I have long days, and struggling to be on time. I feel like classes being online has been its own kind of self-care. I am just really glad of this time and the chance to complete a lot of classes online, without going to campus. I don’t believe that having online classes versus in-person classes has hindered my learning ability at all. I actually think it has definitely helped in enhancing my learning because it has taken a lot of stress out of my life--getting up early, dressing up, putting on makeup, driving to school, and forcing myself to pay attention in classes when I am sometimes tired and unable to focus. I wish SFSU would continue to offer more online classes after COVID ends"
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3068,"Describe how online classes have impacted your learning and what you are doing for self-care. What concerns do you have for your learning and your well-being?Online classes were hard for me ,it impacted me in different ways... It is way harder to focus on the class when you have soo many distractions around in the house.However, I try my best by not doing anything and focus only on class. This class been challenging ,but however with other classes that are more chill I tend to pay less attention in class. Some concerns that I have about it is how much more we have to stay at home and study , with those covid cases starting to go up again. I am trying to rest more while there is classes and try to enjoy the stuff on the internet. One benefit from this whole thing is that I can eat/make tea while I am in class and enjoy my breakfast during class, whereas in school it is a lot harder with all teachers not wanting you to be distracted. Even though it is comfier to be at home and study I would prefer to study in school , because more communication and easier work done with classmates than online where half of the times people do not participate"
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,159,"Coming into this year I thought the learning experience was going to be a little similar to the spring semester, in terms of how my teachers impact my learning and the level of work we were supposed to do, but I feel like there has been way more work and they expect us to work harder because we are at home. In my opinion, they should have kept the same workload as the previous semester because we are all still adjusting to working on zoom, so unfortunately it has had a negative effect on my mental health. What I have been doing to keep my mind clear and proactively keep a good mindset was by writing out all my tasks on my calendar and making sure that I take breaks between classes.in the future I pray that the workload will get shorter, but we all know it's going to get more challenging from here."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3053,Online learning has mostly been detrimental to my learning. I've failed more classes over the last two semesters than I have in any years prior. Before we did online learning I was on track to graduate in 4 years. Now if I'm lucky/ work hard I can graduate in 4.5 as long as I take summer/ winter classes. I don't have any real workspace as I live in a house with 7 other people and it's very easy to be distracted when you're working at home. I know many of my friends have paused their education to work during the pandemic because online learning did not work for them. I don't really have any self-care activities and my stress levels are at an all-time high. My classes during the Fall 2021 semester are also going to be completely online as a CS major so that's not any fun. My health is pretty bad right now mostly exacerbated by stress and some other personal life changes that don't involve the pandemic but were made much harder to deal with by the pandemic. I'm sick of seeing the same 3 friends for the past year and a half. Sometimes I'd hang out with other friends and my other friend group has recently started hanging out again so that's nice. The school gym isn't open so I don't have that to relieve stress. I've seen two divorces happen during the pandemic and two of my old friends have dropped off the face of the earth after their divorce.
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3071,"I'm probably not learning as well as if I were in person, or at the very least, we're missing out on things that would be demonstrated with a good experiment on camera. Some of our labs have had that involved, but in the group's I've been in, I haven't seen the person actually doing what the lab said to do since they didn't have a camera showing it.I don't have any concerns I would like to share about my current summer situation, but I expect the upcoming Fall semester to be problematic due to long commute times since I'm fairly far away from the campus. So far I've been entirely online since I enrolled in this school last year. I'm not looking forward to the commute part of the Fall Semester, but my learning will (maybe) be better than it is now."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3059,"For this online class specifically, the accelerated schedule has been difficult to adapt to. Taking so few classes puts me at ease since I'm able to focus harder on the class, but also pacing is harder since there are bigger gaps between classes. I have been working on scheduling and having healthy/productive side projects outside of class and that seems to have helped in keeping both motivation and time management. Online class is still hard but I find that the study habits are more impacted than the in class experience for the most part."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3049,"Alright I love online learning. I know now you would think that is so weird but I just love it because I don't have to commute to SFSU. In high school I was commuting (Basically walking there) and it was a nightmare. Here I just on the laptop and I am in class so thats a good thing. Other thing that I love about online learning is that I get to spend more time with myself and I am not on the go always. Like in high school, I could never just go on random walks during the evening because I used to be so tire. Always I fixed up my eating habits, because I am a stress eater and when everything was offline I would just eat anything outside and stuff now I actually every single day eat homecooked meals and guess what I lost 8 pounds. Also for my mental health, I cook, go on walks, do random face masks and do uni work cause trust me doing uni work while to are listening to music hits different. Have a great semester to whoever is reading this reflection."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3048,"Personally, I have not really enjoyed taking classes online. I feel like the quality of online education is not the same as taking in-person classes. In my opinion, degrees in the STEM field are not easily earned online. A majority of classes require labs, which are best learned when you’re in a classroom since it is more hands on. However, I do like the flexibility that comes with taking classes online. In regards to self-care, I de-stress by going to the gym or hanging out with friends. I believe my only concern is that learning online will affect the quality of education that I am paying for. I also hope that taking online classes will not come back to bite me in my future classes when we are able to return to in-person classes. Overall, I hope that I am not going to have to completely attain my degree in Civil Engineering online, that is my main concern. I feel like I learn best in a classroom setting."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3044,"The way online classes have impacted my learning is that I no longer have to deal with social anxiety although there still is a slight social anxiety when it comes to answering questions It doesn’t affect me as much as answering in a classroom and commuting to class. I live in Oakland and commuting to campus is usually about an hour I have to take Bart and muni to get to campus. It was always stressful to make an effort to get up in the morning almost two hours before my first class and find time to eat and take care of myself when I spent an hour on the muni and with online learning I’ve had the advantage to be able to cook three meals a day, a luxury that i did not have before I am able to have more time for myself and for school work and I no longer have to be anxious about having to commute to class, I don’t miss class as much as I used to. I have been able to talk to more of my classmates because we are able to send each other a link to a slack or a discord. I’ve been doing a lot better with online learning that I feel like I belong in school whereas before I felt like I didn’t belong. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3047,"Honestly online learning has been hard for my mental health. Being around people and being able to ask them questions and really work together face to face where they can show you easily how they got what they got was so important to me. It was extremely helpful to have in-person communication and conversation to keep classes interesting and make me excited to attend. With online learning I feel like I have much less drive to come to class and I don't get as excited to come to class as I used to. However, online learning hasn't been all bad. It has been extremely helpful for me, as someone with ADHD who cannot take notes well during a live lecture, to have online recorded lectures because it gives me the opportunity to come back to the lecture. I tend to miss many spoken things during lectures because my mind has trouble focusing on writing and listening at the same time. Recorded lectures help me to be able to pause take a break and then come back. It allows me to rewind and re-listen to something I did not understand the first time it was said. It allows me to take the time to make the drawings and notes that will help me to remember the topic by pausing it and then resuming when I am ready to hear them describe the topic. I have done my best to see the people in my circle to keep my spirits up and I have continued to work through a third semester online but honestly my will to keep doing online classes is slipping fast. I do not want to have to spend another semester in my dorm room isolated during all of my classes. It is not fun and it does not encourage me to learn."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3054,"Honestly, Online learning has been had such a positive impact on my learning and heres why: I really don't like people sometimes haha.  There are so many social norms, and annoying flirting that goes on in a class room I always feel so self conscious about whether or not people are looking at me.  I find myself thinking more about what my peers think of me than the content itself.  With online learning I find myself much more focused on the subject and I love that! This also allows me to do my own research during lecture which I found is a lot of fun.  Regarding concerns, I am just worried about my time management skills.  I loaded a lot on my plate this summer and in hind sight I should have taken on less responsibilities.  It is definitely taking a toll on my mental health but I'm young and I believe I can recuperate.  Perhaps this is naive, but it's not like I have a proper control group to test with.  I just have myself and I have to just keep on going.  "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3062,"Online classes so far have been do-able. Afte3r doing this for a couple semesters, I have definitely accustomed even though it was difficult at first. I feel like it requires a lot of self discipline in order to learn. I have definitely learned to study at my pace and learned what works for me and what doesn't. The main thing that was hard for me through online classes was seeking help because it isn't the same as being physically present with the professor and fellow classmates."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3072,"online learning was taught at the beginning and sometimes it is still now. i think that what makes it hard on me is the time. What I mean is that time goes by faster when at home. although I don't have to take time off for transportation I still have to take time off to do chores around the house. Self-care, I tend to cramp all my homework of the week during the week to have weekends off. although this sometimes isn't possible at least I can have Sunday evening off to do what I want. lately I have been trying to wake up earlier to work out because I have honestly become more slow as I spend more time on my computer due to online classes."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3052,"online learning has been an interesting experience. I have taken many online classes before it was while taking many face-to-face classes as well. so having the experience of doing everything online was definitely a shocker. but, despite the adjustment needed, I have come to enjoy online learning. one major benefit of online learning is the fact that most of my classes were being recorded so it gave me a chance to get back to the lectures and review any concepts I wasn't quite caught up with. online learning has also given me better control of my time as it dramatically reduced, if not eliminated my commute time, the time I can allocate for other tasks. in terms of self-care, because I have better time management and a little wiggle room, like the time I would have spent trying to get to class, I now use that time to go to the gym and work out. this, after a long study time, was very therapeutic. asides that I take long walks to clear my head. in between classes or study time. i think the setup right now is really great. I have had one or two professors who do not record lectures to encourage students to attend every class and have an interactive experience. while I think that's super important I really believe so is understanding the material and if there is another way to encourage students to attend live lectures like attendance or sth it would be great as I have greatly benefited from these recorded lectures. overall i really enjoy online learning."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2104,"I think online learning has made it more difficult for me to retain and understand classroom content effectively. Learning through videos and textbooks is not as engaging as in person classes. While school is easier for me online, mainly since teachers have made assignments easier and are more lenient with deadlines, I’m worried if the knowledge I do retain will be enough to be successful in the future when we go back to in person classes. Essentially, online learning isn’t as rigorous or challenging. Additionally, my house isn’t the best learning environment since I have siblings in school as well so there aren’t many quiet spaces where I can effectively study. In terms of self care, online learning is pretty monotonous. While assignments aren’t too difficult, I tend to spend hours on my computer doing all these assignments and watching lectures. I just dislike having to be on electronics for so long."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3067,"For me, online classes are more suitable. It is hard for me to get up early and force myself to walk to the classroom. Because most of my classes are in the morning and the situation I described above is a really terrible exprience. But with online classes, I just need to wake up and open zoom for classes, no need to walk, no need to feel the strong ultraviolet outside, and no need to rush. I could have a more relaxing time in the morning after I wake up instead of rushing to the classroom. Although online classes might reduce my exercising time because no more walking outside, I have more sleeping time and I don't have to calculate how much time I need to reach the classroom from my place. The time is more flexible, and I can put all my attention on classes themselves instead of worrying about whether I should go to classes or not by considering my laziness."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2126,"Online learning has impacted my learning that I struggle to pay attention. It’s easier to sit back and relax than to pay attention. It’s also easier to turn off the camera and relax but I try to listen. I do try but looking at the professor through the camera is not the same as looking at them in person. The connection is not the same and being inside all day with your computer gets tiring mentally and physically. I know I am not the only person and there were some pros to it. For example, we saved up in gas, train, and bus money. Probably the only pro I could think of. The concern that I have is that if I will be able to remember all the information I learned and apply it in the future. Another concern is that making connections with my classmates or with the professors would be a bit difficult because like I said before it was easier to turn of the camera and mic. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3066,"Since we have had online learning for more than 1 year, I feel fine about it since I already get used to it. The largest impact on my life would be probably saving a lot of time going to the campus. It usually took me 50 minutes to get to campus. And I am the type of person that is not feeling comfortable taking transit since I easily got dizzy while riding. So I am glad that I didn’t get “tortured” by the transit during the online learning.However, online learning reduces the workload of all classes which means we actually learn fewer things. Even though that is good for us to get an easy A, it is definitely not good for our future and career. So being organized and not procrastinated is pretty important. So I forced myself to do things ahead of time to make sure everything is ok without worrying them too much, and this really helps me build up very good habit."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3040,"Online classes have made me realize the importance of prioritizing and being responsible for all my work. As everything is online and distance-learning, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between online schoolwork and daily life. I would be stuck at my table for schoolwork for hours and not taking the time to actively move around. 	My self-care still needs some improvement, but I have been trying to go out for more walks. My diet and sleep schedules are messed up, so I have been trying to fix that as well. If I do have free time, I would spend time with my family or watch some shows. 	Since I have been so accustomed to online learning, I am concerned about how this will affect me when we go back in person. Although I am looking forward to learning in person again, I hope the professors are understanding and take into understanding that we have been learning online for almost more than a year. I am also concerned my well-being will deteriorate even more. I hope I will be able to improve it, but it can be difficult some days. At the end of the day, it is just another roadblock I have to cross. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3076,"Online classes have affected my experience of learning so far in so many ways. The way of understanding materials online can be easier, and it could be difficult. For some classes, the internet is much more important than the textbook due to the massive amount of information that requires much research through the course. In addition, in some classes that you must have a wide imagination to get the concepts and ideas out from it, videos, pictures, apps, programs, etc. makes it much easier to observe the whole image. Furthermore, lectures are fine being taught online and somehow it would have a great effect on students’ knowledge and understanding through many great techniques of teaching. However, in general, labs being taught online can be a little bit confusing for many parts. Almost every lab involves the student to keep in touch with the objects and materials day after day which makes it simple and easy for him to understand."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3069,"When school first went online, I wasn’t very approving of it as it was a new system to adapt to and everything was genuinely confusing. But as time went on and I’ve gotten used to the new system, I realized it was better for me because I can utilize my time to better fit my non school related schedule and my grades took a turn for the better as I can study at my own pace and understanding and I now  know how to keep track of upcoming projects and exams. The only downside was that the repetitive routine that burns you out but I’ve found if I reward myself with a road trip or vacation after the semester ends, it really refreshes me to start the new semester with new energy and motivation. But overall, I think the switch over to remote jobs and education was a smart choice as it works with most people who have jobs or long commutes."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,597,"What I do for self care I instantly go and hug my dog, my dog is my best friend and has been my biggest source of comfort ever since I was little. I wouldn’t handle online school if it weren’t for him. I also like to draw when I’m really focused on a drawing it makes me forget about my worries and puts my mind at ease. I also really like music so I’ll listen to favorite bands and artists music, to also make me forget about my stress."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3077,"Under the guidance of the experiment, I learned Matlab. This software is very easy to use, much simpler than C language, but its function is really powerful. It has powerful computing and data processing capabilities, including a large number of computational algorithm sets. Also has excellent image processing ability, since the production has a convenient data visualization function, can be vector, matrix with graphics. High-level drawing includes two - and three - dimensional visualization. Feel this is a very good software, the language is simple, practical strong. Although there are experimental cases in the use process, we still need to learn how to use each tool. If you want to learn a good tool, the key is yourself. The more important thing is to learn a way, a way to learn software, and the attitude of learning. Learning this mathematical calculation tool is very convenient for our whole mathematical operation and image expression."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3058,"My opinion on online learning is not very positive. I have never really liked online classes and having all assignments being on I learn. The most challenging aspect of online learning is doing class work at home, the drastic change seemed really hard for me to adapt to and I was not doing very well at the start of quarantine. I am really excited to rejoin in-person learning next semester and gradually come back to normal in spring next year. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2090,"Online classes haven't been the best in my experience, I very much prefer the in person class where I feel that I learn the course material much better. I am more encouraged to get my work done and help is there no matter what whether it be a classmate or a professor. The issue I have with online learning comes down to a few things, I have trouble concentrating when I have tons of things that could distract me, the comfort of being at home makes me more lazy so I am not as encouraged to do much work, and the lack of human interaction isn't very fun. What I have gotten into these past few months in order to make up for these losses is going to the gym. I may not interact with anyone other than the friends I go with but seeing other humans just feels normal, I also gained some weight so working it off was really fun and challenging. However, this has also brought an issue with myself appearance. I am too worried about how I would look like to other once school is back in session in the fall, this was never an issue to me before but its something that I have begun to think about. So I am hoping that with the few classes that I will be having in person next fall really get me back up to normal, I haven't talked to anyone new this year so it will definitely be tough making some new friends. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3057,"Online classes have been great overall this past year. However, there are many downfalls while taking online classes. Before talking about the disadvantages of online classes, let me talk about the benefits. I get to wake up 15 mins before class and dress however I liked. I also save a lot of money while taking online classes because I don't need to spend money on transportation. I get more hours of sleep when comparing to classes in person. Also while talking about a test or quiz online, I feel more at ease than in person where I'm all tensed up. Some disadvantages are that I tend to get distracted a lot during class. Sometimes I would bring up youtube to watch a video when then I'll be off track on the lecture. Sometimes I would fidget with things on my computer or on my desk. I also would be on my phone constantly, checking social media after taking notes and such."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3063,"Online learning was a lot to take in. It was a sudden decision and we all had no choice but to transition. At first, I was really excited because I've always wanted to go to school from home. I loved it. I woke up whenever and stayed at home all day. I didn't have to wake up early. But then, I wasn't learning anything and I hated that. I wanted the college experience and I couldn't get it for my first year. One thing I did was go for regular drives so I wasn't bothered by staying at home all. The concerns I have for my well being is that I am a computer science major and I haven't learned anything and definitely don't know how to code. I want to learn and actually understand the material because I’ve just been doing work to pass and not actually understand the material."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3046,"Talk about online courses; I don't really think online studying will actually affect the quality of the class because it is virtual. It's more about people. For me personally, stay in a room, sit with classmates and talk face to face, it's a fundamental concept of studying. Also, the learning environment is critical for me to get my focus. It this merely impossible for me to finish a two-hour class when I stay in my own area with many electronic devices around me. In fact, I am already distracted by my mind when I am controlling myself to be focused. So focusing is the biggest challenge I have had so far during online studying. And what I am concern about is I don't really have a special strategy to deal with beat up my laziness and procrastination. What I can do right now is remind myself to start my work earlier and try to watch the lecture video multiple times to handle as many knowledge points as possible. Anyway, I believe everything will be better after I return to campus."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3051,"Online classes have been relatively boring. I think that my learning is okay, but it could definitely be better. To me, the most important thing about college was getting to meet people and creating connections that may or may not last a life time. In order to take care of myself during online learning, I try to maintain a healthy diet and exercise relatively often. I grew up playing a lot of sports and activity is what keeps me going. Recently, I have felt the inactivity in my muscles because I have been getting extremely antsy. Randomly I just feel like I can't sit down any longer and need to get up and do something. With classes being online and being a cs major I spend a lot of time on my computer. I think the biggest concern that I have for myself is to make sure my body is healthy and happy. If my body is not healthy and happy it is hard to find myself motivated to sit down and do work. I look forward to working with other people again, but it is difficult to maintain that healthy life balance at home. We are so comfortable in our own rooms making it difficult to want to go outside and do something. It has become a norm to stay sheltered inside and continue to work from a distance."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2113,"Online classes have occupied my learning as well as has made it more costly. Ways that I have dealt with my web based learning is getting coordinated, adhering to a timetable, tracking down a most loved working environment, wipe out work area, posing inquiries. Partake effectively in online conversations, deciphering and rehashing what you've realized. Apply new material to recently scholarly data. Apply new ideas as a team with different understudies, at work, or in different parts of your life. Take written by hand notes to assist you with holding key data. Like we referenced before, online classes expect you to show more drive. You're more liable for your own learning, and you'll escape the class what you put into it. Keep that Facebook tab shut while you're finishing coursework on your PC. On the off chance that you know your online media restraint is restricted. Take a stab at placing your telephone in an alternate room, far away in a bureau compartment, or in your vehicle during your assigned classwork/study blocks. In the event that periodic telephone checks are totally fundamental, you can permit yourself five minutes to look at writings and warnings for at regular intervals to one hour of considering."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3041,"Online classes have certainly made it harder for me to stay on schedule, keep up with assignments. In-person classes, sitting side-by-side students, is motivating. I find with in person classes I revisit the material more often. I am grateful for online classes, however, because this is the only format that works with my work. Self-care has been challenging. I usually resort to journaling and cooking. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3070,"For me personally, I feel like online learning has impacted me a lot in a bad way. Since I am at home, I am more likely to get distracted by the things around my desk or room. Also, online learning has made me susceptible to staying up late hours which causes me to oversleep and miss class. I have never missed a single class during on campus learning, but that is quite the opposite for online learning. In addition, I sometimes feel like I am not absorbing the information of the topics discussed in class. I have to make extra efforts outside of class to catch up or help me have a better understanding of the subject. I like how it allows me to feel safe and comfortable since I am in my own home, but I would rather go on-campus if it means I have an easier time paying attention and learning."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3056,"My perspective on online classes from last semester (Fall 2020) hasn't changed significantly. While I have become accustomed to online classes, there are some moments where I do miss regular face-to-face learning. I feel that in this class especially, taking labs would flow much smoother than a current in series if we actually got to do these experiments live. That's one experience I wish I got to have before this pandemic started, but other than that, I'm mostly comfortable taking online classes. For someone like me who's an introvert in real life, being able to take courses at my own pace has helped me gain a sense of self-independence I otherwise wouldn't have had in ""normal"" classes. I also attribute this to my prior experience taking online courses. As aforementioned from my answer last semester, in my senior year of high school I needed to take an online Psychology and Health class in order to complete my A-G requirements, so learning to complete work at my own pace while interacting with the material was an acquired trait I picked up quite fast. Also as a college freshman in Fall 2019, I took an online Art History class using Zoom and iLearn, which is where I learned to listen attentively and take notes online as well. I adjusted quite quickly to online learning both physically and mentally. However, I still believe that there are some classes where I feel like I would learn the material better had the pandemic never happened and I were still on-campus - like a few of my Computer Science classes and perhaps Math. I feel like I would have studied more efficiently in an actual classroom environment there instead of at home with plenty of distractions - like video games, the Internet, my toys and gadgets and so on. I do have some concerns that online classes have made me procrastinate a bit more than I normally would, which is something I still have to deal with even today. Other than that, I'm comfortable with online classes."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,144,"Online classes have been great for my learning, I feel like the lack of a commute has really given me a lot more time to study and work as well as allowed me to join office hours I ordinarily would not have been able to go to. It has also saved me quite a bit in fuel, tolls and food which also helps me focus on my studies. My only  concern is that the lack of face to face participation makes it harder to join groups and engage with the community's in sfsu. I also do worry that my degree will be seen as ""less legitimate"" than those who took the majority of their degree in person. I try to mediate these feelings by trying to actively learn outside of school and am in the process of putting together a portfolio (https://brianadams.netlify.app/  *still a work in progress*) so when I graduate I will be a more competitive candidate. I would absolutely reenroll in online education if I had the choice to do it all over again, I have been able to live in a more affordable area which has saved me a significant amount over the duration of my education, and I have filled my free time that I would have been commuting in with productive activities. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3055,"I think that online classes have taken a toll on my social skills as I haven't had as much social interaction or interaction in general since the pandemic started. But I don’t think that online classes are the root cause, they just exacerbated the problem. I recently got to hang out with some of my friends for the first time in over a year and I finally felt that some normalcy had returned to my life. I think that unless something turns for the worse in the pandemic that I will not feel worse about online classes. I actually used to like online classes for the convenience of time and scheduling as many online classes were self paced and I felt less pressure and that the class environment was more casual. However the more I spent in online classes the more I want to have a in person class as the classroom allows for the separation between the learning and life environments, which doesn't really happen when i get up from my computer."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3045,"Since COVID-19 pandemic started, I am very fearful about how academic will either improve or get worse over time for me, especially being taught online for the first time in life. Learning online is oftentimes easy for many people, because it gets more relaxing at home, rather than going to school and attend different classes. But for me, I feel that learning online is definitely not easy, since there weren't enough opportunities for me to ask questions to the instructor, or discussion with other students as there are no spaces to do so. But also because of this shifting from real person to online, I learned how to care for myself. I started to take more notes on my iPad, setting up a calendar so that I will be reminded of when to go to class, and when to complete assignments and submit. Based on the daily patterns that I had, I feel like I've improved a little bit more, since its already one year passed, and things are getting settled. I started to become familiar to the environment, and learned how to adapt."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3061,Online classes have never changed my studying and learning patterns.  I've been enrolled in online courses since 2017 and so far all of these courses were helpful because the instructors included studying materials (i.e. videos or websites).  One concern I do have is having class presentations.  I don't have issues presenting topics or materials I've learned in class but I haven't been in a physical class for more than two years so I think I would be nervous presenting.
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2109,"Online classes have not been the best for me because I had to come back home. As much as I love being home, with my parents, maintaining a time difference of 14+ hours has not been easy for me. Everyone knows how important night sleep is but I have to stay up all night on most days. It has been hard to socialize and be present in people's lives due to this sleeping schedule. It helped me take college more seriously because I had to be more careful about not missing a deadline or skipping classes. It also affected my health badly. But one thing I do for my sanity is taking full breaks on weekends. I tend to finish everything on weekends and keep the weekends to catch up on my sleep, do some shopping, go to the spa, or spend quality time with friends and family. Besides that, I make sure I get to exercise every day so that I feel more put together. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,145,Online classes have impacted by learning some in positive and some in negative. One good thing is flexibility. I am able to not rush and worry about being late to class or missing the bus. One negative is the atmosphere. Something about learning in a classroom is different. It sets the mood into learning mode. When being at home you want to relax but that had to change once online classes came around. The mindset when getting home was to not worry about any classwork or labs. We had to all change that to continue learning. I am still able to talk to others but it is not the same when everything around me is home. So there are pros and cons but overall I am adjusting to it but at times it can be tricky.
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3050,"Online Classes has been somewhat challenging honestly as I feel with most of my classes I got more work than usual . To me personally, I can definitely hande lit , however there are times across semester where I struggle to handle it .However this last two weeks have been really rough for me and I struggled to maintain with my Physics work . Also , I struggle to keep up with overall the workload sometimes as I feel some week are extremely hard , because one chapter is really hard and I have to prepare myself for that chapter honestly seems sometimes impossible , even though I complete it . I feel that I would rather learn out of 13 chapter I would rather learn 9 of them really good and 4 of them later. However, with this 2 chapters per week honestly can be exhausting and I hope there could be readjustments to this idea in the future.Honestly , overall this class is challenging , but definitely doable if you put over 20+ hours just on this class. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3064,"Online classes have honestly improved my learning a ton. I find that I am able to have more time on my hands and take my time on subjects that I struggle in. It has also allowed more flexibility and I am able to have more time to do work. As a commuter student, commuting took up a lot of my time during the day. I would end up getting home late and end up rushing to do my work since a lot of my time was spent taking the train, riding the bus, and walking. Online classes have helped me eliminate that time and have even more time to focus really on my studies. It has also helped me become a lot less anxious and has actually improved my mental health. In terms of self care, I am able to have more time to relax and take a breather. With nowhere to go, I am able to take time out of the day to focus on myself and do more of my hobbies which I wasn't able to do going in person. I don't really have concerns about my learning but going back in person can cause a huge shift in my schedule once again and it does worry me a little that I won't have all the time I have now to take my time learning different topics in class."
