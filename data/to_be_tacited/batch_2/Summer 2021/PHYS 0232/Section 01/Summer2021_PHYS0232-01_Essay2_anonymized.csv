2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2109,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals? Future goals, future plans always overwhelmed me. But now I know what I really enjoy. I enjoy analyzing things, I like to learn about new things related to my main goal: being an engineer. In my last physics class, we had the same reflection question and all I said was that being an engineer for me is just to make my dad happy since he is an engineer himself but now it's more than that. I actually enjoy this field and I would love to pursue it even more after I graduate. This class is just a step closer to my actual goal."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3057,"Currently, my goals are to graduate and hopefully find a job along the lines of a computer engineer. With me taking this class, it is one step closer for me to attain that goal. Especially with the topic of this class about electricity and circuits, it will help me understand the topic a little bit more. It will expand my knowledge so that hopefully when I reached my goal of getting my computer engineering degree I would able to use what I've learned. Besides that, the topic of this class is pretty interesting and it very helpful to understand what is happening with the electrical devices around us. Because I'm more of an engineer than a programmer, this would hopefully help me more in my field of work. At the end of the day though, this class will be beneficial for me and will satisfy the requirements for my major, and will supply me with wisdom that I could use for the future."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,145,My goal is to get my bachelors in electrical engineering. This class will help me alot since there are some chapters that will speak on electricity and resistance. This will help me get a good idea on how electricity flows. We are also getting some review with negative and positive charges. The way each charge moves is different and how opposite attract while the same charge repels. This will help me learn the basics when  I move on to a class that is more focused on only electrical engineering. By learning the basics I will not be lost in class or asking silly questions that will take me a while to catch up. Physics revolves around engineering. Engineering is math and science so in order to do well in engineering I have to be good at physics and understand how the things around me work. This class will help me understand how electricity works.
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3058,My goal in this class is to achieve a good level of understanding on all topics present so I can use it in the future for any coding programming that involves physics with energy and electricity. This can be of great help to also have a better understanding of how some of the physics we will learn about can be used in our daily lives. Energy and electricity is all around us but we cant even see it so it it hard to understand. With this class we can have a greater understanding of those topics and gain more knowledge. It also looks like a very interesting class and I am loving the topics and applications. 
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,1883,"My goal is to get my computer science degree so naturally I have to do well in this class and get a good grade so that I can graduate. With that being said, it has actually been such a delight to take this course because I love physics and learning about electromagnetism is fascinating. One thing that has always been on my mind is whether there could be an element out there that can conduct electricity that is biodegradable. Now I know the chances of that happening are very slim as everything we know to this point is very set in stone and we’ve kind of finished up the periodic table and we know what metals are and are not conductive but it’s something I’ve always pondered on. There has to be a better way to make computers without the use of metals. I’m very fascinated by bio alternatives that are biodegradable to replace most of the technology we have today. I’m fascinated by the intersection of computer science, engineering, physics, and environmental science to advance the world to a more sustainable future. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3074,"Regarding my goal, I hope that I can get the best grades in each class. I hope to get many different goals, such as for my entire undergraduate time, get an excellent GPA, have some good work experiences, and remember lots of knowledge that can be familiar and can be used in my brain instead of reading on the book. I always cheer for myself every time before each class begins and try my best that never miss class and finish my homework seriously. At the same time, I always remind myself, I have to work harder and harder than others because there are too many people in the world who are smarter and work harder than me. I must keep chasing them in their footsteps.For all of my goals, I summarized the following points:try my best to finish homework early each weekparticipate more in classfind an effective study systembuild upon your strengthspractice moreunderstand why following my goals is important"
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3066,"My goal is pretty simple: get an A in this class. The reason is because physics is not my main major. I took this class because CS major requires it. I think this class will help me understand how electric circuits work, even though as a software programmer, I don’t really care about it. But studying in this class will definitely give me a better understanding of how the basic programming language works with the circuit in order to understand how some advanced logic and computer components work. Software programmers don’t really care too much about these electric circuits like hardware developers, but we still need to understand how they work in order to choose a better data structure to make the code run efficiently in a machine. Not every machine has the same component and will work efficiently as the others, just like mac and windows. They are based on different structures and we need to understand how they work based on different organizations of capacitors and other components. So learning this class will definitely reduce my time to understand components of computers."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3046,"Maybe it's because I'm not too deep into my major; I can not be sure about what I am supposed to do in the future. But for now, my goal is to graduate as a computer engineer, which means I need to handle some level of programming skills and professional level of circuit design skills. I should choose a project for the plane between the hardware and software; Of course, this decision will be made after knowing more about both areas. So far, all I want to do is step to step and get closer to graduating and this course is one of my required courses for graduation, and the knowledge of the electricity learned in this class will be foundational to support me in my future study in circuit design. Even I did not find a direct connection between this class and my circuit decided class, things I learned in this class can still give me a better understanding of those components on the circuit board work."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3071,"My current goal is to get a computer science degree (doesn't have to be at this college, but I've already transferred twice so I should probably get it here) so that I can eventually move into game development since I've heard that it's a better viewed degree (from people hiring) than a game development degree. This class relates to my goal because it is a required course for my major, so I have to pass this class in order to get that done. I suppose it would also be helpful to understand electric fields as general knowledge, but I don't expect to be using them too much where I'm going. This is still in the early phases, so to speak, so I don't know for sure yet."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3047,My goals are to be able to do something I love when I am done with college. I want to find a passion and I think that a passion will only grow with more knowledge. The more you understand something the more you can appreciate it in all that it is. I think that this class is going to help me because what I am most interested in right now is biology. Biology is highly linked with physics and so I want to be able to understand the material in this class so I can take it and apply it somewhere else. This class will allow me to graduate early so I can have more money for graduate school where I can hopefully follow what I love more and specialize my work even more. I am hoping this class can also help me see what I am and am not interested in since right now I have no concrete field of interest in stem just likely biology related. I love chemistry as well and physics and chemistry are also very linked.
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3063,"My goal is to get my degree in computer science. This class is a major requirement so I had no choice but to take it even though I suck at physics. One thing this class did teach me though is to look at things around me differently. It's crazy I went from not paying attention to now paying attention to every little detail around me as much as I could. For example, most of us drive every single day. We don't think about the dynamics of a car or the motion that's involved. My dream is to one day work in a tech company and develop beneficial things we don’t have in society today. It’s weird that we have to take physics though. My friend from Jordan is also a computer science major and she doesn’t have to take physics. She thought it was weird that we had to take physics but I think it’s to enhance critical thinking, so I’m not complaining."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3069,"I would like to go into the tech industry and become a lead engineer at a company. The way this class helps me is that if I choose to go into a different type of software engineering that needs fundamental understanding of the concepts of energy and electric fields, I can apply what I learned during this class to the situation at hand and understand what I'm doing in the situation and I can understand what went wrong if it fails. I believe anyone that is in constant usage of electronics and computers during work hours should get to know their electricity better so they understand how to troubleshoot any issues that might come up and disturb their work. In conclusion, this class is going to be very essential for me in my future and I have to understand the concepts thoroughly so I can use that knowledge to my advantage in the road to becoming a lead engineer."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3064,"My goals for this class is to be able to get better at physics and find ways to involve the concepts in my everyday life. I think it is important to understand these physics concepts and being able to relate them to my everyday life will help me be able to get a better understanding of the concepts. With my way of learning, it is important for me to see physical things and simulations of things. I know that using simulations and physical objects while doing labs will significantly help me get better understanding and help me learn better. In order to achieve this goal, I have to be able to look at a topic and be able to make connections to real life instead of just learning something and relying on an equation for example to be the only way I learn something. Again, simulations in the past and in this class have helped me significantly when it comes to difficult topics and they are able to help show real world examples of the topics. Even if a lab has no simulation, I can search for one in order to help me. Overall, understanding this class is very important to me and relating it to real life in order for me to recognize and use them in my everyday life."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3048,"My goal is to obtain a degree in Civil Engineering, and ultimately, with my degree, I will become a traffic engineer. This physics class helps me achieve these goals because it is a required class that is needed for my major. I am also aware that understanding physics will further help my understanding of civil engineering concepts. That is the main reason why I am trying my best to understand the concepts of this class. Although, it is challenging because this class is being taught remotely. In my opinion, this class would be better taught in person. But due to the circumstances of the Covid pandemic we are unable to attend classes in person. I hope, although classes for the past year have been taught remotely, I am able to learn what is needed to progress further in physics and other classes related to my major."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3043,"I see my goals being approached on a path now. I have thought of getting better at computer hardware and stuff, and before I was introduced to topics and some materials, but wasn't really taught abut the math, but it is coming along now. Especially now, we are learning about capacitors, and it is a vital thing in computer hardware, so this part where instead of learning the background stuff, we are finally applying the background stuff, to actual instruments and parts. So I still have long term goals of maybe working toward improving computer hardware, where limitations, and things that work in theory and not reality, may become a possibility, and I think the current path I am in, is getting closer to it. So I really think if I continue to learn about more instruments and parts, I may be at the right track."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,144,"I would like to get a job in software development, this class is a stepping stone to that goal. I am in my last year of my major and have yet to apply anything relating to my study electromagnetism directly to my other work but I can absolutely see computer engineers having to deal with the concepts touched on in this class on a daily basis. I do however think that the critical thinking skills used throughout this class will be incredibly helpful. Being able to analyze a problem, and consider how other similar problems you have solved can be used to inform the solution to a larger problem are skills that translate very well in both physics and computer science. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3045,"There are some academic goals that I have. First, I always wanted to improve my note-taking skills by practicing more on using different technologies, such as using my iPad to annotate on PowerPoints or slides from the class. This goal is in the progress of achieving, since for the lab we have to write out our notes and answers on the Lab Exploration packet PDF. Second, another goal that I have is that I wish to meet more new people and open discussions that are healthy and meaningful. In every week's lab, I get to meet with people that I never met before, discussing the courseworks, school life and daily life experiences, which helps everyone learn and make a better community in SF State. Another goal that I have is improving my grades in class, which was one of my biggest wishes in attending college. Although grades are not important compared to knowledge, having a good grade on my transcript will increase the chance of getting a better job."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3049,"I don't have any goals hahahaha. jk, nah its true I don't. I would said my one goal is to pass this class, with a A. Cause lets be honest who doesn't want a A. My another goal is to stay fit. I know it is quarantine and stuff but I kept eating unhealthy foods which cause me to be really sick (This happened last June) Then I started eating healthy and I exercise a lot. I wake up in the morning and do go running then I go for walks with my sister. I don't like to workout cause I don't enjoy them. My last goal is to pray because I feel like if I pray my mood is better and I have a positive attitude towards life. And to get a A I will submit my assignments on time. I feel like if you submit assignments on time and go to the zoom session the professors will give you a A cause they know how it feels like to be a student. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2126,"My goals are to get a career in mechanical engineering and live financially stable. I want to love my job because I didn’t use four years of my life for no reason. I also don’t want to stress over having to pay the bills, groceries, etc. because I will never get to enjoy life. I have to do the hard work now so I can live easier in the future. This class will help me by completing the prerequisites for my major. If I pass, I won’t have to worry about doing it all over again and I will still be on track for graduating in four years. Additionally, this class will help me by setting down the first stones to get where I want to. Physics will definitely be used in my major and it’s no wonder why physics is a prerequisite. I will be on top of the work because I know if I slack the work will pile up quickly.  "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3072,"I have many goals but a goal that I have for this class is to pass with at least a B while I am aiming for an A. Hopefully, while I am trying to achieve this goal I can learn and apply what I learn to my everyday life. My Onforward goal is to be able to graduate which this class is going to help me achieve.  Also what I can learn in this class hopefully it can help me in the future. All really depending what and where I end up working. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,597,"My goal is to become a civil engineer, and make my family proud. I know that if I try my best in this class I will be one step closer to that goal. It’s not easy but I know that making my family proud will make me feel proud of myself especially as a Latina since the professional field is mostly made of white men, I know I have to do this most importantly for my niece since I wanna push her to do STEM in the future, and if she’s interested in the STEM field I can be there to support her when she goes off to college. I want to make her proud most of all, so she can have someone to look up to, as she is my main inspiration. I want to be a mentor/role model to her and to maybe other young bright Latinas in my community."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3067,"My goals are to achieve a good GPA for college studies and have a good condition to apply to a good graduate school. This class teaches me basic knowledge about physics, and it will help me a lot when I encounter a physical question in my future studies and raise my grade indirectly. Besides, I do not need to register for physics 2 in incoming semesters, and it will make my studies in the following semesters be more relaxing."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3062,"My goals for this class are to have a well, general understanding of the topics we are covering.As of now the textbook, homework, and classwork is helping me achieve this goal. Having visual images also help me further understand the topics we go over weekly. For example, the lines we were learning about electric fields definitely helped me visualize it. In this set up of classes, where we aren't physically resent in a class, groupwork is also very helpful so that I could express my thoughts and questions with fellow piers."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,159,"My goals in life and I guess for my college career is to, first get my degree, and secondly get a job where I can use my degree and thirdly, become engineer. With these goals, it is definitely going to take a long time, but I have to persevere, and if this is a goal I really want to pursue (which it is) I'm not going to quit. Now how can this class help me achieve these three simple but lengthy goals? First, by passing this class will put me one step closer to completing my college degree, and all the information I learn in this class will be important in the critical thinking skills that I may need for a job in the future. One thing I like about physics is that you don't really need to know all the equations and rules to succeed if you can think of the issue in physics practically and with common sense, everything will make sense, and when you use common sense to solve these problems in physics, its basically problem-solving at a basic level and that's all I want to do for a job. Lastly to become an engineer I'm going to have to learn an abundance of physics concepts and since this is the second class of the set, this class will be the stepping stone to all my goals that I want to achieve."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3053,"My goals are to work in tech doing something interesting. I'm in this class cause it's required for CS majors. Hopefully I can do something like security testing or network engineering. I'd just like to not hate my job to be honest. Physics is interesting when it's not stressful and for a grade. Learning things in general is fun as long as I'm not being graded. Maybe my interests will change over time. I'm probably not gonna be able to afford a nice house in San Francisco by the time I'm earning money so that kinda sucks. I'll probably end up living in a van. Idk how this class can help me reach my goals, maybe if I take a bigger interest in physics I could do code in the aerospace field or something. If I ever want to reach my pipe dream of doing something that people will remember not a lot of people mind you just some people it might be worth looking at some physics engineering software and create an open source/ an updated version in a modern language."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3040,"My goals are to better understand physics concepts and become more confident in solving physics problems. Although I took AP Physics in high school, I felt like I did not completely understand the materials and felt like I was falling behind other students. It might be the lack of confidence since I believed everyone in my class was smarter than me. Because of this, when I started school at SFSU, I told myself I wanted to fully understand the concepts and improve my confidence. I also took PHYS 222 in Spring last semester, but it was mainly based on simulations and learning by myself. So far, this lab has been teaching me more about the concepts with hands-on experience, so I am looking forward to learning more from this class. This class can help me achieve my goals of further understanding the concepts and improving my confidence because of the environment and how the assignments are set up. A few weeks in, and I already feel the course is well-developed and the professor is great at explaining the concepts. I like how we are able to work in groups (something last semester did not have) and can share ideas among each other. The professor does a good job of covering the topics of the lab, making sure everyone understands. The students are also willing to help each other out, which is beneficial since it may be hard to reach people online. The simulations and experiments from this class can also help me achieve my goals because I am able to experiment with the physics concepts and test my knowledge. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2121,"My goals are to pass all the classes I am enrolled in and to get all my work turned in on time. I like to learn, and I make sure to take notes to help me get the most out of my lectures in order to pass the class with good grades. My ultimate goal for my academic career involves graduation in 5 years and not failing any classes, to earn the degree I want from computer engineering, I think this class can help me achieve my goals by teaching me to build good habits for my work ethic and it can help me by teaching my skills I will use in the long run. I think it is known that engineering major will take lots of physics classes and this being my introduction will help me in preparing for the future classes I will need to take. This class will be the basis I will have for physics classes and I hope it will prepare for the next physics classes to come."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3056,"As a Computer Science major I am required to complete Physics 220/222 and 230/232 and pass it. While I passed 220/222 last semester, I now have this class left to complete. So far, my goals are for the most part similar to last semester, in that I wish to learn as much valuable Physics knowledge as possible so that in the future I can apply these concepts to whatever branch of Computer Science I wish to explore. I also definitely want to pass this class as well. Similarly to Physics 222, this class can help me accomplish my goals by teaching me both the theories and applications of Physics concepts to the real world. To do this, making labs with a variety of experiments and resources will help me tremendously, like using PHET simulations online or even going hands-on with the material. This way I can develop both an intuitive and mathematical understanding of these Physics concepts which well help me gain a deeper perspective on Physics and science as a whole. I hope we continue to expand our knowledge of these concepts as we venture further into the depths of Physics."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2090,"My goals for this class are fairly simple, I want to get into the habit of sitting down and really try to study the material. I've never been much of a student who depended on studying, I'm mostly all one and done. So I want to develop the habit of studying and just being more prepared since I know the classes will only get tougher from here. I have began to try and change some of the bad habits I have on a daily basis like immediately checking my phone when I wake up and scrolling for hours or distracting myself from actually paying attention to a class. I took this summer course to try and change these habits as well as going to bed early so that I wake up fully rested and prepared for class. I've began going to the gym in the early mornings at around 5-6 am, making sure that I arrive before class that way I can ensure that I am fully awake especially after some exercise. This gives me a lot of time afterwards to try and study for my summer courses and really dive into the material, so far the change has been smooth. I do feel like I am more aware of the amount of time I have to sort things out so I am hoping that I will be able to manage the time to study. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3044,"My goals are to be able to pass this semester with good standing grades, I am not expecting to get A+ in all my classes but I am hoping to at least get a passing grade. This class can help me achieve these goals by helping me build a stronger foundation for Physics. I can understand physics better by applying it in class, and working on multiple problems that can help me better understand physics. Although it does not directly correlate with my major being a Computer Science major but it lets me understand things that go with my major. During class time I'm able to work on lab explorations which help with the work load. I also get to ask for help from students in other classes that have different professors. A goal I have outside of this class would be to be able to get an internship within my major! I know summer is half way done but it still matters that I try. I'm also part of the Microsoft summer program and I want to be able to network during that time as well."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2118,"My goals for myself, in general, would be to get a degree in civil engineering and pursuing transportation engineering where I can plan and build motorways or tunnels for civilians. Another goal would be to maintain my grades at a good level, meaning As and Bs, but during the pandemic, I had struggled to maintain high grades as it was hard to learn and really study on one's own. Another goal is to pass this class with a relatively good grade. This course can help me with achieving these certain goals by understanding the curriculum and following step by step with laboratory procedures. With this class, I am able to learn theoretical laws and cycles on how the earth and other factors function.  Also, passing this class will help me move onto the next physics course which will help me with achieving my goal with a bachelor's degree. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3059,"In terms of educational goals specifically, I have always wanted to know more about graphics programming and physics simulation in a games setting, and physics has always been very close to these goals. I already have been learning a lot about the equations necessary to simulating motion, but being able to go into the physics of computers themselves I expect to also be helpful. I haven't seen as much of this second point come up yet, but I believe I will be able to connect it more to my computer science courses later on, especially when I learn about machine structures and operating systems and low level programming concepts in general. In regards to the first topic, much of this was covered in the previous physics class which was mechanics, but I expect more to come in both linear algebra, statistics, and in more of this physics class as well."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3041,"This course is meant to help me prepare for medical school applications. My goal is to become a practitioner of pediatrics. Currently, I work in education. As a pre-K teacher. I feel strongly that health professionals and educators must work together to meet the physical and mental health needs of our children. I know physics is an important foundation for medicine. I am looking forward to the day when a physics topic shows its relevance during a human biology lecture or a medical technology course. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3052,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals? knowing what my goal is a very important thing that keeps me going but from time to time I lose track of it. I am a computer Science major and I honestly sometimes think all the other classes I take are just a wast of my time as , I want to become a software engineer and I mainly want to learn how to code and it seems all the other classes in the curriculum just seem to be in the way of that , hurdles that I would have to pass to get to my goal I have thought so many times that I would become even a better software engineer if it wasn't for this mandatory classes that have nothing to do with computer science, so I thought. I have often felt that way when taking physics 220, as I ofter thought topics like acceleration , force and gravity have nothing to do with programming. this class on the other hand was the first time I realized  learning about electricity , circuits and all will definitely help me when I am sure I will take a hard ware class that I would have to learn circuits and all. so yeah for the first time I think this class would help me achieve my goal. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3055,"My goal right now is to get my BS in computer science and this course is part of the requirement. I would say passing is my goal but that doesn't mean that I don't want to perform well in the class or just scrape by. I have so far enjoyed the material and the topics discussed, I hope my enjoyment of the class continues. I do find the topics in physics very interesting and I do want to learn more about physics. However I don't think that the physics course will apply to my field of work after this class is over. I will probably continue to study physics in a casual manner and I am open to being surprised if some physics topics crop up in my field of work in the future. I find my fascination with the subject more along the lines of concepts rather than the actual math behind them."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3061,"My current goal is to graduate SFSU with a Bachelor's in computer science.  This class is part of the requirement for my major, however I've always had an interest in physics.  In high school, one of my favorite subject was physics because my teacher was very enthusiastic and always put effort into teaching his class.  His teachings acted as a bridge for my experience with college physic courses.  "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2521,"I really just want to have a firm grip on physical concepts since it will inherently help me understand how the world works in a better way. Because of this, I would say my goal is to understand the world better and have more knowledge of why things happen when they do. This class, in particular, is a bit different in that it covers electricity and magnetism, but it still has that significant importance in which the ideas we take away and learn from this class will apply to real life scenarios that involve things such as circuits, batteries, etc. This class will help build a foundation on how electrical mechanisms function, which definitely will be useful for me since I do plan to work in the physics field in the future."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2456,"In terms of goals, I have many goals that I want to achieve. one of the most important is to understand electricity and how does it work.. because I'm an electrical engineering major and being able to understand electricity is very important to me.. my second goal is being able to examine and going through things that can be taught on labs, things that make me visualize the concepts. I believe from the order of the concepts on this class and from the work we do together, and the effective simulations that will link the ideas from the lecture section to meet the practical part on the lab, finishing with a good understanding of the concepts. since we are studying online i believe a lot of the work is approaching less than it should be so i believe this class will complete the picture through group working. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3068,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?  My goals in general is to graduate with computer science degree , find a good and well paid job. And become the best programmer there ever been, even though this class might not help me much achieving this goals ,  I feel like this class will teach me communication skills with my teammates and socializing with group of people deciding on solution to the problem. I will achieve my goals by studying hard and trying to get good grades in all my classes as well as to get my diploma in near future.This class is a bit challenging which might help me in my future when I will be facing challenging situations , but the challenges that this class is facing me against are different from what I will be faced in my workplace therefore I feel like this class does help in a way but also it is lots of stress especially when we are doing online learning"
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3076,one of my biggest goals is to learn how electric fields work. I have been struggling through a lot of projects when it comes to electric work in the engineering field. this class will help me understand the basics of how electricity work which will help me reach my goals in the engineering field. I would love to get as much as possible of information about electrics so i can achieve my goals. electricity is all around not just in my projects as an engineer. visualizing the concept of electricity is one of my biggest points in this class and  will help in many points. the components of electricity which are the basics are really important to me especially when they relate to my goals somehow in my major as an engineer.
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3070,"My goals are to pass all my classes this semester so that I could be successful in the future. I feel like physics is more about logical thinking than memorizing equations and concepts.  I would have to spend hours and hours practicing problems from my math classes and coding classes. As I practice more and more, I will gradually improve is what I believe. Since we are in online learning due to the pandemic, it feels harder for me to attend and focus on classes. Sometimes I am behind in classes so I would have to go back and watch the lectures. As I aspire to become a software engineer in the future, logical thinking is a very important thing to have. Though since I aspire to be a software engineer, I believe that the actual subjects I learn in this class will not be required in the future. In order to keep up with my classes, I have decided to make a schedule that I strictly follow. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3051,"I want to get an A in this class. But I also have other goals in this class. I want to learn a little bit about hardware. Being a computer science major it is important to have at least some understanding about the materials we can work with. Although we might not directly work with hardware, it is still important to understand. We use a lot of these electric devices every day, and we continue to use them without even realizing how they work. Whether it is a phone or a lawnmower they all use power, and most people just ignore how they work and just go with the flow never understanding their own tools. I just want to learn more about our world so that I am just not brainlessly doing random things every day."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2104,"In terms of my academic goals, this class will help me get my degree. My degree plan is kind of messed up right now since I took my major classes in a weird order so now my prerequisites don’t line up conveniently for upcoming semesters. That’s why I decided to take summer classes to fix my schedule so taking this class right now will help make future semesters easier to plan. In terms of my personal/work related goals, this class can help me gain a better understanding of electronics so I can apply this knowledge to my personal projects and expand the types of projects I can do at work. I work at a makerspace as a technician and I’m limited to operating machines and doing wood/plastic work. Hopefully this class will help me at least better understand the equipment I’m working with and help me feel more comfortable with exploring metal and electric work."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2113,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?Goals are always important and when you are in college it helps to have mindset goals. If you want to succeed, you need to set goals. Without goals you lack focus and direction. Goal setting not only allows you to take control of your life's direction; it also provides you a benchmark for determining whether you are actually succeeding. Think about it: having a million dollars in the bank is only proof of success if one of your goals is to amass riches. If your goal is to practice acts of charity, then keeping the money for yourself is suddenly contrary to how you would define success. To accomplish your goals, however, you need to know how to set them. You can't simply say, ""I want"" and expect it to happen. Goal setting is a process that starts with careful consideration of what you want to achieve, and ends with a lot of hard work to actually do it. In between, there are some very well-defined steps that transcend the specifics of each goal. Knowing these steps will allow you to formulate goals that you can accomplish.Setting goals that relate to the high priorities in your life. Without this type of focus, you can end up with far too many goals, leaving you too little time to devote to each one. Goal achievement requires commitment, so to maximize the likelihood of success, you need to feel a sense of urgency and have an ""I must do this"" attitude. When you don't have this, you risk putting off what you need to do to make the goal a reality. This in turn leaves you feeling disappointed and frustrated with yourself, both of which are de-motivating. And you can end up in a very destructive ""I can't do anything or be successful at anything"" frame of mind.In other words, don’t place the hope of future success in the hands of some wizard’s wand. Relying on someone or something to save you only brings a sense of victimization that paralyzes your ability to think clearly, creatively and quickly. Instead, take charge of shaping your own circumstances, and good, positive, game-changing things will begin to happen. It is very important to have goals! "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3060,"My goals for this class is to help me in succeeding in my Physics 230 class. So far, I’ve been very confused about some of the topics introduced to us in the Physics 230 class because they are new to me and we just don’t have enough time in class for the teacher to go over it in depth. But, the things I had trouble understanding in class like vectors and vector arithmetic, position vs time, velocity vs time, and acceleration vs time graphs. But, the labs thankfully have significantly helped me understand these concepts. Moving forward, the only thing I can do for this class to help me in my goals of succeeding in Physics 230 is to, first of all, be on top of Physics 230, and secondly to come to the lab lecture prepared and ready to learn. I think it’s also important to communicate with group members and be open to learning with them because they can help and you can help them the same."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3075,My goal right now is to graduate and find a well-paying job. This class will definitely help me graduate as it is one of my major requirements. I am not sure how helpful it will be with the job I end up doing. Other than that if I end up getting into a hands-on engineering job the course material will be very important and helpful. If I land a strictly coding job then not so much. Even if this knowledge does not relate to my future work I still want to learn about this stuff as I am using it all the time every day. 
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3050,"My goal in this class is to perform to best of my ability in general to get the best possible grade In this class, but also learn a lot about physics in the end since I really enjoy concepts such electricity and magnet I really can use this knowledge as a computer scientist when I am dealing with electrical component on a computer, server and etc..I really want to actually understand this at this stage of my life  as a lot of people use electrical devices everyday without consideration of Physics behind it . I hope to change this behavior for myself and achieve the goal of understand the concepts in electricity such as capacitors, resistance in order to feel confident when talking about physics concept with my friends and colleagues . But my main goal in this class is to explore all the concepts in physics and be able to visualize it , because for me personally part of my learning experience is that in order to implement a concept or law I have to visualize it and I can achieve this goal I would significantly do great job in my learning experience"
