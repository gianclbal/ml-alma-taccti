Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3040,"I want to go into the STEM field because it is genuinely what I am interested in. I have other hobbies too, but I feel that going into STEM is the best choice for me. For several years, I have dealt with self-deprecating thoughts of not being good enough, or that I will not achieve the level I want to reach. However, after exploring my interests a bit more, I have become more comfortable with STEM.STEM is such a broad field, in which there are many different areas of specialization within any STEM major. Even if a student loses interest in the major they are pursuing, or wants to learn more about another field, there is the opportunity to do so. In addition, everyday life is greatly affected by professionals from STEM programs. Science, technology, engineering, and math play a role in almost everything in the world that has become more and more technology-based.I want to pursue my STEM major because I would love to innovate and create new projects for the future, which will assist and change the world for the better. AR/VR, web development, and even some hardware are some topics that interest me. I also love meeting people who share the same ideas as me and learning new materials/how they work. As I learn, and as time changes, I will also be adapting to what is coming."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3041,"I want to go into medicine so I can help people. I want a skillset that is applicable where ever I go. These days medicine is much more than a STEM field. In order to ethically and equitably apply clinical knowledge, a physician must understand the social and cultural aspects of their patients lives. Biology cannot be untied from the sociocultural realm in which patients live. I am naturally a fuzzy, not a tech-y. I love nothing more than when the social sciences and the hard sciences merge. I am here to learn the foundations from which to build my knowledge of the human body. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3042,"I want to go into the STEM field to develop efficient programs for healthcare. This is personal, but the main reason I want to become a software developer in healthcare is because my grandpa passed away due to cancer. I only had two months with him after he was diagnosed. When I visited him, the hospital he was staying at seemed very unorganized electronically. One time they almost forgot to feed him, but luckily my family was there to check up on him. With my knowledge in computer science I hope to make a lasting impact by creating useful programs that can help healthcare workers stay more organized. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2126,"I want to go in the STEM field because I know it would lead me to a successful career and I know I would enjoy the job the I get. I chose mechanical engineering because I always wondered how things work and I like to build. My dad works in construction, so I think that where I got my passion from. He would sometimes take me to work, and I would see all the projects that him and his co-workers are building. I know that it will not be easy to get my degree, but I am willing to put in all my effort to get as far as possible into my field because I want to help my parents financially along with myself. I’m still thinking about getting my master’s degree because I know that some companies pay your tuition to get your master’s. So far, my classes have been great because I’m learning the fundamentals.  "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3043,"Personally I do better with Maths where theres more clearly defined answers, than something a bit more not as defined like english or writing. I also like the idea that by working in STEM, we are furthering technological advances, and it would slowly both help us understand the world better as well as potentially raise the standard of living. It could also make things previously impossible, possible. I have a mostly CS background, and I've decided to pursue computer engineering, so I could dabble a bit into hardware. And for example, if we look at crypto mining, we could see the advances from CPU to GPU to stuff I don't remember to ant miner, etc. And its those advancements in hardware where it made it a bit more sensible for cryptocurrencies to be able to be mined. Nowadays there are other consensus mechanisms, however the new hardware really made the idea of decentralized currencies out as a possibility. So maybe in the future we could design hardware to support impossible ideas, and then use software/algorithms to efficientize that process."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3044,"The reason I would like to go into a STEM field is since I was in elementary school my favorite subject was science. I was excited for science days and I was always engaged, one of the reasons was because it was hands on. I was felt like I learned better that way and it just made it that much more interesting. I later got into high school and my love for had not changed, the only difference was that since I went to a low income private catholic school we did not have any classes or after school programs that allowed me to expand my love for science. I later decided to major in biology when I got to college without any real grasp of what I wanted to do when I graduated and soon found out I did not enjoy it as much as I though. I started to dabble in programming, and I was always interested even as a small child, I just never had the resources to fully learn. Now that I am in college I have the resources to change my major and learn that way, I love programming. I enjoy being able to make webpages, and hoping one day I can create a video game, an app or even just a couple of websites!"
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3045,"The STEM field was one of the biggest career fields being developed and expanded over the years. As it includes not only science, but also technology, engineering and mathematics. I chose to enter the STEM field for a few reasons. First reason is that I see myself interested in continuously exploring and converting my skills into a product that I wish to make, since I am always interested in learning how technology works. The relationship between science, engineering and mathematics also persuaded me into developing my success, because I was always very confused about how each of these topics can be related to each other. Third reason is that I always tend to do better in mathematics and technology courses compared to other subjects, such as english and history, as I find those a little bit boring and redundant to learn. Because of these reasons, I decided to enter the STEM field and Computer Science has become my major for studying at SFSU."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3046,"Why do I want to get in STEM filled? That is also a question I'm still asking myself. In my junior year of high school, I was confused about what suppose I do after graduate; And eventually, I chose a ""correct answer,"" computer engineering. At that moment, I thought the computer might be the only thing I'm interested in since I learned how to code in Python by myself, and I wrote some script for fun in high school. I believe the computer is the future of the world. The only thing I'm not sure about is should I focus on the software or hardware. I took computer and systems engineering as my major because it contained both software and hardware knowledge. Then after I get deeper into the professional area, I'm able to choose which part I should focus on. But when I step into this field, I realized my patient with the computer was not strong as I thought. I feel tired of sitting in front of the laptop all day long; I'm don't think I hate it, but I'm not sure if the computer is something I want to work with the rest of my life."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3047,"I want to go into the STEM field because I have always really been interested in chemistry and biology. I have always had a passion for marine biology and I took a course my sophomore year of high school and it is still my favorite class I have ever taken. I know this would be a good field for me because even though I completed this course 4 years ago I still remember so many facts from it. I live next to the beach and love to tidepool and when I go with my friends I am able to share what I know with them and appreciate the experience so much more for knowing how hard it is to survive in a tide pool. It is also fun to be able to look at the organisms and be able to understand how they work, what they eat, and why they are built the way they are. When it comes to chemistry I love thinking about the molecular level and how everything we know is made up of these tiny atoms all interacting with each other.  I love thinking about intermolecular interactions between everything especially in living things and how all of this life became possible from random mutations. Organisms are built out of so many things with enzymes that are able to be turned on and off my signals from its surrounding and somehow all of that came to be through random changes. So overall, I want to go into STEM because I think its so cool and the more I learn the more curious I become and the more questions I have that I want to know the answers to. I think that is exactly why someone should want to go into a field. They love it and it gives them a passion for what they do and leaves them excited to come in and learn more."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3048,"Originally, I chose to go into the STEM field was because I realized that I love math. My first major was Dental Hygiene, although after taking math classes for the general ed requirement, I thought that math could be something that I would enjoy doing and as a career. Therefore, I looked into what types of careers I could pursue that involve math and eventually was led to Civil Engineering. I then ultimately decided on switching my major to Civil Engineering. I also was never interested in the Liberal Arts classes because I strongly dislike writing essays, that is why I focused more on STEM. I enjoy STEM classes more, and enjoy learning in these types of classes. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3049,"Reflective Journal #1:			Why do I want to go into the stem field?	Well, firstly I didn’t want to go into the stem field because this field is very demanding and like you know you have to learn to code and most importantly sit at one place for the whole day. I am a person who loves to stay active and I also like to move around a lot. So there was no way I was going to choose anything STEM related. Now you might be wondering why I chose this field when I was applying. Firstly, I was in high school so I had no idea what I wanted to do so I just chose the field that was making the most money because who is gonna pay student loans, well me. Then in my 2nd semester my English professor gave us a project which said where you see yourself in four years, career wise. So I was like oh I see myself as a teacher and then I was like but why am I in an engineering degree. Well I thought about switching out of it and going into teaching but then first thing is that I am done with more than 60 units so I am half way to get this degree second thing is if I want to switch from engineering to teaching I can but if I want to switch from teaching to engineering I can’t do that. And plus how will I pay my student loans if I keep on switching degrees and it would be a mess. So I have decided to join the STEM field for now and enjoy my time in the stem field as long as I want to then I will see if I want to switch my career to teaching or something. Word count 302"
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3050,"""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?""  One of the main reason I took a STEM field on how fascinating the subjects are overall. People in STEM never learn one single subject like some major require us to do such as History. STEM major students get to experience and work on other interesting subject such as Computer Science , Math , Sciences and Engineering which personally from childbirth I was always fascinated from the day when I learned Algebra . But what truly made me fascinated in STEM was when I started playing video Games like Mario Kart and Doom . From that point on, I wanted to  learn the physics, math and computer science goes into making a game look really awesome and cool . I realized that at the point on after playing my first video game as a kid I really wanted to be a Computer Science major , but also learn the math and physics behind on how this machines runs and functions. Overall, to summarize, I went to STEM field due to my simple fascination of Video Games and Math as a little kid."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,145,"I want to go into the STEM field because I have always found it interesting. I like to learn how the world works. I find it fascinating how the earth works. The most shocking thing that I learned was that if air resistance is ignored then the weight of an object does not matter because they will both land at the same time due to gravity being the same for both objects. I also like to make experiments because they will always surprise me and these experiments always are related to the real world and are not just something that is out of this world. Creating things and seeing how it will turn out is very cool to me because I get to experiment on my own inventions. Overall, STEM is more about experimenting and that is something I really enjoy since I get to apply the rules of the world and I can connect them to why it did or didn’t work out."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3051,"The biggest reason why I want to go into stem is that I thought it was interesting. My parents were also in the stem field so I was probably heavily influenced by that. Also, I lived in Silicon Valley my whole life, so that also probably has played a big role. Another reason is that my dad told us that it produces a respectable future, and somewhat of a guaranteed job that will be needed in the near future. If I am being completely honest, at first I picked computer science because I did not know what I wanted to do. I decided on CS because I didn't want to apply undecided, and I could always transfer out of my major. But it also was for already being in, because transferring into CS, is extremely difficult. Even if I didn't major in CS, I would have done something in the STEM field. Science is a much more interesting topic to me, compared to liberal arts, or business majors. Lastly, STEM majors pay decently. It is obvious but I will need to work hard to make that true."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3052,"why do I want to go in the STEM field,the reason I have gotten into STEM is because I like math and computer science and in contrast I am not so good in arts and subjects that involve a lot of memorization. for example as much as I like to know more about history,I realized at some point , studing for a history test , that I wasn't able to retaing most of the information as much as I wanted to and realizred I am a STEM student and not arts. I like creating , designing , testing a new idea in the software world. phsyics in that sense gives me the ability to grow most of my exploring , experimenting my thesis. coming back to my main reason to pick STEM is math, I like working with numbers , I like being challenged with a problem and the urge of finding a solution. so yeah basically this are the reasons I am in STEM."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3053,I want to get into stem because I find it interesting. I had a realization (and a minor existential ) the other day talking to my brother that I've always been a nerd. I don't know why that realization made me panic for a sec because most my friends are also nerds. As a kid i was watching videos on tech and videos by make magazine and such. My brother isn't old enough to remember when macs switched from PowerPC to intel processors he thought that happened in the 90s but I was able to recall people being mad about it because their software didn't work.I guess the reason I want to go into stem is cause I like knowing how and why things work. I got into lock picking cause I wanted the ability to literally open all the doors. Not to steal things but just to know that I could if I wanted to. 
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3054,"Science Technology Engineering and Medicine? One thing's for sure I have an undying love for science and I fundamentally believe that having a scientific mind would solve so many of human's problems.  Not only in a scientific field of study but also social relations, self confidence, and basically any system of observations.  Even if this class didn't have the label of ""STEM"" and even if it weren't a part of my Bachelors requirement, I would still take the class just to get a better understanding of how the world works.  Physics is a fundamental player in life because we live in a physical world and if you think physics is unimportant, then that same thought will inhibit you from truly understanding the world around you.  Lambs to the slaughter Plus I think it's just really cool. -Justin Shin"
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3055,"Originally I didn't really know why I went into STEM, I was just good at math and science. I originally was studying chemical engineering and my whole motivation and interest in STEM just dropped off completely. I had to really reflect on what I actually wanted to do. I stopped taking stem classes and looked at other subjects like history and art but I eventually came back around to computer science. I think that was a result of my general interest in computers and technology. Furthermore I like the idea of automating and problem solving. Programming is where I found that to be most apparent. Computer Programming is very much a task orientated workspace where the start and end point is quite well defined. I enjoy the idea of well defined start and end with vast freedom to connect them. While I still have some problems with more frustrating aspects of programming, I think I have found a Stem field that I genuinely enjoy."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3056,"This response was originally from when I first encountered this question in Physics 222, but my reasoning and philosophy for going into the STEM field has mostly stayed the same:""I would like to go into the STEM field for two reasons. One, the realms of science and technology seem so vast and are ever expanding (like the universe), and with so many new discoveries, inventions and theories coming out it seems like what comes out of the STEM field will definitely shape the future of humanity, and it's something I want to be a part of. And two, I specifically want to become a computer scientist and ultimately a video game developer. As a kid I loved both literature/writing and video games and becoming a computer scientist felt like merging those two fields together. I also love working with computers and seeing how programs work, especially how video games were made, and I had several stories and story ideas that I felt would work perfectly in an art medium like video games. Overall, I hope to work in the STEM field when I finish college and pursue my dreams of being a computer scientist and a video game developer.""I would also like to apply aspects of STEM and Computer Science into my writing someday, and other various projects I wish to complete."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3057,"There is not really a specific reason why I wanted to go into the STEM field because my major, computer engineering, just happens to be in it. For a while now, I have been interested in computers for a long time now but not specifically the coding side of it which is why I decided to go into computer engineering rather than computer science. One downside being stem major is the amount of math that is with it. I am not a fan of math because of the difficulty level but I have to deal with it. On the other, once you graduated I would like to say the starting pay for stem majors is pretty high which is also one of the reasons that I want to become a computer engineer. At the end of the day, I would need to dedicate a lot of hard work and time so that I can reach my own goals."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3058,"I have always had an edge on the mathematics aspect. It has always been my best subject and for me, solving problems is really interesting and enjoyable. About 5 years ago, at my first year of high school I was set in becoming an engineer and help build our society but as the years went by I was not so sure about my choice. I had just arrived in the U.S, San Francisco and there was an infinite amount of career choices I could take. Since that time i have been really close to computers and learning how to code so it came to me that the most obvious route would be of programming. So living in one of the most successful places in the world for programming and developing I decided to pursue STEM and I am now beginning my third year. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3059,"One big reason is that STEM is what my society currently values monetarily. Aside from economics, as someone who comes from a deep appreciation for art and interest in culture, I want to both advocate for, and learn more about the space between STEM and culture. I see this manifesting in mainly two ways: 1 being more reality based/scientifically sound artistic representations of reality, and 2 being the technological progression of artistic capability. I have a deeper interest in the first, as I believe art and culture to be a powerful, yet underused educator and communicator of societal scientific knowledge. I believe that through these methods, our society can be more scientifically sound which has the potential to clear a lot of the misunderstandings and misrepresentations that cause conflict. Moving to more concrete inspirations, many of the people I admire most happen to be in the STEAM field, and almost all of them profess both the usefulness of having knowledge and skills within the field, but also the fun that exists in exploring reality in a rigorous way, which I've always wanted to pursue, and now have the opportunity to do."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,1988,"Dear Diary,I enjoy STE (-M) though I am no longer fully certain that I want to pursue a career in engineering, at least not in the manner I originally intended.  For a university in the tech hub of the world CoSE is underwhelming in the extreme; begging my way into the school of design's facilities just to access a decent shop isn't something I anticipated, nor is using lab equipment from the 1950's  Thankfully I have been accepted into an exchange program abroad, primarily as a means to see if it is engineering I dislike or just this school, my guess is that the issue is with the latter.  Either way a re-evaluation of my initial purposes is needed after the upcoming school year.*As an aside.  Despite waning enthusiasm for CoSE, I believe that it is vitally important for as many people as possible to learn and apply STEM concepts, especially the scientific method and the critical thinking that goes along with much of our learning.  Too many people are kowtowing to ill-conceived and unsupported silliness from the humanities, especially in the CSU system.  The lack of vocal and firm opposition to this by STEM professors and students does us all a great disservice.  If we hope to be in a STEM field than it is incumbent upon us to ensure that the tenets of STEM are not molested.  The end."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,597,"I have several reasons why I chose Civil Engineering as my major. In the engineering field there aren’t enough Latinx people in the field let alone Latinas, I want to change that. I feel as though it’s important to inspire and encourage other young Latinas to be in the STEM field in order to have more representation. Representation of Latinas in the STEM field is important to me because I can help create a diverse professional field that will benefit our society in the future. On a personal note, I want to inspire my niece who I want to encourage her to be in the STEM field as well and be someone who she can look up too. I want to guide and assist when it’s her time to go to college since I know it was hard to get where I’m at. I would also want to leave a physical impact on my community such build and maintain roads, bridges, and dams that will support and make my community better in the long run. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2081,"I think I just fell into this STEM field (Mechanical Engineering) because I didn’t know what else to do. I had been good at math growing up, so I just assumed I was going to end up in some part of STEM. I decided to pick this field because when I started college, all of my friends had majors picked out and knew what they wanted to do in their lives, so I kind of panicked and decided to go into this field. I’m certainly interested by certain concepts in math and physics, especially when I can learn how those concepts can explain the things going on around me in the world. At this point in my life, I really don’t know what specific part of mechanical engineering I want to specialize in, but I hope something piques my interest so I know what I want to do."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2109,"My father is in the stem field, he is a civil engineer and that is where I got the inspiration to pursue a civil engineering major. I think the STEM field has many opportunities and it has a variety of work. The field is interesting compared to other fields since it is flexible. It has always been very interesting to me since I genuinely enjoy knowing more and I normally have a lot of questions about how everything works in life. Studying in the stem field has answered many questions so I believe actually working in the stem field will help me with my curiosity."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2521,"I have recently come to the realization that science is something that resonates with me more than other subjects. This has not always been the case, however. Before entering university, I never cared for anything related to science nor did I even like science in general. During grade school, I was never very fond of it and and ignored it for what it was. I actually hated it largely due to how much it would bore me. Interestingly enough, once I entered university, I developed a strong liking towards mathematics, both pure and applied. I am also starting to think physics is fascinating to me as well, so I chose to declare myself as an applied math major since it is the most relevant major for someone who enjoys mathematics and perhaps physics as well. There was just something so satisfying about finishing a hard problem and ending up getting it correct. I have absolutely no regrets in my decision of pursuing a science path."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3060,"I want to go into the STEM field because I like and enjoy coding. I also enjoy math but programming truly fascinates me. Today, technology is evolving and changing every single day. And technology is in every aspect of our life, we use it multiple times in our life every day. There is no telling how much technology will have evolved in the next 10 or even 5 years, and that is what really excites me. There will be so many new advances in the many different fields of IT technology in the next few decades, and programmers will be essential to advances to human life. The second reason I want to get into STEM/software development is the team collaboration I will be a part of in my future job. I think a lot of people perceive programming as a lonely job, but I think your coworkers and teammates are essential for your project's success. You can't do all of the work by yourself. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3061,"I'm going into the STEM field because I've always had an interest in computers.  Whether they are hardware or software, I've always been interested in knowing the ins and outs of how certain components work.  It's amazing to see how technology grew and now we have a personalized computer in the palms of our hands.  I believe we have a lot more room to grow, not just computer-based but the STEM field as a whole.  "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2113,"WHY? I can make a change and impact.I can explore more about engineering. I can learn more about technology. I can explore my curiosity. I can pursue my passion. I will always have job security and stable money. EXPLANATION! Eventually, the major you pick is an impression of your own advantages, objectives, and interests, so why I picked a significant major that gives me the opportunity to follow my fantasies. A STEM degree can give you the hard abilities you need to get recruited, in addition to the adaptability to adjust and seek after what makes a difference to you most. Chipping away at the forefront of advancement, PC and data research researchers grow new advances and ways to deal with facilitating the field of software engineering. They make new programming dialects, create imaginative apparatuses, or work to tackle existing issues with new strategies. California, Virginia, Maryland, Texas, and Washington have the most elevated centralizations of work for these experts and I cannot wait to be a part of it. Researchers and specialists are, at their centers, issue solvers. Their responsibility is to break down a circumstance, reach a determination, and build up an answer. While mechanization is assuming control over humble positions like information the board and other once-solid vocation ways, robots and programming bundles actually can't top the human mind with regards to basic reasoning. These are abilities that are difficult to instruct, however the interdisciplinary idea of STEM fields implies that you'll have a lot of work on sharpening your basic reasoning capacities. Prior to the coming of Facebook and Twitter, nobody predicted the day that there would be a requirement for analysts to turn their abilities to examining the abundance of information created via web-based media stages. Consistently, new advances make occupations that have never existed. Technology is a universal language. Indeed, the ability to have an effect in the existence of others is one of the significant reasons why people are picking STEM fields for their callings. From making customer air travel quicker, less expensive, and more agreeable to arranging the main missions to Mars, you'll discover moves on from a portion of America's best advanced plane design universities teaming up with material researchers, programming architects, and other STEM experts from everywhere the world. While callings in certain fields don't make an interpretation of well to other people, the abilities you'll master by achieving a STEM degree are quickly appropriate around the world, regardless of whether you don't communicate in the nearby language!."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2090,"I was inspired by the many sci-fi movies and video games that I have experienced over the course of my life and it sparked a bit of curiosity throughout the years. As my curiosity grew I began to question how things worked, like how planes fly or even recently how air fryers work. A few courses will have probably already answered that but the skills I want to acquire are the skill to  restore/fix objects and to create.  I have seen what engineers can do and I want to apply my efforts into bettering our society. My goal is to fall into either the path of a mechanical engineer or aerospace. I found both of these to be familiar but aerospace is really an amazing field that I have recently discovered. To be able to create objects that break the sound barrier or building trains that propel forward with magnetism is all incredible. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3062,"I want to go into the STEM field because its a career path that I have always been interested. Not only is it an interesting career pathway for me, but as a Latinx we are very underrepresented in STEM fields. I think its very important to encourage others like myself to go into a field such as STEM. I began getting interested in tech in high school and since then I   made the decision to stick to it and get a degree in computer science."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3063,"I have always wanted to go into the STEM field growing up mostly because I've always seen STEM as helpful and important in today's society. Everything important that we need in this world mostly came from STEM surrounded ideas. I've always had that inner feeling of wanting to help people. At first I wanted to become a doctor but I later realized it's too much school. Then I wanted to be a nurse, then I realized it's kind of a nasty job. Finally I came to the conclusion of wanting to incorporate med and tech. I want to be able to create advanced medical robotics for those countries who need it. Most countries today can't provide their people in need of medical attention because of the outdated equipment they have. I want to work on getting certain technology to countries in need so they could get the health care they need. I also hope to one day help those in need with coding programs. Some countries aren’t fortunate enough to provide their students with programs like these so it would be nice to help."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2121,"“Why do I want to go into the STEM field?” is the question I have been asking myself all my college years. Is it for the money, is it to prove something, is it for the challenge? I believe it is all of the above and because I’m not sure what else I want to do. I like a challenge and at the beginning I was debating if I should swap a major. I knew that I could fall back to business major if I wanted to, but I told myself that I could push myself and that could do it. Simple as that, I am pursuing a degree in the STEM field for computer engineering because I want to push myself and challenge myself to go through with it and not to give up. I want to do it for my family, and because I want to come out with a degree that will open up brand new opportunities in my life."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3064,"I want to go into the STEM field because it has always been the field that has interested me the most. Out of all the options I had to go into whatever I wanted, I knew that STEM was something that I enjoyed no matter how difficult the subject is. I really dislike writing, and STEM uses a lot of problem solving and equations from what I can see and what I am going in, so it was easily something I knew that would be fine with. STEM is such a hard field to be in and it is extremely difficult, and I knew that going into it. I never challenged myself in the past, and STEM was something that not only was I interested in, but it would challenging my greatly which was something I wanted, even if at times I want to quit. I think in time it will get harder, but I know that computer science, which is what I am in, will always be relevant to our world and will be challenging, but it will always be something I enjoy. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3065,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field is because I think there are so many things yet to be discovered in science and everything in general. I specifically wanted to do computer engineering because I feel like computers will always continue to evolve and anything that is computer hardware or software related. Such as cars going from gas to all electric. Everything is always evolving. I went into the STEM field to expand my knowledge and understand why certain things are the way they are. Another reason why I pursued an education in a STEM field is because science, technology, engineering, and mathematics all interest me in various ways. They also play hand in hand to my understanding so it's always a good idea to get familiar with each aspect of this field."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,1883,"I want to go into the STEM field because I’m very nerdy and I love learning about the world in a formulaic way. I was never very good at Liberal Arts fields like writing and such (even though I have major respect for those in those fields). I don’t know, I’ve always clicked with Math, Science, and similar courses. I’m particularly studying Computer Science which I am loving so far! Coding is extremely fun and I love problem solving. Learning about how one can break any problem down into an algorithm for a computer to solve is extremely interesting to me and often on my free time, I like thinking about tedious things we do every day that could be done more efficiently by a computer program. It’s weird because I’m a women of color so I know I’m going to be the minority in my field of work but hopefully things will get more equal when it comes to representation soon."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3066,"I am the type of person that relates everything to math and logic. Even when I play games, I will force myself to follow some kind of logic and math formulas. Such as build something at the power of 2. Or only build at an even position. The world of math is interesting and also useful to me. So I eventually got into the STEM field. I was studying math only. But during my journey in college, I found another interest: software programming! Programming is like solving math problems, but with a larger scope of everything. Also, it requires me to come up with some complicated logic in order to do the task. That is just a wonderful world with logic and math! Moreover, I think I got into the STEM field because one of my favorite teachers in middle school. She taught me how to learn by treating study as playing games. Every time I am doing a problem, it is just like playing a game, which boosts me to do a lot of study outside the class."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3067,"The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is mainly that I am interested in chemistry. From my childhood to the present day, the only two subjects that interested me is music and chemistry. With the interaction between atoms, and the colorful changes during chemical mixed with each other, I found that chemistry is full of attraction. And I feel better when facing chemistry-related questions comparing with questions from other subjects. That is why I choose to go into the STEM field. And of course, join in chemistry will help me have a better chance of joining the workforce than music, so I choose this path."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3068,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field?  Arslan Alimov  All my childhood I was thinking of becoming a “programmer” ,  I would watch lots of videos about coding and it would excite me to see someone on my screen to write different codes and hack into different systems. I was always excited to grow up and become the “best” computer scientist that there could be on earth. Another reason that I chose my field was because I would always be on computer watching different coding videos and just solving problems sounds pretty interesting to me. The logic behind each of the softwares that is written is pretty interesting and you might want to spend couple of hours understanding what each part of the code means. The coding to me is like a different language which is hard to understand , but if you understand it - it is very powerful. There are also lots of opportunities for people in STEM fields , no matter what skill level you are… it is never too late to learn coding/ programming e.t.c. It also helps you develop logical thinking which is why I chose my field."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3069,"I want to go into the STEM field for a lot of reasons, one being it's the easiest and most accessible way to help people and progress the advancement of humanities needs better like in healthcare, technology and others. I believe that STEM students are necessary for advancements in our society and we are always in need for engineers, doctors and scientists. Another reason is that it pays well and has a lot of job security thus I can be comfortable later in my life when I can find a stable job and income to make it easier to live. I also like the STEM field because all of it is intertwined in some way so there is a lot of flexibility with what you can do with a STEM degree and you can easily change your career between a lot of options. I can say that for my major at least."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3070,"The reason I want to go into the stem field is that I believe I am influenced by others. My uncle and his friends are software engineers. Now, a lot of my friends are also in the stem field. Growing up, I saw my uncle work and go to meetings 24/7. The thought of having too much work was not appealing to me in any way. I know that I have to get a stable source of income if I want to live life leisurely when I retire. Of course, I respected him and wanted to be just like him. Going into CS classes, I realized that programming was pretty fun and interesting. The same can apply to math such as Calculus. It felt fun trying to use my brain to figure out what I had to do in order to get the answer to the problem. And I felt even greater joy when the answer you found is correct."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3071,"I wanted to get into game development and since that wasn't offered as a major at any schools I applied to, Computer Science was the next closest thing. So I ended up picking it as my major since it applies to what I wanted to do, and can have more general purpose use in case I don't end up liking game development (or have complications finding a job). I still don't know if computer science is what I really want to do, but I've spent enough time in college already and I can't afford to start over now even if I wanted to. So I have to stick it out and see how things go."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,159,"Deciding to be an engineer was something that I have always struggled with. Originally I wanted to be a computer scientist/ coder and I kind of wanted to learn how to hack, but after realizing that coding wasn’t for me I drifted apart from that idea because it ended up not working for me. During the summer of 2018, I began to have some interest in being an engineer. During that summer I participated in multiple engineering internships where we learned how to build, design, and create little projects that used Arduino's. That was when I figured out that I wanted to be an engineer. I learned that engineering mostly focussed on problem-solving and creating products and tools to help solve those problems. I have been doing this ever since I was young; building, creating and mapping out ideas of invention models on paper. This aspect of engineering has been in my life at an early age without me even knowing it, and I naturally drifted to that desired discipline subconsciously."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3072,"I have wanted to go into the STEM field since I was very young. Although I didn't necessarily know what I wanted to focus on. I started off by wanting to be a doctor more specifically a pediatrician. Later on, my friend encouraged me to take a summer coding program with her and that was when I got a real interest in programming. When I came to SFSU I went in for the pre-biology program but after 2 semesters I switched to Computer Science. Although I am happy that I have switched I still sometimes think back and wondered if I did the right decision. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3073,"The reason I want to go to STEM field is that my father owns a business and investments in telecommunication in Saudi Arabia and other countries. His company is one of the top companies in the middle east and the company does a lot of big projects like the Riyadh Metro project. Since I was a kid, my father used to take me with him to his office and hang around with him, and since then all that I wanted to do when I grow up is to be an electrical engineer. When I reached high school, I took few training in the company during the summer in the IT department which I really enjoyed. When I started college, I started to work during the summer in the company and I worked in several departments like the telecommunication department and business department. I got the chance to work in several projects. The main aim is to get experience in this field. So once I graduate I want to have the knowledge of engineering field and to work in the company in the future."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2456,"In my own believe there are two types of people in terms of learning, some people get attracted to scientific topics such as the topics that goes into STEM field. But there are some people who get attracted to art and creativity majors, in my case, there are many classes in the scientific fields attracts me so much like biology, engineering and physics. There are many reasons why I decided wanted to go to the STEM field. One of the reasons why I want to assure that I will work on area that offers the workers good payments. Moreover, I'm interested in sportscars and fast vehicle, however the world of motorsport is turning to fully electrical, and as a young students I did not have the chance to work on cars mechanically and now it’s an era of the electrical vehicles so I chose electrical engineering as my field of study."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3074,"The most important thing that I chose the STEM field is that I was really good at it more than good at other areas, such as business, art, philosophy, etc.  When I decided to study abroad in the U.S, I almost took a long time to think about what major I'd like to choose; honestly, everything majors in my ""wish list"" are all the STEM field because the STEM fields like Math, Science and Programming are universal languages ​​that enable teams from around the world to collaborate on challenging problems, allowing individuals to move from project to project. Moreover, I like to learn new things about the STEM field and do research on any questions about numbers, data... I always preferred to answer the question which has exactly answers, which is not like other to areas, you need reflect your own opinion or something. Finally, it's easy to find a job in the bay area if you're in a STEM field, and I really hope to try to train myself to find a job in a country that is my own country."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2118,"I began my route to a STEM field in high school as I strived to learn what an engineer does. As technology has evolved throughout time, engineers and scientists have been adapting to the new ways of programming or planning out new objects that can be essential for society's use. I want to go into transportation engineering, which is a branch of civil engineering, where I am able to plan and construct highways or tunnels such as for trains or vehicles. I just fell in love with this idea because I’ve been so curious to see how civil engineers construct and plan out motorways where they can have a capacity of mass and how the pillars can sustain such weight. The thing that got me really interested in civil engineering was the channel tunnel which is amazing how this tunnel was built underwater and the technology in the 1990s wasn’t as advanced in comparison to the technology we have now."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,144,"I want to go into STEM, and more specifically programming because it is an incredibly interesting field. I feel like programming is both a creative and logical process. Creative in the sense that the way you can solve a given problem is usually incredibly open, which rewards thinking about the problem from different abstract angles. The logical process comes from translating your thoughts and conceptual understanding of a problem back into syntax that is understood by the compiler/interpreter, as well as producing code that is efficient. Programming and math often times feel like a puzzle to me, which is genuinely enjoyable. I would like a job in which I am constantly learning and growing, and again programming is evergreen in that sense. It is a constantly changing field with different paradigms, design patterns and possibility being constantly developed. Finally I feel like the job security as well as compensation is unmatched. The quality of life in the STEM field tends to be solid, I would like a career in which my family and I have more opportunities in life, which STEM careers typically offer."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3075,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field? I don't think I have a remotely passionate answer for this. In my junior year of high school, I had to choose which core subjects I wanted to study for the next two years and the two main options were either Commerce which had Business Studies, Accounting, and Economics, and Science which has Physics, Chemistry, and Maths. I chose science because I enjoyed or tolerated those subjects more than the ones in Commerce. I chose Chemistry as my major because that was my favorite subject. I have now added a second major as Computer Science purely for the job opportunities because I want a financially stable future. So I guess my answer for why I chose STEM is that I like science and I like to think that I am good at it and I want a well-paying job. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2104,"When I was younger I thought I wanted to be an artist and make things like sculptures or paintings, stuff like that. As I got older I got into and experimented with many different art forms (painting, sculpting, traditional art, photography, etc.) and while I enjoyed everything I never stuck with each form consistently. In high school I had the opportunity to work in a maker space and I took an interest in building and manufacturing things. I found that I really enjoy operating machines and working with all the different software. I already knew I liked working with my hands but I never really made things that were functional and that had a purpose. I also found that I had a lot of fun in my physics and chemistry classes. Math also came to me relatively easily. My mind kind of switched from abstract creativity to analytic, creative problem solving. Slowly my career dreams shifted from artist to architect to engineer. I’m not necessarily passionate about mechanical engineering but I know I can do well in this field. Adults around me also played a big part in shifting my interest to more “practical” and “stable” fields. Ultimately, I’m ok with where I ended up (in STEM) but I could have seen my life going well whether I chose STEM or art."
