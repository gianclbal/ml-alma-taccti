2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3058,"What is the governing equation for field strength relative to distance?For a circular magnet with a radius of R and length L, the field Bx at the centerline of the magnet at distance X from the surface can be calculated by the following formula, where Br is the residual induction of the material):"
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3040,"A question for a concept that was covered in class is how are an electric field and electric potential related to work?	From our Electric Potential Lab, we learned that if a charge is moving in a uniform electric field, the work done by the electric field is 𝑊𝐸 = 𝐹 ∙ 𝑟 = 𝑞𝐸 ∙ 𝑟. The direction and movement of the charged particle play a role in determining how much work is done. If the particle moves in the direction perpendicular to the electric field lines, the work done would be zero, because the equation 𝑊 = 𝐹 ∙ ∆𝑟 = 𝐹∆𝑟𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃 = 𝐹∆𝑟𝑐𝑜𝑠90° = 0. If a positively charged particle moves in the same direction as the electric field lines, the work done would be positive.  From the simulation, we placed the charged particle and sensor charge based on the diagram in the lab. We observed how the terms are related to each other. For example, the potential difference between two of the sensor charges does not depend on the path, but rather just the difference in voltage between the two points. Once we understood the relationship between the terms, such a relationship could be written as E = -V/r, where E is the electric field, V is the electric potential, and r is the distance.	This information can be generally applicable to people’s lives and could be used to benefit society, because it can be applied to many electrical appliances. One example is an incandescent light bulb that is turned off. Electric potential energy is just electricity, so it exists wherever that uses electricity. Our daily appliances such as televisions, lights, phones, anything with electricity. For the specific case of the incandescent light bulb, even when it is turned off, there is still energy and electricity flowing through. The electric potential energy is being stored, ready to do work when the light switch is flipped. Thus, electrical energy is often electrical potential energy until some force is applied to make the charged particle do work and convert the energy to kinetic energy."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3070,"A question I used to ask myself before I attended a physics class was “Why do opposite charges attract while similar charges repel?”. I later learned that there is an electric field and the direction of the field is given by the charged source. If it is negative, the field will go towards the charge. Vice versa would happen for a negative charge. By that logic, if 2 like charges are put together. They would end up repelling each other since their forces would be directed against each other which would create a repelling force. An application would be the compass. The compass has a magnetic needle which will react to a magnetic field. Since the Earth has 2 magnetic poles which are the north and south poles, it allows the compass to help a person navigate."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3066,"My question is “how does the use of circuits benefit our life?”So we learn how the charges flow through the simple circuit. But the circuits can be more complicated than what we learn. But since there are some components in the circuit playing a very important role to control the circuit. So the circuits can have a few more properties to be monitored in order to perform some tasks. And based on these tasks, such as switch 0 and 1 (or sometimes we call off and on), scientists build up the complicated task. Then we see different kinds of circuits in our world right now. Anything related to electricity has circuits inside to help control and perform tasks. It is even in the charger! Because it needs to read how strong the voltage/potential difference is and export the corresponding voltage at the output side. But this is not all of the benefits of circuits. The existence of them makes people think we can use them for more complicated tasks, such as mathematical calculation. Then we have some kind of programming language to do those tasks, but also can perform other tasks, such as writing softwares. It gives more and more functionalities just on this circuit, even though a product can have thousands or billions of circuits, but the combination of them eventually benefits us for efficiency on something."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3071,"It was mentioned somewhere that homes were wired in parallel, why is that important?Homes are wired in parallel for several key reasons:If one item connected to the circuit fails, everything else will continue to run and be connected to the circuit, if it had been in series, everything in the house would stop working if one thing was not workingAdding additional items to the circuit does not reduce the effectiveness of anything already plugged in, for example, turning on your lights does not reduce the amount of power going to your microwave, and vice versa.The overall electric current in the circuit increases with each additional item added, and a dangerously high current can be prevented by having a circuit breaker activate and disconnect that circuit before any additional damage is done. The house can be split into several parallel circuits each responsible for powering different portions of the house, and they all follow the same principles described above."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3077,"How does a capacitor work?In a sense, a capacitor is a bit like a battery. Although they work in very different ways, both can store electricity. One of the more important uses of capacitors is in conjunction with inductors to form oscillators. A metal plate attached to the capacitor to the battery's negative pole will absorb electrons produced by the battery. A metal plate attached to the capacitor to the battery's positive pole will release electrons into the battery. After charging, the capacitor has the same voltage as the battery.Sometimes capacitors are used to store electricity so that it can be released at high speed. This is the feature used in the flash. Large lasers also use this technique to achieve a very bright flash of light. Capacitors also eliminate pulsation. If the line carrying DC voltage has pulsations or spikes, capacitors can smooth the voltage by absorbing the peaks and filling the troughs. A capacitor can block direct current. If a smaller capacitor is connected to the battery, no current will pass between the two poles of the battery after the capacitor has been charged (a process that can be done in a fraction of a second when capacitors are small).However, any alternating current (AC) signal can flow through the capacitor unimpeded. The reason for this is that the capacitor constantly charges and discharges as the alternating current fluctuates as if the alternating current were flowing. One of the more important uses of capacitors is in conjunction with inductors to form oscillators."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3076,"How magnetic field work ? The magnetic field exists in the ground and around us. the magnetic field can be around a magnet or a wire carrying a continuous electric current in one direction and known as magnetostatics field. through any running current in blenders, hairdryers or any wire the magnetic field will be generated around. Flowing electrons help compensate electric machines and wiring in our homes, they all produce magnetic fields. magnetic field is the force of magnetism acts on the region surrounding a moving electric charge. as long as magnetic field cannot be seen in real life it might be difficult to understand at first without knowing actual practical experiments for many people. A set of magnetic field lines that follow the direction of the field at each place can be used to see the field. Fortunately, we are able to  use enough information and put it into real life experience of magnets. Magnets are used extensively in modern medicine. it is not only found in compasses that we use to help us travel around and know directions not get lost but also, they're found in devices like the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine and the growing field of magnetic pulse fields, which are utilized to treat Parkinson's disease."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3069,"What are superconductors and how do they work? Superconductors are a type of conductor with metal and compounds that have no resistance and they way they function is that they get under a certain temperature. There are many ways we can utilize superconductors to help people and to mention a few of them, we can use them in bullet trains as bullet trains float using superconducting magnets that eliminate friction and energy loss as they can carry a lot of energy with no heating, thus allowing the train to go at high speeds. We can also use them in medical fields such as MRI scans. Modern MRI scanners use superconducting magnets to scan as they are smaller and more efficient in delivering energy than regular magnets. They are also very useful to use in computer chips as they speed the connection between different computer chips thus making computers more efficient energy and performance wise. They can also be used to make generators and motors and give us a much lighter motor or generator with the same output as a copper wire  but with an increased efficiency of 99% with half the size. I think superconductors could be used in so many things to improve the world from all aspects. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3043,"What are capacitors and how do they work?Before I did the project, I wasn't really sure what capacitors were and now that I know, I know that I didn't know them correctly. I pretty much only knew them in name, and they were important, and something about 2 plates. I had to do some digging around and for the most part, I had to see the animation of electrons moving to be able to understand how it really worked. After that, I did see how it could be used, conceptually. For example, my initial analogy was thinking about using a water dispenser. The dispenser we use at home flips the big bottle upside down and drains down. The thing is that there's a little tank which holds a bit of water so after the bottle is empty, it could fill 3-4 more 500mL bottles. This was probably the better example to use, but personally I'm not the best at essay writing/stuff like that, and I needed something to be more of a hook and drawn interest. I went for Hercules and greek mythology that had a very similar water usage concept, but was not as clear as the water dispenser. But I think with a more interesting topic, it would be easier to learn for some people."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3041,"Topic: electrical potentialHow can we conceptualize electric potential, especially in relation to current and resistance? I find electric potential confusing, namely because it reminds me of potential energy. By definition, an electric field (a vector) is equal to the negative of the change in potential (a scalar). Thus the potential difference between two points in a field is the negative of the line integral of the electric field between those two points. Usually one of the points, the reference point, is decided to be infinity. Potential is useful because it helps us answer the question: how much work has to be done in order to move a charge from point a to point b? So, the potential difference between two points is equal to the work per unit charge needed to move a charge from one point to the other. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3059,"I remember being very confused about Gauss's Law and flux in general. Now, having heard about Current, I question how the relationship between the two can help me better understand how Gauss's Law and Flux affect Current and circuitry, since I believe both are quantities describing charge going through something.I remember Flux being described as being proportional to the amount of field lines going through a surface area. Mathematically it was defined as an integral of electric fields over every small bit of area and can also be defined as charge over permittivity. Current on the other hand was described as the ratio between the amount of charge that passes through a certain amount of time. Looking at the later parts of Chapter 23, they seem to be using pictures that look closer and closer to circuitry components used in later chapters. The idea of a constant electric field and infinite planes of charge become important for the later concepts of equipotential and the construction of wiring."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3061,"The concept of short circuit I believe is an important topic that everyone should at least briefly understand.  In elementary school or middle school, we probably learned how to light up a small lightbulb with a small battery and some tin foils.  This teaches us how to induce electricity to electronics we'd like to turn on.  As adults, we can still apply this concept to our homes and cars.  Short circuit happens often in homes and cars because (one of the many possible reasons) too much electricity is flowing in the circuit and the system opened the circuit to prevent explosions.  What if the system didn't open the circuit?  Then it's up to us to have an understanding of the Ohm's law and how much voltage is being fed to the circuit.  We need to understand the electronics we use and make sure not to overload the system and have a possible explosion."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3067,"For the short circuit lab we did last week, the simple concept is using one more wire that is parallel connecting with the original circuit, and the enhanced current will cause the added wire to overload and break. My question is, if the short circuit is dangerous, why it could be used in daily life as a tool instead of a desaster? Well, the unintentional short circuit will be causing burnout, but the intentional short circuit is controllable and we can use the concept of the short circuit to do something useful, such as the circuit breaker, which is a device that could help to protect the main circuit that is overloaded by connecting too many high power appliances"
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3044,"A question I have regarding Electric Fields is how does electric field lines look around a point of charge? Well when we did our lab for this week we were able to visualize it by using a simulation, we got to put one positive point and see the electric fields react to it. Then we did the same thing with a negative point. Another way to be able to visualize Electric fields patters is by being able to look at electric field lines. Lines begin on positive and end on negative. When it comes to the line density it is proportional to the strength of the field, when line close together it means that E is stronger and when they are further apart it means that E is weaker. There are definitely electric fields everywhere. The lines can not cross. One way to also be able to visualize electric fields is with field vectors. When it comes to the direction of the E-field is out of a positive charge and into a negative charge. We use arrows to represent the direction of the E-field and the length of the vector represent the strength. We also got to use the simulation to test these regarding how close or how far the point was as well if it was a positive or negative charge, this would determine how it would react."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,144,"I think the super conductors are an incredibly fascinating concept that we briefly touched on, I had thought that they ability to move objects with zero resistance would provide a way to build trains that ride on superconductor rails, although that was quickly dispelled when we had talked about the energy required to keep a super conductor below its critical temperature. Critical temperature is the temperature at which the material exabits properties of a super conductor, that is 0 electrical resistance. I still believe that super conductors could potentially have some amazing utility. I think super conductors could be used in computing to speed up the current running through the logic gates and moving bits. This would not only increase a processors throughput but the 0 electrical resistance would greatly reduce the production of heat and energy consumption. Introducing a mechanism that would greatly reduce heat and energy consumption alone would be an incredible feat for the future of computing."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2104,"What are parallel and series combinations?Parallel and series refers to how components in electric circuits are combined/connected together. Essentially, components (of the same kind) connected in a series are connected to each other in a way that the current goes through both objects. Components in a parallel are connected in a way that the current hits a junction and flows through one or another component. An example of a series connection in everyday life is Christmas lights. In Christmas lights the light bulbs are connected in a long chain and the current passes through all of them in one loop. If one of the light bulbs go out/breaks then none of the other light bulbs will light up because the current cannot pass through the broken bulb and thus the circuit is open. An example of a parallel  combination is car headlights. When one of the headlights goes out the other will still function because both lights have individual loops so the flow if the current is independent from the functionality of all the lights. In general the more components/obstacles added to a series circuit, the more the current will decrease. The more components/obstacles added to a parallel circuit (more loops), the more the current will increase."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3052,"what is Current ? we learned in class in chapter 26 that Current is the rate at which charge flows through a surface  and that if change in Q is the amount of charge that passes through a time in a surface then the average current would be equal to  I = change in Q divided by the change in time what then is Resistance ? , also in chapter 26 we learned that the resistance of a conductor is a property of a conductor at a certain temp. and measures or shows the level of opposition of that material to the flow if electricity  R is Measured by dividing change in voltage the current Does conductivity and resistivity depend on the strength of an electric field - the answer is no conductivity and resistivity do not depend on the strength of an electric field which is the characteristic of a conductor.what are superconductors? super conductors are materials whose resistance decreases to zero when are get below a certain temperature How do you define power and what is the formula for power ? power is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit. its formula is P = I times change in voltage. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3056,"From the past few weeks, I chose the topic of electric fields, and the question I want to ask is ""How do electric fields represent the charge of any object?"" From my notes, I remember that electric fields are fields which surround electrically-charged objects that can extend infinitely in space. The form of an electric field depends on the charge of an object; for example, if an object contains positively charged protons, the electric field extends outwards in infinitely many directions, and if another object contains negatively charged electrons, the field points inwards to the object. If the charge of an object changes, then the direction of the electric field changes as well; its magnitude is not affected by this.Electric fields help people gain an intuitive sense of electric charges in objects, and how they attract or repel each other. It can also represent the dichotomy of extroversion and introversion. In society, we typically perceive extroverts, people who are outgoing and energized by social interactions, as a positive trait, while introverts, people who are more withdrawn and prefer less social interactions, are seen in an (unfair) negative light. Like positively charged objects extend outwards, extroverts extend their social status to larger groups of people, while introverts are more attuned to their own personal feelings and ideals, focusing their energy inward like a negatively charged object."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3072,"Subject Current and Resistance: In this section, we focused on solving for resistance, and charge. In the beginning, I didn't really understand. As there was more explanation and diagrams of the problem it became easier to understand what was happing. Current and Resistance, I think are an important subjects. Mostly because in our everyday life we use electricity where current and resistance are at play. For example in a homework assignment that made me think and understand better was question 15. Which states that a popcorn popper is rated at 1.11kW when connected to a 120 V source. What current does the popcorn carry? What is its resistance? To calculate the current we used the following formula I = P/V which gives us 9.25A. Then using the formula P =(v^2)/R we can make it equal to R leading us to this formula R = (v^2)/P and getting 12.97Ω.In the current age we are today people are relying on electronic technology and to be able to improve our way of life. Therefore the subject of current and resistance is important."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2113,"So far we have been learning about a lot of things. These topics are anywhere from Electric Fields, Electric Potential, Currents, Resistance, and to different physics laws. Many things always come up in physics and these topics are always used in everyday life. For example, the main topic that can be used in everyday life that we have already gone over would be statics. When you are doing your laundry you can feel the static electricity on the clothes or when you want to hang a balloon on the wall, you can rub it on your socks or your head and it will stick to the wall. You can dig deeper into physics and it is very easy to be able to find how physics can be used in our everyday lives. Not only does physics relate back to real life situations but in more diverse ways. The different laws explain to us how each topic and segment of physics is used and how it interests into life itself. We have different charges and from those charges cause other charges and it all starts from small charges and protons and neutrons altogether. Physics is a very fascinating topic and it will be easy to catch on once you get the hang of it. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3063,"So far we have been finding out about a great deal of things. These themes are anyplace from Electric Fields, Electric Potential, Currents, Resistance, and to various material science laws. Numerous things consistently come up in material science and these themes are constantly utilized in regular day to day existence. For instance, the primary theme that can be utilized in regular daily existence that we have effectively gone over would be statics. At the point when you are doing your clothing you can feel the friction based electricity on the garments or when you need to drape an inflatable on the divider, you can rub it on your socks or your head and it will adhere to the divider. You can delve further into physical science and it is extremely simple to have the option to discover how physical science can be utilized in our regular day to day existences. In addition to the fact that physics relates back to genuine circumstances in more assorted manners. The various laws disclose to us how every point and section of material science is utilized and how it interests into life itself. We have various charges and from those charges cause different charges and everything begins from little charges and protons and neutrons inside and out. Physical science is an exceptionally captivating point and it will be not difficult to get on once you get its hang. A concept that was covered in class was the way a cyclotron works. I watched a video to get a better understanding of it. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2521,"One topic I want to focus on that was covered in past few weeks was Ohm's Law. Formulaically, I understand the definition of Ohm's Law as it is just the voltage is equal to the current multiplied by the resistance. However, a question I would create would ask, how would you define Ohm's Law from a conceptual point of view? I would respond to this with saying that Ohm's law states that the current would increase through the circuit as the potential difference increases and if there's more resistance, then the current would decrease proportionally. Ohm's Law helps us observe how electricity operates within a closed circuit, as well as help us analyze how the electric current's behavior plays a role in the circuit's structure as a whole. This could be useful when modifying or troubleshooting an already built circuit, or building one entirely from scratch. It's useful in that having the knowledge regarding the correlation between voltage, current, and resistance will aid you in figuring out how the components of the circuit work."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,145,Electric fields was a concept we learned. In this lab we learned that opposite attract while same signs repel. This can help us in our everyday life since a lot magnets are in electronics and so are negative and positives such as electrons and protons. Magnets are a great example of opposites attract. Magnets in electric generators turn mechanical energy into electricity which is why we need to know how magnets work. If something is done incorrectly it can cause a problem. The problem can make the machine not work or even worse it can make the machine overload since the energy is not placed correctly. 
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3057,"What are charges and what is it used for? Well, electric charges contain two types of charges, positive and negative. When two charges that are the same interact with each other, they repel each other. On the other hand, when two charges are opposite from one another, they attract each other. With electric charges, we would create an electric field where will create a field with vectors and have which have multiple properties depending on the situation. With the positive charge in an electric field, the vector arrows point away from the charge however if it were to be a negative charge the vector arrows point toward the negative charge. Also, the vector is greater when it is close to the charge. With these changes, we can talk about the magnetic fields which are due to moving electric charges. With magnetic fields, we are able to create different types of device such as motors and generators that use magnetic fields."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3042,"Can a short circuit cause a fire? A short circuit is a low resistance connection between two conductors that provide electrical power to a circuit. This can happen when there is an excessive amount of current flow in the power source through the short. Short circuits are dangerous especially in power sources with high voltage because it can release a lot of heat energy. The excessive amount of heat can build up in the wire and it can cause sparks or combustion. If this is close to flammable objects it could cause a fire if not properly extinguished. It is important to understand what can cause short circuits and how to prevent them. This information can be applied to everyday situations because many home appliances can have a short circuit and being aware of what causes it can help prevent a house fire. For example, space heaters, extension cord, electrical outlet, cables, and more."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2118,What is the average current? Electric current?Average current is the amount of charge that passes through the surface in a certain time interval. The average current is equal to the charge that passes per unit time. The average current is zero in AC circuits. Current is where the charge passes by a certain point on the circuit. The electric current is where the charge passes through a cross-section in the conductor in a time interval of time. The unit for current is amper where one amper is equal to one Coulomb per second. 
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3053,Originally I didn't understand how electric flux worked. If I recall correctly it's how much the electric field flows through a given area. Φ = EAcos(Θ) is the electric flux formula. The electric field can be broken up into infinitely small pieces and each piece treated as a point charge. The electric field may not be uniform so the formula only works for small areas. Gauss's law states the charge in an enclosed area divided by the amount of charge the material lets through is the same as the total electric flux let out of the area. The relationship between the net electric flux through a closed surface and the charge enclosed by the surface is Gauss’s law. To choose a gaussian surface to take advantage of the symmetry of charge distribution so E can be removed from the surface integral at least one of the following must be satisfied
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3046,"At the beginning of this class we all learn about the electric charge, and the electric field, in that moment I just feel so confused; How would those things affect our life? I know the field force is here, but they are invisible, and I have never seen them in my life. After a week of study, I understand the basic concept of the electric charge and how the electric fieldwork. In my understanding, electric charge is a very tiny material in the region space, they could repel and attract each other so they could create a strong force when the amount of them gathering together, and that is what we side the field force. But still, I have no idea how would it be used daily; Until we learned how would the electric field collaborates with the magnetic field, and how we transform the field forced to torque. As we learned, a charged coil could act as a magnet, and compare with the permanent magnet the electric magnet is highly controllable. So people wound multiple coils on a shaft and put magnets on both sides, when we electrify the coil, the field force will interact with the magnet on the side and rotate the shaft; That is how the electric motor works. Compared with the traditional ones, the electric motors are quieter and more powerful due to the smaller frictional area, and it is wild use in the living space, for example, washing machines and electric fans. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3068,"The concept that I chose is short Circuit... We talked about the circuits and shortage within them... The question that I had is why would a circuit burn out if its connected end to end to another one. Then when we did the lab and connected batteries and closed the circuit the foil burned out because it was too thin and could not withhold the energy and therefore the shortage occurred. This information might be helpful to people when they build houses, build pc's or just simply connecting electricity to the technology... you should never give an energy the cable that will not hold the energy that is passing through it. It is very useful context which helped me understand the electricity more in depth. I also feel like in everyday life the electricity is super important since none of us can live without phones, computers,tablets especially during this pandemic we need electricity... There are times when people need to connect the cables in their PC's and sometimes the shortage occurs because the flow of the current was greater than what the cable could hold leading to burned out cable or burned out technology."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2456,"we've been going through many of electrical physics concepts, one lab concept that I find amazingly is the electric circuit that we did last week for many reasons, it explains a lot of the things around us like the electricity and light bulbs on our homes, like why sometimes in traffic lights when one light broke all of rest broke, but in Christmas light if one light or more in the chain broke the rest will keep on working normally? getting to know the electric circuit arounds us is extremely beneficial for the society"
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3048,"What makes an RC Circuit? - An RC circuit is a circuit containing a series combination of a resistor and a capacitor. When a capacitor is charged, charges do not jump across the capacitor plates because the gap between the plates represents an open circuit. Instead, the charge is transferred between each plate and its connecting wires due to the electric field established in the wires by the battery until the capacitor is fully charged. As the plates are being charged, the potential difference across the capacitor increases. The value of the maximum charge depends on the voltage of the battery. When the maximum charge is reached, the current in the circuit is zero because the potential difference across the capacitor matches that supplied by the battery. When you discharge a capacitor, the capacitor begins to discharge through the resistor. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3075,Is it safe to touch the terminals of a high-voltage capacitor even after the voltage source that charged the capacitor is disconnected from the capacitor?NO. It is extremely dangerous because the capacitor is still holding the charge received from the battery. If we were to touch our fingers would act as a pathway for electric discharge shocking and harming us. I feel like this information would be beneficial or generally applicable to people's lives as it can help them and people around them be safe in case they are in a situation where they need to handle a possibly charged capacitor. They can ground it or short circuit the capacitor to remove the residual charge.
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3047,"Why do resistors in parallel make a smaller Req than resistors in series?Since there are 2 paths that the current can take (one through each resistor) it is easier for the current to flow. Because it is easier for the current to flow the resistors are applying less resistance overall since the current has become more easily moving. In series the current must all pass through one resistor without any other path to take. Then  after passing through that resistor the current must then pass through another resistor which slows it down even further. This is making a bigger resistance than the parallel resistors because all of the current must pass through both resistors without any way to make the current flow easier. In parallel, there are 2 paths, like 2 lanes on a highway vs one, so the current flows easier and increases. By Ohm's law, V=IR and V is constant so when the current increases the resistance must decrease to keep the same V. This is somewhat hard to picture but I think thinking about it like an extra lane for traffic and then using that concept and relating it to Ohm's law helps to show the reason why parallel resisters would decrease the resistance and in series would increase it. Series would be something like a stop sign and then another stop sign in the movement of the cars versus parallel being adding an extra way through the stop sign for half the cars to take instead."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3055,"Why is current so important, when we know the voltage?I first thought that when looking at electric charge we really only needed to consider  the difference in charge and that the current was somewhat secondary as it only defines the rate at which the charge changes over time. Most appliances are denoted by their voltage of 120 volts, at least in America. When we see electrical warning signs it says high voltage. We know that we need power adapters to change from 220V etc. to 120V if we travel abroad. I never fully appreciated what current was, but I think that learning about the resistance and ohm's law helps to contextualize the need to consider current as an integral part of the electric power system. When we examine resistance we see that the voltage is directly tied to the current and resistance. And when we look at Power we see it is not tied to Voltage but the Current and Resistance. So I realize now that Current is just as important if not more important than voltage. Current shows how the energy flows through the circuit and can accurately show how energy navigates a circuit and how the balance of energy flow is maintained when running. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3051,"Why do we care about circuits? I think circuits are one of the most important concepts to understand because our society is constantly evolving around technology such as our phones and computers, that use circuits in order for them to work. Obviously, it becomes more and more complex for a better version of technology, but understanding the basics and what it takes for something that we use daily is important. We talk about the flow of electrons or the current. I bet a lot of people don't know how electricity actually works and instead just think ""oh, lightbulb turn on"". We forget why our devices aren't water proof as water is conductive, creating short circuits. We don't realize what we are doing to our devices is actually ruining them. Another, example of magnetic and electric fields is when we get a keycard to a hotel. If we put the keycard next to our phone it changes the electric/magnetic fields on the card making the card dysfunctional. Physics is around us every day and we don't realize how much we take it for granted until we fully learn about it. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3049,"So I really like chapter 22 - Electric force. One question in it would be why is it important. I think electric force is important because without it you wouldn't have anything. Anyways, since this is like 200-300 words I will just write something. Well one thing is that there are cockroaches in my house. And the cockroaches are like everywhere so yesterday I was sleeping outside. In my backyard and when I was sleeping in my backyard, a racoon, a huge racoon, whose eyes where glowing was I saw him and he saw me and I ran for my life. and hide behind a stool. And the racoon came and slept on my bed and I was like ""hai ram."" So the next day I told this story to my parents, and siblings and finally they called a guy who would help to spray the cockroaches. Ok and then for tomorrow everyone is like cleaning the house and taking the things out so that the guy can easily spray gas. I am sooooo thank ful for the guy who is gonna spray the cockroaches. Its not like I hate any animals, insects or anyone. I wouldn't mind if a cockroach would just come and stay but they keep on multiplying and multiplying so they are making it hard for me to live thus this cockroach killing is going to happen. I do feel a little bad because the cockroaches also have family but if one family wants to stay they can but not the whole family reproduction thing. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3045,"A question that comes to my mind directly after learning about forces and acceleration is that how does gravity affect our daily lives? This topic is related to our mass, yet it is interesting enough to see that gravity helps us do many things. Being able to put our laptop on a table, sitting down on a chair, and sleeping on the bed without flying in the air is all due to gravity, since its gravitational force dragged us towards the near center of earth. Secondly, having gravitational accelerations also benefits us from being away with a certain distance from the sun, making the environment easy to live in, without experiencing extreme temperatures. We will not be able to breath fresh air since the atmosphere has already filed away. Our human body also requires gravity to live, since our muscles and different body parts also depend on gravity. I cannot imagine how normal lives will go without gravity, as humans will start to die, and our earth will become another mystery outer planet since humans can no longer live on Earth. Humans will not exist also, since as humans started to die, there are no more humans left on the planet."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3064,"The concept that stood out to me that I found is applicable to people's lives and benefit others is on electric fields. This field is a field that surrounds electrically charged particles and exerts force on all the charges that are on this field. The force can be attracting these particles or repelling them. There are so many common items that we use in our everyday life that involve electric fields, such as touch pads or friction. An example could be with a balloon on carpet or rubbing your feet with socks on on a carpet. You create friction and the positive and negative charges on the field are being moved around from one object to another. In our electric field lab, we used simulations that mimicked these situations, and were able to predict what charges go where in these situations. This is a simple thing that most people have interaction with that we don't realize includes electric fields."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2121,"During week’s 3 and 4 we continued the discussion of electricity and voltages and circuits. From the lab that week one major conclusion is that is that we would have a higher potential difference when we connect batteries in series rather than in parallel. During our lab we used created an electric circuit using 3 1.5V AA batteries and some aluminum foil, and we arranged the batteries in series to create a high enough potential difference to melt a small piece of the aluminum. We can apply this principle to many household items and appliances. Many house appliances work on an electric circuit, and we can conclude that it relates a lot to fuses in our houses' fuse wires, because the wires in the fuses are selected in a way which holds just enough. If the amount of potential energy is larger than what the wire can hold it will cause a combustion - protecting our system/technology from having lots of damage. We also talked about potential difference and During our lab we used a simulation to to build models between two charges, knowing the distance between a +1 nC charge and two other charges, we were able to calculate the voltage and potential difference."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2126,"A concept that we went over is circuit. For example, what is a circuit? What are the different types of circuit and what do they consist of? A circuit is a closed loop of wire where electrons can travel. This will be in the form of current which can supply households, businesses, etc. There is a direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) circuit. A direct current is where the current flows in one direction. An alternating current is where the current changes direction periodically. A circuit can have a resistor, capacitor, inductor, and a battery. It also doesn’t have to be one of each, but it could be multiple batteries and/or resistors. A circuit is very helpful in our world because that is how we can connect with our world. When we connect the tv and the WI-FI to the source in the wall we are able to see the news and check our social medias. Additionally, it’s a necessity in order to survive. Literally today in the morning I didn’t have electricity, and I was asking myself how I am going to join my class now. I had to bring the flashlight to use the bathroom. Luckily the power came back 10 minutes before the class started. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3073,"Circuit breakers and Fuses in Electrical WiringsThis is our daily life experience when each new light is turned on, it makes all the lights in the house dimmer. What will happen when we switch ON all the lights and all the appliances at the same time? How circuit breakers and fuses protect us from a partial or complete breakdown? Electrical wirings are designed in a smart way, such that in case of any malfunctioned electrical appliance is switched on, immediately a circuit breaker or a fuse comes into action and disconnects the electric supply partially or completely depending upon the design of wirings. Partial breakdown makes us understand that wiring was designed into sections for different rooms/kitchens etc., which are completely isolated from one another and are controlled by their respective circuit breakers or fuses. So, in case there is any electric disorder in a section, it will be disconnected automatically from the rest of the home to keep the rest safe and functioning. The study of series and parallel circuits helps us to understand that how the electrical wirings should be designed and where to put the circuit breakers. In series circuits, there is only one path for the current to flow and which passes through all the connected components. So, when any of the components within a series circuit is broken down or switched off, it will disconnect the rest of the components from the power source and let them stop working. So, this is not wise to install such a setup at our home wirings. To avoid the disconnectivity of the other components from the power source, they are connected in parallel, providing current the multiple paths, so if one component is not working, the current can pass through the others and keep the devices connected and functioning. But at the same time when they are running parallel to each other, they all are consuming electrical energy, which may result in a heavy flow of current which when crosses the limit can damage the electric wirings. This discussion suggests putting the circuit breakers or fuses in series, so in case of the heavy flow of current for any reason, they will trip and keep the rest of the components safe. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,597,"Learning about currents is a important concept to learn. And that is because anybody who have running electricity would need to learn about this concept, which currents run through out our households. And learning about currents have helped developed technology that we can’t imagine living without today. It’s also important to know about currents in case the electricity in your home goes out because it could mean there’s too many things plugged in for the current flow. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3054,"When I reflect back on this summer class, I think the thing that was most intriguing was the difference between batteries in parallel vs in series.  One question that I had was does putting batteries in series decrease the life span of those batteries? This may be a silly question because the voltage is higher, so theoretically it should at least have a harder strain on the batteries which would decrease the lifespan.  But a part of me is wondering if this system works like an accelerator where a large voltage is output at little expense, the only strain being on the wires and batteries.  As I do some google searching that part of me wondering of no expense at higher voltage seems really silly now.  Obviously at a higher voltage the battery life would decrease.  It's interesting, this website says it actually is significantly more costly to use batteries in series and the ratio isn't exactly 1 for 1.  This is why companies don't just add batteries in series whenever they need higher voltage and instead they use bigger batteries.  Very very cool!  "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,189,"The use of circuits in my honest opinion can be used to help people understand certain things happening within their homes. I don't want to come of as a dunce when I say this, however it isn't until recently from this previous lab that we  completed where I started to understand the mechanisms of the electrical circuits around my house. The last lab specifically highlighted a moment of reflection where we were supposed to answer why some  fuse boxes seem to shut off. In a parallel circuit, in order to protect an element, the fuse will shut off by opening the whole circuit. In a way, this can help me especially because my fuse always seems trip out. I never knew this was a self protecting mechanism from the fuse box. In a way, this is kind of genius, if my understanding is correct. From this observation one can conclude that by connecting the fuse again, the problem can be resoled easily. I always saw my dad tinkering with the fuse box every time it would shut off. I always thought we was performing some complex mechanism in order to make the fuse work again. Meanwhile he was switching it from on to off again after the circuit decided to open, lol so helpful yet anti-climatic."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3074,"After studying the sixth chapter of the physics book, we have learned the concept of Newton's third theorem. Every force will have an equal and opposite reaction force. When I was learning the concepts in the book and completing the practice assignments, I was attracted to a question. The question is: ""A person is in the elevator and standing on the scale, calculate the person's weight by using the weight displayed on the scale when the elevator starts to move upwards and the weight displayed on the scale after the elevator stops."" I think this is A very interesting experimental question. Because as far as we know, the weight displayed on the scale when the elevator rises must be heavier than usual. But why? After drawing a picture, I found that when the elevator is ascending, the weight displayed on the scale is the sum of the weight plus the gravity mg. When the elevator is stopped, the weight displayed on the scale is the difference of the weight minus the gravity mg. So we can add the two weights and divide them by two to get the weight of the person we want.This is really a topic that interests me very much, and it makes me more familiar with the concepts in the book!"
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3060,"I would like to talk about the concept of Ohm's Law. My question is when will the current in a conductor be proportional to the voltage in that conductor? Well, Ohm's Law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. Given Ohm's Law, we can calculate the voltage in a conductor by the formula: V = IR [I = Current; R = Resistance]. This Ohm's Law principle has a lot of everyday uses and applications and can be found in a lot of everyday electronics. First of all, the speed of fans can be controlled by moving the regulator. So, the current flowing through the fan is controlled by regulating the resistance through the regulator. Secondly, Ohm's Law is also used in electric heaters. These heaters have a metal coil that has a high resistance that permits a certain amount of current to flow through them to provide the required heat. And lastly, mobile and laptop chargers use Ohm's Law for their basic functionality. Mobile and Laptop chargers use DC power supply in the operation. DC power supply provides a variable output voltage based on the resistance and the overall working is controlled by Ohm’s law."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2109,"Recently we learned about electric power and it was also my project topic. It was fun to know all about how important electric power is in our life. I learned about how electric bill is calculated and that was a fun experience. Electric power is the rate, per unit time, at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second. Electric power is something that is used in almost everything that we do in our lives. Starting from bulbs to heating our water everything needs electric power. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2090,"The topic on magnetic fields is one I found very important in our daily lives. We may not notice it but the applications of magnetism are vast one example would be in our very own computers. How? The hard drives in our system use magnetism to store data on a rotating disk. Another example that is very useful is its magnetic force, there are cranes that use huge magnets to lift heavy metal objects off the ground without the need of a hook. The most obvious would be navigation, in this case a compass. Compasses point towards the north geographical pole which helps gives us sense of direction when navigating in a region where our cellular devices are impossible to us. Lastly, something I find really amazing would be transportation. Using its properties we can actually levitate objects, the vehicle I am referring to is the Mag Lev train, the magnetic force propels the object forward at high speeds which is really amazing. "
