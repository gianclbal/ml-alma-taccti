2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,597,"This class taught me a lot about the world around me and how phenomenons happen constantly without us realizing, and it was great to explore even more and learn how things work. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3077,"I have been exposed to many new knowledge points related to electromagnetic waves in this course, which has benefited me a lot. I'm very interested in this, for example, Maxwell's equations. The electromagnetic theory, with Maxwell's equations at its core, is one of the proudest achievements of classical physics. The perfect unity of electromagnetic interactions it revealed established the belief among physicists that the various interactions of matter should be unified at a higher level. This theory is widely applied in the field of technology. Electromagnetic wave is an oscillating particle wave derived and emitted in space by the same and mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields. It is an electromagnetic field propagating in the form of wave and particle duality. After all, the knowledge we learn in the classroom is limited. During this period, it is more about cultivating our learning ability and thinking mode. More knowledge also needs us to explore in extracurricular time to enrich themselves."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3057,"My greatest takeaway from this class is a lot of information regarding circuits. This includes the current and voltage in these circuits. It also includes the types of circuits such as parallel and in series. There are also many different ways to build circuits such as adding a resistor or having a switch that opens or closes the circuit. All of these are very essential for me in the future because my major is a mix of electrical and computer engineering. There are other important laws that I learned but I honestly might not have them embedded into my head for now. I was also able to learn calculations for many types of problems which will also help me for future calculations. At the end of the day though, I was proud to take this class because there was a lot of work that needed to be done but it was not that stressful because of no quizzes or tests."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,159,"This class was very informative and fun while it lasted, but I wish it were in person because I learn better that way. After taking this class I would say my greatest takeaway from it would be all the lab interfaces and how important it was for my understanding of these physics topics, without I would definitely be doomed because I need some hands-on or visual representation to help me learn. I would also say that the lab for week 5 was my favorite and really showed me why I liked physics because it was simple to understand and you could use common sense to solve most of the problems. Lastly, another takeaway I had for this year, in general, is that it's good to plan out your assignments for the week so that you stay on top of it otherwise the work will start to pile up, and then things will start to get harder."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2121,"The greatest take away from this class has to be from week 7 where we learned how a generator works by using electromagnetic induction. We saw that “a stream of water turns a wheel with a magnet causing the magnet to spin. Nearby, a lightbulb attached to a coil of wire lights up.” During our lab we used a simulation to observe a generator and how it works. We see Faraday's law in motion when the magnet moves close to the coil. This follows faraday’s law which states “a current is produced in a conductor when it is moved through a magnetic field“. Lenz’s law is stated as “the induced current in a loop is in the direction that creates a magnetic field that opposes the change in magnetic flux through the area enclosed by the loop.” and we see this when we look at the compass in the simulation that changes according to this principle."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3060,"My greatest takeaway from this class is being comfortable and open to working with teammates. In the first few weeks, I was super against working with other people and hated it. I felt like I would learn better by myself and so I did all of the lab explorations by myself in the first week. But then I had some troubles and a few questions that I didn’t know and couldn’t figure out. So asking my teammates helped me be more comfortable with communicating with my teammates. And I was finally more comfortable with working on the labs with them because they helped me more than I could do by myself. I didn’t think teamwork would be the biggest takeaway from this class for me, but it is and I’m pretty happy about that since I am very introverted and never liked group work. I’m glad we got to experience working with teammates online especially now because of the pandemic. I think doing the labs by ourselves wouldn’t have been beneficial and it is good that we can communicate with at least a few students in our school lives. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3069,I think my greatest takeaway from this class is just overall scientific critical thinking and skills and taking the time to analyze and understand the situation at hand before doing anything. I also learned that time management is really helpful and critical in the process of being a STEM major and its a skill that all student must acquire to have a better educational journey. I think this class will help me a lot in my career as a future software engineer as it taught me how electric and magnetic fields interact with everyday life and how they work within circuits of the devices I use everyday. I took away a lot from this class and I think will definitely be coming back to this information very soon and I'm grateful that this is a requirement for my major or else I would never had the opportunity to learn what I learned this summer and the past spring.
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3076,"There are many big things that would be considered as takeaway from this class for me. I have learned many things through each lab and lecture. During lab sessions, I really think that the simulation programs or websites are practically somewhat similar to the real life experiment or sometimes even much more beneficial when I can try things that might not be a safety in the experiment. In each lab through doing the simulations I have seen the real life experiments done in each lab that has a simulation. The sage math work was more useful than ever thought it would be at first. It has many of easier ways to get problems simplified and not get lost. Sage math work was really helpful for me, and it will be so. During other experiments that we used simple things at that can be found at our homes were simple enough to get the idea and still have it forever at home. Overall, I have had a great learning experience through each part of each lab that has something I never seen and done before."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3072,"My greatest takeaway from this class was when in the lab when we work as a group. This was both when we were made to complete a task in a small group and when we worked as a whole class. I haven't worked in a group in a while and working with others this semester has been fun. Sometimes some groups we worked more individually and asked questions to each other. In other groups, we all work on the assignment at the same time which made it easier to complete the assignment but this let other members not know what they didn't understand when they weren't given the opportunity to attempt the question.  I personally will remember the topic about circuits. I had a lot of fun when we first began to learn about circuits especially when we went over parallel and series.     "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3043,"I would say my greatest takeaway from this class is properly learning how electrons actually move. I'm still working on solidifying my understanding into magnetism, but I think for electric fields and electrons I am doing better in that. Kind of ironic that my major is computer engineer, but back in I think 10th grade year, that in physics, the circuitry unit was actually my poorest subject. And I have improved that over the years, but this class really solidified my understanding in which I am much more confident in explaining it. Magnetic fields, I still need some time to properly digest it all down, but it probably isn't that far away, than the level my understanding about electric fields is at. But yeah I can see myself improving my conceptual understanding of electricity and magnetism in the future, and I think this class helped me much in trying to achieve that."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3074,"The biggest gain for me from this physics class is that it not only allows me to review and consolidate the knowledge I have learned but also allows me to deepen and understand more knowledge of physics theory. At the same time, I really lab the true lab experience which needs us to prepared some items to do the real lab work. Even we just do the lab work by ourselves due to the pandemic, I still feel it real lab experience is so important for us to know and understand the physics knowledge clearly. Another thing that I learned in class is that I need to focus on doing every little thing. I usually cut corners on the completion of the homework because the homework is too simple or because I don't want to take too much time to complete it. But often after this, I will get a score that does not satisfy me, and these scores add up enough to make my overall score drop. Because I really hope that I can get a satisfactory result in this physics experiment class, I start to take every homework and the content of the class seriously. To be honest, this still has a good effect on my grade when I was trying to study hard for the homework!"
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3065,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that it is important to understand the small concepts and trying to tie them together as a whole and seeing connections. Another thing that I have to take away from this class is comparing these concepts to things in real life and how they are used, and trying to connect that to the physics of things. Another important thing for me was learning how to balance my classes and work out, especially for this class because I could not attend the zoom meetings and had to rely on outside resources and try to gain a better understanding of the topic whether its the homework or the e-book. My understanding of all the topics may not be any better than most of my fellow classmates due to new work and other circumstances, but I have learned through this class that I need to balance things out in order to succeed. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3049,"My greatest take away from this class is that the assigned work goes with the lecture. Like whatever we are doing in my lecture class it corresponds with the week's lab. Which helps me to understand the concept more. Another thing that I like about this class is that there are not many rules. Like this is supposed to be like a free class, like a college class. My last semester's class had a bunch of rules on how to turn the assignment in and everything. The last thing that I like about this class is the breakouts because I think it helps people to communicate with each other since covid 19 is going on. I also like the fact that the professor answers questions about the lab if we have any. And that she also offers extra credit. Overall, I think that the class was bearable even if we had stuff due every week there were no quizzes and during the pandemic its like you never know when your wifi would go out so I like the fact that there were no quizzes. And overall the professor and the TA did a great job."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3055,I think my greatest take away from this class is that physics is all around us even though we hardly notice it. We go about our daily lives with little thought about the power in our homes or the phones and computers we carry around. I think that this class exposes how little most people understand about the mechanisms that are pervasive in modern society. We especially see this in smart phones. We often spend way too much time looking at our phone because they connect us to the vast network of people and information. But we barely understand how it functions in a physical sense. We use it and recharge it everyday but we don’t really study the mechanics of circuits and the disbursement of energy stored in a battery.  I think that that is my greatest take away from this class. We take for granted that so many before us worked so hard to come to an understanding of the force of electromagnetism and to apply it to technology that we now barely give a second thought to.
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2104,"My greatest take away from this class came from all the summaries we do after every lab. From those summaries, I learned to view the physics of everyday objects and occurrences. Initially, I was frustrated when writing those lab summaries because I had trouble applying the concepts to everyday things. I felt like circuits and electromagnetism could only be obviously viewed in really interesting science things that would appear on fancy machines that I don’t know about. However, instead of looking at complex technology systems, I learned to see the physics of the simplest things and that has allowed me to broaden my understanding of the world. This class gave me a slightly better understanding of how the technology I use works like recharging my phone battery, using an extension cord, how the outlets in my house are connected, etc. So overall, the topic of electronics is less intimidating to me."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2126,"The greatest takeaway from this class were the concepts of electricity and magnets. How both of them are different and how they are similar. I know how an electric charge acts by itself, with another charge, or next to a magnet. For example, when two positive charges are next to each other they repel unlike a negative and a positive charge. Charges of the opposite attract and the same thing with a magnet. A magnet has a north and south pole and since they are opposite, they attract. If you cut the magnet in half, each half would still have a north and south pole. You can’t separate it.  Another thing that I got from this class is a study habit. I had to write all my homework in my little notebook and once I turned it in, I checked it off. It was a great way for me to visually see what I had to do. I will be able imply that into my future courses, so I don’t forget anything at all.  "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3067,"The greatest takeaway from this class is that I finally have some comprehensive on electricity and magnetic force. Before I took this class, I'm afraid of having physics classes because my experience in taking Physics 1 is not pleasant. If it is not because of my academic requirement, I would not even try to take another physics class. But after taking this class, I feel slightly better since the electricity problems are always following the equation. And because of that, I have the will to try to understand the concepts instead of rejecting everything, and this makes me have some understanding of electricity and magnetic force. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3053,My biggest takeaway from this class is that showing up every day and not scrolling the internet is the biggest way to pass an online class. It's really hard to do since work from home has all the distractions but it works for the most part. Asking for help when you do need it is the next biggest help as I did need some help towards the end of classes. I don't know how long I'll remember the math formulas. I maintain that paper notes are better for a classes class that requires writing formulas or doing math. Typing is better for notes that are strictly informational. It's very hard to get to know your peers online or in discords that are purely related to classes and don't have any social activities like a weekly movie night or anything. Even in-person classes that are strictly lecture-based have this problem. One of my favorite classes was a math class that was a mixture of discussion and lecture. Another fun class was a science class where the lab was all hands-on. I ended up having fun in that class as there was always a familiar face around. 
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3073,"This course was offered online. E-Book, homework, assignments, and Exams were paperless. It provided a canvas that was very simple to connect all the available digital tools into one place . We were able to explore similar examples to crystal clear the difficult concepts related to our daily lessons . Online discussion with the teacher helped to break the commute constraints and instant replies from the teacher . Regarding the practical work, I was a bit confused that how the lab work will be carried out. However, the use of technology and great simulation work gave us a taste of real lab. I would say a better environment with an opportunity to repeat the experiments several times till we achieve the level of accuracy. Moreover, flexibility and available videos and supporting stuff helped to clarify the doubts with no time. I also like the online quiz option.I would summarize as:It was a great use of technology and a collaborative learning environment.  "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,145,The greatest take away from this class was learning how the things around us work. From the speed of light to electromagnets. I learned a lot about my surroundings. One really cool thing that stood out for me was the electromagnets. I never knew you can actually build your own magnets with electricity. A lot of what we learned in this class will help me towards my major since I am majoring in electrical engineering. 
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3042,"I really enjoyed this class. We did have a big workload each week, but it was helpful that you are such an approachable person to reach out to if we had any questions during class or outside of class. Some concepts were hard for me to understand but your explanations during lab were very helpful. Physics is really cool when you understand it. I actually find myself sitting in fascination sometimes when I am outside. A great professor can make learning so much more interesting and I am glad I had you as a professor!"
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3047,I would have to say that my greatest take away from this class would be a more critical view of the world around me. Circuits and electricity have been something I use all the time and had absolutely no idea how they worked or how to really be safe around them. I never really wanted to know how they work if I am being completely honest but now that I have an understanding of how they work I appreciate the information. Though it may not have anything to do with what I want to do with my life it gives me a greater appreciation of it and a greater feeling of awe at the world around me. Just to know all of the intricate things we had to do and the ways that people have learned how to understand and use the natural phenomena of the world is amazing. I may not see all of the information I learned in this class as something I want to do with my life but it has added to my everyday thinking and understanding of the things around me. 
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,144,"My greatest take away from this class is to budget my time wisely. I took 10 units for this summer semester, with my other 2 courses (CSC317 and CSC340) being incredibly project heavy, so pacing my homework and projects was absolutely critical. I found that if I started my webassign and summaries early, like the weekend before they were due, I would be able to comfortably have enough time to study and complete this classes material. I feel like the time spent working through problems was incredibly helpful, and I found that because I started my webassign early I could then discuss with my group any sticking points I might have had for a specific question. Another huge factor in being efficient with my time was to show up to every lecture! I feel like every minute of lecture was worth at least two or three minutes of reading in the textbook. This has helped me find quality learning resources that are more compatible with the way I learn, for example I find that for math and physics based courses a video is much easier to understand than text. I think a lot of the inefficiency from reading the text comes from jargon heavy sections which I have to reread a couple of times to understand everything. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3071,"I'd say my greatest takeaway would be what we learned about circuits because I know a bit more about how the circuits in my house function, and why certain things are the way they are. Specifically, when a fuse blows or when a circuit breaks, now I know why that happens. Circuit breaks are fairly common occurrences around my house, especially in the kitchen, where several high draw items are in close proximity. It also sometimes happens when the washer and dryer are running while a hairdryer is used upstairs. Also the part about how circuits in parallel versus in-series explained how some circuits have parts that all decrease when an additional thing is added versus staying the same. Before my kitchen got renovated, it was wired in-series, so turning on multiple lights or plugging in several appliances caused the lights to dim. Now everything stays the same brightness so it's been wired in parallel."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3066,"My greatest takeaway from this course is the group work experience. I am the type of person that prefers to work alone, it is not because I don’t want to communicate, it is only because not everyone can follow each other’s logic sometimes especially for harder problems. This is hard to overcome for people that just met. But during this course, I learn to communicate with someone I just met, and split up the task, doing something as a group. It is fun, and it gives me some confidence while working in a group, especially with people I don’t know. It is a great advancement for me. I will keep this experience in mind so I know how to deal with things within a group in the future. Because I know my future upper-division classes all have group projects, so I must prepare myself for the future. And I believe this will help me a lot even in the further future."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2456,"My greatest take away from this class, is actually that I learned a lot about electrical force, through studying together and working on labs together.. It was a rough because of the short term course but the way of organizing was actually pretty helpful. we covered so much work in the past 7 weeks and I hope me and mu fellow classmates will accomplish great grades and we move along to the next step. other thing I really learned, is that class assignments can be different from one class to other which is actually teaches us how can we adapt different types of assignments organizing. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2109,this class was a good way to know what we were learning in the lecture class. It also helped to work in the group since we got to know few people in our class. my greatest takeaway would be knowing more about my project's lab so it was easier for me to do my project better. Even though it is a summer we did a lot of lab and learned a lot about this subject.
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3058,"I have learned a lot from this class. The greatest takeaway from this class besides the learning was how to manage my time correctly to finish all assignments and also work with colleagues. I really enjoyed the people that I have been working with. they were always present and helped with their parts, it made learning so much easier for this class and also for the main class. The assignments were mostly easy to understand and the due dates were mostly clear. everything was posted on ilearn in advance. thank you for all your work. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3059,"Even though there was a lot of it in the mechanics class as well, in this class I felt like there was a lot more emphasis on practice and problem solving. In mechanics I relied a lot on my intuition and experience of mechanical interactions, but because electricity and magnetism is much more abstract and isn't as commonly understood, I found the problems more challenging and harder to understand at first. This forced me to study the equations more and I think gave me a greater appreciation for having lots of problems that help build up my intuition of how electricity and magnetism work.Intuition is very difficult to teach, and I think it's why so many prefer the learning by doing approach since it often leads to strong intuition as a bi product. I felt this class was able to do this pretty well when taken with the lecture class. The webassign problems mixed with the simulations/experiments and then the lab exploration worksheets, all mixed together felt like a good balance between conceptual knowledge and intuitive knowledge."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3063,"I can do things I didn't think I was prepared to do – I simply must be steady and not get frustrated.I've figured out how to talk about things (for example powers, energy, force) such that I really comprehend past a word reference definition and I've had the option to derive things about them dependent on perception and my own work, which is quite cool since, in such a case that this were two or three hundred years prior, Newton's laws would be mine first. The main thing I took in this year was the manner by which to peruse an issue for what I know and apply what I have realized, regardless of whether I don't see essentially how to approach an issue. I likely have the instruments to do it, I simply need to work through it. To mark my tomahawks and units, and be just about as explicit as could really be expected. The main thing I took in this year was about how I discover that it's basic to continue attempting and rehearsing troublesome issues and committing errors to eventually learn something significant. Instructions to communicate dissatisfaction strategically. Instructions to utilize assets (educators) outside of class when I need additional assistance."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3062,"My greatest takeaway from this classes learning the complex concepts of physics. In comparison to the 'Intro to physics' class, this class was definitely different. In my opinion it was a little challenging especially because of how fast paced it was because its a summer course. Overall, I felt like the work was do-able, even though it did get a little overwhelming at times. I feel like the homework really did help me understand the concepts better."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2090,"I think the greatest take away from this class may have to be resilience. This does not just relate to this class alone but all summer courses take resilience. It is hard to get through these courses during the summer when all you want to do is go out and have fun, I will be honest some of those distractions got the best of me so I do not believe I was able to really comprehend the course material. I just hope to het through it and do my best until the very end. This experience will definitely judge whether I take summer courses again in the future, in all fairness COVID really has changed me as a student, I have not been as enthusiastic to learn as I was when school was normal so I can only hope that things will return back to what it was like just a few semesters ago. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3040,"My greatest takeaway from this class is learning how to make inferences from the physics concepts and connect them to real-life scenarios. Taking PHYS 220 last semester helped me understand the concepts in this class more, because everything is connected.I was able to understand physics concepts on a more conceptual level, such that not everything can be seen by the naked eye. The simulations and experiments helped a lot, allowing me to visualize what is happening. 	This class taught me these skills because we had to answer questions regarding the simulations/labs and write about how the concepts can be found in daily life. This allowed me to be more aware of the physics around me, especially learning about charges, electricity, magnetic fields, magnetic energy, circuits, magnetic waves, and more. Since electricity is found in almost everyday objects, it was interesting the learn about how certain devices and functions are created on a physics level. The labs allowed me to make hypothesizes before the simulations and experiments, and then see how accurate they are compared to the results found after the simulations and experiments. In this way, I was able to improve my analytical skills and think about how the concepts can be applied. 	I also learned how to connect the concepts and the equations, understanding the meaning behind the equations. This class taught me a lot, and I hope to utilize the knowledge for future classes and in life. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3050,"The greatest takeaway from this class, I personally got this from the class, was that I learned how to manage time to get most of the work done. To be honest, I struggled with labs mainly because of my work as I missed 3 labs in general. However, my performance in other aspect of the class was amazing in my opinion and I think it shows in my grade. I feel like we did too many labs for one week. I think labs are the hardest part to keep up sometimes, because HW, summary and show your work was honestly hard to keep in the first place. However, besides work management I took a lot of physics concept to major and my daily life mainly how semiconductors, capacitor, and insulators functions and its purposes. Because personally I like playing with motherboards in free time, and thanks to this class I am now more than ever aware of how each component in my motherboard functions in much more detail than the lessons I took from community college when I was an engineer. I really believe this class helped me understand how technology works in a mechanically in ways I wasn’t aware of. Thus, I am glad that I took this class."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3070,"I guess the greatest takeaway from this class is how much I learned. I have taken physics before, but we ended up with a substitute so we didn't really do anything in the class. These past 2 years were like my real start in Physics. I knew about concepts in physics, but I never really went in depth with the topics. More like general knowledge of what it is and what it does. Going to this class helped me learn about calculations and small details I never knew before. I am able to apply and identify some of the concepts we learned in daily life. Although I may not use everything I have learned, I believe there are important pieces of information to remember."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3068,"My biggest take away from this class is that everything around us somehow uses physical principles. Everything we use, touch are  in a way connected to physics. I am also going to take away some electrical classes that we went through which will be helpful to me in the future when I have my own house and will have to fix stuff around it.  Another takeaway from this class is that no matter how sure you are about something you need to always double check even if it is hard to check. There were times when I wanted to submit answer , but I had to make sure I doubled - tripled checked before that. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3046,"What is the greatest takeaway from this class? I think this class help me adjust my life and make my schedule more regular. But I'm not saying I didn't learn anything academically from the lesson; From my point of view, this class has contributed more to my life than it has to my study. I haven't left my room since the beginning of the summer due to the pandemic; this class really give me a target so I wouldn't spend my entire day on electronic devices. Going back to the section's class content about the field force is a new point of knowledge for me, and that was amazing. Then the section above circuit, which we take right now, really gives me a great review of my circuit design. Overall, this course has had a positive impact on my studies and life. And after a month of learning, I found many connections between my major and physics. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3041,"Despite this summer being a very challenging and taxing summer of classes, work, and personal growth, I learned so much about the invisible forces powering my computer, warming our planet and providing food for plants. I loved playing with magnets as a child and my current pre-k students love playing with them also. Highlights for me was learning about electromagnetic induction and generators. I loved understanding that electromagnetism originates from mechanical energy; the falling of water, spins a magnet, which induces a current, which turns on a lightbulb. So cool!"
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3044,"My greatest take away from this class has definitely a much different work ethic. This summer course has had more workload for me than any class I have taken so far at San Francisco State, and I am thankful for that because it allowed me to grow as a student. I had to really set a time period where I was going to have to do homework and prioritize my time for doing homework. This summer has been much different because I have never taken such a heavy workload class especially not in the summer, I spent most of my time with classwork rather than anything else. This really allowed me to test myself, asking myself how important it was for me and how much I really want this degree. The answer was always badly, that's why i decided to do online classes because I wanted it. Even on days I did not have a good day or something happened in my personal life I knew i could not let it reflect on my school work."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3052,"i took this class because it is a requirement for my degree, i am a computer science major and this class was one of the required classes i had to take. i took phy 220 last semester in spring. in comparing i would say i learned a lot more from this class as the material covered were somehow, relatively interesting as far as physics is concerned .compared to topics like acceleration, forces, and relative motion i think learning about electricity, current, resistance, capacitance and so was really fun and so these topics were my great takeaway from this class. the format class was offered in was very helpful in grasping these topics, the hws , summaries, lecture videos were all very helpful. as i am preparing to take hardware classes in my major, i am sure the concepts i took in this class will be super helpful and so i am looking forward to how i can apply the, overall i really enjoyed the class."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2118,"My greatest takeaway from this class would probably be understanding how our physics simulations are an example from the real world. We can't see the factors that have an effect on an object but thanks to the simulations, we can have an idea of how certain objects are affected by certain physical factors. We can't see these factors through the naked eye but we can only imagine what we want to see. Also, something I can get out of this class would be pacing myself when doing the labs as everything is worked at home, and socializing with others may be hard as we may have different times where we can collaborate and it may not work out for some of us. Not all of us like to speak as it may be awkward or uncomfortable but we somehow can get past that fear and help each other succeed in the lab explorations. Having to learn how to solve physics problems and sometimes doing research when trying to figure a certain equation is beneficial. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3045,"This class actually opened up my mind about the concepts of Physics. Only mastering these topics in the lecture class did not help too much, because there aren't enough ways to practice these core aspects besides only summarizing them, doing textbook questions and learning vocabulary. One of the best things about this class is that I get to know more people! In breakout rooms, it's good to see classmates that are also passionate and willing to work together to finish the lab, and I started to see familiar names and get a lot of activities done. This opportunity gave me the options to work with a lot of different people, as well as meeting them and discuss the importance of Physics concepts! Additionally, now I am much more familiar with energy conservation, momentum and elastic/inelastic collisions, since these terms remained unknown to me before the lab occurred. This class helped me understand more about Physics, and how to demonstrate Physics in a creative and interesting way!"
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3051,"To be completely honest, my biggest takeaway is to not be so nice when starting out. First impressions are great and all, but I ended up finding a leech instead of people who will also help me in my understanding. On the first day, I was explaining the lab and working as a group or so I thought, turns out it was just me and this one other person doing all the work while the last person did nothing. Not only that but I would constantly get messages asking for the answers to almost all of the problems from the lecture and from the lab. I honestly do not regret having that good impression because I made a lot of friends, but it honestly felt terrible to finally come into contact with someone who just wanted to pass the class, with no understanding trying to cheat their way through the course. Within the first week, I told this person I am not going to just give you the answers instead I will explain it, to not only help my own understanding but so that they may or may not pick up just a tiny bit about the topic. On the other hand, I met some really smart and productive people who helped my understanding and we could cover each other's weaknesses. By checking with each other it felt a lot better than just having a one-sided give-take relationship. I need to not feel so bad trying to remove these non-working classmates, from my circle. Something that my brother told me was that ""companies just don't hire them"". I need to stop worrying about the leeches and focus on my own work and those who will rise with me."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3048,"I feel like my greatest take away from this class is being able to understand concepts of physics with the help of the lab work that is assigned. Personally, I am able to better understand concepts visually, therefore the demonstrations that are provided in this class help me to understand what the physics concepts mean. I also believe that this class would help me learn better if it were in person. When classes are taught in a class room setting, it is easier to collaborate with other students and the professors whenever you may have a question or need help. Also, professors are able to engage with students face to face during the lecture. All in all, in my opinion, the greatest take away from this class would be the quality of education that is provided by the professors, as well as the college. "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3064,My greatest take away from this class is being able to connect physics concepts to everyday life. It also helped me be able to look out and search for resources that can help me understand these concepts better. The multiple simulations we used throughout our labs have helped me a ton when it comes to just understanding and seeing these things play out in real situations helped my learning a lot and makes me want to go out and find tons of interactive websites and such in order to help me. Overall I will take away a lot of knowledge and resources that I am sure will help me in the future. 
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3054,"One thing I'll never forget is how cool electro magnets are! Even after I submitted the lab, I went out to buy a battery, some wires and a nail to play around with this idea and it was cool what i was able to pick up and what not.  I also had a lot of fun researching the history of AC vs DC currents.  To be honest though, this summer was a long and hard summer for me and a part of me regrets not taking some time off to recollect my thoughts.  I feel like i've been keeping my head down and pushing forward for so long now that I definitely need a break.  I'm so scared of this up coming fall semester because I really don't know if I can make it to next summer.  Don't get me wrong, school is not difficult by itself, but combined with a full time software engineering job is nightmarish.  I don't know what to do and I feel like i'm at my wits end.  In more positive light, I do feel more mature than I was even a year ago.  I see life differently and now that I'm working hard, i'm appreciating the finer moments in life, like a good book or a hot bath instead of loud music, parties and drugs.  I remember going to a club one weekend (recently) and being so tired of it and i was shocked to find myself excited to go home.  A part of me is dying but at the same time a newer, more refined part of me is being born.  "
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3061,"My greatest takeaway for this course is to never be afraid to tell your peers or classmates that you don't fully grasp the materials you're learning or the tasks you're currently working on.  It was at around week 5-6 when we were doing short circuits, I was slightly struggling with the materials.  I was hesitant at first to tell my classmates in the group, but I told them and they told me the parts they didn't understand and the part that they did.  It was a great experience because we were learning together and it felt so accomplishing after I got a hang of the material.  This will be something I'll always keep in mind when I'm struggling with whatever I'm doing."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3075,"I am not sure what exactly take away means. I will just reflect on my experience in this class. At first, I disliked taking a physics lab online as I felt like I won't learn anything. But the labs were very well designed and gave examples from real life to help understand the concepts more. I also enjoyed that for a few labs we got to perform home experiments. I am glad I was able to learn and do the labs even though I took the lectures a few years back."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,3056,"Just like my experience with taking a Physics lab last semester, I took away that Physics has so many interesting concepts that make it so much fun when engaging with them. This semester I learned more about electricity concepts than I ever really knew about, even with taking a Physics class in high school. From discovering electric charges and how opposite charges attract, to how electric field lines extend outward along with the idea of an electric field going through closed surfaces (electric flux), I found that electricity has so many compelling ideas surrounding them. Not only that, but when we learned about magnetic fields and how they differ from electric fields in terms of composition and emission, I also found that an interesting discrepancy as well. Learning about how magnetic fields can induce electric currents when moving through a surface was honestly quite fun to see; I learned so much about the connection between those two types of fields, and how magnetism can produce electricity especially in circuits. Finally, I liked engaging with the simulations this semester; working with online simulations such as the Phet lab and the Sage program helped me understand these concepts in an intuitive manner. Overall, while I had a hard time adjusting to the rapid pace of summer classes (as this was my first semester taking them here), I had a mostly good time with the concepts this semester."
2021,Summer,PHYS 0232,--,1,2113,"The main thing I learned is the means by which to move toward issues utilizing what we have realized in class. Normally, the crucial step is pondering what models to utilize, and how to utilize them together to take care of the issue. This is the main thing I've learned. How disappointment in something can be great as you gain from this disappointment and continue on trying constantly once more. This ability is critical and this is the thing that respects physical science bestowed on me alongside the whole course worth of thoughts on physical science. Crucial standards. Despite the fact that it is a science you can get inventive with it! Physical science governs my life!! I've figured out how to talk about things (for example powers, energy, force) such that I really comprehend past a word reference definition and I've had the option to determine things about them dependent on perception and my own work, which is quite cool since, supposing that this were two or three hundred years prior, Newton's laws would TOTALLY be mine first. Everything has its time and employments. So everything! Speed doesn't approach speed to think!!! to move toward every issue basically and not simply remember a particular arrangement of equations and activities everything, except particularly fnet=ma, mtet(energy+momentum). Generally about how to address things precisely and how to help thoughts."
