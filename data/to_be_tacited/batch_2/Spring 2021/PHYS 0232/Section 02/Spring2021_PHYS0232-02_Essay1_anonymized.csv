2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,157,"I want to go into the Stem field so that I can eventually get the job that I want and have been working towards. In the future I want to be a game developer and the best way I felt to do that was to go into the STEM field. Within the STEM field I can learn the necessary skills that I can use to make me a competative applicant. In the STEM field, the skills I will learn for becoming developer will be focused around computer science. Once I learn these skills and can use them to get a deeper understanding of how games work and how to design the mechanics that are implemented in them. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2131,"There are many reasons why I want to go into the STEM field. Reason number one is I am fascinated by how everything we design works, and why things are the way they are. I know the STEM field is very difficult and competitive, but I feel I can bring importance to this field. Reason number two is I have a passion for automobiles. Ever since I was young, I was curious about how they worked and what made them work. My dream is to graduate as a mechanical engineer and become an automotive engineer and design and test the new wave of electric cars that are soon to hit the market. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2357,"I've always found myself academically inclined when it comes to my skills and interests. I don't think there ever was a doubt in my mind, or the mind of people around me, that I would pursue a STEM carrier. Even in middle school I had an idea that I would go into aerospace or programming. Aerospace was a possibility due to my extreme interest in aircraft and rockets but in the end I choose to be a programmer. I felt I already had a lot of prerequisite experience due to my own person forays into programming and knew I would enjoy doing it. It's one of the few activities that I found I could sit down for hours and work on, all the while enjoying it. I also knew there would work out there for this carrier and that I could make a reasonable living from my wage which were also important considerations. I have also found ways of intertwining my other interests, such as aerospace, into programming which increases my interest."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,133,"I chose to go into the STEM field because of the challenge and it is where my mind is most intrigued. I love those moments of realization when learning a difficult topic. It gives me a confidence boost in my capability to succeed. To ""succeed"" to me, means to achieve my goals of having an impact on the engineering and science community. I chose STEM because I knew it would give me the tools to make an impact. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2358,"At first, I didn't have a reason for going into the stem field other than it's smart financially in the long run. I believe I am in the stem field because I think it challenges me thinking wise. If I were in a non-stem major, I think I might be more frustrated and unmotivated with my schoolwork because I would believe that there was no purpose to it. But in the stem field, I try my best to learn everything because it hopefully will be used in my career later om."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2359,Why did I go into the stem fieldIma be honest I didn't know what I wanted to be on H.S I just choose something at the top of my head and it turned out to be a STEM major. So all in all I just did it because I didn't know what I wanted to be so I just chose it because I did it on a whim. I guess the potential pay out of being in a stem major is an influence but It's just I don't know not really a purpose because I feel like me being in a STEM major at the end of my day isn't and shouldn't be my purpose. I feel that way because at the end of the day Once im down with college and gonna be working IDK if working in the STEM field will make me fulfilled because I Don't know if I just want my whole life to just be my career until I die but thats just me. Im not sure why I went into the STEM field
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2360,"What inspired me to go into the STEM field are two things: my passion for motorsports and learning plumbing as a trade from my dad. First, with motorsports, I was so inspired by my friends in high school because they demonstrated to me how extraordinary and exciting the sports car community. Back then, my friends mostly consist of people who know how to fix and make their cars faster and thought that was one of the coolest professions ever. So I decided that I was going to go into a mechanical engineer in order for me to get a career in fixing and modding automobiles. And second is plumbing, my dad owns a plumbing business called Ariel's plumbing. Most of the time, I go with him to learn what it likes to be on the field fixing customer's plumbing needs such as installing water heaters, toilets, and bathroom/kitchen sinks. Since I have been going with my dad to his work before, I thought engineering would be a suitable course to study under since I have years of experience going into the field. Because of these two reasons, I thought STEM field would really suit for me since I want to learn more what I can do with my skills."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2100,"The reason I want to go into the stem field is because it is my passion. Since I was little I have always liked to build thing with legos and as a grew older I started to get into tech. It wasn't until high school when I grew the confidence to started fixing phones and see how they were built. At first I started off watching Youtube tutorials on how to fix certain thing such as how to replace the screen, how to replace the home button or even how to fix a broken audio jack. Even though I learned useful things there was a limit to what I could learn. When it came to deciding what to study for I was interested in electrical engineering because not only would I be able to fix other things with what I learned but I will also have the sufficient knowledge to do my own repair projects and possible build my own tech. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2115,"I want to go into the STEM field because I want to be able to make an impact. Previously, I was a Pre-Nursing major because I wanted to assist patients and help make their lives better - even if that involves doing what I can to make their hospital stay and transition easy and comforting. I made the switch to the Engineering field because I enjoyed being more hands on, and doing work behind the scenes. I had the intent of going into the STEM field designing and creating medical devices for patients in need of medication. Doing so would allow me to help create something that is beneficial for patients in my community, and for those around the world. It would fulfill my life's purpose of knowing that I had the ability to help not just one patient, but several more because of something that I had helped to contribute."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2361,"I want to get into the STEM field to prove that people of different ethnicities can succeed in STEM. I am from a Hispanic background and have not seen a lot of Hispanics in STEM. But I want to change that through my impact on the STEM community. Also, I want to get into STEM because the salaries are a lot higher. I want to be able to provide a good life for my future family and I believe getting into STEM will help my chances of doing that. The Bay Area is an area with a high cost of living and so well-paying jobs are required if you want to be able to live here. I would like to stay local and work in Silicon Valley. I believe that by me getting a degree in computer science I am setting myself up to make that dream a reality someday."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2105,"I wanted to go into the STEM field because of engineering. It was my own choice to do a major in civil engineering. I like this major so far and I've been interested in participating in building projects in the future, large to small scales. I like seeing progression. I already gave it some thought that becoming an engineer may be a challenge but I believe it is possible. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,192,"I want to go into the STEM field because it's the future and always has been the future. advances in tech and software will lead to a world where people can live easily without much waste. I hope to contribute to that future in AI, entertainment, research, software, apps. There are many opportunities that await, and branches will keep expanding from what STEM can do. The only issue would lie with me and my motivation and focus toward STEM. I am known by those close to me to lose focus near the finish line. I hope to change that during my time at SFSU and finish strong with my work and studies. I want to create good habits that will lead into my career and lifestyle. I hope to shape STEM and have STEM shape me. That way I think that the future Is riding on me, so I’d better do my best."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,167,"My major is mechanical engineering and the reasons I chose that major and to be in the STEM field ultimately goes down to what I learned to like and dislike in my time in high school. Like most people, when I started high school, I had no plan for education after high school and beyond. Originally, I did not think I would be in the STEM field because I hated math and science in middle school, but after a series of inspiring teachers in high school that taught me to think about things from a different perspective, I grew to enjoy math. Eventually, I learned that math is a powerful tool to solve problems based on numerical logic derived from simpler problems. In other words, I enjoy math because it is usually logic-based and relatively intuitive which is exactly why I learned to dislike the other fields like arts and humanities. Topics within philosophy, art, and history, for example, can have an infinite amount of right answers and many ways to interpret concepts which are almost never clear-cut. As to why I chose mechanical engineering specifically, it is a great combination of building things (which I love doing) and math and science skills. To conclude, the more I improved and started to enjoy math and science, the more I learned to dislike the things that are opposite to them."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2075,"I originally picked civil engineering as my major for practical and personal reasons. Practical, because I knew that if I graduated with this major, I would most likely be able to find a secure job with a good salary. I also chose this major personally, because I'm hoping to find a job that would allow me to design and build structures like buildings for work, homes, and roadways that are more cost efficient and environment friendly. I realize now that it won't be easy, but if I stick with this current plan, I should be able to find a career that would help me help other people in the future, which is why I chose to be in this field in the first place. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2362,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field? The reason is simple, and STEM is the future. STEM has a lot of potential and opportunities who people who wants a stable job after the college. Even if you are not worried about the future financial situation, STEM field can fascinate you with its innovation and capabilities which might pique your interest in joining the field. Personally, I want to go into STEM field for stability of my future career and I enjoy utilizing computer. I strongly believe STEM is the future and bright future await for all of us."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2363,"Since my childhood, I am very much passionate about going into STEM. Studying in the science field has always helped me understand my learning better. While I am majoring in biology at SF state, I want to become a Doctor. It’s my dream to become a surgeon. STEM field has a variety of areas, in which getting a degree would help me to study medicine. That is the reason I want to go into the STEM field. By going into this field, I will be able to understand the concepts of an area of interest. By taking classes in the STEM field, it will enhance my learning and help me in further future. talking about the STEM field basically, it has chemistry, biology, and life sciences courses. By going into STEM, one can earn credit in Computer science, psychology, and life sciences as well. My dream to become a successful doctor will only be fulfilled by my graduating with a STEM degree."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2364,I mainly wanted to go into the STEM Field because its the future. It is always advancing as time goes on and STEM majors are always needed so finding a job I felt like I would have a good chance if I entered the STEM field. Being in the Silicon Valley especially for me computer science was a no brainer to enter that field. The pay is good but more importantly the amount of tech companies that are here is insane. There seems like there's a major tech company everywhere you look here. I think its an important field to further progress society and our needs. We will only get more advanced as time goes so the STEM field was my opportunity to join a constant progressive field. I think its an interesting field in itself with lots of problem solving which I love and you work with others which is a plus for me and hearing others provide their reasoning behind things. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2365,"I wanted to go into STEM initially because I love creating things. The feeling of having nothing before and something afterwards is... euphoric. Creating something and having it work as intended, (even if it doesn't work as intended, you might be able to experiment and make something even better from these situations) is one of the best feelings I've experienced in this world. I always wanted to be in STEM since I was a child (although for all of elementary I wanted to be a marine biologist) but in my last two years of high school I joined the robotics team for my school.  I remember we were in the middle of build season and I came across a video posted by Boston Dynamics. Seeing their robots literally walk and open doors and do somersaults???  Absolutely insane. Then I had an idea, not a unique one I guarantee, but an idea. I wanted to combine this technology, the speed and adaptivity of their programming to the field of prosthetics. I must confess, the anime Full Metal Alchemist was what put me onto this interest. In the world of FMA there exists a technology called ""Automail"", which is a prosthetic device that moves with zero input delay, and acts in real time just as any real limb would. I definitely believe this is what planted the interest in prosthetics for me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2366,I would like to go into the STEM field mostly because there’s a huge lack of women in this field more specifically computer science. I want to be able to prove that I can do it too. I used to want to do something with art or makeup but as I get older I see how significant STEM is in our everyday lives. I see STEM as the future. It is practically involved in everything I can even think of. It is a secure field where I can really make a difference. I can make a difference while also proving the point that girls are equally as capable as males are when it comes to the STEM field. We are the generation born into technology and it keeps advancing as we get older. I would love to be a part of that creation. We are the future and it would be nice if I could help out. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2367,"I want to go into the STEM field because I was never good at courses such as English. I always found myself doing better in Mathematics. Even though I'm not good with Physics or other Science courses, it still interests me. I find myself watching space videos every night and I was always interested in learning more about how life started, etc. When I was choosing my major, I made sure that it was heavily mathematics. Before declaring Computer Science as my major, I knew I wanted a career that was in STEM. Besides it being one of the most high paying jobs, I just know that STEM careers are the one most likely to have an impact to the society. Even before Computer Science, I had interests in becoming a nurse or a math teacher. I would always do good in STEM tests and do average with English and Reading Tests. STEM classes just fascinates me more and is more interesting to me. This is why I want to go into the STEM field."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,731,"I want to go into the STEM field because I love working with my hands and solving problems. I am studying mechanical engineering and I find it so fun to use the knowledge I have gained through physics and other technical disciplines, and apply it to real world situations. I have been working an internship this semester and have been using things that we will be studying in this class and I enjoy working on complex problems using rather simple principles."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2123,"I wanted to go into the STEM field because I wanted to be involved with designing things that could have an impact on everyone's lives. I can only imagine the kind of satisfaction you could get from such an accomplishment, and so far I have enjoyed watching countless videos and attending many lectures about the science and background of how nearly everything works. From cars, rockets, machinery, to even structures, expanding my breadth of knowledge across all of these different fields has been nothing short of profound and enjoyable. Looking back now, I am very glad I didn't go through with pursuing a Bachelor's in Criminal Justice, as the only reason that was motivating me to do so were the benefits and financial security."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2368,"As technology is evolving, I would like to be able to understand what is going on. It would also help if I was able to create some technology that would further help communities, especially the low-income ones. They do not have the same chances to all the tech as everyone else. It would be nice to be able to use my education to help out the community. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2369,"Reflection 1  My name is Kiran Shrestha. I am the Computer Science Major. This is my first semester in SFSU as I am a transfer student.  I am always attracted to math’s and science since I get to know this world.  I was always fascinated by the beauty of science and technology. I like the way science impacts our life. Since I was a kid I was always attracted towards science and mysteries. The reason I choose STEM field is my eagerness to learn more about different technologies and the process of Science, especially computer and world related to it. In today’s world, STEM is always in spotlight in terms of good, exciting and prosperous lives. This is basically the reason I choose stem field. I just want to use my STEM field knowledge to bring something new to my society. In future, I will try to use my computer science knowledge to create something new in the society."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2119,The reason I wanted to go into the stem field is because I have always enjoyed building things and want to make a positive impact on communities. I want to become a civil engineer and maybe one day get my masters in structural engineering so I could build houses. Another reason I chose this field was because math has always came easier to me than other subjects and engineering is very heavy on math. I am a person who loves to be outside and to me there would be no better job than fixing up your community industrially. The stem field is so big that if I ever decide I do not want to do civil engineering there are so many things I could transfer into with that degree.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2370,"I am a computer science major and I want to go into the STEM field because it is very interesting to me and I believe that technology is going to advance more in the future and I want to be apart of those tech advancements. I also enjoy learning how to code and find it very interesting. I am not sure what I want to do in the future, career wise, but I do know that I would like to do something in STEM, specifically I would like to work in the tech field. I also like that you only need a bachelor's degree to have a very good job straight out of college. You do not need to continue your education if you do not want to."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,171,"I want to go into the STEM field because I really enjoy those topics. I think that, because I grew up playing video games, technology has always been fascinating to me. After taking a Computer Science class my junior year of high school, I was really fascinated by how many things you can do with programming, and that was the first time I really felt like I had found something I would want to do as a career. I really liked doing the projects because it felt like I was solving a puzzle. Not only that, but I've had two teachers, one for math and one for physics, who I felt were really good at teaching and had lasting impact on how I approach these subjects."
