2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2115,"This semester was my first semester taking all of my classes fully-online, as I'm sure it is the case for a handful of other students. Previously, I used to prefer online classes as they felt like they allowed me to work on my assignments on my own time. So, for the past few semesters I would have about five classes in person, and a class or two online - and that was very manageable for me. However, since we moved to fully remote learning, it has left me to manage and prioritize all six or seven classes. It has left me stressed and overwhelmed this entire semester. I think the main reason for that is because there was no guide as to when I should do which assignment by when. What I take away from this class is that sense of guidance and control. In this class we have deadlines in the middle of the week. At first I was a bit against it, but after sometime it made me realize that it would force me to work on it and get it done. Then afterwards, it would allow me to deal with the other classes, with one less one to worry about."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2119,One of my greatest takeaways from this class was learning how to use sage mathwork because i was never very familiar with coding. Another huge takeaway was just learning how currents flow and can generate lights through a circuit.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2100,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that I was able to visually understand what we were  learning. Like when we made electromagnets, seeing how they work helps me better understand their purpose and how they function. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2105,My greatest takeaway in this class are learning about circuits and how they work. I never knew that there was parallel and series type circuits. Also we got to learn about voltage and ohms.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,157,My greatest take away from this class was a reinforcement to what I had learned in my non lab portion of my physics course. The simulations let me experience what I learned in the other course and have a better visualization of the concept. We get to see the concepts happening before us making it more interesting to learn and overall more enjoyable experience.  It provides me more opportunities to discuss the concepts and ideas we went over with my classmates as well. If I feel like I am confused I have others that are learning the same topics as me that I can ask for help.  
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2365,Hmm. To be perfectly honest I was feeling really disconnected from this course (in terms of the lecture) due to how infrequently we were meeting and how unstructured it all felt. The lecture time we had before each lab with you really kept me hanging on to this class. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2361,"My greatest takeaway from this class was that I need to be better when communicating with groupmates. This semester a lot of times I did not ask any questions because I felt a fear of judgment. Eventually, I learned that it would be better if I just ask the question because I'd help myself and most of the time people are willing to help each other. People feel satisfaction from helping one another and it is something that I've realized in myself and when talking to others. So in the future with classes and in my future job, I will make sure to better communicate when I have a problem with my work. This is something that I thankfully realized early this semester so I was able to adjust over the semester and help myself in this and other classes because I noticed that is was a recurring issue that I had."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2369,"This class is more fun than I expected. Professor uses easy methods to clarify things that are hard to understand. I am having as well as learning the materials. I have learned a lot from this class. At the beginning I was not sure that this class could be this enjoyable. With all this pandemic situation over our head, it is challenge to understand the virtual learning materials. But, professor have done very impressive efforts to teach us the materials.i am prefer in person lab courses but, considering the current circumstances, this class in very handy and effective. I felt very comfortable with the teaching materials. My biggest takeaway is to be able to understand this course in more joyous way than I imagined. i am very thankful to professor, to make us laugh and learn at the same time. This class was really a very good learning experience for me personally."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2131,"My greatest takeaway from this class was how difficult physics is. As the class progressed, I noticed it would get more difficult. It made me reflect on whether this major was right for me. And it made me rely on so much help from my peers. It made me more comfortable asking my peers for help and working in groups. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,192,"My greatest take away from this class is that these labs have applications for everyday life. From circuits to charge and electric fields, they will all have many uses in what we do daily. It is what creates the sports we enjoy, the physics in video games, transportation, and how we evolve. For example, it is important to understand center of mass for sports, while understanding projectile motion and force for the ball of an arbitrary sport. Multiple labs would be relevant maybe one aspect of life. The simulations help a lot with getting an idea of how the physics applies to life. For example, in this lab, the momentum and energy conservation in different types of collisions help understand what kind of material might be more powerful for hitting or softening impact. Overall, this class can be seen as a lens into what a physicist sees in everyday life"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2363,"I like that you have choices for assignments, subject display, student response options, and fixed due dates. I'm glad, however, that I now have another blended learning tool that works well and is more student-friendly for low-level learners. This isn't going to work, but I'm happy I have other choices. I believe it is an effective way to move away from paper and into the realm of technology in the classroom. I was a little worried about setting up the classes since it had to take a long time. Online learning can offer a lot more than just facts. Online learning can provide a lot more detail than just the course content. Overall, the course showed me how much you can do in Physics to make teaching a multi-level course a lot easier and more competitive."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2359,"The greatest take away from this class is that the lab is really fun at times but the main part of this class wasn't the best as i find myself dreading going there but looking foward to the lab. My biggest problem is that i don't do any post lab or summaries as i would put them aside and focus on other work. The group work at times felt like it was solo work, just in the same breakout rooms without talking with the occasional do yall need help or what is the answer for so and so. Really wishing to experience this class in an in person setting but this class also makes learning physics a little more bearable. This class was not a class i would be confidant in as i wasn't so confidant back in phys 220 and 222 so gald to know that I was able to somewhat understand the material and be able to figure out problems. So thank you for all the classes professor wish i could have had this class in person"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2366,"My greatest takeaway from this class is how significant physics can be in our everyday lives. I really enjoyed that we did experiments that really ties into real world things. Such as currents and circuits, we used examples that makes a lot of everyday things make sense. We were able to learn the way that electricity flows through objects and how certain placement can affect it. For example if something is parallel or the electricity is dispersed differently. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2364,My biggest takeaway was that the problem solving and labs helped me better understand what was taught in the lecture portion. I feel like I would be lost if this class wasn’t provided and only the lecture portion was what I was taking. It was nice for some labs to have more of a cooperative feel to it because a lot of my classes it doesn’t feel like it’s all over the place. I hope that the lecture portions in the future are a bit better structured so that people don’t have to rely on the lab portion of the class to actually understand the material.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,133,I enjoyed getting to use Sage in this course. It helped to de-mistify coding for me. Those 2 weeks we used SAGE helped me learn more coding applications than the MATLAB course I am currently taking. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2358,My greatest takeaway from this class was when we used coding to solve physics homework. My major is computer science so I was pleasantly shocked that we worked on some physics problems using sage coding. It was actually pretty fun and I learned how physicists used code to solve mathematical functions easier. I always like it when we use code in class because it is always good practice to code whenever possible. A lot of the topics were also really interesting and the labs helped a lot with understanding the material from the lecture class. The lecture class is not really formatted well and it doesn't teach a lot and I learned most of the material from the labs rather from the other class. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,167,"My greatest takeaway from this class was the fact I should always check my work and calculations. For some of the labs and most of the homework assignments, I frequently made tiny mistakes such as missing a minus sign or conversion of units mistakes that caused me to lose points. This taught me that I should review my work before submitting it not only in physics, but also in each of my other classes. Hopefully, I will carry this lesson to my classes next semester so I can maximize my grades by not losing out on easy points that I would not have lost if I were more careful."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2367,"My greatest takeaway in this class is that teamwork is important. For example, some of my labs were finished quickly when my groupmates communicated. For when I was assigned to a group that doesn't communicate, it feel as though a normal lab takes two times longer that it should be. From doing labs multiple times, even though a faster lab would consist of strategizing who does which part and just go over it at the end so that everyone has something to do while everyone is still learning the overall topic of the lab. But for this lab class, we had to do every question together which took longer but we learned more than we would if we were to split the work."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2370,"My greatest take away from this class was learning about electricity and magnetism. I learned that forces attract when they have opposite charges and they repel when they have negative charges and nothing happens when objects have neutral charges. I learned that electricity is a form of energy which results from the existence of charged particles. An example of electricity is the force that powers a lightbulb, the lightbulb gets charged particles from the battery. Magnetism is produced by the motion of electric charge which also has an attractive and repulsive force between objects. An example of magnetism is when magnets stick on the fridge."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2362,My greatest take from this class will be understanding a concept and able to apply through lab or experiment. Some labs were challenging but working together with professor or other students helped in understanding from different point of view. I also liked when professor make sure everyone understood or helped the students who are having trouble before moving forward. Some labs we did as lab was also very helpful and I hope other will adopt this way to teaching.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2368,"My greatest takeaway from this class will be connecting the physic topics to my everyday life. The lab that I liked the most was learning about Sage coding. I was able to learn about it, how to code, and be able to use it properly. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2075,"My biggest takeaway from this class so far is learning how closely related electricity and magnetism actually are, hence the title of the course being electromagnetism. It was very interesting learning about how these two interact with each other. The experiments we did in this class for the most part were greatly helpful in providing understanding of the material, and I don't think I would have had as much of a good time seeing how these things interact with each other. "
