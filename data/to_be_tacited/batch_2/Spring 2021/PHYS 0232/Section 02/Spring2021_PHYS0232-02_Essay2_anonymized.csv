2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2075,"My goals at the moment are just to get through all my classes this semester while we tide through this quarantine. Ever since the campuses have closed down, and we switched to taking classes completely online, I have begun to lose a lot of motivation spending enough time to study and work on my classes. My main reason to keep going is just to meet all the requirements for graduating college so that I can have a better chance at finding a stable job in the future, and be able to support loved ones, while also being a productive member of society.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2369,"I like this class because, it gives me confidence about the topics that I learn in Phys 230. This is simply the class where I learn all the theories and laws I learned in Phy 230. My goal is to be the software/hardware engineer one day. So, learning physics will solidify the concept of softwares and their interaction with hardware. This is really important for my major as well as carrier. Being one of the requirements of my major, this will add up my knowledge about different circuits and their working process. This will help me in my future. My goal can be achieved with much more ease if I know how the hardwares and software works. And I can learn all the ingredients of success from team work, research, hypothesis, assumptions, facts and many more. This Physics lab is combination of all these. So, it will always help me to achieve my goals in effective way."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,167,"Overall, my current goal is to complete my undergraduate education and to eventually learn the information that will help me succeed in graduate school if I choose to do that as well as in what I hope will be my future career as a mechanical engineer. My goal for just this semester is to succeed in my classes and prepare myself for the more challenging classes that I’m planning on taking in the coming semesters. In terms of how this class brings me closer toward completing these goals, my major has a lot to do with almost all aspects and categories of Physics and other branches of science as well as math. Specifically, Physics labs seem to go into more detail about real-world/practical applications of the concepts that are taught in Physics lectures. In other words, this class encourages further exploration into these concepts in the hopes that it will reinforce students’ knowledge and understanding."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2365,"My only goals as of right now are to move out and experience life on my own. I'm tired of feeling suffocated here, and getting my degree is a step towards that freedom. As for why I'm taking physics classes, I'd have to say that I'm here because I like creating things. To that end, I have to understand the science behind the things I'm trying to create so that it can be a consistent and easily replicable design. This knowledge is just irreplaceable for the field I want to go into, so I must be here with the intent to learn."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2100,"My goals are to graduate and to be a great electrical engineer. This class can help me achieve these goals because it will provide me with he knowledge needed to become a great EE. Even thought what we are learning can be confusing at times, what I learn will be useful in the future to understand other topics. With the knowledge I obtain future classes will be much easier and therefore increase my chances of getting a good grade for the class and passing. Overall this class helps me with the knowledge I receive. The knowledge is useful and will help me reach what I want from college."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2366,"My goal is not very specific but currently it is to finish college with a bachelors degree in computer science. This class is not only required for my major, but it is very helpful as well. I would really en joy to get started on my  career and see where I go from there. I would not be able to reach that goal without this class. Physics is also very important in everyday life. We can practically connect anything to physics. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2123,"My goal is to graduate with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and this class can help me achieve this by fulfilling my prerequisites. But in all seriousness one of my goals this year is to be more consistent and more involved with learning and adapting. At this point it's not a secret that online classes add to mental health issues and induce an increased amount of fatigue; however I would like to work on having the courage to still show up to class, be engaged, and do the best I can. I'm trying to maintain a certain level of consistency with this class along with my other ones despite the mountain of assignments that form at the beginning of every week."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2364,"My goals particularly related to my major of computer science is to get a good paying job in that field not sure exactly what part of computer science to focus on but a job related to computer science. This class is useful because it can be applied to things in the computer science field. The field itself is pretty broad so physics helps me get more knowledgeable on how things work in the real world. The job I may get in the computer science field may just need me to have some physics knowledge of my own. Or at least it could be useful to understand the interworking's of certain processes. I could potentially apply the things I learn here for my future career. Also, physics is a lot of problem solving which is exactly what computer science majors need it is good practice. So, I have somewhat of a goal to work for a big company but in order to do so I need to really devote myself to this and gain all the knowledge I can. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2363,"I am taking this class Physics 232 because since my childhood I am very much fascinated by how everything works. There is physics in everything. The world works through physics. I am very much interested in space study. I love to study different planets and galaxies, and It's my dream to work with NASA. Therefore, this class will help me to enhance my learning towards pursuing my dream of working with NASA. Before taking this class, I didn’t use to like physics as I was not good at solving problems with calculus. But after taking this class, so far I am really enjoying taking this class. The labs are really interesting and fun to work on. Though I have done so many experiments in my high school, but the experiment in this class lab was a bit more in detail and depth. I am looking forward to learning more about 2-D and 3-D dimensions. I hope this class helps me to improve my calculus skills."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2367,"My goals for this class is to understand every lab being done in order to pass Physics. I remember when I took Physics in high school, I struggled so much that for the first time I considered getting a tutor. This class is kind of a tutor for me to help me pass the actual Physics class. I remember getting my first D grade on tests and quizzes from that class. I was interested in Physics but somehow when it comes to doing problems, I get confused on which equations to use and I end up confusing myself. This class can help me achieve the goal of getting an A in Physics by having classmates and a teacher that can help me solve these issues. I remember the only reason I passed physics in high school was because he dropped our worst grade in class and it was enough to make me pass the class. In high school, most of my grades were A so it was a big deal for me. So far, I'm doing well on my Physics class and this lab class has definitely been helping me to achieve closer to my goal."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,192,"My goals from taking this class is to advance myself further in what I want to do. It seems very general, but this class is a stepping stone I need in order to take the next stone. Yes I will be learning motion and kinematics here, and will apply them to my future, but the main reason I am taking this class is so that I move on to the next one. I can see physics being used in my desired future which is game development and may play a huge role. I want to use this class as much as possible, and do it efficiently. My goals are to complete school and get my degree so I can do what I want more freely. This class will help me do that by being a major requirement."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2115,"I feel like my goals have changed numerous times throughout the years, especially around the time that I had started college. For the longest time, I have been going back on forth whether or not I wanted to switch my major halfway through my college career. It was a risky jump, but I did it - I changed my major from Pre-Nursing to Mechanical Engineering. It was definitely scary at first, but over time I realized that it may be a good fit for me. It is difficult, but I see now that despite being in a new career field, I am still chasing the same goal: to be able to find a job where I am able to help people. Had I become a nurse, I would have helped patients in the hospital as they recover. As a mechanical engineer major, I help solve problems that would then go on to help people in their daily lives. Another goal I may add to this would be to find a job position with a company that I am 100% truly happy to be at."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2131,"Well, my overall life goal is to become an automotive engineer developing and testing the new era of electric cars. This class and future physics classes will help me achieve this goal of mine. The reason I say this because physics is extreremly important for developing and testing any sort of cars. It is the reason why cars operate the way they do. Understanding the material taught in these physics  classes is important as it give me the knolage of how and why these car do what they do, which is key when developing and testing cars. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,157,My goals right now are to finish my school work and graduate with a computer science degree. I will then use it to accomplish my other goal of becoming a game developer. The way this class can help accomplish my goal is to allow me to take other courses that I need to. This course is considered as a required course for my graduation requirements as a computer science major at San Francisco State University. With completion of this course I would have finished one of the remaining portion of the science category to graduate. It will also unlock various different computer science classes. For example once I have completed this course I will be able to take CSC 415. Once I have entered the game development field I can use the physics I have learned to help with the designs of the games I will create. I can use it to create the inner workings of the game.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2358,My main goals right now are to graduate with a bachelor's degree and find an internship that can help me find a job after college. This class is helping me achieve those goals because I need to pass this class in order to graduate. It connects to the work we are doing in class because we are learning to problem solve in this class and problem-solving is essential to any software engineer career after university.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2370,"My goals in life is to be happy and successful in what I do. I would like to learn and do well in all of my classes so i can get my degree in computer science. This class will help me in my goals because it will help me learn physics, finish my classes in my major, and help me to get my degree. I would like to become a software engineer but I am not sure what I would like to do specifically. I am still learning about my major and I don't know what I want to do in the future. I would love to get into real estate as well because I am interested in it. Most importantly I want to be happy and I am happy learning about physics so this class will help me with that as well."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2368,"For now, my goals are to pass my classes and fulfill my GEs. Another goal would be to graduate from college. That is some of my goals for now because I do not have a goal for my future (in my career/major) yet. After all, I am thinking of switching my major but I am not sure what to. So, I am hoping to find what I like through GEs and then switching major. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,731,"My main goal right now is to graduate. This class will help me achieve this by fulfilling the requirement. I completed physics years ago, but my old school did not include a lab. Now I am a senior and making sure all my classes are taken. Even though I have used all the topics from this class in upper-level courses already it is still good to get a refresher since it is all very important information!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2360,"My goals for in life are to have a good life, be happy, get a career in Mechanical Engineering, explore most of the world, start making my own projects with mechanics, and starting a family. I feel that this class can help me achieve of my goals since the topics in this class can be essential in future classes such as a design and manufacturing. For example, if want to make my designs and models then i would need to consider how the forces interact with each and see if it works or not. Plus I recently just learned how to use a microcontroller for the first time and i I am really hoping that I can do projects outside of school and go big with my microcontroller designs. And I know I'm going to have to apply Physics to the designs so that it doesn't fall apart. So I believe Physics will help me in the future."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2362,"My major is computer science and physics is one of the requirement I must complete. My goal is to graduate and in order to achieve that I must pass the physics class. In my perspective physics does help with understanding the laws around you and reason why it is happening. So, I do believe it will be big help in future since computer science does revolve more around methodology and learning/ understanding my surroundings will give me edge when I work on computer science related task. Physics is more of trials and errors and for computer science you need patience since most of the times codes doesn’t work right away and you need to find the errors within the long lines of codes. Lastly, the patience and discipline I learned in physics bare fruits for me in future. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2357,"I would say my immediate goals are to get through college successfully. This class helps me achieve those goals by giving me the necessary credits I need as physics is a required part of my major. Besides that there is a possibility of programming physics based simulations in which case a background in physics is helpful. For example, a lot of 3D game engines require at least some degree of physics in relation to movement and object physics. There is also some degree of physics requires for lighting simulations and destruction simulations which can be applied to a prerendered or on the fly rendering situation. In either case physics can help give me the background necessary to program these things."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2359,I honestly don't know my goals in what to achieve in this class because im only taking it because im required to for my major so im not sure what goals I have in mind. I guess I want to get a good grade but isn't that for everyone anyway. But by goals in general In regards to this class I guess will help me understand and before better in the main physics class because I wasn't the best in phys and calc so I just hope to be able to get a good grade in this class as learning online is pretty tough. Like im not entirely sure what I want for myself. Like I wonder if I can find that here in college but im not so sure but I hope to get a wife and kids some days but thats general not anything that is more personal im just going with the flow
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,133,"My goals in their most basic form are to lead a successful life. This class helps me gain the knowledge and critical thinking skills that I want in order for me to product the best results in my professional career. I want to excel in this class so that I can excel in my career. To me, the knowledge and concepts we are learning all have a greater purpose to serve outside of the lab. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2119,My goals are to become a civil engineer in the future and this physics class will help a ton. I already see a bunch of aspects from physics in my engineering classes. Physics describes the world around us and for example in this lab we talk about work which can be applied in engineering. Physics can be applied in mostly all things while being built because there are forces and equilibriums present. Another one of my goals is to make plans and build my own house which also has a lot to do with physics.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2105,"My goal this semester is to pass all my classes. It seems hard at the moment but I believe it is manageable. However, learning physics in general is important. So taking this class is not useless. Also I am majoring in civil engineering and there is a lot of physics involved. Engineering in general involves a lot of physics and calculations, which I expected from the beginning. I am up for the challenge. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2361,My goals in life include starting a family and moving into a home somewhere in the Bay Area. A career-wise goal would be working at a tech company somewhere in the Bay Area. I believe that this class could help me achieve those goals by helping me start connections with people that might go on to work for tech companies before me and so they could possibly refer me to a job. This class also teaches me how to network and networking is a valuable skill for any career. Networking can help me make connections that could potentially find me my next job or I could just make good friends.l I am not a huge extrovert so networking isn't the easiest thing for me so this class is out of my comfort zone a bit since I have to collaborate with other students. But over time I have gotten more used to labs and right now I think that I can successfully guide a group towards success which is something that I probably would not have been able to do before I began taking lab classes. This class is helping me talk more and have better team-building skills.
