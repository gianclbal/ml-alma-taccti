2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,731,"I believe the most impactful topics covered so far have been current and voltage. Electricity is so important in our every day lives and these are two of the main aspects of it. Every day we use telephones, cars, home appliances, etc. and do not think about it, but every one of those objects has a certain amount of current and voltage it needs to run properly. Electrical engineers have spent countless hours figuring out how to wire all of these objects properly so we can use them to their fullest potential. I believe that even though we already know a lot about current and voltage, it will be studied even more in the coming years with the emergence of electric cars and other electric transportation services."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2358,"One question I had about this class, in particular, is how the things we're learning in physics are connected to my major which is computer science. When I researched this, I learned that there is a growing field of computational physics where people are using software programs that simulates physics-related environments and computer scientists have to create those programs."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2366,A concept that we have learned about in class that I have found to be particularly interesting was circuits. I feel like out of most of the topics we have covered this one may apply most to our everyday life. I also did really enjoy learning about charges as well and how same charges will repel and how opposite charges attract. I didn't know too much about charges initially before going into this course but I learned that brushing your hair takes away some of the charges or rubbing a sweater or using a ballon and all of this was really fascinating to me. I am able to figure out why everyday things work the way that they work. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2105,"Sketch a scenario with your wires and batteries that would NOT light the light bulb. Explain your reasoning (Postlab question) If the conductors are charged with the same sign it would not work. Example: positive to positive (as seen above), or negative to negative. Also the reason why when you insert batteries the wrong way on a battery powered toy it will not turn on or work. Our circuit works similarly. Also, if the conductors are not properly connected to the bulb, the bulb will not turn on. This is one of the important lessons that stuck out to me last week. Learning circuits & currents and how they work is important. They exist everywhere. From electronics we use, battery powered toys, to lights we have in our own household. Volts and resistance is important, and its the reason why things don't overload in energy, and possibly explode or short circuited. Electricity and currents are everywhere. It is hard to miss. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2115,"What are the different types of charges and why do vectors face the way they do when in the presence of a charge?There are three main types of charges: positive, negative, and neutral. Opposite charges attract, like charges repel, neutral charges are attracted to either charge. We have done simulations in past lab explorations where I was able to visually see that vectors face away from positive charges, but towards negative charges. The reason behind this is because the lines or vectors are facing in the direction of the force that the charge would feel. This information might be generally applicable to people's lives because we've all seen it before when we were children. At some point we've all brought two magnets close together and try to line them up, only to feel the force of them repelling each other."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,157,"From what we have learned in the course throughout the year, the topic of circuits seems to be the most applicable to influence our everyday life. Though how do circuits affect our everyday life? To provide a specific example we can view the effects of circuits in the light switches of our home. When a single switch controls a single bulb we can see that the light bulb is a series circuit. When we see that the switch is able to control a multiple amount of bulbs then we can see that the switch is a part of the parallel circuit. We can see predominately series circuits at work all around us with the most common places being at our homes and vehicles. We see them at work when in our everyday household appliances such as refrigerators and water heaters. As briefly mentioned before we can see them at work with lamps.    "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2368,"A concept would be circuits. What are some types of circuits? There is an open circuit, a closed circuit, a series, and a parallel circuit. A closed-circuit would be when the circuit would work on its own. An open circuit could be when it has a switch or something that would require you to flip it to start the circuit again. This is the light switched to turn on our lights at home. A series circuit is when all the components will be connected from one end to another, making the flow a single path. And a parallel circuit the components are connected across. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2075,"Over the course of these past few weeks, one question on a concept that we learned about is this: If the electron current in a circuit theoretically never ends, then why can't we create machines of perpetual motion? I believe this has something to do about energy, and how some of it is lost in the movement of these particles. We know that energy is conserved. And some of the energy we generate in these machines escapes and cant be reused. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2123,"Question: Since current is never-ending, or the electrons going around a circuit are always present, why don't/can they go through around forever?In a circuit, I don't believe that electrons are created, destroyed, used up, or even lost. When a circuit receives a source of electricity, the source acts as a pump for the circuit. The pump is able to move the electrons throughout the circuit, and when it shuts off, the electrons don't necessarily go anywhere or destroyed. I suppose they would remain stagnant until the pump/source of electricity is activated once again. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2365,"What is a fuse, how does it work, and why is it necessary?Fuse's are thin strips of conductive material that are designed to break / melt in response to extreme heat brought on by excessive current. They're necessary for the protection of the components inside any particular device, since they break the circuit running this excessive current through the device. It acts as a safety net to protect the wires and components from damage."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,133,"Why does a series circuit configuration create a larger equivalent resistance than a parallel circuit configuration?A series circuit configuration creates a  larger equivalent resistance because the resistance would combine since there is only one path for the current to flow. A parallel configuration would create multiple options for the current to flow, therefore lessening the equivalent resistance."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2361,"A question that I had was that since the electrons in a circuit are always there, why don't they keep on going on and on forever? They don't keep on going forever because something prevents the flow of electrons in a circuit. There have to be power sources moving the existing electrons in the conductor around the circuit. Items that prevent this flow of electrons are called insulators. They are known to have low electron mobility with few or no free electrons. Some examples of this include glass, rubber, and oil. Items like this prevent the free flow of electrons."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2359,"I honestly Don't have a question I can think of in regards of the previous labs as im just in confusion for a lit of things and I can't even form a question when I don't even know what is my question. I guess electric fields but I haven't really been taking notes so I can't go back on them. I guess in the first week there was something that interested me was why does a neutral attract positive and negative charges. Because my initial understanding of it was if something had 0 charge or is nuetral it wont attract anything because there is nothing to be attracted too, but the thing is that when we scratched the two pieces of tapes together one had a positive charge and the other a negative as they repelled but once we put the pen (Which has a neutral charge) it affected the tapes and attracted themI wonder why this happen , maybe it could be the electrons or protons at work "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,192,"All things electricity is based on current, resistors, and the circuits. These are in all our electronics today. The light in my house is based on a circuit that lets flowing electrons flow through wires to a resistor. Society would be nothing how it is today without the concept we learned in just these past 6 weeks. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2370,"What is a resistor?A resistor is an electrical component that limits or regulates the flow of electrical current in an electronic circuit. They can be used in electrical circuits to reduce current flow  adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. They are used to provide a specific voltage for an active device such as a transistor. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2100,If current is never ending could there be a power source device which can continuously function? This could help people with supplying endless energy when needed and could help places which don't have energy. These devices could create energy on their own without the need of an external devise which would make their use endless. If these devices were to work on their own then they could be taken to different places which energy is difficult to obtain.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2367,"I really liked the concept of short circuit from last week's lab. I learned from this week's lab is being able to determine the difference between series and parallel circuits. If two objects are connected in series, all of the current that passes through 1 will also pass through 2. In parallel, right side of object is connected to right and positive while the left side object is connected to left and negative terminal. Knowing how circuits work, we would know how light bulbs work, how to prevent electricity supply to malfunction, etc. It's always around us in our everyday life. We use electricity with almost everything nowadays and its the reason we can see at night, use our phone and computers, and many more. Without knowing how it works, people may have not been able to invent such a technology to improve our everyday life and make things easier. Nowadays we use electricity with almost everything and we can't imagine a life without it. It is essential and without it, it would be hard to learn in school and expand our knowledge."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2369,"If net electric flux of a closed surface is zero, then what can we infer from this?We went through the Gauss's law and we talked about the electric field, electric charges and flux through the surface. So, i had a small confusion about the question I mentioned above. So, I went back to my notes and lecture notes from previous lectures.i did some readings and found my conclusion about my question.If the net electric flux is zero, we can conclude the following:in a closed surface, if the net electric flux is zero, then we can infer that the net electric charge will also be zero.Since, electric flux is rate of flow if electric field in closed area and if the flux is zero, then overall electric charged within its boundary will be zero as well.Also, we can sat that in that closed surface, there is equal magnitude of positive and negative charges. Which cancel each other to be zero.I later realized the fact about the question that I have. These two are the statements of Gauss's law in fact. My notes and further study made me clear about this particular question about the net flux."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,167,"Why does a series of resistors in a circuit create a larger equivalent resistance than resistors in parallel?Current ""flows"" through a circuit in a similar way to how water flows through pipes; it always moves in the path of least resistance. If current only has one path to take, such as through a series of resistors, then the total resistance of the circuit is the sum of the resistances. However, when there is a junction that leads to multiple paths that each have a resistor, some current goes through higher resistance, but most travels through the lowest resistance. The end result is that the sum resistance of a circuit with resistors in parallel is less than one with a series of resistors."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2362,"The circuit Lab was very interesting and made me understood how the current goes from one to another point and if it is close circuit it will work unless it is open circuit meaning circuit path is not connected. Understanding the capacity of current is important because if you do over the current limit it will combust and damage the equipment. The lab was fun and seeing smoke, and visualizing the change first hand was a great learning experience. I believe this information is important since most of our equipment somewhat deal with circuit and current."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2364,"Why does the current not get used up in a circuit? A current will flow around a circuit feeding off the batteries voltage for energy. With a bulb we are able to see just how strong a current is by seeing the brightness. The brighter the bulb is the more current there is. With circuits we have different types the ones we know of right now is a Series and Parallel. They circuits are connected in a different way for them to be considered one or the other. In a series it is connected right to left of left to right. All of the current needs to pass through object 1 and object 2 for it to be a series. In a parallel we have two objects connected parallel to each other. The right of the objects are connected to the right the + terminal and the left sides of the objects are connected to the left the - terminal. What we learned is that the current depends on the source providing the energy and voltage that the source or sources are providing. The strength of the current is depended on the factors such as energy source, resistors if involved, and amount/type of connection that are within the circuit. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2363,"Among the concepts covered in the lecture and laboratory class, the concept which I personally find interesting is the 3-D dimension. The reason I find the 3-D vector dimension important is that in recent times I have seen many movies and also various fields using the concept of 3-D vector. But, in spite of being interested in the topic, I hardly had any knowledge about the back-end implementation of this technique. I was keen to understand the in-depth process of its implementation.  Apart from this, I have tried to research this topic on the internet, but I was unable to find the process in an easily understandable manner. All of them were a little difficult to understand.  In the Physics class when the professor started explaining this topic I was so amazed by the precise explanation of my professor. There was a problem I saw while studying this concept and the question was:- In a local bar, a customer slides an empty beer mug down the counter for a refill. The height of the counter is 1.24 m. The mug slides off the counter and strikes the floor 0.20 m from the base of the counter. And the question was to find out the velocity and direction, therefore for the 1st time, it seemed hard to me to find out how can we calculate the velocity with just the height and base of the object. Later on, while going through the notes I found that we can use the question of h= 1/2gt^2This made sense to me cause we have the gravity acting here and we can find the time and put it in the equation of velocity. Thus everything started making sense to me after going through this concept of 3-D vector. Many factors including magnitude and direction which contribute to the working of the 3-D dimension vector."
