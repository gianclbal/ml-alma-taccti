2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,167,"Overall, classes switching to an online format made it more difficult to stay motivated and to have the same degree of concentration on school work as I used to have before covid. However, after being in this position for several semesters now, I have learned that the best way to counteract the above issues is to make a routine and stick with it. By this I mean have a consistent sleep schedule, eating schedule, and dedicated portions of each day to work on assignments. Personally, I have been on a similar routine to the one I had when classes were in-person and I lived on campus which has helped to prevent bad habits and falling behind on school work. Another problem that I hear other students having is procrastination, but I have found that I have so much free time that I almost never have anything productive to do besides school work, so I usually complete things early. Lastly, in my opinion, online classes usually are not that bad and pretty bearable, so I'm not very concerned about my learning, but I'm definitely looking forward to things going back to normal."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2362,"- For me, online learning is very hard, even though it is very convenient. I just like being physically in class and interaction between student and teacher. I also feel like I learn better and focus. With online learning I sometimes tent to fall behind and more room for procrastination. For my well-being, I tend to go out in nature (hike, travel, game, and gym) it keeps me sane and motivated. I believe everyone should have something to do in their free time to keep their mind  fresh and not get overwhelm by work."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,157,I have found that the hardest thing about online classes has been about how it has affected my focus in lectures.  It has become very simple for us students to tune out of what is being discussed during the lecture with the easy access of the internet from our computers. If tempted to check something on the internet a student only has to simply click on their web browser and the lecture becomes a background noise. Their attention has switched from learning to whatever they are looking at as they surf the web. Some professor styles seem to have changed as well where they want students to focus on what they say during the lecture and then for note taking to go back and watch the lecture recording. This has been less effective for me as the material isn’t being retained as efficiently from taking notes while they originally explain and take more time to listen to the same thing repeatedly. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2364,Online learning has been definitely challenging and a different experience. What is nice about it would probably be the time that you have to yourself and no need for commute to school. What I can say is that it is more challenging to stay on top of work. It is really easy to get comfortable and get lazy with online school. Things I generally do is take breaks get something to eat if I'm not getting an assignment. The last thing I want is to just lose my mind staying at my computer all day so I think its good for anyone to take frequent breaks to keep your mind fresh. Being at home has been nice in its own ways but always nice to go out and get more physical interaction from time to time. You can definitely feel isolated when you just stay at home all the time. What I can say is that I've had time to reflect and the time for myself has been nice with online learning.  
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2368,"Online classes have impacted my learning because the lessons are modified to be able to be taught over zoom rather than in person. For certain classes, group work can become awkward when people do not want to participate. I have been using my resources, especially when I am confused about how to do something. Sometimes the workload is a bit crazy but I just need to improve my time management to get them done in time. I listen to music and watch tv/ movies to relax to not be stressed all the time. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2105,"Online classes made it both easy and harder for me to learn. You get to stay home and go to school but the only down fall is that, if you have a bad professor who is not really that good at remote learning, good luck trying to understand what they are teaching. Sometimes their handwriting is horrible and their mic is broken/muffled. For self care, I usually go outside and skate, like 1-2 times a week. Trying to be active in someway that I can. In terms of classes, this class is easy and easy to understand. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2360,"It hasn't been doing well for me because online classes have still been making me lazy. I would wake up five minutes before going to class, I get to turn off the camera that I don't have to show my face, and still feel like that I haven't been learning this whole time.  Nowadays people are only doing school only to get points and leave rather than learn from the materials of the class. But on the good side, since it's online I form study groups with my peers to learn the topics in class so that we can understand. Of course, think it's much easier since we don't have to go to school in person but for me, it would be meaningful if I got to learn face to face in person. As for my self-care, I would binge-watch series of anime, spend time with my dog, go out for drives to keep myself sane, and participate in my church activities. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2359,Honestly this online learning is really tough because at times it just depends on the professor because if the professor doesn't like doing online learning then that will reflect how the prof will teach the class and at times sometimes I find it a waste of time to even go to class because i don't feel like i am learning anything and it sucks because I want to feel like my time and money was well spent but im feeling that because of this online learning it has mostly been wasted. With an online class you can't really interact with classmates unless you are required too through group work but also that with online learning you have to be more accountable with yourself because you can be tricked into thinking you have all the time in the world because you are inside all day but being in your home can lead you to distractions so the learning environment is also important for online learning. My only main concern is that once we are out of covid what will my attitude be like once Im back in the classroom how will the online learning experience affect my in person learning. I keep sane by trying to take break in between doing work because if I stay stuck at my desk doing work ima just be there even longer and it helps my sanity haha
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2363,"Since I am not used to not being in person, I believe that online classes had a significant impact on my learning. It made me sad at first because I had such a great time in San Francisco! Being able to do it in person made it a lot easier, particularly because resources were much more accessible and convenient! Right now, I try to light a candle, open the window, listen to music, and just relax for self-care. I still use face masks for self-care on occasion, and I would do something that makes me happy. For example, after a long day of studying for an exam, I could treat myself to my favorite food or take a long walk with my dog - both of which are well deserved! I'm worried about my learning and well-being, so I'll continue to prioritize education, but make sure I don't have a clouded mind so I can retain information."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2369,"Everyone is having some hard time with this ongoing pandemic, I am no exception to this situation. I prefer in person learning method rather than online format. But, this covid situation is out of my hand of control. So, I am trying my best to cope with this situation. Online classes at first were overwhelming for me. With the exams format, lecture notes and others. But, along this time, I am able to adapt with my situation. I am getting the hang of lecture notes and other materials. Especially, with the recordings, I am able to go back to the subject matters to the part I don't understand.For, my self care. I am trying to stay fresh, with biking and hiking occasionally. Online classes save my time to get to school, which I can use to invest in study and other productive activities. But, I believe online classes are not that productive but it also has its plus points. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2357,"I had a great difficulty adjusting to quarantine. My mental health began to significantly disintegrate when quarantine hit and so I had to take a semester off of school in order to recover. Since then I have just made it my job to be vaguely busy, not think about my current living situation, and surround myself in supportive friends that I can support in turn. The one upside for me about quarantine is the ease for which I can go to classes. I don't think there is much self-care I can do in my current situation though. Slowly working through my thoughts and surrounding myself in loved ones has been the most helpful thing I have found to maintaining my mental health."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2115,"Online classes have definitely taken a toll on me. I feel like my mental health has taken a hit, and I have found it substantially harder to stay focused in all of my classes. Being stuck at home all day and having work being piled up on my to-do list every single day has affected my time management skills and awareness of what actually needs to get done. To try and help adverse these feelings, what I do for myself is go to work. And by that, I mean physically, because it allows me to leave the house and feel like 'getting away', even if it is just for a few hours at a time. I also enjoy riding my bike through the neighborhood, as well as go sightseeing in the city with a close friend. We are both busy all the time so it's nice to have another person who relates to you and understands what you're going through.Next semester, I am concerned that I will undergo the same worrisome cycle of feeling behind in all my classes and not being able to learn the material in a timely manner, all while having extracurriculars and work to do."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2100,"Online classes have really changed the way I learn. Before when I had question it was easier to get it answered, but now with everything being online it's more of a hassle. To get a question answered you have to wait a day or so. That makes paying attention at all time crucial because if you happen to miss one section and don't understand it then it will take more time to get it completely. To deal with the stress of online learning I have taken time out of the day to do something I like such as go running, play soccer, watch a movies, or even play video games. It helps distract my mind from school work and helps me relax. I do worry that I won't learn as well through online classes. Most of the classes I have require us to solve the work on our own so I don't know if they way I understand a section is correct."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2361,"Online classes have made learning easier for me since it easier for me to ask questions in chat as compared to a large classroom. I have also saved a lot of time that I would spend commuting and that has been to good use for assignments. For self-care, I have been going out more with friends and family and have made it so that I give myself a 3 day weekend where I do not work on schoolwork or extracurriculars. I have a concern about how I will be able to time manage with less free time available once the pandemic is over, due to commuting but I am excited to get the chance to head back to campus someday soon and interact with people in person instead of just online virtually through a screen. For now, I am making the most of the pandemic by taking extra free time and putting it to good use."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2367,"For specific classes, online classes made it harder since most teachers are new to teaching online. For example, I have a teacher that teaches very fast and most classmates are confused. There's a study group chat and everyone seems to not get his lectures and we tend to learn it better by ourselves. Online classes also impacted my sleeping schedule since I usually wake up later. Waking up early for class is very hard for me and I've been sleeping much earlier to help with that. I know some friends that are willing to take a break from school until online classes are over. I don't mind having online classes but I do agree that for some classes, it is almost mandatory to have in person class to learn. Teachers have been assigning crazy amount of homework ever since online classes started and students are procrastinating more than we usually do. When you think about it, it should be other way around since we're already at home but something about online classes makes you wanna procrastinate. Zoom lectures are so boring to students that some fall asleep in class and wake up when the class is already over. Especially my 8AM class, I struggle to stay awake but I know that people are asleep in that class since barely anyone answers his questions even though they're easy. I've been more organized than ever to help with my self-care and managed to have an efficient reminder to remind me about homework and to remind me to sleep early so I wouldn't get tired during class the next day. Working out helps me stay focused and having time to have plenty of naps help when you're not used to waking up early."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2131,"Honestly, online learning has been absolutely dreadful. I hate how many professors do not try to put in the effort to make it a proper learning environment. Also, some of us do not have the luxury of quiet space at home to do homework or study. It doesn't help either that we can't go to a local coffee shop as they are all closed. All in all, with online-based learning, I feel like I have not learned a single subject. I am just doing the assignments and protects just to pass the class at this point. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,192,"I have been on a quarter term system for the past few years of my student career, so even transferring to San Francisco State and taking classes here had an impact on my learning. It's a lot slower paced, which I enjoy. I don't have to frantically think about the next midterm as one ends for a class and I have a lot of time in between classes. Learning online I have done before at my previous school, and it never went really well. Now I think I've matured enough to manage my time better with online classes. To take care of myself during this time, I just stay indoors the whole day. It’s boring but it gives me time to study, do homework, and play games. My concerns for learning are on an internship for the upcoming summer, my GPA, and my current classes. Since they all connect kind of, I’m just focusing on my classes at the moment. It helps using a calendar to never be late to things, even though I’m still late to things."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,133,"Online classes have disabled my ability to learn. I'm not grasping any concepts. The most frustrating part is when we go back to in-person classes I know that I'll probably fail a few classes because I'm not learning anything now. I used to be a 4.0 student. Now I have a steady 3.6. I'm trying to learn all these concepts on my own which is impossible. Being online has effected my mental health significantly. I am forced to sit in my own feelings now that I am home all the time.In the end, I'm not doing well. I find myself relying on the presence of others to distract me from my reality. I have no idea how to begin my self care. The only remedy I can think of is a drastic life change because I hate that I felt societal pressure to choose college. Now that I'm here in college, I hate the situation I put myself in.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2366,"Online classes have greatly impacted my learning due to the fact that I have ADHD and have a bit of a hard time focusing. The online learning process has not made things any easier because every part of my house already has a designated purpose for example my bed is where I sleep, my desk is where I do my makeup, the family room is where I watch TV, the dining room is where I eat etc... What I have been doing for self care is a lot of skin care along with baking. I have been having an overwhelming amount of work lately,  I am taking 6 classes which is more than I normally take along with running multiple small businesses. I am very concerned about my learning because I am unable to get information to stick with me, I tend to forget information much quicker ever since the whole remote learning process started. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2075,"As an introvert, it was kind of nice to switch to online classes at the start, since we were getting a break from being in environments with a lot of people we didn't know. However, as time goes on, it does start to get very tiring having to do all this work from a desk at home. I'm starting to find it more difficult to pay attention to the lectures in a zoom meeting, and realize that going to class in person is what I would rather do instead. When everything is online, it gets very boring at times, and difficult to keep track of everything despite the fact that the technology to make everything easier is literally at our fingertips. It's the lack of a change of pace/environment that makes it especially dull when it comes to online learning. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2358,"I believe that online classes have added a lot more work to compensate for not being in-person. Because of this extra work, there was a lot more stress in terms of workload for school. However, I do not have to commute to school anymore and I save a lot more time because I stay in one place. I believe that I learn better in person rather than online for some classes like math and science. But for my computer science major, I think it's better to be online because you have your whole computer set up at home comfortably while also using what the lecture is teaching with actual coding practice. I am afraid that I will eventually get too much work to the point of breaking down. Being a full-time student means hours and hours of work and it can get really bad if all the assignments are assigned on the same dates."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2119,Online classes made a significant impact on my learning in both positive and negative ways. I think that it effected me negatively because i didn't get to have all the hands on experience in all of the lab sections. I think that it impacted me in a good way because I can work a job through these times and pay for my tuition. I think it has also made it more difficult to seek out for help because everything is through a camera and screen. That also taught me how to be more dedicated to problems and find out other resources to help. Things I do to stay sane is go surfing between classes or I go to the gym and workout. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2123,"Online classes have definitely impacted my motivation for upkeeping consistent effort and determination. There are many days where unfortunately I am content with giving minimal effort, which is reflected in my assignments. In addition, at the start of the semester we had many newcomers in a club that I am involved in, Formula SAE. Over the period of just a few weeks the number of new participants has dropped down to 5 from 20; I presume that these individuals either have scheduling conflicts or suffer from the same phenomenon as I am: losing motivation. To stay sane I find myself enjoying finding new music, working on my car, staying connected with friends, and remembering to step away from the computer as much as I can."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,2370,"Online classes have been good, the only problem is that I am not as motivated to study and complete my assignments. It's harder to stay focused inside my house because I have a lot of distractions like my family. I am trying my best to be more focused and motivated even though I have had a hard time this semester. I am also trying to get back into exercising and eating healthier for my self care because I have been feeling very lazy and unmotivated with everything in my life. I also decided that I will stay off of social media because it is a very big distraction for me and I want to focus more on spending time with my family and learning new skills like cooking. Lastly I want to get myself into reading and I ultimately want to learn new things in life like business (stocks), real estate, etc."
