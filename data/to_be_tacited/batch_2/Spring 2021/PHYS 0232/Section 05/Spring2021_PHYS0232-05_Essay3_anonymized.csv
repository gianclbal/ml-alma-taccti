2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2407,"One concept that has been covered recently in both lecture and Lab is the use of conductors and how they are used both inside and also outside of the physics lab. Some materials that are conductors are silver, gold, copper, and steel. There are also many insulators like rubber, glass, oil, and wood. These are important to know because they can be found in everyday electronics. There are also resistors that can break up the flow of electricity or slow down the flow so that an object does not get overwhelmed. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2405,I think a lot of what we learn in this class can be applied to our everyday lives. The activities we do are all somehow related to things we see every day but just don't notice it. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2404,"There is one concept of circuit discussed in the lab which I find really interesting and I think that it is a good concept for people to understand. Which can help them in their life and can be beneficiary in the society. There was a concept of how wiring in our home is done. Like in parallel or in series. Generally it is done in parallel. Because parallels wiring helps to let us choose which objects we want to lit together and which one separately. In series wiring all the objects will lit together and which will not give enough power to objects to get enough brightness and they will use more extra power than turning on separately. So in our homes, offices and other places like this, parallel wiring is used for objects. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2401,"Why do two positive/negative charges repel?Since both charges work in the same direction, if it were positive, the forces would naturally repel each other and if it were negative, the forces would be attracted to it. However if two of the same charges were to be brought together, their forces would act against each other and thus repel each other. If there were two polar opposite charges however, their forces would act in the same direction of each other and would be attracted like magnets on a fridge."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2415,"My question would be how linear density could be useful to know and how it could be applied to troubleshoot appliances at home, so you don’t need to hire people all of the time? Linear density is represented by lambda(λ), which is charge over length. In my time in the navy, I did work on electrical components that required an understanding of wavelengths and how they affect the system. An understanding of charges and how they are measured is very important to technology nowadays. Our phones use this application constantly. I read a lot of tech manuals that showed you how important a frequency can be to a component. At home, I can use this knowledge to make sure I am using 60Hz chargers. I can also make sure to account for the voltage that we learned this week, both in the lab and in the lectures. It is very important to not use the wrong charger, but it is also important to not have to buy new things all the time. If you can make sure that your charger will not damage other equipment, it can be beneficial because you won’t require expert advice all the time. You have to make educated guesses sometimes. This will save you money in the long run. It isn’t advised to do things that you are not confident in of course."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2411,"How can understanding circuitry better, help humanity advance? Being able to understand exactly how electricity works in a circuit is very important to our survival. Our society has progressed to a point where electricity can also be considered a fundamental necessity. We use it to heat our homes, to power our machines, to have online classes. If we failed to understand how circuits work, we wouldn't be able to diagnose and account for problems when they arise. Knowing the difference between how a circuit works in series vs in parallel or how whether affects circuitry can be important in potentially saving lives. We can look at Texas and how they had not planned for the cold which resulted in many of the people being without electricity. This is something that could have been avoided if the Texas lawmakers took the time to understand these things and the ramifications of what would happen if they didn't take appropriate measures."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2414,"We've learned how electrical potential energy flows from highest potential to lowest potential. This is one of the fundamental phenomena that allows batteries and electricity to power devices. Since the charge will seek out lower potential energy areas within its system, that can be used to get power to a motor without having to use any power in transportation itself. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2408,"If we have a positive charge inside an electric field, will it attract the electric field lines or not?This is a very common question that seems very simple to answer but many seem to get confused or get it wrong. I would say that sometimes I would get this answer wrong because I sometimes have one of those moments when I just forget a simple question. To answer the question, we know that if the charge was negative, the force of charge would make the electric fields attract towards the negative charge. If we know this, then we should get an idea of what would happen if the charge was positive. You can think of it as the opposite of a negative charge, so if negative attracts electric field lines, then we can say that positive charges will not attract electric field lines, they would actually go the opposite direction, away from the positive charge. So if you ever have to look at an electric field and describe the charges, just look at the arrows and if they are going away from the charge, then you know it’s positive, if the arrows are going towards the charge, then the charge is negative."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2406,"I think physics is important for everyone because it can keep you aware of what is possible. Good knowledge of physics can make your life safer and easier. It will probably help me in the future will computer science, even though I'm not sure how. Even if the specific information isn't useful, practice with problem-solving is always a good thing. If everyone knew more about physics, there wouldn't be as many car accidents every day. Learning about physics makes you more careful when driving because you understand how much energy your car produces and how bad it would be if you crash."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2409,"Do circuits really matter?I thought this question would be interesting to me for a number of reasons. We just went over circuits last week and as we were doing the lab, I thought to myself why circuits are so important, and what would happen without them or if they were improper and wrong. Well, as the lab went on, my questions had been answered. One reason they matter is that this is how all of our electricity actually works. Everything has a circuit and has a ""circle"" of wires that goes around which carries a charge of electrons which ultimately power our lights or electricity. Also, if they are improper or wrong, this can result in sparks which causes house fires. There are lots of house fires today cause by faulty wiring in electrical sockets, or lightbulbs and fires begin because of wires not being connected properly, and once the charge is turned on, it throws sparks around. This was also shown in the lab through when we put the aluminum close together while they were connected to the batteries and it began to heat up because of the flow of charge from the batteries which caused some sparks. So in all, circuits do matter a lot and if it wasn't for the brilliant engineers and minds of our ancestors, we may never have electricity because of them."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,183,"For me, I feel that the current chapters that we have covered are applicable in people's lives today since we are surrounded by electrical circuits and currents. Many houses have wires and cables that help with lighting up the inside and help power the electronics that people use. This information that was covered in class is usually not well known and that some people mainly know the general aspect of currents and circuits so these chapters it can help expand people's knowledge on the matter. Since with circuits, it is a bit complex in that it is a path where electric currents can flow through. When talking about circuits we would need to mention currents in that they are the rate of electric charge passes through. Which would bring us to talking about electric energy and the concept of it. But since most people do not have time to learn about it or is generally not interested that is why it is all the more important to educate people about it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2402,Reflection #3             Why can objects still interact with each other without any physical touch? Electric fields are what makes this possible. Electric fields are essentially the surrounding area of a source charge which can attract or repel other source charges. Understanding the different reactions and properties of the electric field we gain a better understanding of why and how different objects act the way they do with each other. This information may benefit society because we can build on this concept to create new ideas that could potentially change society drastically.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2403,"Which type of circuit would be the most efficient: series or parallel?When looking at these two options for a circuit, there are pros and cons for both.  In a series, everything is connected in one line, where in a parallel, there can be multiple sections where the components are broken up.  The electric current through series is the same throughout, but is broken up between each part in a parallel.  On the other hand, the voltage running through a parallel is the same, while it can vary in a series depending on the resistors present.  There might not be a universally efficient way to set up a circuit, but depends on the circumstances.This can benefit society by understanding the most efficient way to set up a circuits in particular situations.  This can allow for power to be used more effectively and prevent mishaps from occurring.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2416,What is the electric flux? List the qualities.The electric flux over an area is defined as the dot product of the electric field and the area vector. Electric flux for a uniform field through a flat surface is calculated by ΦE=→A⋅→E. Gauss Law states that the total electric flux out of a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed divided by the permittivity. The electric flux in an area is defined as the electric field multiplied by the area of the surface projected in a plane and perpendicular to the field. Electric field are considered to originate on positive electric charges and to terminate on negative charges. Electric flux is also a scalar quantity. It is considered a scalar because it is the dot product of two vector quantities. electric field and the perpendicular differential area.
