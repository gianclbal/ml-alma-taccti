2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2401,"As a Computer Science major, the reason I am in the STEM field is because it draws my interest the most. Math and computer code are easier for me to understand than subjects that aren't in the STEM field. It's easier to go into a field that you can understand easily."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2402,"Reflection #1               I want to go into the STEM field because I like the excitement of improving technology and the infinite opportunities for creating a plethora of things your mind can imagine. Ranging from improving human life as we know it or something smaller such as making a game is very vitalizing knowing that we can create our dreams, of course with the help of others and studying. The fascination and growth of anything part of the STEM field has increased exponentially and just being part of that wave of possibly creating the world’s most favored game or the most high-tech accessory is enough for me to feel proud and to take proud of my studies. Another reason of wanting to be in the STEM field Is because not many of my family members are part of that field so to me it feels like I can stand out from the rest of family."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2403,"Ever since I was little, I had this idea that I wanted to be an engineer.  At the time, I did not really understand what engineers do, but my parents were all for it.  As time passed, I developed interest for sciences and mathematics.  I finally understood what engineers do, specifically civil or mechanical, and wanted to pursue that as my career.  Of course, I did not face any hesitation from my parents and they encouraged me to continue on this path.  After more research, I learned that engineers make a decent salary and will still be relevant for many many more years.  This was also a big push factor for me to become an engineer, but I also loved the way that engineers collaborate with each other on projects to create something that everyone will benefit from.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2404,"The reason I want to go into this STEM field is that, It includes many things which I am interested in and I like to do. Science is very vast thing and I think, this is very interesting tom learn about new technologies and creating something different. People spend most of their time based this inventions and without these technologies we cannot even take a breath and we are so much influenced by them. Inventions based on this field provide us relief and we like to do it often. People like working with this things and we can do anything with these things. We play lots of games on different devices and we look for many things on it. So I think this field is mixture of different parts that anybody like to do anytime. These are one of the reasons I enrolled into this field and I want to learn more about this."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2405,At first I did not know what field I wanted to go into because I was new to college and had no idea what the real world was like. My parents are the ones who pushed me into the field along with my uncles. After seeing my uncles working in the same field and the jobs that pay well and they tell me all the benefits of the field. Mainly they are computer science majors and especially living near the silicon valley I know there are unlimited opportunities to find high paying jobs close to home.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,232,"ive always wanted to be in the STEM field when i was young. i loved computers and being able to play around with new technology as i was growing up. i was born in 1989 so i grew up threw dial up and how computers and mp3 players evolved. also how we communicate with tech. i joined the military in 2012 and was lucky to get my job as a radio frequency technician in the air force. i was assigned to a tactical communications squadron in florida where the job encompassed a great deal of networking skills as far as routing and switching, satellite communications, communications security, and a lot of IT work. that job increased my desire to stay in the STEM field. Now my focus is on computer science and i love it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2406,"I chose to study computer science because I've always been interested in it. I started programming around 5th grade because some of my family members are programmers and it seemed cool. I think it will also help me get a good job in the future. My goal is to work at a company that makes games that I enjoy. If I wasn't studying computer science I would probably work on cars or learn to weld. Some of these required classes are making me rethink my decisions but hopefully, it will be worth it in the end."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2407,I would like to get into the stem field because I think it will benefit my career in the future. I would love to get out my ideas into the world and being in the STEM field it can make those ideas come into reality. I also find the STEM field is getting bigger and bigger each year and by studying it I will be able to contribute my knowledge to those who also have an interest in joining. There are also many fun projects that are used to learn and create new things that benefit my learning. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2408,"Reflection 1Angel Antunez	I have always wanted to go into the STEM field ever since I moved to California in 2005. I moved to the city of Palo Alto which is a big technology city. Palo Alto is home to Apple, Google, Microsoft, Tesla, and many more tech companies. I remember seeing Steve Jobs's keynote speeches when he first introduced the iPhone to the world. At the time, it was a big deal because there had never been a phone like this before. Watching that speech inspired me to go deeper into software development and coding. I looked at how apps were created and what programs you need to code them. I also loved video games so I looked at how they were made and became very interested. So looking at all of the technology around me, I knew that I wanted to major in computer science. I would definitely want to work at a big company like Google, looking at their offices and how people work there seems to be very fun, the food there is also amazing."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2409,"I wanted to go into the STEM field for multiple reasons. When I was applying for college in high school, I applied to major in Computer Science. Back then, I did not know the difference from computer science or engineering so I just assumed that ill go to school, get my degree and go make money. However, once I began my second year at San Francisco State University, I had to take my first major required class, which was Computer Science 210, or known as Intro to Comp Sci. After I took the class, I ended up having a final grade of a D and that is not passing to go onto the next course. During the class I realized that coding was not for me and I can't see myself sitting behind a computer my whole career. So I switched to Computer Engineering because I like more of the hardware aspect of computers and I do see myself fixing, creating, inventing, and hopefully revolutionizing the industry just like Steve Jobs, or Mark Zuckerberg. I have also decided to get my masters in Computer Engineering once I graduate from SFSU and am excited to get out into the world of technology."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2410,"Growing up, I always had an interest in space, robotics, technology and all the ""nerdy"" interests. This propelled me to dive further into the topics and I truly love the logic, reasoning, and innovation that STEM fields offer. As I've gotten older, the ACTUAL reason I want to go into a STEM field is for the MONEY. Especially living in California near the Bay Area, it seems to be the best way for me to pursue the life I want to live outside of work and school. Fortunately enough for me, I do enjoy the STEM fields of study and have always wanted to pursue a career in it. I originally wanted to be a mechanical engineer, but a few years a go I shifted my sights towards computer science. I've always worried that the cliche ""if you love what you do you'll never work a day in your life"" would never apply to me, but the longer I pursue a STEM field, and the more I see technology progress in the world, I feel more and more confident that I ""won't work a day"" in my life. Realistically though it's about the money. If being a data scientist or software developer paid half of what they do, I would probably be pursuing a different field."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2411,"My reasoning for wanting to join the STEM field is because i have always been fascinated with STEM subjects. While Computer Science is my major, and my favorite STEM subject, all of the STEM subjects interest me. Chemistry would be my second favorite. While I enjoy physics, I also think physics is the hardest subject for me. Despite this, I greatly value the importance of physics and understand its importance. All STEM subjects are important though, and that is just another reason why I enjoy the STEM field and wanted to go into it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2412,"I mainly want to go into the STEM field because it’s where my major is. I haven’t decided on a career path yet, so I chose a major in this field mainly to have something to fall back on in case the career I choose doesn’t pan out for me. Apart from that, I don’t really have any big motivations for being in the STEM field. I’m not sure what I want to do still, but I do have a passing interest in astronomy and some computer related fields."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2413,"the reason i would like to go into the stem field is because since a little kid technology has always been curoius to me. i have been thinking how does all this come to life? how does this work? i feel that i would feel really proud of my self to be making the biggest thing ever. i want to see how phones are created. the world has alot of expensive technology that people have no idea how it is made. and also i have seen those entrepeneurs that have created apple, google, and facbook, and i would like to make something cvreative that alot of poeple would use."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,183,"The reason why I want to be in the STEM field is mainly due to my major and that I feel that it can bring me toward my life goal. For me, I thought computer science would be fun to do and could be helpful for my future. Computer science is a fairly new thing that is implemented in the world and that it has helped create many things in the world that progress technology further. For me, I believe that the STEM field is a field that should be prioritized the most in the world as it can help everybody. Another reason for me besides helping people with the field that I am in is so I can get a well-paying job. As money is what runs the world so I want to use anything I can to do it but helping people with the knowledge earned is what comes first."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2414,"I want to because it is challenging, interesting, and is likely to pay well. I'm a Computer Science Major so, I like that I can use logic and math in ways that are very functional. Even if it gets more complex, it also relays a great feeling of accomplishment. There does not seem to be a limit to how I could use my degree, so I look forward to seeing how it may be applied. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2415,"I want to go into the STEM field because I was an electrical engineer for the navy for five years. This experience introduced me to the life of science through troubleshooting technology. I since changed my major from electrical engineering to computer science. I have always broken apart things because I am curious as to how the components work together to do a larger task. I wish that one day I will create a program to help veterans and amputees around the world, who go through many physical hardships."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2416,"I love finding innovative solutions to real-world challenges. STEM challenges me, frustrates me but actually helps me be a better person. Technology will forever be in our lives and it's our future. I also want to be apart of tech because I live in the bay area and I want to make good money which will open doors for me and my future family. I like the fact that I'll be able to travel often and still work from home. I also get to play a role in some of the country's major discoveries and developments. There is also a racial/skin color discrimination in the tech field that I'd like to help workout. I want to be an example for other black girls to get into STEM. Its a very fulfilling industry. Seeing people love my products.I can't wait to see my future end products. Looking forward to my future in stem."
