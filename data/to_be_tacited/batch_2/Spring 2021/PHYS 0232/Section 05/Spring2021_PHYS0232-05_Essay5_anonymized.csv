2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2411,"My greatest take away from this class is that it really helped me understand the physics adjacent class. This class was a great supplement to that. I think my biggest issue with  Physics 230 might be due to everything being virtual, but i felt like it was a lot harder to understand the concepts when there is very little interaction. However, with the lab portion, having this hands on experience really helped me understand the core concepts that we were learning in the other class. I hope once everything goes back to normal this won't be an issue and that future students won't have such a difficult time in Phys 230 like I did."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2415,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that science can be fun. Learning by doing is a great way to remember what you have read. The electrical stimulation was so fun to watch and play with. We got to see how electric fields interact and how they can make sense of all of the information we took in. I don't think that we would have been able to imagine it without the experiments as well. Now we can use the website to further learn our degrees and keep on practicing. This will also help us teach it to others. This way we will be able to teach others with an image in our minds to fit the math. I can also play around with components at home with a better and safer understanding of what I am doing. Electrical components are the most interesting to me and this fulfilled that. I like to work on my motorcycle and this will help me do it in a safer way. I wish I had known about these free websites before, I could have used them and created a stronger base for myself."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2404,"I think the greatest take away from this class for me, is that understanding the theory and doing it practically makes a lot more sense than just reading the theory. Doing things in real life is like doing something you might never know and you want to learn something from it. From this class, I learned that physics is easy if you understand how we can use it in daily life. Sometimes, we even use the rules of physics but we never pay attention to it or we do not realize that. If someone why the particular thing should be done in the certain way, we know it has to but we sometimes do not know the reason behind it. Which is the rule of the physics. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,183,"The greatest takeaway from this class is that I was able to learn more about physics in the sense of actually applying it and seeing it happen. Since with lecture we mainly talk about the fundamentals of the topic and use a calculation to solve the problem that we are assigned. In the lab class, we do that as well but I can see it being applied to the real world in that I know what I am working toward. I could use what I have developed in this course for the other course that I am planning on taking such as planning my time out better and getting better at working in groups. I feel that his course has helped with my understanding of physics in that it is working well in conjunction with my lecture class so when I learn something from my lecture class I can see it being applied in the lab with help with my understanding."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2407,The greatest takeaway from these classes was being able to visualize everything I have learned so far in physics. I tend to better when I am doing some sort of experiment rather than just focusing on equations and reading material all the time. I was also able to learn from some of my peers who would explain difficult concepts that I didn't understand before. I enjoyed doing some of the simulations and also one of the projects we would do at home when we would have to gather our own materials. This made the lecture fun and easy to follow while also being able to see the different results my other classmates would get. I think that the lab is a great way to learn physics especially when you have a group that can help and learn from during the class. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2406,"Like my previous physics classes, this class will help me understand more about problem-solving as well as many physics topics. I learned a lot more about things like electricity and circuits than I ever had before. It was interesting to learn about why homes use parallel circuits to power everything. Learning about flux and SAGE was cool because I had never really learned much about them before. I also learned that some labs are hard to do online where you can't really discuss with other classmates as much."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2414,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that even without the complex formulas, there are aspects to physics that can be understood through simulations and experiments. In the main class, it is often difficult to understand what is going on or what I'm even solving for when just looking at a diagram and all of the equations that 1/2 in greek and no labels (Please look into the non-labeling of variables in our formulas in our textbook please.)"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2409,"My greatest takeaway from this class was having the knowledge of more physics other than simple basic physics from last semester. This semesters physics 232 went deeper into physics and also used more math and other components and other fields of expertise in order to solve for our physics problems. For example, we had to use some coding at times, electricity at times, and a lot of mathematics. It showed me that a class does not just rely on its own unit and topics, but also can rely on other areas of life. I think this class came in handy for me because I may use this information I learned for my future as a computer engineer. However, it really does depend on the job that I secure. Im glad I need physics 232 because it not only taught me what I need to know but it also opened up my eyes to what I may need to know as well, especially since a lot of people say that they will never use something in life when in fact you never know if you may need that topic or not in your future."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2401,"I feel like my greatest take away from this class was to learn difficult subjects by myself. This wasn't the only difficult class I had in general and with the way classes have been run because of COVID, it had only made learning more difficult. However I have learned how to research the concepts I needed to learn without the help of others."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2402,"Reflection #5        The greatest take away from this class is the improvement on my time management skills. Ever since starting this semester I tried to plan out my classes and homework schedule in a timely manner. As this is my fourth semester, it was very difficult getting through work and making deadline without stressing out a lot since I didn’t really have a set plan and set goal for myself every day. Another take away from this class is how much it helped me in PHYS 230. My 230 was asynchronous and the format of the online course was just weird and difficult to understand in general. However, from this lab course, it explained the concepts a lot better and the workload was pretty fair."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2408,"Throughout this class, I feel like I’ve had many take-aways from it. I learned a lot of good things, made mistakes that I now know not to make in the future, and just became a better student overall. I think that the main takeaway that I’m going to take from this class is that I’m a better student when I work well with others. This whole semester I worked on my labs with a group of people and I noticed that I learned a lot more whenever we are discussing different ideas. We were able to solve questions better as a team. I like the fact that I work better with a team because I know that I’m going to be working in teams in my career as a software engineer. Also working in teams, I was able to better manage my time and was able to finish my labs on time. Overall, working in teams was the best experience I had in this class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2412,"For me, the greatest takeaway is that this class  has a lot of real-world usage, unlike a lot of other classes. Circuits, flux, and charge are all used very widely in the world, and it's nice to be able to understand the intricacies of some of these mechanics. Online labs are not the best way to go about things, however."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2416,"My biggest takeaway from this course is I can do things I didn’t think I was capable of – I just have to be persistent and not get frustrated. The most important thing I learned is how to approach problems using what we have learned in class. Usually, the hard part is thinking about what models to use, and how to use them together to solve the problem. This is the most important thing I’ve learned. How failure in something can be good as you learn from this failure and move on trying and trying again. This skill is extremely important and this is what physics imparted on me along with the entire course worth of ideas on physics. I’ve learned how to speak about things in a way that I actually understand beyond a dictionary definition and I’ve been able to derive things about them based on observation and my own work."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2403,"My greatest takeaway from this class was how circuits work and which kind if circuits are used in certain situations.  I went over series and parallel in a previous physics class in high school, but I did not really understand it until this class.  It is interesting how different a series and a parallel is and where it can be used.  A parallel is used in households in order to allow an electric current to flow throughout the house without every source being used.  Seeing where concepts learned in classes can be applied in everyday life really helps illustrate the idea.  Even though I am not an electrical engineer major, I still find concepts like these to be something I am interested in.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2405,My greatest takeaway from this class is all the knowledge I was given. I learned of things that I did not know and I feel it will help me a lot in the future with the rest of my classes and life.
