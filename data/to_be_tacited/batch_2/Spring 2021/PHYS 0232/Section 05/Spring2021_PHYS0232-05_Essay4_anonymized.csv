2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2403,"Since online learning started, I had to adjust to not being able to talk face to face with my peers and professors.  This was difficult to get used to because I learn more from talking with others as well as physically being in a classroom.  After coming back to southern California from SFSU, I had to change where I study and the way I study.  It was overwhelming at first, but not used to the formatting.  Sitting at a desk staring at my computer screen for for than 6 hrs a day can take a toll.  I have to remind myself to get up and eat, drink and stretch.  I find stretching to be one of the ways to relieve stress and prevent myself from sitting in one place for too long.  Doing anything that has to do with exercising is my biggest way of staying healthy and getting out of the house. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2406,"Online classes are okay, but I can't learn as much. If I'm at home, I have to focus on other things besides learning. I have more responsibilities than I would have if I was physically going to school so sometimes I have to sacrifice school work. The hardest thing to learn online is probably math-related topics. I think physically going to school for most of my classes is better so I can actually focus on learning."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,183,"For me, I feel that online learning has both a positive and negative impact on my learning. Since for staying at home, my living expense is free and that I do not have to rush to class every day and worry about being late. With an online class, the lecture is recorded and that means when I do not understand a part I can review the video and look back at it compare to in-class where it is not recorded and I would need to take notes as fast as I can.  But the negative aspect of it is that when I want to ask for help it is difficult since I understand by asking it in person and with chat, I can not really do it and when having a class discussion I feel unmotivated to say anything unless someone pushes it out of me.  I feel that taking some classes is better online and some are better in person so the online classes are both good and bad for me. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2415,"Online classes have been harder in my experience. I have seen more work pile up in some classes while others are more lenient. The classes that added more work seemed to take advantage of the fact that we are home all the time and used it to push work through. I spend most of my time doing homework and have very little time to myself. It also distances us from the professors and it makes it harder for us to bring up issues on certain subjects. For self-care i have been doing homework outside when I can on my porch. My concerns are mostly for next semester and how it will change. Hopefully, things are better when we come back. We also need activities outside of school to recuperate from long studious weeks."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2414,"Even before the pandemic, I was taking mostly online classes. They have taught me to be much more self-sufficient, and to look for other sources in order to solve problems. I make sure to set aside time to do homework and remind myself that even in harder classes it is not necessary to get straight A's. I try to balance school life with my family, but with two young children, it becomes difficult. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2411,"How has online classes affected my online learning? that is a great question. To start, today happens to be the day my apartment complex decided to test the fire alarms. So today has been a great day for online learning. I have been able to spend all day today having a blaring siren going off making it virtually impossible to hear my teachers. So today has been great. Outside of that, online learning has definitely taken a sever toll on my ability to learn. I've always been a great student but my grades have slipped tremendously this year to the point where I am seriously considering taking a semester/year off from school and going back when classes are back to being in person. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2405,"Online classes have impacted my learning in a good and bad way. It makes it comfortable for me to attend class from home but I feel it is hard to get help when needed. My concerns for my learning are a lot, no one knows how long we will be in this pandemic, and not having in-person interactions makes it much more difficult to learn."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2402,"Reflection #4     Online classes have been okay for me. There are definitely some disadvantages to online learning like having to understand the material on your own or having to work by ourselves. Online learning does leave more room for cheating and slacking off. Procrastination has really been a factor on my learning even though I still will get my work done on time I think the setting has caused me to think that I can get this done today when I would probably take 2-3 days for a simple task. For self-care, I’m trying to stay positive and deal with matters in the moment. I’m generally an anxious person and on top of all the online format it makes me gravitate away from doing assignments."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2407,Online classes have been good so far because I get to spend the majority of my time at home. I do miss have social interactions with most people but I can still make that up with over-the-phone conversations and talking with my family at home. In order to keep my mental health in check I have been exercising at home with some of my friends and I have been seeing great results mentally and physically. I have also been enjoying a lot more of my hobbies since it keeps my mind off of things. I am still looking forward to when we everything opens back up so I can have more fun. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2409,"Online classes have definitely impacted learning in a big way. I feel as if the whole college experience is being in a big class room with a lot of your class mates and fellow students and working together to both learn and develop our social skills and this is essential especially for our future. I also feel like in person learning is much better because you get to be in the class room and physically be with the teacher and asking questions is definitely easier. For self care I am going outside a lot and getting necessary fresh air and vitamin D from the sun. Also exercising and making sure my body and especially my mind are healthy. I don't have many concerns but I only wish that we are back in the class room very soon because it is important to learn in a class setting. Hopefully we will be back in school soon and be able to learn in the correct setting,"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2416,Online classes has impacted my learning a lot because I feel that I have learned much less. Because of the pandemic I lost my job. Yes it gave me free time to study more but I have been stressed because of losing my job. I took on 4 classes this semester. I'm very overwhelmed and am struggling to finish classes. For self care I got liposuction because i gained so much work. I workout once a day but I don't feel its enough. I do not like the sedentary lifestyle that I have been living. I go out on the weekend with my boyfriend but I do miss going to work and being active. The concerns that I have for my learning and well-being is that I won't have good grades and I won't learn anything.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2401,"I do think that most people including myself, have a harder time understanding the material being taught in a online class rather than a face-to-face lecture class. The only benefit besides not risking infection, is that I live and work in Concord, so commuting to and from San Francisco has been a hassle as well as balancing work and schoolwork. Despite the stresses of before Covid and after, I am able to calm down and relax by doing what I enjoy most which is playing video games and talk with my friends through Discord"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2404,"The remote instructions have been very affected on me, because I am not getting good grades and I do not know what to do. I think this way learning will never be completed and I am really willing to attend in-person class. I really hope to continue my classes on-campus. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2408,"Online learning has had a big impact on my life. Transitioning from regular classes to fully online classes was hard at first, but throughout the year, I slowly got more and more used to it. I do sometimes feel like I haven’t fully learned some of the materials covered because they were meant to do in person, so we had to do simulations, which is ok but isn’t the same as learning in person. Taking 5 online classes has had its ups and downs. I feel like taking fully online classes has made me a little lazier. I sometimes put off homework till the last day which isn’t a good idea. Taking little breaks in between classes has really helped me a lot. I also feel like when we go back to school, it’s going to take some time to get used to because we have all spent pretty much a year learning online. I feel like I might struggle to learn the first couple of weeks, but like with online, I’ll eventually get used to it again."
