2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2407,My goal for this class is to improve my knowledge of physics because I have yet to understand some of the main concepts we are going through in the main session. I hope that doing these labs helps get a better understanding of the material through virtual simulations and the small amount of at-home experiments we go through. I hope to increase my knowledge by the end of each lab learning both from my peers and the materials given to me. I also want to be able to understand how we can apply physics you our everyday lives. I will achieve all this by attending class and asking questions when I don't understand what we are trying to learn.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2403,"My long term goal was to graduate with an engineering degree and obtain a job that will be able to support me.  However, a short term goal would to be able to excel in my classes and retain the information I learn.  With both of these goals, taking this class will bring me closer to graduating and developing an  understanding of physics.  Even though the topics being covered may not be crucial to know in the line of work I want to focus on, it is still important to learn the basics of physics to be able to apply it to other problems.  This class is also a required course to pass in order to graduate.  Most importantly, I enjoy taking science and math courses because I learn about how the world around me works."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2401,"I am only interested in computers and history most of the time as far as my interest in school goes, so physics itself doesn't really interest me. At the best I will make a program that uses a formula or a concept in physics in terms of application outside of class. Most often, I see this class as a requirement for my degree and nothing more than that though sometimes I do find concepts that interest me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2408,"My goals for this year are to pass all classes with good grades and to get through the year stress-free. This class is helping me a little bit with those goals. This class is helping me stay on task by having to do the work during class time which is really good. I say that it's good because if I didn't have to do the work during class, I would most definitely have procrastinated, which would have stressed me out more. This class at times does stress me out a little, but that's only because this is a physics class and I have never liked physics. The only reason I'm taking this class is that it's a major requirement for computer science, but the class is fun and interesting at times. Doing the simulations has made physics a lot more interesting for me. This class is also very simple to follow so as long as I show up I know I can pass this class with a good grade.      "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2417,"My goals are to understand Physics in a way that I can help contribute to the field. (i.e. I would love to help advance modern propulsion, in a form that is not combustion but will still be able to lift equal payloads in the same amount of time: into space/in a vacuum.) This class will help me explore/understand physics of the universe, and I will be able to think about ways of using/manipulating such laws/phenomenon of the universe to aid in my goal. I couldn't care about marks/grades but I do understand that maintaining a good gpa will continue to allow me to attend lectures & dabble in different fields of physics in the future (and other fields as well.). "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2410,"This lab helps me in real life because it's pretty close to a job experience. I work with my peers and collaborate to achieve a common goal. I like physics and labs in general because they make sense and in these labs, there are correct results and conclusions to arrive at. Physics in general has been really beneficial for me this semester because the frequency and regularity of homework gives a good structure for study habits. I feel like I check my assignments  daily and am spending a portion of my team each day working on my studies. My biggest goal is to finish college, and having a well-structured study habit is vital to my success."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2412,"My main goal right now is just to get a degree. I don't have anything longer-term, as I still don't know what I want to do in life. This class helps me with this goal as it is a prereq for my major."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2411,"My main goal in life is to get a degree and have a stable job making good money. How this class can help me achieve that goal is by being a class I need to graduate. I am currently a comp sci major so Physics is a requirement for me. Beyond that, This class has been helpful in teaching concepts from the non lab physics class. Physics 2 has definitely been quite a bit more challenging than physics 1 so having this class to help me better understand what we are learning in the other class has been very nice. On the flip side, it is pretty unfortunate that physics is a required subject for comp sci. I don't know how useful this class will be to me once I get a job in the comp sci field."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2404,I am in Computer Science major and I have still some many things in mind. I am not quite sure of my goals but I think there are so many things to achieve and only one thing to accomplish is not satisfaction for human beings. This class is helping me to accomplish the class requirement for my Computer Science degree and I am grateful for that. I think sometimes if you think about something and still there are some things left on the way and you divert you mind in those things and your goal which you decided before gets unaccomplished. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2413,"my goals are to understand the concepts of this class. meaning to have basic knowledge of charges, volts, circuits. we learned about it in the last physics course but it was more about energy and movement. but now it has to do reactions with in elements. and this class will help me achieve it along with the lecture. since one might think it might not be important since engineering is mostly math, but one day we might just have to refer back to this. since i am majoring in electrical engineering, the topics of electric field, circuits and many more. this will be useful for electric majors."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2405,My goal is to get the help I need to be able to pass my physics 230 class. I want to use this as a review class. I believe I can achieve these goals by interacting with you (my professor) and other classmates to ask questions and clear up anything that I might not understand. Being in breakout rooms and seeing what page other classmates are on is a really helpful tool. It can show me if other students are also not understanding concepts that I don't understand and if they do understand it they can explain them to me. I see this class as a review class and not as another class full of work. I really enjoy labs and I feel I am getting exactly what I wanted out of this class.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,183,"For me, at the moment my goal for life is to get a job that pays well and that can support my hobbies. This class can help me achieve my goal by giving me a better understanding of physics and the implantation of it in real life. With physics, it is part of the major which I  am in and that is Computer sciences. By completing and passing this class I can move forward with my goal of living a good life. As the school years go by I continue to stress out about classes and assignments and try to make it work with my social life but that is a hardship that I have to face in order to get to my goal. This lab class is one of those hardships that will help me in life as it is a stepping stone like all the other classes to get me to my goal."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2406,"My goals are to finish my degree and for that, I need to finish this class. Another goal is to learn more about physics. The problems we have to do on WebAssign are pretty hard, but they are fun sometimes when I figure out what I need to do quickly. I'm not really sure why I need this class and the lecture, it must be important in the future. In the future, my goals are to get better at programming."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2402,"Reflection #2                 My goal for this semester is have better time management on my assignments. This class can help me achieve this because since there is a set due date for each lab, I can use that and match up any other assignments due from my other classes. Another goal of mine is to just further my knowledge in physics. A similar lab class has already helped me last semester and so far, this class has also helped me especially when it comes to the actual physics class since we just get bombarded with concepts and readings weekly, it gets too overwhelming, and it’s not really effect for my learning which is why I like having a paired lab class because it’s like extra help. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2414,"My goal is to get a bachelor's degree in computer science and use it to get into a related career. To this end, I am using my GI Bill to go to college full time, and am trying to do my own projects as time allows. This class helps in that it is required for my degree. Physics 2 is difficult, and these labs help me understand the basic mechanics of what is being taught without being bogged down under several high-level math equations. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2409,"Some of my goals in life or better yet, in the next 2 years is to graduate college and also get my masters in Computer Engineering, as well as get a good job somewhere in San Francisco where I can use my skillsets I learned in college and throughout the last 5 years to make money, make a business, create a startup, or even just to do certain things as a hobby. This class can help me prepare and achieve for that in a few ways. Working with groups and other people allows me to expand my experience of working on possible ""projects"" in the future and also develops good communication skills and team building. This class can also help me with the physics aspect of a job I may have in the future. I could have a job that uses more math, coding or physics, and this class will allow me to have a good amount of knowledge on how the basics of physics with calculus works and what goes into this topic."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2416,My goals are to get my degree in computer science. I'd like to become a project coordinator in the tech field. This class will help me earn my degree and will help me know more about about coding. This Physics course is based on creating mathematical pictures of the way the universe works. Physics tends to provide a very good background for people who study computer science. A lot of physical modeling can be done in computer programs. Physics is based on creating mathematical pictures of the way the universe works. Physics really builds on the logic that is integral to computer science. I feel that I can really own my skills through this course.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,5,2415,"My goals are to understand the world around me through science so that I may one day contribute to it. I want to get my degree in computer science so that I may one day create a program that helps out millions of people, maybe billions. This class can help me understand the world around me through facts and experiments. This way I can transform my ideas into realities. For example, learning about electricity and how it interacts with the environment can help me understand problems that I may face when dealing with electricity. If I see damaged equipment and want to begin fixing the issue, I need to refer back to this class so that I can get a better understanding."
