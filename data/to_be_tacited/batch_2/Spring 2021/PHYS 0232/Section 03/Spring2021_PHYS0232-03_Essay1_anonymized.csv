Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,199,I would like to go into the stem field for the interest in future projects as an engineer. I am a civil engineer major with focus on structural or construction engineering. I love mathematics and the placement/making of buildings. Looking over plans/blueprints are very fun. As a kid i always enjoyed puzzles and playing with Lego's and now that i am a college student i can pursue the dream i had as a kid. I have always looked forward to the day i can step into the worksite as an engineer and hopefully in a couple of years i can do so.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2371,"I am majoring in the Computer Science. I am in the Stem field cause of craving to cause a change in the world. I would like to contribute to the Earth with my knowledge to make it better. STEM majors always are there to contribute and come up with new ideas to make things better for technology's sake. Computers, programs, software were always my favorite things to play with. I ended up discovering how to write the software. Since I started, I found joy by solving codes, adding designs and etc. Being part of a STEM major is an honor to me. Physics is really interesting topic where I find joy doing laboratory experiments. There are so many connections between physics and computer science when it comes to computer hardware parts and how they work.  Hoping for great semester!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2372,"Why do I want to go into STEM? I want to go into STEM because it's a field with constant things to discover. I'm an astrophysics major which is one of the fields where discovery is more likely to happen. Finding the way things work in a way that makes sense to the world we know and building on that principle to find other things we don't know is an amazing thing. I've always been an inquisitive person in the way that I always want to know why. This is the reason why I want to go into STEM. Additionally, studying physics we learn about theorems that were discovered many decades ago that are still relevant to this day. Isn't it fascinating to see how even though these theorems and theories were thought of so long ago how they are still relevant to this day? it's interesting to see that they felt the world around them much like we have. Not to mention how these theories like Newton's we use still to this day. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,160,"""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?""I want to go into the STEM field because it is great and hot. Many companies need that and not too hard to find a job. Another reason is I like that. My major is computer science. I want to be a computer programmer because this job has a high income and demand. Maybe I will regret that but right now I want to try. So I want to go into the STEM field to have a stable job and a high income."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,129,"I want to go into the STEM field because I love science and mathematics! The thought of problem solving  and following a procedure to get to the end result really excites me. Computer science is a field that not only involves math and problem solving but includes a great amount of teamwork as well. Knowing how to collaborate and well being an individual worker is the ideal field for me. Although I'm taking this lab as a requirement for my major, I still enjoy physics very much. I have aspirations of starting my own tech company that preferably helps countries around the world. I plan on working in the field as soon as I obtain my bachelors in computer science and will obtain my master's after gaining some hands on experience. My main purpose with being in STEM is to solve problems on a global level."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2373,"I want to go into the STEM field because I want to be able to support my family in the future. Another reason is that I really want to do something challenging so I can push myself to my full potential. I come from a very background in which I did not learn as much math, so going into computer science (a somewhat math-related major), I will push myself to go into a field that I am not comfortable in. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,151,"Honestly, my biggest roadblock with STEM is that I’m not naturally “good” at math. I didn’t have any very good math teachers until well into my college career, so I was convinced that I’m bad at it. I still know I’m not naturally good at math; I have to work much harder than most other people to stay at the same level as them. I was really inspired to pursue Computer Science because of my discrete math class--it was the first math class that had material I both understood and was intrigued by. It was surreal to feel like I was ahead of the class instead of far behind as usual.This changed my perspective a lot on what I wanted to do with my life and how math might tie into that. It also made me want to work with other people who are learning STEM concepts, and to be able to explain tough concepts in an accessible way. I never believed I could do math or computer science until I realized that it was still possible, I just have to work a little more than most people. This led me to work in STEM education, especially working with young girls and computers, because I want every kid out there to know that they can pursue tech careers if they want to. Did you know that the only STEM field to see a decrease in women in the last 30 years was computer science? Sitting in my CS classes where I see one other single woman if I’m lucky, it starts to become more obvious. It’s important to me that the next generation realizes that careers have no gender and just because you’re not a prodigy doesn’t mean you can’t pursue science! You don’t have to be the best of the best to make a meaningful difference in the world. I want to go into STEM so I have the chance to help other people pursue the same things it took me forever to realize I’m interested in."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2374,"I want to go into the STEM field because I like exploration, mathematic, logicality, and practices. Also, the STEM field can benefit our society mostly such as improving productivity and efficiency of works. I have studied both business and computer science. They require totally different critical thinkings. The business field focuses on personal understanding, professional principles, or governmental regulation, but the computer science field focuses more on logic, creativity, and practices.  In addition, since there are various programming languages, we have to be very practical for different languages. Also, technology has changed rapidly, we have to update knowledge frequently. The computer can help us do tasks and deal with a huge volume of information faster than before, it is the field which will bring huge changes for our society. As a result, the demand for job positions related to computer science is huge. I also want to have a job that has a good salary to support my livings and family. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,1828,"I want to go into the stem field because I find it fun and interesting to learn about increasingly complex topics. I want to learn about physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology and computer science. I think physics is my favorite subject even though I find it pretty difficult at first. I love the feeling of after I have worked on something that I find difficult and it begins to make sense. As the time goes by and more of these difficult concepts stack on to each other by the time I take a look at all that I have learned It is more than I would have thought I was capable of. I hope I can one day find a career that can tie in physics and computer science. I still don't know what I would like to do exactly but I am looking forward to it. I think something that would be really cool would be to work for NASA."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2375,"I decided to become a STEM major because of my dad. He and my mother had my sister straight out of high school so he, unfortunately, did not get to attend college. The easier jobs he could get to provide for us were tech jobs. I had never really been aware of how many job opportunities there were until my dad decided to go into tech. I remember growing up and seeing him teach himself about what he needed to know to get these jobs and how hard he worked to move up in the industry since he didn't go to college. As my older sister went to college she chose computer science as her major. Which then led to more exposure to the tech world in our lives. And as I needed to decide on a major I also chose Computer Science since no other field had interested me. Making a decision about your career at such a young age comes with its doubts, but whenever I doubt myself and my abilities, my dad is there to reassure me that the field of tech is bigger than I think and that I don't necessarily have to follow in my older sister's footsteps. Seeing how the tech world gave my father, who is without a degree, the opportunity to provide for us. I am excited to take full advantage of the opportunities it can provide me, so I can give back to my parents, as they have sacrificed so much and worked very hard to give me the life that I live. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,174,"I want to go into STEM because I want to do something meaningful with my life. I don't want to be CEO or anything I just want to contribute to the pinnacle of scientific understanding. I specifically want to become a computer scientist because I feel like I really understand computers. All of the other natural sciences like chemistry and physics are really cool and I felt like I understood them to the extent that I needed to for my classes, but those are all about learning the laws of the universe. Computer science is something else entirely, sure the underlying technology functions purely based off of the same laws that apply to physics and chemistry, but in computer science the rules of how computers solve our problems are dictated by us. Also, unlike the other natural sciences, computer science is so new in recent history that it seems like it's the final frontier. Computer science has advanced at a pace that is completely unprecedented in all other human study. I want to be a part of this golden age of computer science, and hopefully I can contribute in a way that steers us towards a utopia rather than a dystopia where computers are used to control and suppress people. There's also the aspect of making a living wage in the silicon valley. It sucks that, in America, we can't earn a living wage working at a coffee shop, but even if I could, I would be ultimately dissatisfied with my life if all I did was serve people coffee. People need coffee and it's a respectable job, but I want to accomplish something I can truly be proud of when I'm old."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2094,"I want to go into the STEM field so that I may fulfill my interest in getting into the design, analysis, building, and prototyping projects pertaining around machines. I grew up having a lot of interest in cars, which evolved from wanting to become a mechanic to wanting to become a mechanical engineer. I've always had a fascination with automobiles and I would try to get into different activities or hobbies pertaining cars. I've bought and taken care of my own car and I took an Innovation, Design, and Manufacturing class in high school to further advance my knowledge with designing and analyzing. I particularly was always interested in building and analyzing anything, even if it were something small, it was just fun to dissect and put anything back together after analyzing and studying the parts of that thing. With all of these innate interests and skills that I have attained leading up to this point in my life during college, I want to further improve and learn new concepts and skills that I can take and use with the career that I've always wanted to pursue in Mechanical Engineering."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,163,"To be honest, there were two main reasons I started studying something in the STEM field (Computer Science). The first reason was because I grew up using computers every day of my life as a child, and it was something I loved. Obviously computer science is much different than just using a computer daily. The other reason was because I did really want a financially stable job as an adult, something that could support me and give me a stable life. Fortunately for me, I’ve really begun to enjoy Computer Science along the way, and found that there are so many different aspects and fields to explore within just Computer Science. The major was very difficult at the beginning of my studies, and still is, but after a couple of internships and many classes I’ve gotten pretty comfortable with it and enjoy it more the more I learn about it. So while the primary reason for me choosing the STEM fields was for a stable lifestyle, it’s also because it’s something I’ve begun to enjoy a lot and hope will be a fulfilling career."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2376,"I want to get into the STEM field because these disciplines represent the cutting edge of human knowledge. The innovations that are changing our world are a direct result of STEM studies and applications. I want to be part of the effort to develop technology that changes and improves the way we live our lives. Additionally, I find the work required to understand the STEM fields to be very challenging and demanding. I appreciate the challenges that this works presents me with. I want to be a lifelong learner, and pursuing a career in the STEM fields presents this opportunity. In order to keep up with the rapid innovation that is happening, I will have to continue learning every day. I am pursuing a career around computer science. The field is evolving so quickly that new tools are constantly being developed. In order to keep pace with everything around me I will have to make a constant and concerted effort to improve my understanding and science and technology. I also want to remain relevant. As people grow older it is easy for them to find a comfortable place and become complacent. I don't want this, so I have chosen to pursue a place in the STEM fields. Also, I believe that STEM employees make pretty decent money, and I want that as well. I also want to be as smart and well educated as I can, and I believe the STEM fields offer me this opportunity. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2377,"I want to go into the stem field to learn new things and to get a good job. Also my major is computer science so I think I have to go in this fields because there are a lot of problems solving and challenging things to in this fields and I like to do this kind of stuff. Lastly, I think studying and working in the stem field is means learning about the world around you, and finding innovative solutions to real-world challenges."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2378,"Umar Rama  Professor David Yee  Physics 232 Lab  Reflection # 1.     It is a dream come true for me if I am able to gain knowledge and cement my skills in the STEM fields especially Computer Science. Studying and pursuing a career in STEM means learning all the technology around me and finding innovative solutions to challenges that really effect our daily lives. Pursuing a career in a STEM field grants me the opportunity in some of the major discoveries, researches, and developments in the tech world. This also gives me the access to a range of great professional work opportunities and maybe in the future can secure me financially. I will have the chance to work on the cutting edge of field like robotics, computer technology, and many more. I think the best way to describe my reason to pursue STEM field is my passion. I hope I succeed in achieving my goals in Computer Science."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,147,"I want to get into the STEM field because the careers all consisted of my favorite topics to learn in school. Math and science are two of my favorite subjects, but math is my number one. I specifically chose Civil engineering because construction has been around me my whole life since many of my family members are in this field. With the right opportunities a job in this field can eventually pay well enough to live comfortably in a place other than the bay area."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2379,"I want to go to the STEM field because of few reasons. First of, the most obvious reason is that it is the trending field in the industry. For example, if you're in the health care, then you can also alternate to a tech job and provide services through that company. If you are in the tech field, then you can be helpful for software development in the health care field. Overall, STEM is hot for job opportunities. Apart from that, I like the STEM field because I am someone who started off as a premed major. Due to personal reasons, I opted out and went into computer science. However, due to the open-ended jobs out there, it is easy for me to still use my computer science skills in the health care industry where my interest lies. STEM is a field that will continue to grow, so there is a long term balance. I predict more a flexibility and reliability by going into it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,165,"I want to go into the STEM field; specifically, Civil Engineering because in high school I was apart of the Engineering academy which really opened my eyes to the world of engineering and eventually turned into a passion. I eventually had to choose a specific branch of engineering and that ended up being Civil because there so many things you can do with a civil engineering degree. I really feel that civil engineering is something I really enjoy and i want to make a career out of it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2106,"I want to go into the STEM field because I am interested in engineering and want to have a career in this field. I want to learn more about it and use what I learn to make the lives of the people around me easier by helping them do things that would normally require some knowledge in this field. I want to have a career in this field because I am interested in engineering and technology and how they can make difficult tasks easier. I also want to go into this field because I want to be more useful to the people around me. This is because for most situations involving this field, there is usually only one person in my family that the people around me would ask for help. I want to make things easier for this person so they do not have to do all of the work or if this person is busy with something else, I can do the work for this person."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2086,My goal to join the STEM field is because within stem we have civil engineering and specifically construction management engineering. That branch in STEM is what will allow me to join a career  that involves things that I’m interested in with a solid and strong degree. Also being honest I plan to stay in San Francisco so the whole Bay Area is very technological therefore going in the STEM field is also a good job opportunity in this area. Also I would want to go into the STEM field because In reality having a job in this field will help me out financially. The more I study and challenge myself in STEM the better I will be able to succeed in life. Overall what truly helped me decide was my back injury when I was younger and I knew that my back would not be able to keep up with construction work physically so studying and using my brain for construction rather than my body will help me have both construction and engineering in my career path. Overall I feel as if STEM is a field open to exploration that will help me better myself in. many different aspects moving forward possibly changing my life as a whole. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2380,"I want to go into the STEM field because I have been interested in math/science ever since I can remember. My interest in physics/math quickly became an obsession because of the limitless concepts that can be learned. The STEM field will always be expanding, and new concepts or theories will always arise. The field is limitless! When I was in middle school, I would always look forward to my math and science classes because it was more fun than writing or memorizing things for history. I never really liked writing growing up, but it was something I had to get used to because of all the writing I have to do in college. I like doing research, but I do not really like writing about the research. My favorite science classes that I have ever taken were physics, chemistry, and biology. The most interesting class was physics because it had to do with calculus and I liked that class as well."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2381,My reason for going into stem was out of spite. I remember sitting in the computer lab where we were supposed to complete our common app and begin working on the UC application and having to explain to my teacher that my grades were so bad that there was no point in even trying. I figured the quickest way to show I was smart was studying computer science. My counselor advised me not to do it because it would likely be difficult for me and I took that personally. I was desperate to prove I was smart without having to prove it exhaustively. After all it seemed like something few people understood and explaining simple concepts seemed to baffle people. The reason I stayed in STEM because I enjoy the amount of problem solving and seems like a good stepping stone to working for the government. Also group work has been minimal and in most cases my teammates do their work when compared to my GE classes.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2382,"I want to go into the STEM field because I think that it is what our future revolves around. I also find it interesting to learn about. I think everyone should take some time out to study a topic in STEM because it helps you with critical thinking and problem solving. I also want to get into STEM because it is generally a well paying field. This will allow me to accomplish my goals and do the things I want to do with financial freedom. I believe the easiest route is studying Computer Science. Im interested in coding, and I improve my problem solving and critical thinking skills all while being paid pretty well. So to me, its a win win. Do something I enjoy, and make enough money to travel and see the things I want to see and do the things I want to do."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2383,"The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is that some of the more general stepping stones into my mechanical engineering major are ones that I think are a good mix of challenging yet also rewarding. Some of these courses are harder than others and can make me feel a little overwhelmed sometimes, but in the end always make me feel proud of myself for overcoming these challenges (especially during COVID) to further myself into the field. These courses all interest me for the most part and are ones that I find myself succeeding in according to my history of STEM classes. And just like all the courses I have and will continue to take for my major, I hope that the decision I made will turn out to be a good one and hopefully will find success in the near future."
