2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2378,"One of the biggest challenges that I faced during online learning is the lack of in-person interaction with both instructors and classmates. I think this transition was difficult for me especially in case of science lab courses. The sudden switch to online classes also made me worried about my future that whether the degree earned through online learning will be credible enough among the job sector. Another issue that I faced was lack of motivation and time management. Managing school, work, and some other responsibilities were difficult for me. Building up a schedule has really helped me over come such challenges. Online learning taught very good self-motivation skills. It has enabled be to workout daily as exercise increases the brain plasticity. I still have a reason for pursuing my degree and maybe pursue my dream career in the future."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2379,"Given the situation of this COVID, one of my biggest concerns is of a longer online education. Learning online has been a big change and a big transition for me. I always thrived in a learning environment that was in person because I was more proactive. If I needed help, I can reach out to anyone around me and ask for help. In addition, I could also make new connections and network. In fact, it would help me get to know my professors better. However, now with all the online learning, I am having difficulty understanding who I am studying with or even my group members. I find that quite disconnecting because I am not coming to know who I am working with which does not bring any connection to my learning experience. Especially it is a bit of a struggle to connect with the professor during office hours if I need help. Apart from the concerns of learning, my concerns for my well-being are not as much because I am still exercising and getting through my day with some changes to my routine. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2086,Initially Online classes where a huge shift to what I had originally had ever known but it was a quick getting used to. I will say I have not done anything for my mental health since I have felt like Online classes have made me more to teach myself as the courses itself are either asynchronous or just overall lectures are meant to be more taught through homework. Self care has not really been a thing for me since I have felt that the less time in class has actually felt like the more time online studying or watching the videos given to us. I am concerned that I know my ability to teach myself is enough for a passing grade but nowhere near enough what Im supposed to know. It has felt as if I read and study but forget right after since overall online has been memorization and deadlines rather than a in depth approach. Overall im not concerned online has its flaws but definitely its benefits as well. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,129,"Online classes have impacted my learning experience a great deal. Not having that in person contact has made school a lot more relaxed than usual and understanding concepts a lot more difficult. For self care I'm meditating a lot more, attempting to be more active, listening to music and being creative any chance I get. The concerns I have is that I won't fully understand the concepts that are being taught during lectures and that my mental health will be effected while going to school remotely."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,199,"I have always preferred in person learning because of the interactions one can make with peers, professors and possibly TA's. Yes we can reach out to one another via email but i would rather work with someone in person due to the fact that showing my work or getting taught something wont be as disruptive as sitting at home with background noise or any connection issues. I am also a visual learner so white boards and pieces of paper work in the sense of me visualizing different scenarios. Also, personally speaking i have been a glasses wearer for quite a while now and my eyes have been getting more irritated lately after 6/7+ hours a day after being in front of a computer."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,163,"So far classes have been completely online for about one year now, and in my opinion my learning has benefited greatly from it. The amount of time saved by not having to commute to school has opened up a surprising amount of extra time to either study, work on the homework more, or work on projects (I’m a computer science major). Some of my teachers, mostly the physics and sometimes math department, almost completely cancelled zoom meetings at all and just have us study the recorded lecture on our own time, which saves even more time or allows for a much more flexible schedule and life. I also have a better connection with classmates through class-wide chat software like Discord, where we can all talk about concepts we don’t understand, issues we have on homework, or get clarification on class meetings. A couple of the Discord servers even have the professors in them constantly answering students’ questions. This whole temporary online class situation has been a huge increase in not only learning, but also in utility for me, and while it’s extremely convenient it does come with some negatives. It can be pretty tough not going outside as much as I used to or not seeing as many people. For the self care side, I started going to the gym again (now that covid restrictions have been lifted a bit) and tried seeing more of my friends more frequently, which I fortunately have the time for because of my flexible online class schedule."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,147,Online learning has been very hard and frustrating when it comes to lab courses. One example for myself would be in my surveying class. Its frustrating because we cannot become familiar with the surveying tools by using them hands on since we are fully online. As far as self care I work out everyday and spread out my work to were I wont have to do more than one assignment a day. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2371,"Online school does not work. For past a year, we all acted like it does. There are so many plagiarism, and cheating going on. Do I want my doctor to cheat and pass classes and get a job in the future? NO!   Online school puts so much work on us. Online school is boring, most of the time most of the students including me will not pay attention to the class, instead be on my phone or something else. That's because it is not interesting, and its so easy to get distracted when you are not in classroom . Classroom used to help me focus, because everybody wanted to learn and catch up. Online school is totally opposite. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,1828,"The first thing I did for self care after I noticed that things were not going well for me was cut down my class schedule there was no way that I could keep up with as many classes as I had and not be miserable. Once I did that I really tried to do well in all the classes that I still had. I noticed that I now had much more time for myself and it felt great. I enjoy working out, stretching, going on hikes and many other activities. Doing these things while doing well in school has made me less sad. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2373,"Well, online classes have been pretty frustrating for me. I feel like I am not engaged in classes as I normally would. In addition to this, some professors do not seem to adapt to the technology which makes things a bit slower.  Also, some professors teaching method has to change in order for students to successfully pass the class (things like sharing slides, homework submission accommodations etc). In terms of self-care, I work out, which has been super helpful to release stress and anger. I also like to go out with friends as well as play video games like battlefield and dragon ball z fighterz."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2372,"To be frank online classes has helped me balance school and work easier but has taken a toll on my mental state. I don't feel like online classes have been as affective as in person classes, I have a harder time actually learning things because I can't physically go to office hours or tutoring. I also feel as though to compensate for in person classes we are given more work that we don't need which leaves us students with no time to practice self care. I also feel as though some teachers just worry about pushing more assignments rather than worry about us grasping the material. A teacher I personally feel has done an amazing job adjusting to this change is Charli Sakari where the work she assigns are all purposeful and the midterms are more on comprehension of the concepts we learned rather than solving a bunch of word problems which makes me feel more confident in what I learned. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2374,"As we have moved to fully online instructions since this March, I feel more pressure on learnings. There are a couple of reasons that I don't like online learning. First, we have to spend most time of the day to sit in front of a laptop and watch the screen, so my eye feels tired. Second, it is different to guarantee that I have a quiet environment to study at home because I have a three-year-old and naught nephew who is living with me. Third, if I have questions about my assignment and lectures, I can't get a response from my professors immediately. I miss campus at this moment, but safety and health are the most important things for us. As many people finish their vaccination for the covid-18, I think we can go through this and back to our normal social life later this year."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2383,"Online classes have impacted just about every aspect of my learning, with certain aspects being affected more than others. Unfortunately, there seem to be more negative effects of online learning in comparison to a normal in-person learning environment as when it's online, I'm home all the time and can be easily distracted. I've gotten better about this distraction thing since we first moved to online, though motivation always seems to be lower when online (especially during the second semester after spring break and before summer vacation). For self-care, I've been taking any time that I can to relax and engage myself in activities that make me happier and put myself in a state where I don't worry about school. Whether it be streaming a show/movie, playing a game with friends, or hanging out with my friends, all of these are ways I take care of myself. Some concerns I have for my learning are that my ability to engrave the material into my mind are significantly harder when online since we don't get the true environment that is in-person classes where we can talk and ask questions with our peers and instructors. Not only this, but it seemingly feels like my professors have been ramping up the work a lot (even since the first semester we started transitioning to online back in early 2020). This hasn't been especially helpful with motivation levels and has definitely increased stress about all the assignments that seemingly are never-ending."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,151,"Online classes have basically ruined any sense of work ethic I had managed to hang onto before lockdown. Everything I used to do to motivate myself (going to the library, planning study dates, visiting the tutoring center, etc.) are all impossible or difficult to pull off now. I legitimately have not been outside in two weeks. They say that college is supposed to be the best years of your life, but I’m spending half of them with a daily eleven-hour screen time and drowning in schoolwork. All of the mental illness problems I have are now exacerbated--I could barely keep up in a classroom setting and now I feel useless in lecture with my tiny attention span. I have no idea what to do to self care. I used to plan fun things into my week to stay motivated, but now all I do is snack and shower twice a day because I literally can’t think of anything else to do. Also, self-care is a dangerous game to play. It doesn’t feel productive, it feels like a huge waste of time that I should just ignore so that I can finish all of my schoolwork. I am homework robot beep boop. I can’t really tell the difference between taking a beat and self-caring versus watching an entire Netflix series in a sitting.The worst part is that it’s never over. It’s always “We’re excited to welcome you back next semester!” and it has been for three semesters in a row now. I am extremely conflicted on the idea of CSUs reopening, especially since the words of the chancellor were not very comforting at all. When I saw that they wanted to have 10-20% of classes in person and are refusing to require vaccination, my jaw dropped to the floor. Also ironic considering that I just got an email from SFSU telling me that if I don’t submit proof of other immunizations then I’ll have a hold placed on my account. So I guess it’s completely fine to bring people back into an in-person setting without being immunized against a deadly virus causing a global pandemic, but how dare I attend online classes without proof of immunization. As much as I want to experience college for real, and network and attend class in person, I’m still terrified of getting or passing on the virus to my loved ones. Online school has been an up-mountain battle but honestly it is better than the alternative. I guess I’m struggling with not only staying inside, but also the fact that this could last forever at this point. Two weeks is turning into two years pretty quickly, and I wonder if I’ll ever take an in-person class at SFSU."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2380,"Online classes have impacted my learning in many different ways. First of all, it is way easier to study because of the recorded lectures that I can look back on. Also, everything is online so I just stay home and it is not as motivating than being at the SFSU library. Also, I cannot physically go to office hours because it is online so the professor will never know who I am or what I look like if I do not use my camera.For self-care, I have been trying to keep a routine and I try not to do anything too distracting so that I stay motivated for school. I usually take a shower before any of my classes and study for any of my classes, whether it is review or not and if it is 5 minutes or more, anything helps. I normally work on homework after my classes so that I can work on the homework while the concepts are fresh in my mind. Lastly, I play video games or chess for a break because if I study all day, then I probably will not retain much information. I usually take less than 20 minutes of a break so that I still have the things that I learned in my head.I do not have many concerns for my learning and well-being because I am taking care of both of them. Although I am doing fine in regards to those two, I do think that going back to in-person learning will be much better for me because I will be a bit more motivated."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2376,"Online classes have made a huge difference in my learning and my routines. First of all, they have been easier to attend but harder for me to gather additional resources from teachers. Also, the material is more available but somehow harder to access. The interfaces put the material links front and center, but the iLearn interface makes planning a bit challenging as some assignments are hidden. Also, as I study more upper level classes, the material becomes harder to grasp and more abstract. Overall, the experience has had both good and bad aspects.I have noticed that I have become overwhelmed by all the work piling up. Part of my response has been to try to break down the assignments into component parts. I have tried to isolate individual assignments into individual parts in order to make the jobs seem less daunting. I would like it if office hours were more front and center, because for some reason I can't fully explain, I find it difficult to reach out to the professors online for additional resources. I am concerned that I am continuing to fall behind on my work despite the fact that I stay generally up to date with my assignments and homework. The physics problems are particularly challenging to grasp, but the Cengage interface is actually pretty handy. I appreciate the labs that help me grasp the physics problems. I like the labs that have an interactive component, and it sometimes seems that the online components might be just as valuable as the real life experiments. I also like that we are entering a module with software and a programming aspect. I also like these journals, which help me to reflect on the challanges that I face in the classroom, which reflects onto the challenges that I will face in real world scenarios."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2381,"At the very beginning of the pandemic online classes provided me a great deal of convenience. By not having to go between school and heaven especially with my usually hectic schedule I was spared tons of stress and was able to get an adequate amount of sleep. But this semester most of my courses are hard and boring. Since I have all online classes it means that I can study anywhere and anytime. However, I end up leaving things to the last minute because I can turn things in seconds before a deadline. Consequently my academic performance has begun to sink. To take care of myself I lounge around and spend time on my computer to take my mind off things. In terms of my learning I'm worried that my comprehension of any classes material is much lower than it was last semester. I'm tired and just want the semester to be over. I just need to power through for the next 3 weeks and for better or worse another semester has gone by and closer to earning my degree. I've spent 4 years now trying to get it and another year to go. Too much time and effort has gone into this to give up."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2094,"Online classes have impacted my learning by giving me less of an active engagement with my professors. I haven't been able to have an on hands learning experience for my laboratory sections and it was somewhat difficult not having that kind of experience to enhance my learning. What I'm doing for self care is by taking break and playing video games and working on my computer or my car, which helps me not think too much about my studies since I want to be able to de-stress from the work itself. I just have a concern that what I'm learning and how I'm learning things may affect how I would apply myself to in-person classes in the future and towards a career, I hope that I can be able to succeed from this semester and sustain a similar amount of success whenever I do take in-person courses again."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,174,"Online learning has been the worst. Back when I was taking classes at community college (in person) I tried my very best to get excellent grades I could be proud of. The second half of my last semester at community college (first semester of online learning) I got a C in my calculus class. That is the only C on my West Valley College record. The worst part is that I didn't even need that calculus class, I was told to take it by a counselor who didn't know what they were talking about. I should have taken statistics. The worst part of online learning is just how easy it is to be disengaged. It used to be like: go to school and force myself to pay attention, when I'm behind on homework I'd study in the library all afternoon, forcing myself to work with no distractions. I never missed class except for an emergency or if I was sick. Now, it's just so easy to fall off the tracks of my classes. It's so easy to just not attend classes, or to forget there are deadlines for homework. The perfect example is my entire lab team just leaving and not saying anything. I told myself, ""I'll just go get some dinner and then wrap up the lab on my own"", and then I forgot about the lab, and every time I've looked at it since I've just been too mentally exhausted from putting off the rest of my homework that I just haven't done it. I finally asked someone to help me with it and I'm going to turn it in in a moment, but this never would have happened with an in-person lab."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2382,"Online learning has had an impact on my classes in way such that I tend to care way less. These classes feel like monotonous time wasters with very little effort by a majority of professors. It has impacted my learning immensely to the point that I don't really even retain a lot of the information. My motivation is nowhere to be found and not sure how to possibly get it back. Not really doing anything for self care to be honest, i just go about my day like usual, and sit through the lectures like everyone else, not sure there is a way to make it better. It sort of just seems like nobody cares anymore and It's hard not to think of this past year as a giant waste of time. I feel like ive learned nothing in this past year. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,160,The online class is not better than the lecture class because I can't pay attention all the time during class and need to learn by myself. But online class can let me have more time to do the homework. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2375,"If I am being honest, online classes have greatly impacted my learning. It is very hard for me to learn and let alone focus on the material that is being taught. This is the third semester of online learning and I feel very burnt out. Compared to when I was on campus I was able to have a sort of balance between school and normal life, whereas now, after being stuck inside for a year, it has taken a toll on my mental health which of course impacts my ability to do well in school. Self-care is something that I have been struggling with as I feel guilty for wanting to take a break, but I try to remind myself that it is okay to take breaks and that if I don't give myself the breaks that I need, my mind and body will do that for me, maybe when it is least convenient. I try to paint and read as often as I can to get my mind to fully focus on something other than school, as well as allow myself to take a break to watch some Netflix when needed. Concerns that I have for my learning are that after doing 3 semesters online, I feel like I have retained little information as reliving the same day over and over, being stuck in my room, and ""learning"" through a screen became repetitive fairly quickly. I have many concerns for my well-being because my stressors from school quickly altered my mental health which of course affected every other aspect of my life. These concerns that I have for my well-being, as I feel as though I have hit rock bottom when it comes to my mental health, I hope are not permanent, as hanging in there a bit longer as we return to ""normal"" will help me get back on the track that I was before online school started. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2377,"I think online classes have a very good impact only learning because by this I learned many new things and most of the things I understand by doing myself. And for self-care, I usually take regular hours of sleep, wear a mask while I am in public, and maintain social distance while going outside."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,165,"Online classes have impacted my learning in a major way, being that starting next semester I will solely be focused on my major courses, I feel that I am not learning in an intended way for my major. I feel that I have adapted very well to online learning since I am kind of forced to so to speak. For self-care, I am trying to enjoy myself in a safe way outside of class since there are still high chances of exposure to the virus in my county. A few concerns I have for my learning is that I am missing out on a lot of stuff I could be doing if I was on campus. On account of my well-being, I feel that is a very safe way to be learning in the meantime which is understandable however I would love to be on campus learning a lot of my major courses hands-on and in the intended way the professors would love to be teaching us."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2106,"Online classes have impacted my learning by preventing me from getting the experience of going to classrooms for the lecture and labs because I feel that for some classes, it is better to be in person like the labs. Another way that online classes have impacted me is if there are internet issues, then it would make learning more difficult because it would take up time if there was a disconnection on the teacher’s end or my end. A concern that I have for my learning is for some classes, I am fine with it being online and for others, I feel that it would be better for it to be in person. For example, for labs and group activities, I feel that it would better in person and for other things, I think online classes are fine. For my well-being, online classes are better option than in person classes because of the quarantine."
