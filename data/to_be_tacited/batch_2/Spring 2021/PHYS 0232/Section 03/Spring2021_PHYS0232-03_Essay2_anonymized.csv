2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2374,"My goal for this course is to understand deeply each topic in physic 230 by doing some related practicals during every week's lab. Since my physic 230 only gives us the study goals for every week and let us study by ourselves. Therefore, some knowledgeable points are not completely understood. Related labs are useful for me because some hands-on laboratory activities provide guidelines for us to explore the topic and have simulations to verify some conclusions. Also, the mini-lecture of every week before our exploration is extremely useful. It helps me to review some physical stuff and emphasize some confusing points for us. I also can answer some questions that I am struggling with. I hope every week we can have a simulation for us to verify our conclusions. For example, in week 4, we explore the flix and Guass'Law, but we don't have the stimulation to verify our conclusions after explorations, so I need to do extra research to verify my conclusions. Overall, the lab is extremely useful and helpful for me. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,151,"One of my goals is to get better at problem solving--not just in math or computer science settings, but in life in general. I honestly don’t plan on working in any physics-related fields after graduating, however there are still things I can learn in this class to improve my problem solving skills. Most physics problems require you to really pick apart the situation and understand all of the moving parts before you can find a solution. Life is a word problem and being able to pick out what we already know and what we’re looking for is vital to moving forward. In summary, this class can help me to achieve my goals by making me exercise my critical thinking and problem solving skills, as well as intrapersonal skills from working in group settings."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2373,"Well, this is a very interesting question... My primary goal as of now is being able to graduate in 4 years, this class will allow me to do so because I will be able to take other classes with physics 230 as a pre-requisite. Outside of that obvious explanation, I think this lab is important for me because I will enhance and help me understand difficult topics I encounter in the main course, having visual representation of the math that I am actually doing is so important."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2378,"My ultimate career goals are to graduate on time from SFSU and get my desired career job. I think physics play an important role in achieving this goal. This class specifically is really important for this because it provides practical problem-solving examples of physics from real life, which I think is really important because it helps to develop logical thinking skills. This class will help me set my basics for advanced engineering subjects which I might have to learn in the future. This class will aid me in establishing the relevance of theory in physics. It can also make me understand the difference between theory and application. The experiment techniques demonstrated in this class will clarify my mind regarding the basic concept of the subject. Experiments carried out in Physics laboratories helps students in learning how to be patient and careful while taking observation and calculating the data."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2379,"My goal for physics overall is to get a good fundamental understanding of the concepts. One thing I always struggled with is that understanding the topics. I had a hard time grasping such materials. Therefore I did poorly in physics. However, with the physics lecture class I am taking now, I have able to understand more of the concepts because of the direct examples that relate to the concepts. Coming to the lab part of physics, I want to take advantage of the lab material to understand some concepts like vectors, velocity, acceleration, and such in a deeper manner. The reason being, in labs we tend to apply what we learn in lectures, so it is a way of doing ""hands-on"" which is helpful. Although the class is not in person, I'm hoping we get to do some ""hands-on"" activities at home and get to work with the concepts."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,129,My goals are to pass all of may classes this semester with a B or better and to obtain my bachelors degree in computer science. This class could help me a lot because this class his a requirement for my degree and it's very informative and forces me to think and work hard.  This class forces me to think logically and constantly use math which is a huge part of my major. Also have a teacher that is compassionate about their teaching subject inspires me to work harder in a class as well.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2377,"My goals are to achieve a bachelor's degree in computer science and I need this class to fulfill my major requirement. In this class, my goal is to learn new stuff and new formulas. Also, my goals in this class is to achieve better grades and do my lab better. I think learning new things from this course will help me in the future or I can also apply this concept in my daily life."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2380,"My goals are to have as much knowledge as I can, and to learn as much as I can. This class can help me achieve these goals by just staying the same because I am already learning new things every class, and this contributes to my goals. My goals are something that pertain to every class because you can never get enough knowledge. I think that I learn and understand more material in this class than the lecture class because we go in depth with specific topics instead of straying off about things that we are not learning. Everything about this class is very helpful and this class helps me achieve my goals in every way. My goals are every easily achievable, but they take hard work to achieve. Even though this class is not that too big on all the topics, it definitely achieves my goals and helps me conceptualize hard topics in this course. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2086,My goals are to reach a point in  my life where I will have a solid job in my engineering career. First and most immediate goal is to work hard and progress through school in order to get the degree that will help me reach my overall goal in engineering. At some point I hope to reach a job in construction management engineering either here in the bay or in Los Angeles. This class will help me reach that goal by teaching me the material necessary which eventually will be used in my career. Also will give me the boost to knowing things necessary within my field. Overall I hope to learn from this class and school in general to later on learn from internships and working in the field. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2382,"My goals are to get a Computer Science degree so I can become a software engineer. I would like to work on the backend side of things. I don't think this class will help me achieve these goals, other than the fact that I am required to take this class to graduate. I do not believe this class will help me in any sort of way in terms of coding. I think that it could possibly help with problem solving but who knows. I think this class is more beneficial for people who are in other STEM fields. I think that physics is only really important for video game development, because understanding vectors is a big part of video game coding, im sure there are other aspects of physics that are super important to video game design but thats the first one I thought of. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2106,"My goals are to graduate with a degree in electrical engineering and to get a career in engineering. These are my goals because I am interested in the field of engineering and technology. This class can help me achieve these goal of graduating with a degree in electrical engineering because it is a pre-requisite for some of the classes that are required for this major. This class can also help me learn new things, develop some new understandings, and prepare me for the classes that are more difficult than this class. This class can also help me by letting me practice using what I have learned in the past. This class can help me achieve the goal of getting a career in engineering because I can learn more things in this class. I can use what I learn to prepare myself for having a job where I might need to use things from this class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2094,"My goal is to attain a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and work as an Automotive Engineer. I think that this class will help me achieve these goals by giving me the opportunity to learn more about other aspects of physics, a subject which will have a lot to do with my major in Mechanical Engineering. If I were to understand how machine design works, I believe a big part of that learning experience also involves electricity, not just with computers and other electronics, but even with how electrical power is supplied to a machine. I know that the subject of electricity would only get even more important as the automotive and even public transportation industry begins developing and manufacturing on electric technology such as EV or bullet trains. Knowing the subject of Electricity will help me better understand our future technology more and have a greater amount of knowledge around Electric vehicles and electronic components in vehicles in general."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2381,My goal is to become a more thoughtful person and better acquainted with physics concepts. I am a hands on person when it comes to learning so reading through a text book and taking notes on lectures does little to help me remember the ideas long term. So I think this class can help me achieve that by forcing me to think how the concepts apply to every day life and use everyday objects to demonstrate the concepts. I think given how procedural the class is I think it will help my comprehension when understanding directions and working with my teammates towards a common goal. I just like to get through things and not think too hard about what I'm doing. And I think this class focuses alot more on why you get the correct answer than what the correct answer is.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,165,My Goals are to pass all of my classes and be out in a couple of years with a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering. This class is a step along the way to help achieve my goal of finishing school and going out into the field of engineering. I believe this class can help by teaching me the necessary tools i need to be a successful engineer in the coming years. Physics is a very important subject to master for Civil Engineers since it teaches us how the world around us works.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,160,"My goal is computer science. This class can help me achieve these goals because this major needs the PHYS course and the physics lab can make me understand more clearly about the physics, more easy to learn. It still makes me understand what and why physics happened by experience in my life and class. Usually, use PHYS knowledge to make programs. Therefore, the experimental class is very important, because the experiment can help me learn more about the knowledge I learned in the PHYS class, so it is necessary to participate in the course. If you do not have a PHYS laboratory or experience, then you will not be able to understand how the knowledge learned in the PHYS classroom works and why it works. Studying PHYS in computer science is essential. If I have a wealth of PHYS knowledge, it can help me become a better computer programmer when I graduate from university and come to work."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2376,"I remember writing about this reflection a few months ago. I'm not sure why the submission didn't work, but this is a great chance to reflect further on how this class has helped me achieve my goals. I have always been driven to a greater understanding of physics and electricity. This lab has helped me to better understand the relationship between electricity and magnetism and mechanical physics. We have had opportunities to conduct computer and physical experiments to explore the behavior of charges, electromagnetic fields, and atomic material. It has helped me realize that experimental science is not beyond my grasp.My goals as I came into this semester largely focused on improving my skills in the subject areas of my study. This class has helped me focus by giving me a fixed weekly exercise set, and makes me work with formulas and scientific principles applied to real world dynamics. Of course, some of the experiments are computer simulations, but that is becoming as real as using a voltmeter, so the results are practically the same. This class has helped me improve, in some small way, on my understanding of current, voltage, and resistance. I have a stronger understanding and confidence in my abilities to work with electrical circuits. I know about ac and dc currents much more now than I did at the beginning of the semester. This class has helped me become more self-reliant, and a better educated human."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2383,"My goals regarding my physics classes are too simply get a better understanding as to how things work in the physical world around me, and to hopefully pass my physics classes with a high grades. This class can help me achieve my goals by teaching me in a more visual and often more comprehensible manner, the concepts from the main PHYS 230 class. Hopefully by simply exploring the labs and understanding the lectures prior to them, I will achieve this goal of understanding physics in a way the main class may or may not teach me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,174,"My ultimate goal is to be a professional computer scientist someday. In order to achieve that goal I have to learn a lot of relevant information as well as get a diploma certifying that I know said information. This class will hopefully help me with both of those requirements. I'd like to learn as much physics as possible because I might be working on software that has to do physics type calculation, or maybe even computer hardware (which requires a deep understanding of physics to be able to design low level hardware). Sometimes I feel fed up with physics and math because it doesn't really pertain to what I hope I'll be doing someday, but I try to keep my mind open and learn everything I can - not just for good grades but also because I wanted to be a knowledgeable person."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2371,"My goals in this class is to understand physics lectures with doing labs. Usually when something is not clear in physics lecture, lab makes it more clear to me. Seeing something is totally different than reading about it. I tend to more enjoy when I work hands on project on our labs."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,199,"My main goal is to become a civil engineering with an emphasis in structural engineering. The way this class can help me achieve my goal is by perhaps providing shortcuts to solving questions in the STEM field. It is very rare for me to hear that a structural engineer is using methods from a physics class that focuses on electric components. If there is a way methods can be taught to me to use the in the future, i would be more than happy learn those methods. Another way this class can help me is to not give me so much work in order for me to focus on my upper division classes. I just feel and think that none of this information pertains to my future career and for me to work on something i will not use does not seem fair when i could be spending time on a class that pertains to my studies"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,163,"In general, my main goal for the short-term future is to graduate college with a computer science degree. Obviously this class helps me achieve that goal because this class is required for that goal. While this class is mostly to fill a degree requirement, I think this class can also help achieve smaller goals that in-turn helps me in the long run. I think this class helps a lot with learning how to work with others in a group, so like teamwork and collaboration. The rest of my classes, usually coding or math classes, don't really emphasize working with other people and it's more individual work. I think being able to work with others is a very important skill that I will undoubtedly need in the future, most likely in my career one day. This class also helps with other things, such as explaining our thought process throughout the labs, although I think the main takeaway is the amount of teamwork experience we get."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2375,"My goals are to graduate college and find a good job that I enjoy and that makes me happy. This class is one of the classes I need to get my degree and graduate. Although I am taking this class because I have to, I somewhat enjoy that it is physics as physics is all around us in everyday life. I enjoy being able to see something happen and to know that it happened because of science. I think being a woman in STEM can be discouraging at times as I doubt my intelligence, but understanding some of the more complex wonders of the world kind of reminds me that I am smart, and that is thanks to this class. If I start to feel smart in everyday life, then that sets a positive mindset when working towards my degree, and considering the world right now, that can go a long way. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,147,My goal is to one day be working a good paying job in the civil engineering field. This class helps in many different ways to achieve that goal. First off some of the content will be used for projects I will be doing once that time comes. Topics such mechanics and elasticity can or might be used under certain circumstances. Also this class helps to prepare you for the work you can possibly be doing. This class teaches you responsibility and collaborative skills that will for sure help you in the future .
