2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2373,"I think the greatest takeaway from this class is, aside from all the material, how important it is to cooperate with others. Working and studying with people you like is a great way of making studying a fun time, it also enhances my social skills. Also, I think that I am more of a hands-on person, I think that learning the theory and all of that is important but it is not as intuitive at times, that is where labs come in, having a visual representation of the theory betters my overall experience and understanding of the concepts."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,151,"Coming into this semester, I was nervous about the classwork and whether or not I would be able to understand everything and succeed. My greatest takeaway from this class is that with a bit of a time investment, I can accomplish most things that I dedicate myself to. I also learned a lot about actual physics, too, but being able to learn those things intimidated me at first and now it isn’t that scary. This is my last semester of physics, but I will carry this confidence with me and try to apply it to other intimidating concepts and courses."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2381,"Im not sure where to start. I've struggled with math since high school so given how much math is involved in physics I've always found it incredibly difficult. Physics also comes across as a collection of abstract concepts that I assume are true so even when I'm shown datasets modeling or showing that they are true its still confusing to me. This lab has dealt with plenty of invisible forces that after hours of lecture and reviewing the book I still had a hard time grasping. The experiments during the labs helped solidify my knowledge in these concepts though they are still pretty abstract to me. The class also helped me realize the importance of documenting our results since working purely from memory often left me stuck when doing the summary, and knowledge check. My greatest take away would probably be learning to become a slightly better student. The class went beyond just pushing numbers around and forced me to understand why the results we got in the lab made sense and to explain them thoroughly. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2371,This class has taught and proved to me variety of ways to run experiments on physics problems.These experiments can be run with literally no tool or with household appliance. You have made this class really fun professor. One thing I would probably ask is to have more hands on experiments. Physics is more fun when I see things happen with my own eyes. Electronic experiments just makes it dull and boring. Everybody might have different opinion on this.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2376,"My greatest takeaway from this class has been the improved tools for analysis for physical sciences. Participating in laboratory experiments has given me additional problem solving skills because creating and executing the experiment requires understanding the problem and applying various problem solving techniques to successfully complete the problem. The creation of physical experiments such as the electromagnet have given me the confidence to attempt real world issues. Working with various electrical and magnetic principals to complete these lab experiments has helped me connect the real world phenomena with the academic principals which underscore the material. I think this class has given me tools which I can apply to many real world problems. Many of these problems are complicated at first. However, once we start to break them down into smaller components, we see that these problems have all been solvable. No matter how complicated the theory is, we can understand these problems by breaking them down. Using the theories and the handouts, we can understand and solve. Also, working in a team makes these labs much more manageable. In real world applications, most of the problems like this will be solved by teams working together. Teamwork makes these labs much easier, and we can take this same approach to solving real world problems."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2378,I think this class has helped me in establishing the relevance of the theory of physics and further strengthen my concepts in physics. This class has brought clarity in my thinking regarding the basic concept of the subject. I was able to understand the difference between theory and application. These physics labs have helped me in improvising my approach towards the theory of physics. The experiments carried out in this class has helped me to be patient and careful in taking observations and calculations. Research is everything in science without research science would get stagnated and it is here in Physics lab that students are able to learns what it is to be a researcher. There are different procedures of different experiments in Physics and then there are some basic behavioral rules in a laboratory. A student of Physics needs to be aware of all this. And working in a school physics laboratory actually puts a fundamental slab for them.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,174,"What has been my greatest takeaway? That's kind of hard to quantify. It feels like it's been hard to really apply the things we've learned this semester (not just in this class but in all of them) since online learning feels so out of touch. It's always been neat to have a lab class where we get to witness all of the abstract stuff we've been talking about in lecture, but this time it just feels like two abstract classes together. I would still rather take a lab with lecture, especially with how bad my lecture professor is and how good my lab professor is. Our lecture professor would belittle us for asking ""stupid"" questions while our lab professor took the time to explain to me what's going on with EE stuff in my actual life (we talked about the electrical wiring of my house!). Back to the prompt, I think my greatest takeaway from this class is simply that I learned a little more on how to interact with people (professor and students) in this weird online format. After the pandemic is over I'm sure we'll still be doing lots of online things - especially in the computer science industry, and so I think those skills are actually quite valuable."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2382,"My greatest takeaway from this class is probably the skill ive gained from problem solving. Taking physics has taught me a lot about physics obviously but also it has taught me how to approach and solve problems. As a computer science student, problem solving is key to succeeding, and by taking physics it has taught me a new approach to problem solving and understanding problems. So I think for me personally it isnt a specific subject we have learned in this class but moreso a collective of all problems we have done, and the methods we have used to solve them. This has been the most beneficial thing for me in this class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,147,I felt like my collaborating skills were improved although this was online. Working together on the explorations and staying after class as well I felt is something that would have not been as efficient in person. The simulations and experiments shown to us really were great representations of the topics and I enjoyed taking this class overall. Plus the professor is very awesome and enthusiastic.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2380,"My greatest take away from this class is the ability to scientifically reason things out with the knowledge that I accumulated over the semester. Now that I know more about electromagnetism and the way that magnets and electricity interact, I am able to reason out how they will react with each other and that goes for any other topic we went over as well. For example, since positive and neutral charged objects attract each other in regards to electricity, those same objects would not interact in regards to magnetism because of the difference in reaction. This class has helped me a lot with being able to keep up with my physics lecture class because I do not fully understand the lecture until we do an experiment with the concept. Although my greatest take away was not the best, I still have several other take aways from this class that are not mentioned because this paragraph would be too long if I mentioned them."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,129,The greatest takeaway that I received from this class is learning about currents and electromagnetic. Learning these concepts has forced me to notice how these concepts are applied in one’s everyday life. I also enjoyed doing experiments using household items because I love hands on learning. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2375,"I would say that my greatest takeaway from this class would be that teamwork is one of the best resources that we can have, especially during times like this. Personally, I was excited to take a physics course this semester because it gives me a better understanding of the way everything around us works, but since these classes got put online I found it hard to focus and retain important information like I normally would. And since we did not have face-to-face classes where we could talk to classmates like we normally would, I found that still working together on these labs and talking it out with my group had a much stronger impact on me, versus doing it alone. Concepts that were important to understand for the lab that I had a hard time understanding, didn't seem so difficult once the team discussed them. So when we go back to in-person classes, I will try to implement teamwork, even if it is with just one other person, so that way I feel less alone when I feel discouraged. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2086,"My biggest takeaway from this class was the reassurance in the topics we were learning. If I am to be specific the work we did as group in the lab as well the in depth explanations the professor provided each time before we began was extremely helpful when it came to currents. Sometimes certain topics and mindset that I learned from this course became helpful when taking the exams for the lecture portion. This class gave me the biggest takeaway by being more connected to the teaching style that works best for me, slides and explanations and taking notes from such slides is my best way to stay on track therefore this lab course was helpful in all topics and reinforced me in all that I needed to learn. Things I was simply not grasping from reading chapters and chapters each week. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,163,"I think my biggest take away from this class is learning how to effectively work in a group. Something that we don't always get to experience in classes is working with others. In my computer science classes we are almost always working individually, which I believe is very important as well, but we don't really get much experience working with others or in large groups - which I think will be very important in the future. With COVID-19 effecting our current learning situation, I think it's even more important to help build solid communication skills between people, because we will need it when our means of communicating has been reduced to audio and video chat, rather than in person meetings. When all of us eventually graduate and begin working jobs, good communication with our boss, supervisors, and other coworkers is going to be extremely important for working efficiently."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2377,"I learned many new things from this course and many new formulas. From this class, my greatest take away is the flux and Gauss law and many more things. I learned how the circuit and the voltage system works by doing different experiments. To me, this physics class was one of the interesting class, where I learned and apply many new things and formulas. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2383,"One of the greatest take aways I had from this class was how magnetic fields can be influenced and how they function from a physical and theoretical standpoint. I learned that magnetism is the flip side of the same coin as electricity, with both of these physics concepts being heavily related to one another, with both influencing one another. On top of this, I learned how to become a more successful physics lab scientist as working with others to achieve a common goal (in this sense the lab explorations) was made more successfully compared to before as we could bounce ideas and teach each other the concepts if there is some sort of confusion or misunderstanding. This collaboration will certainly prove to be useful in the future as teamwork and using your peers to solve problems will be an essential trait to have for future classes and professions. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2372,"My greatest take away from this class is to not procrastinate. I lab activities are pretty straightforward which is why I would put them off for a long period of time to focus on harder assignments. I would end up overwhelmed by the work once I had about an hour to turn it in on time along with other assignments. I have since started to at least try to finish 3/4 of the lab activities that same day and finish the last assignment the next day. I go by doing this by setting a timer of 35 minutes to work on one subject then take a 5 minute break and then switching to another subject for 35 minutes. This way I don't feel so overwhelmed. So, this class has taught me to better manage my time so I don't feel so overwhelmed. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,199,"My greatest take away from this class are the attempt of the simulation for almost every lab. Personally i am a visual learner so it was great working with online simulations to further gain insight on what  current, voltage, resistance, capacitance, etc. looks like. It was also very helpful when the professor would  do their best on showing us a setup of what may be going on for the lab of the week when there were no simulation."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,160,The greatest takeaway from this class is more understanding the knowledge that I learn for the PHYS class. I learned how that works and caused by. The experience of the lab is helping me learn to understand and interesting. I can know why the PHYS works and how it happened in my life. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2094,"My greatest take away from this class was the way that electricity and magnetism relates to my major in mechanical engineering in a way that has application within the field. I wanted to come away from this class with a higher amount of knowledge in this topic of physics, and not only was I able to learn more about the subject, but I learned about the fundamental aspect of how circuits work. In mechanical engineering, a lot of machine systems have to rely on electronics to be able to be operable since many things in today's world is powered at least in part by electricity. So I believe that even in the design of machines, it was really important being able to learn about circuits before learning more deeply about circuits. The lab sessions concerning RC circuits, short circuit, current, voltage, and potential were really impactful for my general learning in my major."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,165,"My greatest takeaway from this class is learning a lot more than I already knew about electricity. I feel as though I had basic knowledge about the topic from using it in my everyday life. Things such as series and circuits I learned a lot about in this class. The way electricity flows through a circuit and conducts current to power our homes. Being that in this day and age of online learning, electricity is heavily relied on for us to learn and thrive in our academic careers. I understand much more about the importance of having a good series with a good connection to have electricity flow. The presence of an electrical charge whether it be positive or negative produces an electric field. Which is important when it comes to electricity as a whole. I learned many things taking this class which makes me see the world a lot differently now and I hope to use most of these topics and apply them to things in my everyday life."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2374,"After taking this course, I learn some stuff about electricity such as electrical forces, electrical flux, electrical potential, current, resistance, and inductions in electricity. Also, we different characteristics of those elements in the series circuit and parral circuit. Besides, I know about how a flowing of the current wire produces a magnetic field and how a moving charged particle produces a current with a magnetic field. Overall, we learn a lot of physical stuff during this semester, and I hope I can also use these physical knowledge in my daily life to make my life better. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2106,"My greatest take away from this class is that there are many applications from the concepts and methods in life outside of physics lab. The concepts can be used to make things easier to understand and the methods can be used to assist in various tasks in everyday life. For example, from the current lab, the concept of series circuits and parallel circuits can be used to decide which to use when making a circuit. A second example would be from the labs where sage mathwork was used, This program can be used to make problems easier by setting up variables or graphing data. A third example would be from the electric field lab, the concept of electric fields can be used in life outside of physics lab to find out different information about an electric field like its strength. A fourth example would be from the lab with the circuit simulation. The concept from that lab can help when deciding what parts to add and how many of those parts to add."
