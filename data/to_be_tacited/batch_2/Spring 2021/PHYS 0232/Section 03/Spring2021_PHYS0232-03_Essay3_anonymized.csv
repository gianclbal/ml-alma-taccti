2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,199,"How does the topic of electric field and resistance come in to play when studying civil engineering? When i was looking over the topic of electric field, the charges and their placements stood out to me. The way the positive and negative charges' summation of the total electric field gets affected puts into mind how equilibrium works in a beam, truss or frame. The displacement of a point charge is a way to relate how much a beam/truss/frame/members gets displaced when applying a certain load. When thinking about resistance, I think about a dam and how it is built at a certain height with sturdy material to keep water from overflowing/overpowering the dam"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2372,While working on circuits my question and confusion came from how to tell which charges are in series or in parallel. The answer to this is to see if the charges had the same node. A node is where two charges mutually connected to each other. If they do have a mutual node then the circuit is in parallel but if it’s not the case then the circuit is in series. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2373,"Well, when thinking about the applications of this course into the life of regular people not that many come to mind. But I think that so far, circuits are probably the most useful for the general public. Because we deal we electronics that contain circuits and different elements to make a product work as desired, it is important that we know about these things as we make use of them in our every-day life. Phones, Tv's, computers, calculators, the PS5 that I will never get, all have different types of circuits in them."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,1828,Question: Electromagnetism is around our everyday lives what is an example of this?Answer: I like electric guitars and sometimes I like to repair their electronics for others. It is important to know how electric guitars actually work. Electric guitars have a magnet  in what is called the pick up. The magnet makes a magnetic field that goes up towards the strings. The vibration of the string makes a magnetic field as well and their is wire around the pick up that detects the vibration of the string. This wire sends and electric current to the amplifier and the amp produces noise!
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2094,"In a system where there is a positive and negative charge within a cylinder. What is the net flux of the entire system, as in the cylinder? A cylinder, considered a closed surface as every section of the surface all connects to one another, would have a net flux of zero. Closed surfaces will always have a net flux of zero regardless of its shape, if all the surface connect in one in the system, then their net flux will always total to zero. Even if the cylinder may have one surface where there is a negative amount of flux and the other has a positive magnitude in flux and the curved surface would have a zero flux. These flux values will total in zero overall. This would apply in the real world in terms of further articulating the properties of the electric field and its effects upon objects. Knowing about a net flux of zero in closed surfaces helps us understand how flux doesn't have an effect in terms of any physical objects and thus learning how a charge in power sources would have an effect on an object depending on the electric field."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,174,"The past two weeks things have been getting more interesting, dealing with real life applications of short circuiting a battery and talking about electric potential. It's hard to feel like we're learning real life things when everything is so abstract and remote, but I'm starting to see more pieces falling into place. I'm trying to major in computer science, so I'm always looking for more useful information to add to my toolbox that I can use somewhere in the future in a job I might have. That's not to say I just ignore irrelevant information, but I definitely try to hold on to relevant information a lot more.Recently, the Joy-Cons (controllers) for my Nintendo Switch gaming console starting having an issue with drift. After searching online I found out that spraying some contact cleaner into the socket of the joysticks would fix it. Sure enough it did. Recently I've been thinking about that more because of our study of electric flow. I found out that how joysticks work is essentially the same way a potentiometer works. By reading a change in resistance the digital technology is able to read how far you've moved the joystick in the x and y directions. The problem with my joysticks is that Nintendo made one of the contacts out of a fragile metal, so that after enough time the contact degrades and leaves behind a bunch of metallic fragments (dust), which causes reading errors in the resistance because it's essentially causing electrical current to flow before / after it is actually supposed to (the contact is actually conducting through a different piece of the potentiometer than it's designed position). By cleaning it with contact cleaner I washed away the metallic fragments. I don't know if I'll ever work in an industry designing user input equipment, but I do know that I'll remember the fault of the Joy-Cons. I'll make sure to choose a metal that won't disintegrate after only a few years! "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2378,"The concept of Electrostatic Induction which was covered in the first two labs of the semester really interests me. Electrostatic in duction is the process to generate static electricity in a material by bringing an electrical charged object near it. This amazing concept always raises a question for that how can a nonconductor be charged through electrostatic induction? Movement of electrical charges is much more constrained in nonconductors than in conductors. In a nonconductor, the electrons are constrained within the atoms, so separation of charges particles does not work. However, nonconductor consists of polar molecule that have one side more positive. So, electrostatic induction will cause those molecules to be aligned with positive charges on one side and negative charges on the other side. One of the great examples of this concept in real live is of the water molecule that has more positive charges on one side of the molecule and negative charges on the other side. Thus, water can be slightly attracted to a static electric charge. A demonstration of that can be seen in bending a stream of water with a charged plastic comb."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2376,"As I think about the last few weeks, I remember learning about direct and alternating current, short circuits, amperage, voltage, and resistance across circuits in parallel and series. These concepts have real world applications for me because I work with generators. Generators take mechanical energy, often from an engine, and rotate coils to output electricity. The entire system usually starts with a battery having to provide a certain amount of voltage for the starter to engage. If this relationship is messed up, the generator might nor start. The cause of poor voltage could be a low battery or a bad connection. I often see short circuits occur when connections become too loose. The systems also work with both direct and alternating current. The batteries provide a direct current, but the rotation of the coils means that the generator output alternates back and forth as it rotates. The output of each individual generator also depends on the physical connections and components. Larger wires have lower resistance and can carry higher currents. These last few weeks have had real practical applications in everyday life."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,160,"is the Electric Field important? This is very important and affects our lives because many things like phone, computer ... depend on that. This exists everywhere.  People using the theory to create or find much news knowledge and development. For example, potential, electric current, charge, and many of that is caused by the electric field."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2086,"A basic grasp is necessary in order to understand circuits, how would you explain a short system circuit to someone who has never heard about them before? My way of explaining circuits would be to simplify what a circuit is by dividing a circuit and its explanation into three different and important components. Such as the first section explaining what a circuit can consist of, so a circuit holds the three factors of a current, voltage and resistance. Now each component varies by what a circuit is involved in but the basics are that a current is the flow a charge is able to hold, the voltage which is the potential difference, and the resistance which may very depending on the material the current and circuit example is made of in real life. All these where represented in our previous lab as well mathematically can be brought together by the Ohm's Law. It is important to know that circuits are divided into symbols, within the ohms law the I represents current, V is voltage and R is resistance with the units of usage being the ohms units. Finally the third division is  what type of circuits are there, there is only two. The circuit that flows in one path is a series that are all connected on one another following a directed power guide. Meanwhile the second is the parallel circuit which is multiple paths where the division can be made such as right side to right and left to left but not interconnecting. Overall this simple circuit knowledge is a set path to learning the more difficult questions revolving a circuit. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2106,"A concept that was covered in class is circuits. Information about circuits can be used to benefit society because it is used in many electronics that are used by many people. It is generally applicable to people's lives because many people use electronics that contain circuits for entertainment, daily work, and jobs. For entertainment, it can be used in the television, game consoles, and laptops. For daily work, it can be used in a clocks, computers, vacuums, and light bulbs. For work, it can be used in printers, mechanical tools, and scanners. Information on how a circuit works can be applied to many objects like a battery and a light bulb. This information is relevant to society, community, and everyday life because almost everybody uses electronics everyday and especially at a time like this, more people are using electronics to communicate and to do work. The electronics that are being used contain circuits."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2383,"One concept that was covered in both this class and the main PHYS 230 course was electric flux. So, how can this physics concept be applied to everyday life? In it's most basic sense, electric flux isn't too hard of a concept to wrap your head around. The key concept form it is that it's simply the measurement of the electric field's strength through any given surface represented by arrows. To make more sense of this, if the given surface is parallel to the electric field lines, then there is no electric flux. It would have to be perpendicular to it in order to have an electric flux. To translate this in an even simpler way, one could think of electric flux as the water flow through a paper towel with the water going through representing the electric field lines and electric flux. Actual uses of electric flux are really all around us, as many electric appliances we use use electric flux to produce the voltage required for said appliances. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2375,"Last week we discussed circuits, my question is after discussing the difference between parallel and series circuits, which type of circuit is most useful in everyday life? My answer to this question would have to be parallel circuits are more useful compared to series circuits and this is because parallel circuits give the opportunity for appliances, household ones, to have their own individual switch, as well as parallel having a higher power. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,163,"A concept that I enjoyed that we covered somewhat recently in class was short circuits. Our last lab involving short circuits had us connecting batteries and attaching tin foil to the batteries to try and create a circuit. The two strands of tin foil were supposed to replicate wires. For safety reasons, we used a third smaller piece of tin foil to touch with both our ends of our tin foil. What I found interesting was that with a thinner and smaller piece of tin foil, it created some sparks and a burning smell. Using a wider and bigger piece of tin foil resulted in no reaction at all. It’s interesting to think about, as I assumed either one would get a similar reaction. After completing the lab it turns out that thicker wires have lower resistance. A fuse with higher resistance easily lets a high current flow through it, melting it. Because the thick wire had lower resistance it did not receive the same high current flow that the smaller one did, thus not sparking or melting."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2380,"My question is ""Would you rather never use parallel or series circuits?"". Even though both of these types of circuits have their benefits, I would rather never use series circuits. I choose to only use parallel circuits because they are more efficient. The current in a series circuit decreases every time you add a light bulb. Whereas, the current in a parallel circuit is the same for each light bulb. Therefore, every time you add a light bulb to the circuit, you do not decrease the current that is going through the bulbs. Parallel circuits are more useful in this case, and lots of other cases. This information is generally applicable to people's lives because we as humans rely on lights and currents, we are very dependent on it and we should know the differences between the different circuits. This information might be used to benefit society because society would know what kind of circuit to use for certain cases."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2379,"There are a lot of topics in physics which are really beneficial for people's good. One of the many concepts in physics is crucial for people's day to day life which is the idea of potential charge. Electric charge is really important to understand because if there is ever a time when an individual comes in contact with some charge, they will be thrown off. In fact there have been many instances in India where broken wire cables or electrical lines would be cut down and may even be laying in water. As some kid might walk by, the electric charges throws the kid off and the kid mostly dies. There have been many instances of this type of scenario and it has been very alarming. Overall, electric charge is something that is really powerful and can disorient a person's life. Understanding the value or concept of potential/electric charge this semester has made me realize how significant it plays a role in physics also. Generally I through, topics such as acceleration would be the most common idea. However, learning about electric charge has been really helpful."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2381,"Im not rally sure  how I would apply any of the concepts beyond the scope of a lab or academic setting since I have a hard time looking past the equations and thinking critically. Here I go.  Why did the the small bit of foiil burst into flames? Looking through my notes I locate last weeks short circuit lab notes. Given how resisitance is calculated, resistance = resistivity × length / area, and given the small area of the foil this caused the resistance to have an incredibly high value. This meant that the foil ended up absorbing some of the energy running through the wire and converted it to heat. Its temperature rose it s combustion point and caught on fire.Replicating the experiment with a wider strip was fruitless and nothing happened because its resistance was significantly lower due to its larger area.Such information can be used when designing fuses to explode when a certain voltage has been reached and knowing which ones you may need for your house, A larger house typicallty consumes more electricity so you would want to get a higher rated fuse to avoid having a blowout when people are using lots of devices in the home."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2374,"In the past few weeks, I have learned so much stuff related to electric physics including point charge, source charge, electric force, electric field, voltage, electric flux, current, resistance, and so on. We can use Coulomb's law to calculate the force between point charges and source charges. Source charge is different from the point charge because it produces an ununiform eclectic field, so we need to use integral to calculate the electric flux on a surface. Besides, we learn about the relationship between capacitance, current, and resistance, which is R= V/ I. Also, series circuits and parallel circuits have different characteristics for the charge, capacitance, and electric potential. The series circuits have Vtotal = V1 = V2, Qtotal = Q1 + Q2, and C eq = C1 + C2 + ....+Cn, but parallel circuits have V total = V1 + V2, Qtotal = Q1 = Q2, and /1C eq = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + ....+1/Cn. Most recently, we learn about the resistance of a material depend on itself and the temperature. After learning some knowledge about electricity, we can know how to safely use our appliances in our houses. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,129,"My question is regarding electric flux and how it flows through electric field?I learned that the flux  is proportional to the density of the flow in the e field and how many lines are going through a virtual surface. The flux also varies by how the boundary faces the direction of flow and the area within the boundary.The effects of electric flux can be seen through the photocopying machines, radio transmitters, kitchen appliances and mobile phones.The benefits of electric flux is that it allows all electric items to operate light lights switches and computer devices"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2377,The topic that I have choose is from lab exploration week 2 which is charge lab and my question is what happens when we run a plastic or a rubber comb through our hair and after that how you determine that the comb contains negative or positive charge from our hairs? So I think here the comb will contain negative charge because of rubbing and the hair will pick up the positive charges. So the result the hair and comb both will attract each others.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,165,"A concept covered recently that I really enjoyed was the concept of Circuits. A question I ask myself when thinking of this topic is what is the difference between a series circuit and a parallel circuit? Now anyone who uses electricity in their daily lives should know this information because it can be applied whenever the power in your home goes out and you need to check your electrical box. To answer this question we need basic knowledge of what circuits are, A circuit is a closed-loop composed of wires, batteries, switches to power something such as a lightbulb. Electrons travel through these wires consecutively in order to power a bulb. There are parallel circuits and series circuits; In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each of the components in a circuit is the same, and the total current is the sum of the current flowing through the circuit. In a series circuit, every device must function for the circuit to be complete if one fails the whole system fails."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,151,"Since I’m studying computer science, I find electromagnetism and electronics fascinating. It’s kind of amazing that we’re able to manipulate current to invent life-changing technology. Thinking about our battery lab last week, the question I formulated was: why do electronics often stop working after batteries have corroded in them?We’ve all forgotten to take the batteries out of some electronic Halloween or Christmas decoration before putting it away for the year. Often, you’re met with a sad surprise the next year when you pull out the decoration and the old batteries have corroded and leaked all over the inside. Even if you manage to take the old batteries out and replace them with new ones, the decoration might never light up and make sounds again.This is often the result of the leaking contents of the old battery covering the contacts in the item. If the spot where the new battery should be making contact with the conductive metal holding it in place is covered in battery acid, it will have too much resistance to carry the current through the circuit from the battery. We’ve already discussed electrical conductors and insulators extensively this semester, as well as how only a closed circuit will carry charge. Batteries need to be touching conductive materials that connect it to a closed circuit on both the positive and negative end. You’re basically electrically insulating the contacts with the battery residue, so even if you change the batteries out, it won’t be able to close the circuit and carry charge through."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,147,"The concept I'm choosing is charges. When we learned about charge, we did a lab involving tape and a neutrally charged pen. We learned how opposite charges attract and same charged objects do not. Also how a neutrally charged object and a positively or negatively charged object will attract to each other as well. As the neutral charged object gets near the other objects, it configures itself to where its able to attract rather than repel. This relates to our everyday lives as everything is solely going towards running on just electricity. So having a good understanding of charges and how these objects act under certain circumstances is important. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,3,2371,Current lab taught me how electrons moved through the wires to light up the bulb(or bulbs). I was able to learn about two different types of circuits which are parallel and series. Parallel circuits are used in homes because the loads can be operated independently of each other.
