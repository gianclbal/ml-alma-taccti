2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2418,"I think that online classes impacted my learning negatively at first but now that we have had online classes for a year, it is now on the more positive side. For self-care, I have been giving myself breaks here and there so I am not sitting at my desk and in front of a screen for a long period of time. I recently also started going on bike rides with my aunt and uncle so that's something I can look forward to after a long week. One of my biggest concerns is that being at home and having online classes is allowing me to procrastinate even more. I have been working on it by using the Pomodoro study technique and it has been helping a lot. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2120,"Online classes have been pretty chill. I've always learned and googled things online to get my knowledge so this is nothing new to me. In person, i feel like i'm always fidgeting in class and spacing out but thats probably my adhd. I have no problem with being at home and learning because it gives me full flexibility to do what I need to do. I do miss making friends in person though and I feel like it's hard for me to make friends online because I'm more quiet and tend to do things on my own. Some things that I have been doing to keep myself sane is going for a jog in the morning. Sometimes we get the urge to just sleep in and get up 5 minutes before lecture and hop into class. I initially did that and I found it to be very unproductive. So I've been modeling my days like how I would be going to actual class to make it seem ""normal"". Of course even in normal days I'd probably skip class to take a breather day as well. All in all, I'm not concerned with how I study, I'm more concerned with how I'm going to interact with people in person once we get to that point again. Then again I deal with people everyday at work so who knows really. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2423,"I have mixed feelings about online classes. In one hand, it has allowed me to stay home instead of having to relocate to San Francisco. In doing so, I have saved money in being able to stay home as well as being close to my family in these troubling times. That being said, I also hate the online classes. It has taken away our ability to be in classes and interact as a classroom. I miss being able to see my classmates and learning together in an environment. I feel like the joy of going to learn has been taken away from us. Learning online has felt lifeless, robotic and worst of all, optional. It takes away my motivation to go to class when it is on a computer screen. In terms of learning, I feel like I am learning the same, just a bit more distraction being at home. In terms of self care, I am at home healthy with my family who are all also doing well so at least theirs that. In conclusion, i feel like online learning is not as good as learning in a classroom."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2429,"Online classes have impacted my life and my learning in several ways. I feel that with the online learning structure students have a bit more time to mess around, which can be good and bad. I do not feel that I have learned as much as in-person classes. I have always found it hard to take online courses and tend to shy away from them in general. Since the pandemic, my days have been more scheduled, I usually stick to a strict schedule but I feel like I have had to make my days much more organized so I do not fall behind in my classes, fall behind on work, and I have scheduled some free time. Overall, I feel like this has been beneficial but it has made everyday life a bit harder. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2427,"Taking online classes came through as a culture shock for me because of what I've been doing for the past several years of my life, which is going to school, attending classes, getting an education in an interactive in-person manner where I felt pretty comfortable. Online courses were always available but when COVID 19 started everything was moved online regardless of how we feel about it, it helped me learn a lot more not just about school but myself. It gave me the option to do things that I was unable to do because of the time spent in the classroom plus the commute and the hassle. I've grown as an individual and understand my mind and body better. I have started waking up earlier waking up, cooking for myself, while still catching up with school. It's not the greatest because my CALC 2 class didn’t go as planned and I do believe it would’ve been better if that was in person, but hey there are pros and cons to everything. The cons are obvious and unchangeable since we are in a pandemic, but the pros are more than I would’ve expected. I've grown to understand my body and mind, I meditate, cook, work towards my goals, work for school, go on runs, work on cars, and enjoy my time. I love school being online, to be honest, because I get a lot more stress-free time on my hands, it helps me develop habits and take care of myself. The pandemic has left me with something good and the skills I've developed over this time, I plan on using them in my life and provide myself with excellent structure and time management to reach my full potential in life."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2424,"Online classes have impacted my learning pretty significantly. Ever since online classes started, I've felt less motivated in my classes. With in person classes, it was easier for me to get into a routine and I would do a majority of my school work at the library or somewhere on campus. However, since everything is closed at the moment, my study environment and habits aren't as good. In addition to this, I find it more difficult to learn in online classes compared to in person classes. In terms of self-care, I'm making sure to exercise a couple times a week, especially since I've been spending a majority of my time in front of the computer. I'm also making sure to take breaks once in a while to relax. One of my concerns is how well I'm learning the material in my classes, since they're online. Also, I'm a little worried about my mental health, as it's been about a year now since quarantine started and I've spent a lot of time indoors."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,707,"Online Classes the first couple of semesters weren’t terrible, as we were all trying to transition to online learning and such, but when it came to the complete year; Fall Semester and Spring Semester, leaving my entire Second Year to be online, it honestly has been very draining. Keeping up with everything being online from my extracurriculars, to hanging out with friends and to taking classes and doing homework, I constantly felt like I was glued to the screen and even if I wanted to take a break, I would still be stuck to the screen and would end up doing research on my future or organizing schedules and my degree progress report. I have learned however that I never really set time for myself through the online process every moment of the day I’m doing something for school or for my extracurriculars and I’ve been beginning to feel burnt out and numb to all of the work and assignments of being online. The same goes for having to self-teach myself some topics in Physics and Chemistry; it’s been really hard, and although it is encouraging to hear other students in the class are doing the same thing, it doesn’t help when there isn't effective communication between professors. If I could relax however, I could ignore most of my work and forcibly take the time to do my own relax time and then when I feel up to it, before a due date, then would I jump into it and tackle it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2112,"Online classes have greatly impacted my learning. Mainly because there are too many distractions at home. I find it hard to study and do homework properly. What I do for self care is talking online with my friends, and drawing and animating in the meantime. My main concern is keeping my grades at a decent grade. mainly because my classes this semester are a lot harder. And being at home doesn't help much either since teachers can only do so much via zoom. I learn a lot better in person and I don't have that luxury anymore."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,152,"Online classes have several positives and negatives. In my experience, although learning online is possible and I’m capable of it, Many departments fail to restructure their courses to better fit the style of learning that results from online classes. In particular I notice that too many classes still have midterms and finals. My math and physics courses have fewer of those, but both seem to still engage me and make me learn the subject matter.I’m frustrated with several departments not restructuring at all, whilst expecting students to pick up the pieces. In my discrete math class (a computer science course) we have finals and midterms and tests that put too much pressure on students and emphasize memorization over deeper understanding of subjects. Other courses that haven’t been restructured have far too much homework and studying required to be applicable for online classes.So right now my mental health is right on the edge of being in bad shape. Thankfully, I’m particularly good at noticing times when my mental health is low and reminding myself of taking breaks. The stress of school seems to just stack up more and more, but I’m ready to complete this semester’s courses and move onto another few semesters of online school."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2428,"My learning has been greatly impacted when we shifted to online.  I have become more frustrated when attempting to work out problems.  I do know that SFSU is attempting to do everything in their power to make this time as easy as they can, but it is still hard.  In my house we have four people going to class online and everyday we have a family meeting to see how everything is going.  The family meetings are my way of doing self-care.  We also now have movie night every Sunday.  We also have two nights designated for eating fast food.  My family will get through this and I know I will as well.  It is just that I have a lot of responsibilities as a father.  I also have my mother and my mother-in-law that I help on a weekly basis.  It is almost like having three homes to take care of."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2089,"Online classes have more than likely had a negative overall impact on my learning and socializing. I feel as though engineering and mathematical concepts are harder to grasp on a computer screen than in person. The volume of work for the majority of my courses has been increased to compensate for the lack of in person instruction; which also makes things more difficult. In all honesty, I really haven't been doing anything for self care. I really should be though, because I certainly don't feel healthy during this time, I have dropped (again) from 150 pounds to 130, and I am only 5' 9"" tall. I am concerned about that, my diet, and my grades. l feel like we have been doing online learning forever now, and sometimes I feel like I am missing out on a lot of education and experience that other people at different universities get to have. It also gets old not seeing other people anymore, I pretty much remain isolated, hopefully I get to see some people once I am vaccinated next month, but waking up in the morning sometimes gets old; I don't like seeing my face anymore in the mirror considering I don't really see any others besides at the grocery store or gas station."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2420,"Online has classes have really made it difficult for me to stay focused at my desk. The desire to always be in my bed next to me and really took away some of my motivation. I do not know if I am learning anything or not. I would study last minute, study enough to pass and finish homework in time. This has been a big routine for me and I feel bored to do anything. Nonetheless, I do like learning things at my own pace. This is what I admire about online classes the most which if why I don't mind them but I would also like to be in class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2422,"Online class impacted my learning by not really being able to understand most topics because it's really hard to stay focused. For the past few semesters, online classes negatively impacted my learning because I'm having trouble retaining the information when I'm looking at a screen. For self-care I'm trying to keep myself busy by playing video games, watching movies, and doing things that will keep my mind away. I'm really concerned about my learning but this is more of a ME problem, than the online class's problem. It's my fault that I can't stay concentrated when I'm staring at a screen. Although I'm struggling to learn in class, I find online classes to be convenient and fun because I don't have to wake up extremely early just to go to school. In fact, online classes helps to improve my well-being because I'm able to get a goo amount of sleep by not having to worry I'll be late to class. To resolve my learning problems, I guess I could try to be more active in class so I would be able to maintain my concentration when learning."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2077,"Online classes have significantly affected my learning in that it is really hard for me to learn in this online format, I dont really have any self-care things as I don't really know what that means. Concerns I have about my learning is that I'm just getting by and that I'm not really learning anything about the subject."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2101,"Online classes have been pretty difficult for my learning and life overall. From an academic perspective, It’s difficult to seek clarification because I never know when a good time to communicate is, and it’s also difficult to group together and work on assignments as a class. From a more personal perspective, emergencies are hard to deal with, and really put a damper on my motivation, and at home dynamics are frustrating. As an anecdote, I was rear ended during midterms and there was very little that could be done to try to get extensions or makeups, which is to be expected, but I feel like being online made it just a bit harder on the professors. There are some benefits to online instruction, including setting your own schedule, so long as one can keep to it. Another one would be the safety that comes with it during this period of uneasiness. That keeps me very conflicted as we enter the final phases of the semester. I hope that the next few semesters go well."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2430,"I hardly have any free time this semester, which I don't really mind. I enjoy when I keep busy, because feeling productive makes me feel accomplished at the end of each day. This semester, I'm taking 19 units in addition to other commitments, so I'm able to keep very busy. Having constant work to do doesn't ever get me down, if anything, its motivating to me. Usually, I'm able to get in a discord call with friends who I met at SFSU for an hour or two before I go to bed for the night. I would say that these calls are my main form of self-care, just keeping in touch with and talking to friends despite being online. Before the pandemic, all of us were the ""gamer"" type of people, so transitioning to discord felt natural. My specific group of friends has been very active since the start of the pandemic, so we've all supported each other throughout remote learning.Some concerns I have are that professors sometimes attempt to replace the experience we are missing of in-person interactions with more work for students. I'd say this was pretty common towards the start of the pandemic since most of my professors have stopped assigning ridiculous amounts of work compared to in-person."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2425,"I think online learning has drastically impacted everyone from the professors to students. As I'm sure many of others I had not taken an online class before and had previously only been on campus at my last school so the jump to strictly online was pretty drastic. I've had to adapt how i study for exams and reading materials as I don't have much of a quiet place at home but one of the things I like doing is sitting outside and reading or studying because I get to go outside and its somewhat more quiet. My concerns are about getting help outside of the class as in tutors or just general questions about homework and when coming back how those tutors or outside help will be a available when we are allowed to meet with some small groups. Another thing that is challenging is the amount of work given for some classes is pretty insane, like last semester my Physics lab explorations were extremely lengthy and on top of that there was the other various submissions for that weeks lab. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,195,"I can't believe it's already a year now since the first time we moved from in-person classes to online classes. The biggest change will be that we do not need to show up physically at school. All we do is just sitting in front of our computers and interact with the courses through Zoom. And we can be less shy somehow and be able to speak up when we have questions. I actually love online courses because one advantage of online courses is that we can watch the recordings of our lectures to refresh our memories and strengthen what we've learned, and I think this helps me a lot."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2426,"Personally, I feel like online classes have negatively affected my productivity. I feel like it’s easier to slack off. Since everything is on a computer, its easy to pull up social media or a game in the background during a Zoom lecture. If I don’t pay attention in class, I sometimes have to take time outside of class to rewatch lecture recordings. With online learning, I also find it harder to get help from classmates, since there isn’t much social interaction between peers. Also, with asynchronous classes, some teachers don’t give solid deadlines for when to complete certain assignments, so it makes it more difficult to know when stuff is due. I think that online learning is also making things difficult for instructors, since some have fallen behind on grading and other tasks teachers should do. I think online learning is giving us all excessive stress, and we should all make sure we aren’t burned out."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,176,Online classes for me have been fairly challenging. One of the major things for me is the experience of actually going into a physical classroom and being in that environment it puts me in the mindset of being ready to learn and what not. While with online classes being at home can be extremely distracting or I just won't be in the mindset to be ready to engage in class. Every semester so far I have had to have 8am classes and those can be really tough if I don't physically get myself out of bed before entering the class. Specifically with physics and math it can be really difficult for professors to convey an idea from the other side of the screen and not to mention my internet connection being pretty bad at times. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,137,"Online classes have indeed impacted the way I learn. It feels more self-taught as I rely more on the textbook and homework to understand and gain an idea on the concepts we’re learning. As for self-case, I would play a game to relieve stress. Last semester I focused a lot on work right now and didn’t have a lot of free time. Now I make sure to have a few hours of relaxation by playing the game. I make sure to not spend too much time on it but just enough so that I don’t overwork myself. I do feel a bit stressed with the workload, as this is my first year in college and everything is online instead of in person, so I came in pretty confused and unsure of what to do. However, I am doing better now compared to the first semester as I was able to make a schedule of what I should be doing everyday."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,153,"Online classes have definitely reshaped learning as a whole. Classes and assignments are definitely more flexible and time management is not as bad considering there is no commute. However, online class makes it much harder to keep track of assignment dates and I feel that it is more difficult to retain knowledge from video lectures as opposed to in-person lectures. The only advantage of video lectures that I see is the ability to watch recorded classes via zoom. As far as self-care, I have a lot more time on my hands so I have been spending more time with my family and my dog. I've also tried to spend some of that time exploring new hobbies. I'm concerned that I will not be able to make a smooth adjustment once in-person classes do start back up. I also feel as though I've gotten a lot worse at social interactions due to self isolation."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,135,Online classes have been tough on my learning I find it hard to stay focused in class and to get the help I need. I know that I could do office hours online online way but I don’t feel comfortable doing so since I have no relationship with the professor in a personal way. My self-care is my top priority these days. I am doing well keeping up with my health and sanity along with family life and friends. My concern is that by staying online my education is not as beneficial as in person. I hope to one day go back to the classrooms because that is what I need to be the best I can be. The action of going in to class and making that conscious decision helps me realize why I am here and Continue to push towards my goals. I would like to go back to that time
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2421,"This is my first semester at SFSU so I have yet to have a class on campus. That being said, I think I'm enjoying taking my classes online. I have a desktop computer at home with two monitors, and I have all of my school stuff organized at my desk. I can't forget anything because everything is in one place, and without the commute there's no reason that I would be late for class. This is the first semester that I've had 100% in every single class, so I think online school has been good for me. To give me reason to get out of the house and away from the computer, I applied for a plot in the community garden next-door to my apartment. I've been enjoying prepping my plot and starting my vegetables. For the first year of the pandemic I was pretty homebound, so it's felt good to get out every morning and water my plot."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,158,"Online classes have impacted my learning because unlike classes where you can see people face-to-face, you only can see people online. Online classes don’t let us use our body language fully to express ourselves, but instead adds features online like in Zoom in order for us to express ourselves, but it’s still not the same as when we see each other face-to-face. For self-care, I just have to sleep early enough so that I could wake up and then have enough energy to go through the day. I also have to eat snacks to give me enough energy also to go through the day along with eating food at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I don’t have a lot of concerns for my learning and my well-being."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2071,"I feel like online learning has greatly impacted my way of learning. I belive this because not only did we all have to adapt quickly and overcome the transition, but be away from an eviroment that was education oriented. The places we stay or learn at does not have the same effect as the college campus. What i'm doing for selfcare is having a day to myself away from school and other things that will stress me so that i can decompress. What concerns i have for my learning is if i actually can transition back smoothly into at campus learning as well as if i got the right education because many classes weren't like how they would be at college for example labs. You lose out on the hands on experience and i dont know when i come back will i be able to pass classes that are more adavanced than my foundation classes. lastly the concerns that i have for my well being is that i dont go out as much as i used to making me feel more isolated and lazy. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2130,"Online classes has drained me mentally. I feel no motivation to do anything, but I still end up doing it. As a student with a learning disability, it has been more of a struggle than in person. It’s very hard to be focused and engaged in the class. My grades have also not been as great as they were when classes were not online. My mental health has been horrible to the point where it caused other health problems. I hope things get better and this pandemic ends."
