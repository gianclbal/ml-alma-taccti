2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2427,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?My goal in life is to get involved in the automotive industry whether it be transportation or formula one racing, I want to help in the development of the automotive industry. This class could deeply help me achieve my goals because this is one of the fundamental things that I need to know in order to understand mechanics and physics better. I need to keep expanding my knowledge to prove resourceful later in life, in order to do that I need to get a better deeper understanding of real-life problems I would face in the field. This class tackles the problems that include calculus 2 and has been helping me develop a better understanding in areas where integration or derivation is required. I have always been into physics and love knowing how real-life things works and how to encounter the issues that may occur while creating, implementing, or troubleshooting certain parts of the machinery. I believe I need to have a certain level of knowledge before stepping into the field of physics and this class offers a very specific piece of knowledge that I require to achieve my goals."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2077,My goals are to graduate and become a mechanical engineer and this class  will help me do so in teaching me the basics of engineering. This class  will also help my goals in that it is a graduation requirement as well  as a prerequisite to other c;asses. I hope what I get out of this class  is knowledge of the subject and the relationships that hopefully will be  made throughout this course to help me achieve my goals in life.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2089,"My goal is to receive from this course a level of understanding of physics that I will need academically for my degree, and for this understanding to be at such a level thaT I can apply to to an engineering job that I will have in the future. This class can help me do this by giving me building blocks of engineering and concepts that I will need to tap into to hold a job doing engineering design after I graduate. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2130,"My goal in this class is to get comfortable and confidant with the materials. Since I have to take physics 240 as well, I want to be able to be good at it. I hope to get an A in this class, as well as my physics class. I am more of a visual learner, I like to understand how we use it in our lives. I am having a hard time with my physics professor because she has been very rude and unclear. I know you are a better professor, and I like how kind you are, it makes me more comfortable in your class. So keep being yourself and I know I will be successful in this class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2428,"My goal is to earn my CS Degree.  I have a lot of people depending on me to achieve this goal that I cannot let down.  My immediate family needs me to pass this not only to earn money in the future but more importantly to show my three sons that if you put your mind to something you can accomplish anything.  Both my Mother and Mother-in-law are widows and depend on me to help around the house on a weekly basis.  They are also in need of financial assistance within the next two years.  I would also like to help other people going through this same process in the future.  This class is mandatory for me to accomplish.  I also like physics when I understand it.  When I read the textbook, it is almost as if it is written in another language.  It is difficult but if there is a way, I will find it. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,137,"My goal is to work as a game developer, which is why my major is computer science. A requirement for this major is that I need to take this physics course and lab, so it’s a small step for me to achieve my goal. Not only that, but the subject will be important for me to understand in the future, for both my major and to have knowledge of. Another goal I have is to learn as much as I can, and I don’t want to limit myself to only learning about computer science, so I like taking this lab course. It may help me in the future someday. I want to gain as much knowledge as I can, because I want to learn. Specifically working in this lab class helps me because it gives me a better understanding of the subject, since it’s more of a hands on experience than just reading a book and watching videos."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,707,"Eventually, I want to go to Med School. After graduating from SF State, I want to be able to earn a degree in my major, B.S in Biology, Physiology while also earning two minor degrees in Chemistry and Mechanical Engineering. This class gives me the opportunity to take prerequisites that also happen to work towards my major degree; but along with those working towards my major degree, they also allow me to earn units towards a minor in Mechanical Engineering. I wanted to do Biomedical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering seemed like the way to go and it seems a lot more fun compared to focusing on the computer aspect of the other CS/Comp. E minors. This class specifically allows me to have an in depth look at electricity and how it works. I think this is something important to understand because electricity is around us. In Med School, most of the medical devices have some sort of electric energy source which allows them to work and provide information that doctors and nurses need. This could help in broadening my understanding with different devices and abilities in Med School, but it also gives me a chance to have fallbacks as I will have background knowledge in these concepts."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,135,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?One of my biggest goals this semester is to understand the basic concepts layed out in physics. I want to be able to explain physics to others since it is a common insecurity for many students. I think this would also be helpful for me later in life, although I want to be a data scientist and not an engineer. However, the versatility of understanding physics that understanding it brings is a big incentive for me. Another big goal of mine in general in life is to not waste my time. So, by trying my best to understand the concepts presented in physics I will be saving myself the time of repeating the class, and furthermore will not be wasting my own time pretending to understand a subject I truly find interesting ,complex, and worth the work."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2424,"My goal is to graduate from San Francisco State University with a degree in computer science and get a good paying job that I enjoy. I'm not sure what field of computer science I'd like to work in at the moment, but I'm leaning towards software development. Also, I'd like to work on something meaningful that will help others. Since technology is changing so quickly and becoming a bigger part of our everyday lives, I believe there's a lot of opportunities to work on projects that are making people's lives better. This class can help me achieve this goal since it's a requirement for computer science majors. In addition to this, while I may not necessarily use physics in the future beyond this class, I think taking this class will teach me valuable problem solving and math skills that I can use in the future, as they're both useful for programming."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2420,"My goal is to get this computer science degree so in the future I can get a job and work on great projects. This class is a small step that I need to conquer in order to unlock my next level towards my goal. Physics is a great subject to learn and understand. It does get difficult but it is one of those classes which can strengthen what you are trying to accomplish In the real world. In the future I hope to program a few machines and AI on the come up, learning physics and computer science the two things that help you get ahead in the game. Nonetheless, I need to focus on school for now and not get ahead of myself which is why this class is the first step towards my success. Thinking ahead can damage the present which would ultimately affect the future."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2425,"My goals are to complete this this class with a B or better as it is a prereq for my course work for my CS degree. Historically, I have had a little bit of difficulty in Physics and this being an online semester I expect it will make it just as challenging, but also last semester in physics 1 I got a B in both lec/lab so I know I can do it. My main goal is to continue with my education with Computer Science as it what I am most interested in learning about. Also another goal would be to get more comfortable with the material while getting a better understanding of visually of how things work as I am more of a visual learner. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2112,"My goal is to achieve a career in design in the field of engineering, this class will help me get there because I need to understand the basics and fundamental laws of physics before i can even think about getting fancy with designing products. Through this class, it will help me become familiar in the world of physics and how electric fields and energies may affect the things around it. With all of that, i'm sure this class will help me prepare myself for my future career down the line."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2429,"I believe that this course will give me a better understanding of circuits and electricity, which will give me better insight into how computers work. I also think that taking this course will better my critical thinking skills and problem-solving skill, which will in turn help me become a better programmer. By having better critical thinking skills I will be able to create more complex algorithms and hopefully faster runtimes for my work. My goal to be a better computer programmer and have an understanding of how a computer works, will ultimately come from practice. I also think that this class will give me a better understanding of how electricity works, which is the main power source of a computer and many other things. In order to achieve my goals, I will try to achieve a high grade in this course and ask questions when I am stuck. I enjoy this lab a lot and I am glad to be a part of its class. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2422,"I don't really have any long term goals. But my only goal right now is to graduate college. This class can help me achieve this goal because I would liked to graduate and get a bachelors degree for computer engineering without having to retake any classes. For all my years of education, I've never failed any classes granted that only F is a failing. But the lowest grade I've ever gotten in my life was ending with a C. So I would like to get my degree and graduate without failing a class. This class is giving me the most trouble for not trying to fail because I really dislike watching YouTube videos for my education. I feel like I'm having a hard time understanding what is going on because I'm not used to learning from YouTube videos. I'm trying my best to keep up with what's going on but I don't know if I'm still uncomfortable with this learning method or physics in general. I know that physics is hard to understand because it teaches us about concepts in reality but I don't think the videos help my understanding any better. I can achieve my goal by trying a little harder in this class even though I already am. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2418,"One of my goals for this semester is to pass all of my classes and to gain more knowledge from them. I had plans to go to grad school after graduating but right now, I am not entirely sure if that is what I am meant to do. After some re-thinking, the new plan is to potentially move to Seattle and maybe reconsider grad school after the move. I can't really think of a way that this class will help in these goals/plans of mine other than the fact that this class is required for me. But I am here to learn. :)"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2421,"I'm pretty confident with my ability to code, but I've always had an interest in mechanical things. A year or two ago I made a few Arduino projects. One of them was a freezer alarm to prevent my roommate from accidentally thawing all our chicken, and another was an automatic blind opener to give my plants sunlight during the day and me privacy during the night. More recently I made a knock box that would listen for a pattern and knock back using a solenoid, matching tempo and all. I would like to do a lot more than this though. I want to make some projects involving more complex circuitry, but I have a very limited understanding of electronics. It's my hope that this class will further my understanding to a point that I don't have to rely entirely on tutorials to build circuits. Aside from my own projects, I would really like to understand a lot more about electromagnets. As a kid I was really into roller coasters, and I would study them and their construction. I would love to understand how linear induction motors and linear synchronous motors work."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2071,My goals for my career is to become an electrical engineer either working on big industrial places to move large amounts of electricity or tesla. This class would help me achieve these goals by learning the concepts and equations i will most likely be using in my everyday work life. Learning the concepts are crucial to building and developing as well as maintaing structures and big items that require large amounts of electricity. I believe these things will help me accomplish my goals of becoming an electrical engineer as well as helping my family if i get a good job. Because if i get a good job that pays well i can help out those who i love as well as the community i grew up in. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,176,"My goal for most of my life has been to work on cars in some capacity. That is why I chose my major to be ME. Physics is a vital part to learning how a car functions. More traditionally, cars are associated with Newtonian physics like I did last year. But since now electric cars are what is in high demand the physics of this semester will be extremely important. This class also plays a role in my ability to get my degree to even get into the field that I want. So that translates to another goal to just pass all my classes. With all the online learning it is hard for me to grasp all the concepts without physically being in a classroom. This class being a lab I would have much rather preferred to do in person but given the circumstance this class will still probably help me understand stuff to pass the lecture with the simulation and visuals."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,195,"My current goal now is to get a job after I graduate. I will need to prepare myself for that. I'm majoring in computer science major, so in other to get a job in this industry. I need to learn and master as many programming languages as I can. I especially like to work as a frontend developer because I enjoy making websites look great. It gives me a sense of accomplishment. I think this course might somewhat help me to achieve my goal since programming involves physics sometimes. If we work for a company and our boss might require us to work on a project that involves how two objects collide with each other, and this is the time when physics becomes handy."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,158,My goals are to graduate from college and also to keep learning how the world works. This class can help me achieve these goals because this class is a requirement for me to get my college degree. And also this lab gives me more knowledge on how physics works through lab activities. The lab activities are pretty interesting and it helps me understand on how the world really works.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2120,"My long term goals are still to graduate with a mechanical engineering degree and then join the Air Force as combat rescue officer. Once I get out of service I plan to get my masters in engineering and/or work at a biomedical device company preferably Neuralink. Some short term goals would be to get a 3.5-4.0 GPA this semester, swim 1500 meters within 24-35 minutes, and run 3 miles within 22 minutes. This class allows me to have the building blocks of what a mechanical engineer should know and also think analytically as I progress my career in engineering and the military. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2426,"If I’m going to be honest, my main goal for this class is to meet requirements for my computer science major. However, that does not mean I should not take this class seriously. I hope that in this class, I can understand more about physics and the electronic devices that I use daily. Especially in a computer science major, even though 99% of it is about computer software, I think that having some understanding of computer hardware is also beneficial. By learning physics E&M, I can gain a better understanding of how certain electronics function, which might help me understand problems in software. Some examples of this might be how knowing how an SSD stores data can help me create more efficient methods of data storage, or how understanding the workings of a CPU can help me write faster code. I think that these are all important, even though most of the time I won’t interact directly with the hardware I am writing software for."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2430,"This class will help me achieve my goals by first, satisfying my physics degree requirement since I am majoring in computer science. Besides that, having a better understanding of how the world works is always good. Understanding how electricity works will most likely come in handy since I'll be working with electronics for the rest of my life. Technology will only evolve, so I expect to live in an even more electricity-demanding world in the future. Other than broad statements like these, I'm not sure how this class will help me with my goals. I don't have a solid idea of what physics knowledge will be used for in my life other than as handy information to have. I was talking to my friends about what physics could be used for after graduation, and we all came up a blank since we all plan to work on some sort of software, not physical materials. This probably is the exact opposite kind of response you're looking for, sorry about that."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2423,"One of my goals for majoring in computer science is getting a major that is relevant to the uprising presence of technology in our society. My main objective is to understand software, but I know that hardware plays an important role in how technological devices operate, That is where electricity and magnetism can help me understand how it is that this technology distributes its power and how it helps me with what programs I can input to the memory, without overloading it. In addition, Physics is a class where complex problems and concepts are put into mathematical equations for solving. This will help me with how I approach a tough programming task and it will help me have the patience to deal with it.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,153,"My goals are to grow my knowledge, obtain a degree in Computer Science, and then eventually get a job as a programmer. This class helps me achieve those goals as it does give me knowledge that can be useful at times. It helps me obtain my degree as it is one of the requirements for my major. It also helps somewhat when actually getting a job as a programmer as there are many concepts that do translate. Physics problems, similarly to coding, require a good amount of critical thinking skills to solve. Both fields contain many instances where you will have to use both logical deductions and theoretical concepts to solve problems. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2419,"My goals are to graduate SFSU with my bachelor's. I think more than anything, this class will connect me to meeting my goal by keeping my discipline more than the actual content will. Now that I'm doing this class ""asynchronously,"" I need to stay disciplined with class and work. Yes, I'll learn many things from this class, but in all honesty, it's not something that will stick with me for years to come. The time management I learn is what will stick with me. Collaborating is something I'll learn as well; thankfully, platforms like Discord make it easy to share ideas. I tend to have an upside-down bell curve when it comes to proactivity when it comes to academia. During the middle of the semester, I get into a slump with my education and work that takes some time to get out of. I'm hoping I could try to stay more proactive throughout the semester. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,152,"My goals are to succeed in college, having a deep understanding of how to apply my skills in computer science to my career. Succeeding in this course can help me have a better understanding of how to apply these skills in a real life situation. Assume I have a job where I have to work with electronic engineers and physicists to produce software for something like AI drones: If I were to have a poor understanding of physics, I couldn’t make reasonable calculations in my code for how much power to send to the motors. The software I would write would need to have realistic parameters and would need to consider the physics of everyday life. I would need to account for things like gravitational acceleration and wind forces on the drone in order to have some semblance of stabilization. I would also have to account for the voltage the system is sending to the motors and understand the expected life of the battery so it won't die unexpectedly when it's battery dies. Working with those around me, I would consider all possible scenarios to keep the drone safely capable of self-stabilizing or following its own set path without crashing. I hope I can learn several important physics formulas and theories to help make a good product. That’s how I hope this class will help with my goals."
