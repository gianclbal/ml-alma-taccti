2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2425,My greatest take away from this class would be how supplemental classes really help learning Physics and especially while learning online. I have needed to take a class that was part of another but now I am seeing the real benefits. One benefit would be how when something is not clear in lecture or even when you can follow along with a problem but might not get a step there is extra help to aid in learning. With everything online its sometimes really difficult to find specific answers to sometimes general questions and this helps a lot. Another benefit would be getting together with other people from the class and talking about what is going on in the section or even just hearing what they are having trouble learning. It helps get a different perspective on topics I might not have thought about and maybe a new way to approach the problem
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,137,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that I still managed to learn and understand the concept and physics in general, such as charge and current, without actually being in a lab. I thought it would be more challenging and I wouldn’t be able to grasp the information. I still do think in-person would do a better job, but due to the circumstances we’re in, it’s pretty difficult and risky to do so. I think I had a really good understanding of specific energy in this class, as the simulations helped a lot. When I finished the lab, I tried playing around with what else I can do in the simulations and try to understand what’s happening and why it’s taking this action. I think the simulations helped a lot since they were basically an online version of an experiment, and there were a lot of simulations for the energy lab so I think that’s why I was able to get a good idea of it. I know how it’s used in real-life scenarios and how it’s never created nor destroyed, but is instead transferred."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2112,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that physics can be understood a lot more if you have a hands-on approach. Even though I love science and physics, some of the concepts are a little hard to grasp for me, a good example being the circuits. But having this class and actually working through the topic helped me understand how circuits work and the math behind solving them."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2101,"My greatest takeaway from this course has to be my expanded view on electricity and magnetism in our everyday lives. I can look at anything plugged into the outlets in my room, appliances like the microwave oven, and even the induction Motors used in electric vehicles, and have a simplistic understanding of the things going on to make that happen. While we did only get a basic overview of things like circuits and other topics, I feel like the course did prepare me to take those courses in the future, and not be completely lost when introduced to those subjects. other than widening my perspective, I really enjoyed and took a lot from the cooperation with my classmates, who always managed to get everyone involved with the every lab and help each other is understanding of that week’s subject. Hopefully, I can get people like them to cooperate with me again, and hopefully I can experience a class as fun as this one once again."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2429,"The greatest takeaway from taking this course would be a better understanding of how electricity and magnetism work. Although this course was taken online and learning is generally harder for me online, I feel like I learned a lot. Working with others in the course has been a great benefit, not only can ask my peers when I need clarification, I can clarify questions for others which gives me a better understanding of the topic. Learning about electric fields and circuits will help me in my goal of becoming a software engineer in many ways, if I were to decide to get into the hardware side of the software industry I would have to work with physical circuits and computer hardware. With a firm understanding of the concepts covered in this course, I think I will be able to do well in that field if I wanted to. Thank you for the opportunity to take the course and to better my understanding of these concepts. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2427,"My biggest takeaway from this class was the group work and the collaboration skills I learned, working with people and figuring out the problems throughout the course, working with people is essential to succeed in the engineering field. The course also helped me make a connection with several physics concepts to real life, having a practical physical or simulation to represent real-life physics concepts helped me greatly to develop a better picture and understanding of these concepts. This course helped me get more familiar with a lab environment, even though everything was online its important to know how to collaborate with other people using online platforms because a pandemic could happen anytime and it should not be able to stop the research or work we put that much time and effort in. Just having enough skills to communicate and work together without having to be there in person would go a long way and these skills would come in handy.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2422,"My greatest take away from this class was the electric circuits, current, and voltage topics. Those are my greatest take away from this class because I'm majoring in computer engineering and I would need to know about these subjects if I want to pursue my major. If I don't learn about circuits, I wouldn't be able to understand what it takes to build computers or other electronics. I would need to learn about the electric currents because it's essential to electronics since it's mostly powered by electricity. So I would need to know how the current flows in a computer. I would also need to know about voltage because different electronics need different amount of electricity to power. Some computers have a higher voltage output for their processors and some have lower. The amount of volts will vary, so I would need to know how to find how many volts is compatible with certain components of a computer."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,195,"The greatest take away of this class is that It helps me learn lots of physics concepts. The class is fun and helpful at the same time. By doing the experiments, we have a better understanding of what the concept is and how it works. This is something we can achieve by just reading the textbook or doing the quizzes from the textbook. When we are doing the lab experiments, we are interacting with the objects and this can help us build a stronger connection to the concepts that we previously do not know about. I'm glad this class is required for us to take because this is not a class we can get rid of. Without this class, students might find it difficult to learn physics. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2430,"My greatest takeaway was learning about how electricity worked. I use electric devices every hour of every day. In the future, as we advance more and more, I think that understanding how our devices work will be increasingly important. If I'm being completely honest, I wouldn't be able to explain exactly how they work off the top of my head. I would need to look through our textbook for several hours to connect topics and equations. I feel like I would have a much greater understanding if I had experienced this class in-person, but with online courses, I'm only left to be taught for about 30 minutes before each lab begins. I know it's not even your job to teach us these materials- its our lecturer's, but that's not what happens. Not even the synchronous sections of my professor's include the professor teaching material. I used to show up to them despite being in the asynchronous section, but me and every other student in the class soon realized we'd be left to teach ourselves physics for this semester. Instead of teaching material, we (very quickly) review textbook slides that we should apparently fully understand ahead of time. When students speak up about not understanding material, we're met with tantrums and scolding on how we are bad students. Sorry to turn this into a rant, but it's where my flow of thoughts went to."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,153,"My biggest takeaway from this class is I was able to gain a better understanding for how the world works. Concepts such as magnets or circuits are seen commonly in our everyday lives, but before I did not know the actual science behind them. Learning about the science and processes needed for these commodities to exist has given me a greater appreciation for scientists and electricians as there are so many nuances in their profession that I am now aware of. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,707,"This class personally tested me towards the idea of that Mechanical Engineering Minor. Although I do need this physics class for my Major itself, the ideas and concepts here I tried to understand in order to gage if I was really interested in pursuing the Mechanical Engineering Minor. I could’ve taken the regular PHYS112 class, however I wanted to challenge myself by taking on a class that has the requirement of a Calculus 2 background. As difficult as calculus 2 was, I want to say that this class better prepared me when it comes to thinking about physics and that the overall idea and structure of each and every concept isn’t difficult; if you really want it to work and you really want to learn how certain voltages and how many different parallel and perpendicular circuits there are, then this class was very interesting in that sense. It also showed me that there are many different minds that want to learn physics; and this class was almost the definition of future engineers and scientists that aren’t also from the Biology Department like myself. It was very interesting to see their interests portray into the ideas that they knew and understood and tied it into learning with their different majors versus myself."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,135,"My greatest take away from this class would be that I am a visual learner. I learned that I was a visual learner when it comes to physics because I have seen that I obtain a clear understanding after interacting with the labs. The labs help me understand concepts better because they usually have some sort of interactive graphic that is used as a tool to break down concepts within my physics ebook. I like that I can clearly see what is taking place and how the laws of physics are important and fundamental in every day life. With pictures to go with the words, and the ability to play around with different experiments, I am able to make real life observations in real time as well. Quarantine has been rough and many of my classes are hard to follow due to the lack of resources and alloted time."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,152,"The biggest impact I’ve experienced from this class is the understanding that work should be done piecemeal. My experience with online classes totally changed my view of them. Previously I would’ve told you that online classes are way easier than courses in person, however now that I’ve experienced around a full semester of them, I’ve come to the realization that they’re much harder than real classes. I honestly didn’t anticipate the degree to which time management and other independent study habits would impact my success in classes, compared to classes in person. I’ve learned to set up a system which allows you to complete all of the work for a class at a reasonable pace, all while keeping up with my other classes. Being able to pace myself and control my class material is a pretty good way to put these into practice."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2428,"My greatest take away from this class is that I use to not ask as many questions.  I knew before this class about circuits, but I never knew why they acted the way they did.  I see myself regularly talking to my children about what I learned today and attempting to relate it to something they do on a daily basis.  Just last week I was talking to my youngest son about how the electricity in the house works.  Another take away from this class is that contrary to popular belief two years ago, it can be taught online.  Who would have thought? It is a little bit different than being in a physics lab, but I still like it. I am looking forward to the day I can meet all the people I have been talking to online.  It might take four to 8 months longer, but that day will come."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2071,"My greates take away from this class was basically the whole class because i believe that i will be using this in the future in my major, electrical engineering. i feel like all the topics that were discussed in this class are more benefincial to me since my major is going to be using it more frequently in the future. what i felt was more helpful to my learning in this class was the hands on learning that we recieved because its hard to truly understand what real world effect that most of the simulation labs are trying to demonstrate. Furthermore i feel like this will be a minor set back in my learning, not being able to have all hands on learning labs but i will try to overcome it. So overall i believe everything from this class was useful to my future in electrical engineering."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2421,"I think my greatest takeaways from this class are the concepts of current, resistance, and voltage. I knew of them but I didn't understand the units or what they physically were. I had heard of Ohm's law too, but I had never applied it to anything. I also didn't know exactly what alternating current was until this class. I understood direct current, but I couldn't picture in what way a current could be alternating. I had always visualized it with sine waves, but I didn't realize the current actually reversed direction. I feel that while I still have a lot to learn if I want to get into electronics with Arduino boards, this class definitely gave me a good foundation for that. While magnetism is still a confusing topic for me, I feel that a lot of the mysteries behind electricity have been cleared up for me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,158,"My greatest take away from this class is when I was able to communicate with my lab group and also helping each other in the lab. There are lab questions that are hard for me to answer. And so, the other lab group members help answer those lab questions for me, while I also answer the lab questions that are hard for the other group members to answer. I pretty much enjoy with the other members of my lab group. They are nice to me when it comes to me and them working together to complete the lab."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2423,"I think that my greatest take away from this class was the learnings I got from doing the labs head on. Physics is a difficult subject for many reasons but labs like the ones we do help us see a visual representation of what we are learning about. I enjoy that i can learn about current and then see it in action with a battery and wires. We also get double lessons at times because the labs we do involve what we are studying in class. I think that learning requires repetition, otherwise it doesn't stick the same, or you will forget it a lot sooner. I enjoyed these labs and the powerpoints that were associated with them.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2424,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that working in groups is very beneficial for learning. Throughout the semester, we worked in groups every week on the labs. We'd go through the lab exploration together and answer the questions. Once we were done with that, we'd move on to working on the post lab questions together. Personally, I like to work on most things alone. However, working in groups for this class showed me that there's a lot of pros to group work. For instance, if any group member was confused on a question or concept, the other group members would help clarify it. Furthermore, it was nice to hear how other people explained a concept. Sometimes you need to hear something presented in a different way to understand it. In addition to all this, working in groups was especially helpful during the era of online classes. In a lot of my other classes, we just show up to lecture and then leave afterwards. There isn't much group collaboration. In this class though, I felt more connected to the other people since I was working with them every week."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2130,"My greatest take from this class is realizing how much better I learn this way. With my lecture, I realize how hard it is for me to grasp what I learn when I only have to sit and listen. With this lab, I get to interact more with other students to really understand it. I really enjoy the interactions I have with my own professor and it really means a lot, especially with my learning. The little experiments and simulations we do it helpful because I am more of a visual learner and more of a hands on person. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,176,"My greatest take away from this class would probably have to be that labs for me are a huge part of gaining a general understanding of the topic at hand. I think that going through these labs is what makes the concepts really click in my head. I can sometimes watch lectures on a topic all day and come out still not understanding what it is we're talking about, but after a lab I can see how the topic presents itself in the real world. Specifically with this course on electricity and magnetism there are a lot of things that are entirely conceptual and there is no real life visual like with kinematics. If this was in person it would have been a ton better because even some of the simulations can challenge conceptual understanding. Circuits are also a really fun topic so I would have liked to be able to create real circuits in a lab. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2418,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that it has helped me a lot with the lectures in Phys 230. Personally, I am a visual learner so all of the labs that included simulations and were hands-on helped guide me through the different topics. This class along with the lecture section was not the easiest for me as physics is not my best subject but I did enjoy my time in this class and had a good time doing all of the labs. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2089,"My greatest takeaway from this class is to never give up and always persevere, even when you have little motivation to do so, you need to unlock that part of your brain and spirit to just keep pushing yourself and learn. This was really hard to do from my personal experience because online classes have become boring and just uninteresting for the most part. However, it is important to keep your goals in mind and to understand that there are brighter times ahead, and that we may have in person classes again someday. I took this away from this class this semester, seeing as though physics 2 is a very daunting class that is of a very high degree of difficulty. ""If you believe in yourself you can achieve anything"" -Johnny Karate"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2426,"I think the greatest take away from this class might not be the physics content that was taught, but rather the collaboration and teamwork skills I developed. In this class, I found out that it is almost always better to work on something with someone else. Whenever I was stuck and needed help, I could just unmute and ask. Most of the time, I can receive the clarification I need. If it is something we are all confused on, we can all bounce ideas back and forth and help each other understand the material. Without teamwork, I don’t think I would’ve been able to understand some of the topics taught. Teamwork can also allow us to get work done faster. For some labs, we took a divide and conquer approach and was able to get it done efficiently. I think that being able to collaborate with others has benefitted me greatly, and this is an important skill to have."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2120,"In this class it was nice learning about magnetism and charge. Actually those were some of the few topics I wanted to learn going through this physics course. Also during the group online learning it is nice to see that most if not all the students are willing to help out each other. Online learning is difficult for some people and I definitely understand that. I guess another cool thing about this lab class was that we were able to do some at home experiments which is always nice. Even though they were not as complex it was a very clear way for me to understand what is going on. Also the online simulations were really good as well. It did help me understand attraction forces between objects. All in all I did feel like I learned more with ""hands on"" lab learning than the regular lecture class. "
