Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2418,"I wanted to go into the STEM field because I was interested in what it had to offer. I had different routes I wanted to take after high school and becoming a Computer Science major was one of them. I took a class in high school and really enjoyed my time so I thought, why not learn more about it in college. While I took interest in other fields, I chose to go with the one that would provide more stability in my life. Being able to solve problems I run into when coding is also kind of fun and is an experience. Frustrating sometimes but worth it in the end. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2077,"I want to go into stem because it seems like a fun career choice and that I  also enjoy doing hands-on stuff, I feel that stem is the best choice for  that. I got into STEM when I was in high school and participated in a robotics  lab/club and I really enjoyed what we where doing and decided to pursue a degree in engineering. I also want to go into STEM because of the people that I  want to meet that have the same passion as my own and have professor that know  the struggle and understand students that are pursuing their dreams. I also  want to go into STEM because I want to be a mechanical engineer that through the  STEM program is a master of the material and is ready for hands on  experience. Another reason why I want to into STEM is because it is the future of technology that I would be working with and its exciting to  think about, that my design could further progress."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2419,"I think the main reason I wanted to go into the STEM field is mostly because of career security. I think that STEM majors are pushed on us at a young age. Thankfully, I liked math and technology growing up, so I knew this was a good fit for me. So I can confidently say that I'm going into the field because I enjoy it instead of going into the field due to the pressure of financial stability. I grew up liking the arts as well but not enough to want a career in it. I think STEM is what I enjoy doing the most. Even my job revolves around math (not just my academics right now). I thoroughly enjoy STEM subjects, but I would be lying if I said financial stability didn't play a small role in my choosing of CS as a major. I'm glad I enjoy CS, but I'm also glad that the career has a bit of stability compared to other non-STEM majors. :)"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2420,"Reflection #1I want to go into the STEM field because STEM is where the future lies. There are endless opportunities in this field. For me being a Computer Science major, it is a great way to help the community with software development to create products that make every small business grow. Our world is moving towards technological development and being skilled in such a field is not only crucial but is a game changer during tough times like COVID. My goal is to become an app developer who helps people in getting their ideas written in code and create a product which helps them grow as well. This is also a great way to make a fortune. Certainly not the easiest field to be in but definitely not impossible. Everything going digital has endless opportunities to take part in because you never know when the next big thing might come up and taking part in it is life changing."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2101,"This is the first journal I will be submitting, as I am a Transfer Student. My reason for wanting to go into the STEM field are pretty weird compared to others, and it revolves around my early obsession with the game Minecraft. It's a fun game that gave me hours and hours of enjoyment growing up, especially with the mods that could be added to the game. Some of these mods included machines that relied on real world processes to base their function on, like a coke oven, which has its origins in the classical period of history when metal and furnace working was just taking off. This gave me interest in those functions, which led me to finding a huge interest in history and chemistry, which is my major. Overall, I wanna learn how the world works, and eventually apply it to sustainable living practices as best that I can. STEM is the best way to learn that."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,158,"I want to go into the STEM field because this field is interesting to me. What makes this field interesting is the topics of science, technology, engineering, and math. I really like being into problem solving using math and science and it makes my mind imagine interesting things on how the world works through math and science. I was majoring in computer science because I was interested in the topics of it, including how code was used to function computers and programs. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2421,"I want to go into the STEM field because I've had a passion for programming since I was 14. I started coding in Lua as a kid, and by the time I started college I was pretty confident that coding was what I wanted to do. I'm still unsure exactly what I want to do with my degree once I get it. Growing up I always thought my dream job would be to work at Roblox as a game engine engineer, but now I'm considering other possibilities. While I'm at SFSU, I would like to learn about 3D graphics and backend web programming. Both are strengths I think I would need to work as a platform engineer. I'm much more interested in the more mathy parts of programming because math has always been a strength of mine. For that reason, I want to learn about quaternions and how to use linear algebra in places like computer graphics. I'm also excited to see how PHYS 230 will advance my understanding of electronics. I've wanted to do projects involving Arduino boards and motors in the past, but I feel I'm limited with my current understanding."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2422,"I want to go into the STEM field because I'm majoring in computer engineering. My main purpose of majoring in computer engineering is to build whatever electronics I need that will help me on a day to day basis. For example, if I do drink coffee or tea, I would want a device that would start making the drink when my alarm clock rings. So by the time I would finish preparing myself, I would have a drink ready to go. Thinking of the possibilities of computer engineering excites me because being in this major will help me become more efficient in the future and potentially become a very successful engineer as well. Another reason why I wanted to major in computer engineering is that I loved the idea of coding but computer science is a very common major. So I decided to take it to the next level and major in computer engineering because computer engineering is essentially computer science but with the addition of an engineering aspect."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,153,"I am in STEM for many reasons. First and foremost, STEM has always been encouraged by my parents and is hugely emphasized in Indian culture. Indian culture tends to push for jobs in the science or technology fields such as doctors or engineers. In addition to this, STEM jobs tend to be a lot more lucrative and have good benefits and security. Lastly, I would say I enjoy aspects of computer science such as problem solving and being able to create."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2423,"I decided to go into a stem field because I was always interested in math and science as an adolescent. I was always a curious kid and I quickly found that science helped me understand how the world around me worked. Over the years, I have found that Computer Science has drawn out the most interest for a major. I took a programming class in my community college because I was trying to find a major and was instantly hooked. I found a passion for programming and the way that it challenges me to think deeper about how to solve a problem efficiently and neatly. It has also taken me down a path where I had to take more science and math courses which I have always welcomed. I enjoy being a STEM major and I wish to obtain my degree soon.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,195,"I think the main reason why I choose to be in the STEM field is that I love my computer science major. It's very interesting to create a program, and you can feel a sense of accomplishment after you spend a lot of time finding a way to solve a problem. And more importantly, your program may help someone or some companies if you are good at programing. I believe technology is very important to us and it will have more and more influence in the future, that is why I think going into the STEM field will not be a mistake. Also, programming is just a tool, a tool that can change how we think. It can help us to become problem solvers against many real-life problems, not just programming problems. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,135,"I dated this guy and he was such a tool. Just your average orange county douchebag and it turns out that he was a data scientist for Instagram. He was very obnoxious and acted like he was still in a fraternity although he was 10 years my senior. Despite the horrible date learning what he did intrigued me. I began to look deeper into the background of his job and fell upon computer science. I fell in love with coding as soon as I began learning it. It was the challenge I had been missing in my previous majors, and a new passion emerged. I want to go into the stem field to increase representation of POC in the field who are also women. I want to join a team in tech one day because coding is my passion and I love that there is always something new to learn. I want to join the stem field to break the stigma of jobs in stem being mainly for men, and inspire other women to try something new (I didnt think I would like it at all, especially all the math which I never thought myself to be good at!) Basically, I want to be in the Stem Field to show you don’t have to look a certain way or be this super smart person to succeed. You just have to want to do it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2424,"I want to go into the STEM field for several reasons. I've done pretty good in math and science classes since I was a kid, so when I had to pick a major, I decided on computer science. It seemed like a great field to go into since technology is always advancing and playing a bigger role in our lives. I also wanted to go into STEM because I've always been interested in technology. My whole life I've played video games and I think it would be cool to be a programmer and help create them. Other areas of computer science such as software and web development interest me as well. In addition to all of this, based on what I've researched and the experience of people I've talked to, careers in STEM can provide a good living. My goal is to have a stable job with good pay and I believe going into the STEM field can help me achieve that."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2089,"I want to go into the stem field because I love mechanical engineering and why mechanical systems and things work the way they work. I am fascinated with cars and motorcycles and transportation, and mechanical engineering is a good way to be involved with those industries and it is a very important job!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2112,"The reason why i want to go into the STEM field is because i gain the opportunity to make a better tomorrow for people. Having the chance to help develop, design, or build something that can be used by many and impact their lives fills me with drive to do well throughout my college career. I want to contribute to developing a better future with the things that i may design or develop. With that being said, I main aspect of engineering I want to get into is the design aspect, such as finding out what material would be best for the object, what shape it should be, and problem solving what would be the best design to be cost efficient but effective in completing the task at hand. So to wrap it up, that's why i want to join the STEM field, to contribute to a better tomorrow by designing things for people."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2425,"There are many reasons why I want to go into STEM field. Ironically, I was hesitant at first because of all the math courses required but I pushed through them and found that I really enjoyed them. I was never strong at math but when it came to college, I found when I sat down and really tried to learn, the problem solving became easier and that is also why I enjoy my STEM classes now. Currently I’m a CS student who has transferred from Southern California and at my previous community college is where I began my math courses and started learning how to program. Now that I have transferred, I’m continuing my education in CS to see if this is the career path I want to take. So far, I have learned a lot even with the whole zoom university. I have found that I enjoy working with others on CS projects and the importance of having a mentor or someone with more experience help guide and give suggestions. Also, I am interested in learning web development as I have no experience with it, and it sounds fun"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2426,"I am taking a STEM major because I want to be able to make a difference in people's lives. I am a computer science major, which means that I am at the forefront of technological innovation, both hardware and software. Technologies such as the internet for example have changed how people communicate and get information. By learning computer science, I will have the knowledge and skill necessary to keep this innovation going and to improve or enrich peoples' lives through the use of technology. The reason why computer science so powerful is that it is multi-disciplinary, which means that knowledge can be applied to a multitude of fields ranging from finance to medical to entertainment, etc. Currently, I'm not exactly certain which fields I should go in, but I know that computer science is the bare minimum for what I want to do in the future. I want to have the ability help create the next big thing that will make an impact in the world."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2071,"Why I want to go into the STEM field is not complete yet but have also been given alot of thought. As a kid my eldest sister was always into science things and doing math. She would often encourage me to do science/ robotic things as well as drill me on mathmatcis. She even went as far as calling it a bootcamp for science. This made me learn to love math and science because finally accomplishing a problem or figuring out something science related was rewarding. So in my junior/ senior in highschool i decided i wanted to be an Electrical Engineer. If i could become one i always think of what good i could do and what i can do to help future generations. So the reason why i would like to go into the STEM field is ultimately help make the world i live i easier, safer, healthier, and more substaniable for us and future generations."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2427,"""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?"" STEM field has been evolving over the years and effects almost every aspect of our lives today. Growing up I was always interested in knowing how things work and found it hard to accept that such complex machines were created by humans. As I grew older, I developed a better sense of how things worked, and this only boosted my dedication towards machines specifically cars. I want to go in the STEM field to understand the mechanics behind our modern machinery and eventually work on making that machinery work more efficiently. I am interested in the automotive industry; transportation has always fascinated me, and I would love to work in development of that field. In order to do so I need to develop a deep understanding of the machinery and how it functions. I want to get into the STEM field in order to achieve my dream of developing more efficient machinery that functions better and provide better results."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2428,"I was in the military for 20 years.  After I retired, I decided to work as an electrician at a Bakery located in Lodi, CA.  It was a job with no hope of doing anything more than risk my life to make sure the bread was baked.  One night I just thought to myself, ""Is this it, work 20 years at one job and another 20 at this one?""  That was the night I decided to make a plan.  I wanted to do something with my life, something I could be proud of, something that would test me.  After a week of looking at degree plans, I stumbled across the STEM field.  For the first year I was living in Elk Grove, working in Lodi for 50+ hours a week, and going to school full time.  after that, the classes started to get too hard, so I decided to quit my job and dedicate everything into school.  Along this journey my sons decided to go into the CS field as well.  I could not be happier."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2120,"Initially I got into my major because my mom told me that I would have a secure life with mechanical engineering.  At first I got frustrated with the amount of math I had to take, but ultimately I found math interesting and how in mechanical engineering it can easily go into almost any career field. Now my goal after college is to join the Air Force and then work for Neuralink to create biomedical devices. I've taken an interest into helping those with motor skill issues and possibly create a break through in neurosurgery. I want to create a difference in someone's life with medical devices. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,176,STEM has always been my strong suit so that's probably one of the biggest factors to the direction I chose. I was never really good at my English and social science classes but STEM classes were always fun to me. More specifically though I chose my major of Mechanical Engineering because I have always wanted to work on cars in some way or another. Initially I wanted to be a mechanic until I found out that it is pretty hard to be decently successful as a mechanic. That ultimately brought me to engineering as an option. It was a bit of a coin toss though because I was never really into school but then as time went on I have become more interested in expanding my education and I actually enjoy school now more than I ever did. I also always saw STEM as on of the primary field where we find ways to advance as a society so it would be really cool to be a part of that in my future career. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2429,"Journal One: ""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?"":I would like to get into the STEM field for several reasons, the first being that I would like to set myself up for my future goals, and the second being that I would like to challenge myself. I believe that getting a degree in Computer Science and Civil Engineering will help me in the future when I get into Real Estate Development. My plan is to create an app that will help future investors or people looking for homes to easily visualize the potential property, they have come to purchase. I plan on doing this by creating an Augmented Reality Application that will use your phone to do a virtual walk-through on either an empty property or a pre-existing home, allowing the customer to see what the home can look like and edit features of the home if needed. I think a strong background in the STEM field is needed to create this application. I also think making this application is going to tough, but I think I am up for the challenge and I like to push myself to do things that others may find hard. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,152,"I am majoring in computer science. I want to go into a STEM field because I think  STEM is interesting and can lead to real change. When I think about things that have changed human lives and made standards of living go up, I think of inventors and scientists. I don’t have much faith in politics or world rulers and certainly don’t see anyone in politics making real change that makes people’s lives better. Instead, I see change come with technology. Only a few years ago almost everyone had begun carrying a smartphone with them. Our communal understanding of our world has changed because of it. Imagine the Black Lives Matter movement couldn’t kick off if enough people didn’t have social media presence to fuel it and share their personal and systematic experiences of racism. If the people didn’t have smartphones or other technologies at hand, they would have an even harder time spreading information. That’s just one example of how I think technology can change the world. I want to enable people with important information to be able to share it with those who need to hear it. And that’s only one of the many aspects of STEM that makes me want to pursue it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2430,"I want to go into STEM (computer science specifically) because I grew up with access to a computer that I was on all the time playing games. I learned to love technology from there and the internet. That on top of being good in STEM and math courses throughout middle and high school made me shift towards wanting to do something in STEM by college. Until my senior year of high school, I wanted to be an aerospace engineer because I thought that being able to contribute to humans going to space would be really fulfilling. I still do think that, but in my senior year, I took AP Computer Science. After doing well in that class, I realized that I would really enjoy the CS field. Even now, I have no idea what to specialize in since there seems to be countless subfields within computer science, so until I graduate, I plan on exploring a lot of programing languages and areas in CS. After this lab actually, I'm planning on taking an optional introductory course to R for my statistics class. I figure I could do my work on paper- or I could learn R and have another tool to use in the future."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,137,"I want to go into the STEM field because I am specifically interested in computer science. I was first introduced to it in my junior year of high school. I learned a lot in the class and always looked forward to learning new topics. I am also interested in learning how to understand software to make games. Even if I was not into computer science, my major would still be somewhere in the STEM field, because I was always more interested in math and science than English and history. I prefer learning how things work than just memorizing a bunch of facts. I also prefer looking at equations than looking at rhetorical essays. I can see myself working in a chemistry lab but I can't see myself trying to write a book. I do like to make my own stories, however, I unfortunately have difficulty on how to write well (I am trying to change that right now by taking some English classes this semester, but it is more difficult for me than taking a math class)."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2130,"Since I can remember, I have always been interested in STEM. I am very good at anything STEM related, I've never been good at English, or any of the other subjects. The crazy part is that I had to grow and work hard to become good at it, teachers had an impact on that. As a minority, I don't see many Latinas in engineering, and I wanted to change that. I love proving people wrong, and I don't like giving up. Many of my classes have very few woman and it can get intimidating, but I learned that they should be the ones intimidated because I am a diamond in a pile of rocks. I can't wait to get my degree and earn a good income."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,707,"I want to go into the STEM field because it was mostly an encouragement from my family. Most of my mom’s side of the family are involved in the medical field as mostly nurses. I know that going into the STEM field will also give me a well paying job in the future and that’s something that I would like as a family or being able to buy a house would be a dream. Besides monetary value and encouragement from my family members, going into the STEM field is something that has interested me since Elementary, Middle School and beyond! Being involved with MESA in middle school throughout high school has kept my interest sparked with engineering, math and sciences; doing projects ranging from prosthetic arms, to balsa wood gliders, to egg drops and bridge competitions. Now further in college, I have an interest once again in the medical field. I wanted to become a Physical Therapist for Pediatric Patients as I already work with karate kids outside of my educational studies. Now, I want to go into Oncology or PM&R to focus on helping people. The world of engineering and science is rapidly evolving and there’s more studies and research ideas theorized and found as the years go on. It’s a constantly growing field and while it also has its trials and tribulations, it is also a lot of fun. Overall, going into the BioPhysio field and minoring in Chemistry and Mechanical Engineering are something that interest me and I know for a fact will challenge me mentally as well as physically."
