2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2421,"I think everyone should at least have a basic understanding of electricity given everything in the world today relies heavily on it. One important concept to know is voltage which is a difference in electric potential. A large difference in electric potential between two objects can be very dangerous if not treated with caution. One example of this is high voltage power lines. If you were to touch one while being grounded, the difference in potential between the line and ground would cause a large current through your body and could easily kill you. While it can be extremely dangerous, it's also extremely useful. The electronics we use every day would not function without a difference in electric potential. Electric potential is what causes current to flow and that current is what powers our world."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2423,"In my opinion, people need to learn more about circuits. Circuits are present in our everyday lives in our houses, and our cars. It would benefit society to know this because it would help them understand how electricity is distributed and how it behaves when connected throughout a system. In addition, learning about circuits can also help people understand how to fix most electrical problems in their house with the proper care. Electricians charge a fortune to fix what can be a small problem in many cases. Learning about circuits can also teach you about how to take care of your electrical appliances since some of them can only handle small amounts of voltage and current. Learning about the differences can help you also know that high current is a lot more dangerous than high voltage. Other harder concepts are not necessary in my opinion, because its not necessarily something they will see in their lifetime. It is also important to learn about the dangers of shorting a circuit because it might cause a fire or even cause a blackout in your house. This is why I believe it is important to learn about circuits.        "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2428,"As I have mentioned before I was an Electronic Technician while in the Navy.  I was basically a glorified card swapper but in the beginning of my career I actually had to memorize everything we are learning now.  The question that I like is where you have a closed circuit.  This circuit has a 10-volt power supply and two resistors.  One is a 10-ohm resistor rand the other is a 5-ohm resistor.  They are in series.  I know that most people do not work on electrical circuits, but I still do on a monthly basis.  The hardest electrical problem I have ever came across was on my first ship.  I, along with five other people, had been working on a piece of equipment for several days.  Without this the ship could not leave.  It was a shorted capacitor.  Up to that point I had always been told that could not happen.  I actually had to show my whole chain of command for them to believe me.  The last think that I fixed was my dryer.  My first response when something breaks is not to call a repair person.  It always fell as though I lost if I must ask for outside assistance. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,195,"We learned circuits and short-circuits in the last week and we also did our first real experiment at home. Circuit is like a loop for charges to move around. If a circuit is not closed, then there is no current on that circuit. Short-circuit is another story. If there are no obstacles in a circuit, we may have a short circuit because we have too much current on that circuit. It can be dangerous sometimes since it burns the batteries or the appliances. This is why we should have fuses set up in our house. Fuses can help us reduce the current. It will have some protections on the electrical devices we use., but it will not work either if we use too many appliances at the same time."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2422,"A concept that was covered in class in the past few weeks was circuits. Circuits is a charge is able to flow throughout a system. This information is beneficial to the society because our computers are built from circuits as well. Our computers are able to run because of the charges flowing throughout of devices. I find circuits really interesting because I'm still amazed as to how we can use our computers the way we can now, if I just imagine myself dismantling every piece of hardware in my computer. When I learned that our computers is ran by using binary numbers, which is 1s and 0s, I highly doubted that because I questioned myself, ""How can I watch YouTube or play video games with only 1s and 0s?"". This information is really relevant because this is the era where computers and electronics keep progressing further. When the first computer was created, the popularity of computers started rising. But nowadays, the first few computers are almost forgotten because there are newer and better computers out there. This is the same for cellphones, mostly everyone used to have a flip phone but nowadays we got iPhones or Samsung. As time moves on, the technologies we have will keep evolving into better devices."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,153,"Last class we discussed circuits which relate to other values we have studied such as current, resistance, and voltage. These values are related through Ohms Law which states that V=I/R where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance. Ohm's law is applicable to any circuit and circuits have many real world applications. In lecture we learned specifically about series circuits and parallel circuits both of which we find in our everyday lives. Series circuits can be found in objects like refrigerators and an example of parallel circuits is the larger household circuit that is connected to every electric device. For a circuit to be functional, it must always remain closed so that the flow of electrons does not get stopped."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,135,"Do objects with a neutral charge attract to other objects?We know that two objects with like-charges repel, but what about a positive charged object and a neutral one? or a negative charged object and a neutral one! Since the interaction between two objects with opposite charges is attraction it would be interesting to know what happend when one object has no charge. In our first lab we answered this question and learned that any charged object whether positively charged or negatively charged will have an attractive interaction with a neutral object. Positively charged objects and neutral objects attract each other; and negatively charged objects and neutral objects attract each other. The result is always attraction.So to answer our question what happend when an object with a neutral charge and a non neutral charge come into contact, the answer is clear.  The objects will attract because that is how their properties work. This is important to understand because when dealing with electrical components it is important to note how charges interact amongst each other."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2130,I have learned many things in class that made me see what can be applied in real life. One of the examples was from last weeks lab working with a battery and learning more about circuits. Its like when you have an outlet and you start to plug in multiple things at a time and it gets too much to handle and it starts to overheat and go out. I also know that even though its plugged off it can still be dangerous to touch because the capacitor remains charged for a long time after it has been disconnected. The residual charge can prove to be fatal. Capacitor can be handled only after discharging the plates by short-circuiting the device with the use of a conductor. Because the capacitor stores charge. It can be handled safely only after discharging.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2424,"It's important to understand how Ohm's law works. Ohm's law can be summarized by the equation V = IR, where V is the voltage of a circuit, I is the current of a circuit, and R is the resistance of a circuit. While the base equation is used to solve for voltage, the equation can be rearranged to solve for either current or resistance. This equation can be very useful for both people and society. Circuits play a huge role in people's lives, as we interact with circuits everyday. We find them in our homes and cars. Because of this, designing circuits is a very important task. Knowing how Ohm's law works can be very beneficial in carrying out this task. If you know the current and resistance of a circuit and you also understand how Ohm's law works, you'll know you simply have to multiply current and resistance together to find the voltage of the circuit."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2425,"One interesting topic that was applicable to peoples live would be Electric potential and the use of Proton therapy for Cancer. This is possible by energizing a proton by accelerating creating a proton beam to hit a tumor and kill it. This is an incredible medical advancement in the way we have developed technology alongside of physics to hopefully cure cancer cells. Interestingly the protons are shot into a particle accelerator at some fraction of the speed of light and after stored and transferred for medical use. Another interesting part of the treatment is how the machine in which it is placed into is circular and because of this it allows the treatment to be done 360 degrees around the body. This and various other biomedical technology are actually pretty interesting to learn about now that I’m starting to get some baseline understanding of how it works in the physical world. Although I find this interesting, I'm more interested in the more recent lectures about circuits and how they work in the various different ways in our life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2419,"I think the best example to talk about is circuits/short circuits. As we discussed earlier, there are two types of circuits - parallel and series. With series, we connect batteries by adding the voltages of all the batteries but kept the amperage the same. With parallel, the voltage will remain the same, but we divide up the current between each battery. We see both types of circuits every-day, but the most useful circuit we see when it comes to home-electricity-setups is parallel. The danger with setting series circuits when it comes to the electricity in your house is that since it's all connected, it's an all-or-nothing type of effect. Whereas, with parallel circuits, you have the opportunity to divide up the appliances by switches. I read somewhere that back in the day, most Christmas lights were structured with series circuits. That's why in most old comedy Christmas movies when we see one of their Christmas lights short-circuit, all the connecting lights will turn off as well. Nowadays, Christmas lights are structured parallely which explains why sometimes only certain portions of a string of lights will be short-circuited instead of the whole thing. Structuring in parallel instead of series when it comes to more complex equipment can be more beneficial as it eliminates the possibility of the entire equipment short-circuiting."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2418,"Why are short circuits important to understand?While everything we have learned in this lab and in 230 can be applied to the real world, I found short circuits to be interesting and also important. A short circuit can be dangerous so I think that it would be important to understand them so they could potentially be prevented before something serious happens. In our short circuit lab, we can see what happens between a battery and some wires. When we connected the makeshift wires with a small piece of aluminum, there was a small spark. That spark was not big enough to cause damage but this can happen in real life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2089,"One concept that we covered in this class that I thought was particularly important was we had an icebreaker assignment in the lecture portion and discussed perpetual motion and superconductors. While these superconductors cannot help us find perpetual energy due to them eventually heating up, I found it particularly important to ponder these ideas due to our increasing need for energy in the modern world. However, the idea of perpetual motion or energy does break the first and second laws of thermodynamics, seeing as though machines that extract energy from finite sources will not operate indefinitely, because they are driven by the energy stored in the source, which will eventually be exhausted. However, the more we research these concepts and attempt at solving the societal problems of the need for energy, the sooner we can find a viable solution"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,707,"In the past couple of weeks, we have learned about wiring, current, and what would happen if there was too much current or not enough current flowing through a wire. In my understanding, current plays an important role with anything that requires electricity and has either a fuse box or anything that holds the energy. 	Theoretically and literally, the lights in my house flicker, could there be something happening with the wiring? Is the fuse box being overloaded by chance? What causes the lights to flicker on and off? In the past week, we recently had a lab which went over the concepts of current and having a complete circuit. When a light is on for a long duration of time, you could assume that the circuit is complete and the electricity is flowing through the wires providing voltage. In my home, we have lights that flicker on and off; if the there are multiple lights on at a time throughout the house; if electricity is being pulled from the same spot, all these lights being on and large amount of electricity being used; this could be leading to a fuse overload, to the point where it isn’t enough to blow the entire fuse box. 	As most light fixtures are set in a parallel circuit, when every electronic device and light is on, there could still be too much energy being pulled from the entire household leading to flickering lights."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,137,"Subject: Short CircuitMy question: When is it best to use a fuse to avoid having a short circuit?A fuse wire is used so that if the current flowing increases to the point where it can short circuit, it will combust and stop the equipment from breaking or failing. It’s best to use a fuse for a series combination. In a parallel combination, the battery terminal voltage won’t change since the potential difference applied across capacitors will remain the same. In a series combination, the charges on the capacitors stay the same instead, which is why connecting batteries in series will receive the greatest potential difference than connecting it in parallel. If there was a fuse in a parallel combination, current would still continue to flow through other components since there are multiple loops. A series, on the other hand, only has one loop, so a fuse can be used in series to stop the current in the circuit if the current were to reach a certain limit. Fuses are important to use in everyday life since if short circuits were to occur due to an overheat (which was from the flowing electricity) it could create a dangerous outcome, but the fuse will protect the wires used in the circuit."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,176,One of the concepts which is what we are just now getting into in my lecture is circuits. How circuits work is essential to almost everything in our modern world. It's interesting because the circuits are the part of our electronics that we almost never get to see but they are literally what makes the thing function. Electricity and magnetism in general can be a pretty hard concept to grasp in general since there is rarely any physical thing we can see and interact with. Circuits are so important because they're the thing that bridges that gap between conceptual understanding to physical world tangible outcome. Like how in our lab last week we actually could see a spark being created as a result of the things we were learning in class. Circuits are extremely beneficial to our society since it is literally how we are able to still attend classes in these times through our computers.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2112,"One thing i learned in lecture was how circuits work, and how circuits can be either in series or parallel. I feel like this can help me a lot in the long run since I'm a mechanical engineering major. So there's a possibility I may have to work with electrical based things. So it's important that I really get things like this down as it may apply to a future job that I may have. Things that include this are pretty much anything that involves an electrical current such as a light bulb or a battery."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,152,"Prompt: Explain what a circuit is and give examples of its components.	A circuit is a closed path where electric current can flow. This path must include a few key components such as the source of the electric energy, which is usually either a battery or mains power lines that transport power from a generator or large power plant. Circuits must also include a key component: the conductive wiring. Although this last component doesn’t always have to be wires, it does need to connect components in a manner in which electric current can flow. This means there must be some path in which the two ends of the source are connected by.	In real life people typically use electric circuits everywhere, most commonly in their homes and technology. In homes, we use mostly parallel circuits, in which components within the circuit have independent connections to the power source. Capacitance through these components can simply be summed up to find your home’s equivalent capacitance. This information is important to know because it defines the amount of charge your home can store (like a battery)."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,158,"There is a question that I had in my mind about short circuits, which is why do we need resistors and capacitors for circuits. I found out that the reason why we need capacitors is that we need them to store charge later on in case we need power to on the devices with capacitors that we want to use. For example, we have televisions to watch what we want to watch. And so, televisions have capacitors because they have the charge needed in order to power the televisions on so that people can enjoy what they watch using televisions. I also found out that we need resistors in order to control the electricity that is moving through the circuit. Televisions have resistors because the resistors are used to prevent the electricity from causing too much power that the televisions would broke."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2071,A concept that we went over in the past weeks that i learned in class is RC circuits. The concept consists of two main topics which is resistors and capacitors. I believe that in my future not only in my profession but in my upcoming classes im going to need to know the basics of RC circuits so i can do well in my next classes. I also believe that in the future in the job sense knowing some RC circuit layouts and how to calculate resistors and capacitors will come up alot. It will probaly come up alot in electronics in my profession as an electrical engineer. There are plenty of topics that i feel like i will need to take with me in the future but i was excited about it and found RC circuits more important. Furthermore in RC circuits knowing about current is extremely important as well because in the circuits the current will go through the resistors and capacitors and you have to know how to calculate it in each one of those individually. Lastly knowing the RC circuit stuff and having to know that temperature is affected by it is a good thing to know in the future wheter it be class or in the real world. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2426,"I think one of the most important things we’ve learned about in this class so far is voltage, also known as potential difference. Pretty much every electronic device is powered because of a potential difference, everything from a simple battery powering a flashlight to the complex circuitry inside of our smartphones. Voltage is also what determines the current of a circuit. Current is the voltage divided by resistance. When you are plugging in things into the sockets in your house, you need to ensure you don’t draw too much current otherwise the fuse will trip. In North America, the power grid typically provides 120V. The more things you plug into the outlet, the more resistance there is, causing the current to decrease. Current also plays a role when it comes to safety. For example, many bathrooms now have sockets that trip when there is a sudden change in current. This has helped save numerous lives, as it prevents people from accidentally electrocuting themselves. Voltage is also related to power, as stated by the equation P = ΔV^2/R. As someone who builds my own computers, I need to ensure that I have a sufficient power supply to power my components. Learning about power allowed me to understand what it means when I purchase a 750W PSU. All of these concepts revolve around voltage."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2427,"The one thing that I think is important for people to know is how are their houses wired, what kind of wires were used to do the wiring of the house what kind of connection they have with different types of appliances, whether the kitchen is in parallel or series. These things are important to know because when we are living somewhere it becomes our home and the place, we seek shelter in, its only right to prioritize our security by making sure there aren’t any safety hazards in the whole houses wiring. It only takes a few sparks to start a fire and damage the possessions you have worked hard for. This class helped understand the importance of the right type of wiring and what could cause a hazard. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2120,"I believe circuits to be very useful for everyday life since we encounter them on a regular basis. A circuit is a rate of flow of charge from one end to another. There are two basic types of circuits which are series and parallel. A series is generally two objects that are connected in a series (next to each other) and a current passes through both of them. A parallel circuit is when either a right or left object is connected to either right or left to a terminal. But of course these are just general summaries and they are purely more complicated. This is useful to understand in everyday life because if someone such as yourself is trying to wire your house, you would need to understand if there is enough power coming from one end to another to power a specific item. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,6,2430,"Understanding electricity has brought us so far in society. Because of our advancements, we are able to meet remotely during COVID. I'm able to study computer science because these advancements allow me to. I don't remember a time when I was ever without electrical devices, even when I was little. Sure, most people have no need for understanding exactly how electricity concepts we discuss in class are applied in real life, but that doesn't stop their lives from being affected. The innovation that scientists and engineers bring forth through the concepts we have gone over continue to shape our future. I never think about the complex circuits within my laptop that I use every day. I can't even imagine how they might look. "
