2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2384,"I got my first computer when I was younger, maybe about when I was 9 years old. I slowly but surely started to learn how to use that computer and I was fascinated on how computers worked. I would use the laptop to play some web browser games, watch videos online and use my laptop camera to make some funny faces too. Ever since my first computer, I have been very fascinated with my computer. Now I want to learn how to make computers work. Like how they function and do things based on input from the user. I wanted to become the person that makes people's lives at least a little bit more convenient with the use of technology. I learned later that Computer Science was a major in college and that STEM was a field in college. I was quite happy. I went into the STEM field because I believed it is a good way to secure a job in the future and also pays very well since the future will be using a lot of technology, it will use a lot of people that have come from the STEM field."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2385,To be honest I went into the stem field because there is good money in the field. I also went into the stem field because I had previous experience in computer science in High School. I think that I enjoy the aha moments of the stem field and the way everything relates to each other. I like how everything is based on logic so that I can connect things and relate things to other topics. I believe that I can make a good computer scientist because I like the logic and thinking required to be a good computer scientist. I like the design and creativity of the STEM field. Another reason I went into the STEM field is because it is a widely spread fact that STEM majors make money and other majors have a hard time making money and finding jobs. So the conceptions of not being a STEM major is very bad.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2386,"I have many different interest in life. Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Botany and ancient civilizations to name a few. I have considered many different fields in which I would eventually like to work. Early in my life I was majoring in biotechnology during which I spent almost ten years in the medical field. After much consideration in what major I would like to pursue, I eventually came to the conclusion that I wanted to major in Computer Engineering. The main reason that I wanted to major in Computer Engineering was to challenge myself. For a long time in life I avoided math. In fact, I chose my major based on whatever would contain the least amount of mathematics. Since I am now older I came to the realization that It was not the I was not good at math, I was simply did find it interesting at the time. I also struggle to see how mathematics applied to the fields that I was interested in. Coming back to school after a ten year break, I decided that I was not going to avoid math but rather pick the major that would expose me to math the most. I feel that it is undeniable the degree to which computers play a role in our lives. I have never had a particular interest in computer science alone. After some thinking, It occurred to me that having a major in computer science would give my the most flexibility to work in a variety of different fields. I really do not know which field that I would ultimately like to work in but this seemed the best route to keep my options open. This is way I picked the stem field for a major."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2387,"My major is computer science. I chose this major because we use computers every day and I think it is good to understand how a computer works. It also a good tool to create things that could benefit society. Also because of the pandemic, you can work from home because all you need is a computer."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2388,"Growing up I felt like I would always want to be some kind of engineer. As a kid I really enjoyed creating things out of LEGOs and other building materials and so I planned on probably going to college for mechanical or civil engineering. However, my junior year I took my first physics course and discovered that it really wasn't for me. I had pretty much zero interest in forces and how they interacted, and I began to rethink my decision to be an engineer. Then during my senior year of high school I took my first computer science class because it looked interesting and that was my first introduction to programming. I was so interested in what that class was teaching and was very eager to learn more. This led me to major in computer science and helped me to discover one of my true passions. I always thought I would be an engineer, but never thought of being a software engineer."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2389,"I want to get into the STEM field for many reasons. I want to be a mechanical engineer. This career can put me in a broad area of professions. I can focus on sustainability, as I have a passion for the taking care of the environment. Here I can focus on clean energy. Secondly, I can work in a developing field like robotics that focus on things here on earth or on interstellar travel. The different things I can get into intrigue me and give me a lot of flexibility if for whatever reason, I get tired of one thing. Lastly, I have a passion for the future, sci fi movies always inspired me to think and try bigger things. A lot of things in old sci fi novels or movies are now possible, and continuing to push the envelope and be a part of something big is what gets me going every day."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2390,"I want to go into the STEM field because I've always had a passion for math and data which is why I decided to double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.  I want to also represent  being a woman in tech and also a women of color in tech.  After graduation, I plan on working as a Data Scientist or a Project Manager in the health teach field. My minor is health education so I plan on combining the two and work in the health tech field. Combining the two, I plan on being a data scientist for a company like Headspace or Calm. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,164,"When asked something related to my major, it's always kind of funny to say because of how things went to get into the STEM field and then seeing where I am now. When I first got into the STEM field, I had the ambitions to go for a medical degree with a major in biology. This had initially stemmed from a series of illnesses/medical problems that I had within a spam of like a couple weeks and from these visits, a sense of wanting to know what was going wrong when someone had some type of problem, common or not, but I wanted to be able to help/know what was going on. After a while however, people around me had told me to go into computer science and I did but the first experience with it was basically me being thrown into the ocean and being told to swim back to shore without actually knowing how to swim. This got me back into biology but after a semester, I went to try out computer science again, and while initially unsure, I think now I want to use computer science and turn it into data science/analytics so that I can satisfy me initial desire to be in medical and help others."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2391,"When i decided to join the STEM field, I was very confused on what i wanted to. One day i decided i wanted to teach, since i love kids, but i didn't want to go the easy way and major in liberal studies. I have always been good at math and when i learned that there was a lack of women in STEM it influenced me to go into the field. Another thing that pushed me was my dad saying that it was a waste of my time. He said i wasn't going to make any money as a Math major and i should've stuck to business. I want to prove him wrong and show him i can be successful as a Math major."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2392,"I have always wanted to go into the technology field, and when I was in high school, I found out about computer science. I first wanted to go into mechanical engineering, but I was not too fond of the job description and duties a mechanical engineer has to do. I like programming because it allows me to create new things, explore new ideas and then implement them. I like coding, and I usually spend most of my free time-solving programming problems. Moreover, computers will operate almost everything in the future, so that idea also inspires me to pursue this field. In general, I don't get bored or frustrated solving a programming problem, and I feel like it's something that I could become good at. Money is also a motivator, and I feel like computer science majors will make a lot of money in the future. A couple of years into my major, I feel like I made a right decision by choosing computer science as my major."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2393,"Why I want to go to STEM field is I find it interesting and it includes such a wide rage of topics. It's something that you will always be learning new things in. Going into this career field, it will keep me challenged and never really get me bored. My inspirations to getting into STEM field came from my high school classes, where I took bio classes where we did really cool and interesting labs. In community college I tool computer science and thats when It really solidified that thats what I want to do. It was such a new, challenging thing for me but I really enjoyed it. You are always leaning new things. computer science is something that is huge for our future and important and I felt like I will enjoy doing it and it will also provide me with financial stability in the future as well."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2394,"I wanted to go into the STEM field because I think it is really profitable and will always be in demand. I was born and raised back in the Philippines, and ever since I was a kid I've always thought that I will be doing graphic arts because I was really into doing Photoshop editing, Video editing, etc. However, when I migrated to the US back in 2015, I started getting into computers and I found out that graphic design is not as in-demand compared to computer science careers. Although the two professions are much different, they shared a common similarity which involved computers. Since I love anything about computers, I ultimately decided that I will be doing computer science instead. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2128,"My purpose on why I want to go into the STEM field is first to pursue higher education. Both my parents work jobs that do not require a college degree but my dad has a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering. Though, he was never able to apply it and get a job in the field. In a way I am following his footsteps but I would want to be able to apply it and help my family's future. Another reason is that I feel like I am better at math related subjects. In elementary and middle school I never really paid attention at school but I remember I was put in a higher math class during 8th grade and ever since then I would rather put my effort on math other than any subjects. STEM related subjects fascinates me because most of the time our questions always have an answer. For example, art is governed by people who thinks its the ""right"" art but math, physics, and chemistry will give you a universal answer. It explores laws that are just fascinating in a way that it explains mysteries.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,410,"Why do I want to go to the stem field? I want to go into the stem field because I like to code. In high school we did a bit of coding here and there, coding lego robots to go through a maze, coding parts to move of a robot, and it felt great seeing it work. I love playing video games and one day I hope to make my own card game. I love the turn-base strategy of card games and making one sure does sound like a lot of creativity, but will feel great once it is finished."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2395,"The reason why I decided to go into the stem field is because the STEM field is what I feel like interests me since I enjoy working and using technology.  Because of my interests I decided to chose computer science as my major, as in my opinion learning about coding and web development is a great way to further my interests. Another reason why I wanted to go into the STEM field is that it provides many opportunity as many teach companies are located around where I live so taking Stem gives me lots of different choices."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2396,"Hello, my name is Mathew O Abiola. I am originally from Nigeria been in the US for only 6 years, The reason to as why I want to go into the stem field is because since as a kid, I have had the natural intelligence to handle and fix computer related stuff. I remember fixing my aunts phone one time; trouble shot it by myself, figure out the problem and ended up fixing it. In essence it has been my passion and will to be in this field. My overall goal is to give back to the community with the knowledge I acquire from this field."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2397,"There are a multitude of reason as to why I want to go into the STEM field. One of the major reasons is the various job opportunities a STEM major has. In todays day and age, STEM jobs are essentially the future and going into the STEM field allows for people to have a number of job options. With all these different job opportunities, this allows for STEM field majors to be given a chance to obtain a job they truly desire and not what they just studied in college. That is one of the major reasons as to why I wanted to go into the STEM field. Another reason is the vast impact the STEM field has in todays day and age. I want to be apart of that impact and want to help lead the world into its better future. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,172,"I want to go into the STEM field because of the amount of interesting jobs in STEM and the pay you can potentially get. This is the reason I chose to be a computer science major. The field seemed interesting in high school when I took my first programming class and the pay for new programmers seemed pretty good. The STEM field certainly is challenging and I dislike how challenging it is, but getting through will prove that I am prepared for the future. A lot of people who start out in the STEM field drop out because they realize how difficult it actually is and that it requires hard work and dedication. I am also slowly starting to realize how difficult the work is going to get as I progress through my classes, but no matter how hard it gets, I want to succeed in computer science so I can have a better future. Being able to get a good job in programming and making good money to repay my parents for all the help they have given me growing up is my reason for going into the STEM field. I hope I can make it through so I can fulfill this dream."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2398,"When I was still a child, the thing that caught my interest was video games. Ever since then, I was interested in video games and computers and how they work. Once I was in high school, I was given the chance to explore more about computer science and what it was. The final for my high school computer science class was for me to create an app and I spent an entire week coding the app; Some of my classmates didn't like the struggle, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself, it was like for the first time, I was able to express my creativity through creating the app. Now that I'm majoring in computer science, every cs class has thrown different challenges at me with each one being more difficult than the last, however, I still enjoy them. So overall, I enjoyed coding and I believe that anything is possible if I have the right tools."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,173,"Growing up I have always loved science and I became very curious about the universe. It wasn’t into high school that I really decided I wanted to go into the STEM field. When I was a kid, I wanted to be an engineer and create amazing things. This mainly came from my love of the movies Iron Man and Transformers. I loved my chemistry class in middle school, and this was one of the reasons I became passionate about astronomy and wanting to learn more about the cosmos. Before, I wanted to study art and became an animator, but I grew to love astronomy and wanted to pursue a career in that field. I love space and I enjoy learning more about it and physics. I can’t wait to take more astronomy classes and learn more about physics. Hopefully, when Covid is over and everything is open I could work part-time at an observatory or planetarium."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2399,"I decided to pursue a career within the stem field, because I was impressed by the creations and advances the community has accomplished over time. I want to do something similar and be able to help a lot of people. There is also a choice to move into healthcare and I'd also be achieving the same goal, but I don't want to be held responsible for people's very own lives. And I don't think it would a problem with my competency to fulfill the required duties, as there are exams to prove that, but there is always that chance of making mistakes. Computer science seems broad and has a mix of a few other sciences, so I think it'll give me enough room to fine tune what direction I want to take afterwards. As society becomes more grounded in technology, I find it important to know more than just using it to browse apps or services and mold it to help yourself."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2400,"Pedro Jaime 01/30/2021 PHYS 232 Prof. GrigorescuReflectionI want to go into the STEM field because my brother inspired me to. As a kid, my brother always made apps on his computer, and to me, it was amazing how good he was at it. As I got older, my interest in computers grew bigger and bigger. I used to be in coding clubs and spent countless hours on my computer making things like small games and websites. I took classes in high school like AP computer science that took my interest to the next level. We went on field trips to explore what it is like in the tech world and got inspired by everyone that worked there. For the assignments, we would make game apps. Overall, I got an A in that class. From that point on, that is when I realized that I was good at coding and decided to major in Computer Science. So far, I love the major and I look forward to graduating with a STEM degree and see where it takes me. "
