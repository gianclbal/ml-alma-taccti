2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,172,"My greatest take away from this class is that physics is hard, but if you incorporate some other activities then it can help you learn better and have a bit of fun. When I first registered for my physics class (PHYS 220 and PHYS 222), I was nervous because I had a friend say physics was pretty hard and that just made me worry more. After my first week of classes, I thought it was going to be impossible for me to pass both physics classes because I wasn't understanding the material at all because it is hard for me to focus for online classes. As the weeks passed and the more labs I did, I began to gain a slight understanding of the material, which was a lot better than before. It's the same with this semester. Physics is still really confusing for me, but doing the labs and stuff help me understand a bit more. I think the reason its so hard this semester is that my 230 class is mainly self taught, which is not how I learn."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2394,"I think other than learning more about physics, my biggest takeaway from this class is improving my collaboration skills. Not everyone is knowledgeable about technology, physics, and other things. Even I, feel like sometimes I am not sure about things in physics. So knowing and acknowledging that is very important especially when collaborating with other people. Learning how to be much more understanding of others and not just about yourself is one of the most important things I got from this class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2400,"My greatest take away from this class is that it was filled with helpful people. During the breakout rooms, my classmates answered all of my questions and made sure that I understood the material. I love how the Professor makes sure that we all understand the material and that we finish the lab before class finishes. This gives me time to do other classwork for other classes so it was easy to incorporate the labs to my daily schedule and get it done. I am always excited to join this class because we get to do fun activities instead of writing 500 words essays like other classes. There was nothing about this class that I disliked. My favorite topic that we covered in this semester is learning about electric fields because in that lab, we used simulations to see how it actually works and it helped me better understand the concept. Overall, this semester was really fun and I learned a lot of things during this semester and establishing a great environment definitely played a role in my success in this class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2384,"In the beginning, I thought I would not really use any of this knowledge gained from this class. As I learned more, I found the newfound knowledge to be more and more interesting. It really surprised me. I could apply this knowledge to possible jobs or conversations or even my future career. I found the main sections that had to do with electricity and voltage to be the most important to me. It affects me the most because I am a computer science major. I think that the knowledge of electricity and voltage really gives me the help that could lay the foundation for a future career job for me in the computer industry or even just the technology industry in general. I really did not know the value of the knowledge in physics until nearing the end of this course. I had my doubts about it but now I am slowly realizing the true value and I am slowly learning to appreciate it. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2385,My greatest take away is that the labs can show good visualizations if you can use the phet simulations becaues they help visualize the topics. Also physics can be applied in many different areas where we use in everyday life.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2399,"Of course I learned a lot in both areas of this physics class, but for me electricity seemed more important than the rest of the topics. It could just be that the parts I learned faster were really just easier compared to magnetism and the rest. But I felt that having some kind of interest makes it somehow less complicated and clear. This lab also provided both interactivity and visuals that really helped me understand the ideas. Although, while they did a good job, some of the important details were very briefly discussed or not explained at all. I realized then that I still needed to read the materials and go over formulas. So I guess simulations and labs are great for introductions and to understand what happens inside, it would be better to explain through conceptualization. But all in all, I learned quite a bit on circuitry and emf  making up a good foundation."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2387,The biggest thing I can take away from this class is that physics is everywhere and that even though we don't think about it as much we shouldn't take it for granted. It's also cool to understand how the world works because if you know how the world works then you can make the world a better place. Make it more efficient. Learning about physics can also help us explore new places or get people to mars. There are endless possibilities for what you can do with knowledge in physics. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2388,"I think my greatest takeaway from this class was learning about circuits and electric forces. I would say this because I think this knowledge will be the most practically useful for me in my life and future career. I like working on older cars and I think knowledge of basic circuits and their different components could be really helpful when troubleshooting electrical issues. I'm a computer science major and plan on working in software but if I ever have to do anything with computer hardware, a basic knowledge of circuits and electric forces could be a very useful foundation."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,164,"It's a little hard to answer this with a definitive takeaway considering how this class had to be taken especially given my lecture professor. I guess I wouldn't necessarily be taking away any of the actual course material but rather that I should be doing things ahead of time so it allows for me to do other tasks that I need to do but also just taking away from the stress that I normally have from procrastinating on everything. Outside of the labs that actually required in person demonstration, this was one of the classes that I could do ahead of time and felt like it was not a chore to do so. If I could find a way to apply that to other classes then this would be a great takeaway from this class"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,410,"Getting up really early to sometimes fall back asleep mid-lab. Actually, the hour lectures our professor did during the labs were more helpful than the hour lectures I had for physics 2. I understood more about this course here than my lecture class. My greatest takeaway from this lab is falling sleeping and actually learning here. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2392,"This class helped me understand the concepts discussed during the lecture class better. I also enjoyed working with other classmates, as it was fun working on the same problem together. I learned new concepts that have use cases in my major, Computer Science, like capacitors, resistors, and combined circuits. Before I took this class, I liked to work alone, but now I've realized the power of working in a group as it helped me complete assignments in less time than I would've if I worked alone. I enjoyed working with simulations as they helped me understand concepts better; they made complex concepts easier to understand. This class has been beneficial for me as it provides an additional opportunity to ask questions and clarify concepts taught during a lecture class. But If I have to specify the greatest takeaway from this class, I would say it is the lesson I learned in working with other people than alone."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2397,"My greatest take away from this class is that this class actually helps me understand physics at a much deeper level than my actual physics course. In my actual course, the professor gives us mainly youtube videos to watch and those are our lectures instead of actually teaching us. With you going over the lab, you help me better understand the process and how the unit works which I am grateful for. The explanations prior to the lab are useful and the lab itself is a huge helps compared to the actual homework given to us. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2390,My greatest take away from this class class would be actually learning to apply calculus III and the concept of physics to real world problems. The simulations we had in are labs showed how different concepts would work in real life
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2391,My greatest take away was that i learned that i hate taking labs remotely! I feel like labs are need to be done in person you don't get the same learning experience being at home. On the other hand i did learn how to work with online simulations which is great. Another thing that I finally understood is how coding plays a part in math and physics. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2393,"My greatest takeaway from this class is having refine and learn more about problem solving. Physics is great with learning to be a better problem solver. From the math problems to the real world application problems, its helps you in how to solve problems, how to look at each problem when you are stuck, how to go about answering. All of this is really helpful for someone like me who is a computer science major. We are constantly running into problems when we are coding and this helps in many ways like what to do when you get stuck, how to approach a problem from a different angle and stuff like that. The Lab in it selves are helpful in just understanding real life more, in how things work and why they work the way they work. It doesn't have to be only for academic reasons to learn stuff like that, its good to know how our world works."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2395,"My greatest takeaway from the classes/lecture is getting a better understanding of the concepts. Through the classes and lecture I was understand more on the topics that were taught, before I have some knowledge on the topic but it was greatly expanded throughout the semester. While I do have a general idea on the concepts I feel that I still have trouble fully understanding the concept as there's knowing how to find these concepts is difficult."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,173,"Something that I took away from this course is more through information about the topics in my physics course. My physics course is main online, so we only watch YouTube videos for the topics. Having this lab helps with any questions I have. The labs are also very explicit and goes over topics in details while also giving visual examples about the topics. Many may see labs as just a long class, but it’s an opportunity to learn more about a lesson we are being taught in the main section of physics. Something else I took away from this class is how much a group setting can help getting through topics you don’t understand. Like if you are stuck in a section of the lab, you have your group to help you figure it out. In the labs where we worked together as a class, it really helped when I was confused in some parts."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2398,"I have many small takeaways from this class so it's difficult to just choose one. Most of the stuff in this class's mini-lecture was already covered in my lecture class, but there are tiny things that my lecture professor failed to mention or I didn't really understand. I learned that when a current through a wire in a solenoid, the direction of the thumb is the Northside, and the opposite side is the Southside. I was also able to figure out how flux works; if a positive charge is inside a gaussian object then the flux penetrating that object is positive. I was also able to figure out how electricity magnetizes metal objects; I knew of electromagnetism but I didn't know how an object is magnetize using electricity until it was demonstrated in this class. Overall, this class was very helpful in solidifying my understanding of the different topics from my lecture class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2389,"My greatest takeaways from this course were the interactive labs. Learning about short circuits, current, voltage, and seeing how it works was great. My favorite lab was the short circuit as we got to see how the fuses in our cars and houses work and prevent our electronic devices from becoming damaged. Also, coding to answer some questions regarding circuits was very enjoyable as well. I feel the labs have helped reinforce my knowledge I learned from the lecture material and made me see the purpose of the topics in practical usage. Learning about parallel and series circuits as well as electromagnets has been enjoyable as much as it has been challenging. I don't have any other thoughts on the semester other than I am grateful there is a lab portion for this class as the lecture wouldn't be enough for me to fully grasp all the concepts."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2128,"I think my greatest take away from this class learning what electricity is. It is not just the general aspect of the subject but also being able to apply it in my home and everywhere I go. I can look at wiring systems and know what is going on and I now have an idea about safety. Another thing that I was able to sharpen is my ability to function in a group. We worked together and help each other out on the labs and that is something that I can definitely apply to my other classes. Overall, this class has set me to understand my future courses by providing me knowledge and skills."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2396,My greatest take away from this class would be the hands on lab with Prof and the entire class; every bodies contributions I have learnt from has helped me develop understanding on each weeks labs and experiments. The knowledge and experience acquired from this class will help me with other classes as well as my educational system in general. Once again Thank you prof. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2386,"There are a lot of things that one can take away by studying the subject of Physics. Taking physics is necessary for a wide variety of students and I think I can understand why. Taking physics better helps one to understand the external world. In saying this, I believe that it helps people to see the bigger picture of how the world works. During my time in college I have taken a number of different subjects. Chemistry, Physic, Biology, Philosophy. In taking all of these courses one of the things that one founds is that all of these subjects are connected in some way. Therefore studying them all helps one to understand the other. Since I have started the study of physics I have found that as I go through my daily life I find examples in my everyday life of how these physics concepts are at work. In addition to this I find that taking physics helps one to look at problems in a number of different ways. Problems can be represented in a number of different ways. Some of these ways include through mathematics formulas, pictures and graphs. Having these different perspective defiantly effects how one approaches problem solving."
