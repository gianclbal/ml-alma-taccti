2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2398,"There are several good things about online classes and there are several bad things about online classes. The good things are that I don't have to commute—normally it would take 2 hours—so I get to sleep in; Since online classes are online, I just have to turn on my computer which is in my room so don't have to go far to attend class; I get to use the commute time—2 hours one way, so 4 hours both way—to study and do my homework. The bad things are that I can't focus as well as I would have in person; The materials seem more difficult; I couldn't form a bond with any of my classmates; Most of my classes are asynchronous so I don't even know how my professors even look like; Hard to contact the professors. So in general, online classes have more cons than pros. I have been trying to eat healthier and get a little exercise in every day, but it's not enough due to the fact that I can't leave the house and the amount of homework sitting on my desk that needed to be completed within the week it is due."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2384,"Online classes have negatively impacted my learning a lot. I am not a good online learner and more of an in-class learner. I am trying my best to keep up with all the classwork from all my classes but it is proving to be very difficult. My online learning experience is clashing with my at home experience/life. I have to take care of my grandpa every day now because of covid-19 and my parents do not have time to tend to him so it is my job to take care of him. I am trying my best to keep track of everything in my life. I am trying work to earn money for my college tuition as well as keep up with classwork. Online learning is definitely less stressful than last semester so I am definitely glad. I just hope I am able to keep my mental health in check. I think that my mental health goes first before school but I think everyone's mental health goes first before anything. I think a person's health, physical or mental deserves the most importance in their own lives. Anything or everything comes second to that. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,172,"I feel like online classes have been meh this semester. I feel like I have very little time to relax because its just assignment after assignment after assignment. Once one assignment is complete, another one is right there. The constant bombardment of assignments has made me feel mentally drained and I feel like the only keeping me from just giving up on my classes is the thought of summer and relaxing. We are almost there and I couldn't be happier. With the little time I do have to relax, I usually just play games or go for a walk around my neighborhood. This helps me relax for a few hours. I also feel like I am having a harder time retaining information this semester compared to last semester. I don't know what it is, but I find myself forgetting simple things. This means that I usually have to rely on my notes a lot more than before, which isn't the worst thing."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2396,"Online class have impacted my learning more in the negative spectrum; it has been hard for me to focus in zoom lecture while I am home full of various sort of distraction. I am very very concerned about my academic progress; because a slight back track of a semester can cost me 1 to 2 more extra semester which I would be paying out of pocket. I have planned on working hard and get back to my ultimate study/learning habits. Thus this class has been different because of the interactive section that has kept me focus to do my work, it is still a struggle but one I can easily handle."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2397,"Online classes have made my learning much more interesting but not in a good way. I do love the time saver that does come with online classes, however in the grand scheme of things, I learn virtually nothing. I do not understand as well as I would if I were having class in person. As a result, I do try and focus on self care to help with my mental state. Some things I do are hanging out with my friends online and playing video games with them. The time I spend with them is time away from school. Yes it is on a screen but I have glasses to protect my eyes. These actions minimize the concerns I have for my learning since I am fearful of classes in fall when they are in person and I don't really know anything. Let's hope that is not the case. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2128,"I think online classes have made courses more difficult just cause professors are having trouble gauging where their students are at. It is often up to us to learn by ourselves because we were not used to the online setting and homeschooling. It was at it's hardest the first time we canceled in-person classes because I was unexpected and professors pushed student to still get materials done and I felt so behind that I had to take time off work. But as we got used to the online setting, I think it became easier since professors became understanding and I was able to manage my time more effectively. One concern I would say I have is not much of a concern but more a realization that I have spent more time doing online classes than in-person and next year I will be a junior in college, which is not long before I graduate. A self-care that I do is manage my sleep and get some sun or drive around when I feel overwhelmed with work or school."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,410,"Honestly, online classes make it hard to focus because I have so many temptations and distractions not paying attention. Sometimes I give in because I just can't stop. Being stuck inside really motivated me to be lazier, I stopped working out. I am learning more about cooking instead of playing games all the time because even that is getting boring. Just looking for new things to do because I am slowly losing interest in everything I normally do. I do them too much. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2386,Online classes have effected my learning in a number of ways. The first way is that it effects the ways people learn things who have to take lab classes. While people often claim that they can make an online simulation like real life classes and some institutions have done very well at implementing online learning functionality. There is still the tactile aspect of performing lab procedures. Another Way that online learning has effected my learning is that there is not away to always get instant feedback from the instructors. This can make solving certain problem more laborious then others. Over the past year I have tried to take certain steps to take better care of myself under the circumstances. One of the ways that I do this is by taking breaks often. This can help to prevent muscle and eye strain. The second thing that I have been trying to do is take care of basic needs like food and water. This along with physical exercise are great ways to stay health during the pandemic
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2395,Online classes have impact my learning in that it made learning a bit simpler because I am able to access the materials much easily as everything is online and I can comeback to the material at any time. Online learning also made it difficult to be engage during class as you are just siting in front of a screen for a hour listening the someone  talk which can get quite boring at times. I don't have any concerns about my learning and well being as i am doing well in class and that staying home makes it easier to get to class on time. However I feel that the amount of work I receive is much more than in person which makes it difficult to do all of them on time.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2394,Online classes have been really tough especially for courses that are meant to be taught in person only. There are things that can only be taught effectively in person and would create a whole lot of confusion when taught online. One thing I can think of is Programming classes. Most of my programming classes would really benefit if it were taught in person instead and its been really tough because I had to figure out almost everything by myself.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,164,"The online aspect hasn't really done too much in terms of my classes because I am a computer science major which can easily be taught online. The only negative I guess is the lack of human connection/interaction that I would have  with some people within the class, but at the same time, it can be said that I met more people online because it was easier to talk to people and reach out. But back to the class topic, I really don not feel I am missing too much because of the convenience of being at home and having that quick access to my computer but also because the remainder of most of my classes needed for my degree are computer science courses.The only health thing that is a concern is the fact that I am no longer going out so I am probably lacking a lot of vitamin D and also the normal exercise that I would get from being on campus and walking to each class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2392,"I am doing well with online classes, and I feel like the online learning system hasn't affected my learning process that much. One good thing about online learning for me is that I don't have to spend time in the commute, which gives me more time to study, hence improving my learning experience. One drawback that I can think of is that sometimes it's stressful to take exams and tests online since there is always a possibility of a technical problem. Exams, in general, are already stressful, and when you add the possibility of having a technical difficulty on top, it makes them even more stressful. I also sometimes miss the in-person experience of being in a class and interacting with fellow class students face to face. To decrease stress, I try to meditate and focus more on positive things, and I also like to talk to my friends back in India. Whenever possible, I try to take some time to exercise, which also helps me relax and relieve stress."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2388,"For me, online classes have been a great convenience and a better way for me to learn. Since starting online classes I have stopped procrastinating as I used to when attending school in person. I think this has to do with being able to be in my home while attending class. When class ends it's like I'm still in ""class mode"" because I am in the same environment and it motivates me to continue to work throughout the day.I have also adopted some self-care practices while attending classes online. One of them is getting up at 7-8 am no matter when my classes start. I am most productive in the morning so this helps me get a lot more productivity out of my day. Another practice I've adopted is showering, shaving, and getting dressed every morning even if I'm not going out anywhere. I discovered this helps me by giving my body a defining change between waking up and actually starting my work for the day."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2387,I think that for lab it would be easier to do in person because we can all work on it together and interact with each other. I like how since it is online I don't have to commute to school but I think I would learn a little better if it was at school. It is interesting how times have changed and this is the new norm. I think that in zoom calls it feels like it is a ghost town and no one usually talks so it is hard to learn when no one wants to initiate conversation. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2390,Online classes can be very stressful at times. Being a Computer Science major means I'm constantly learning on the computer more that 99% of the times. It's harder to learn for me because we don't have that option to have hands on learning due to virtual learning. I just hope everything can return back to normal sooner or later. For self care I try not to be on my computer as much and try to get out of the house where it isn't as crowded due to the pandemic. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2399,"I can’t really tell how much better or worse I would be doing if we started this semester in person. Although, with the amount that I learn seems like it would be the same regardless where I am. Personally, I think both online and in person types of learning have their own unique systems and discipline. The most obvious difference was with the schedule. Everyonetakes this issue differently, but I struggled to keep up to pace. The environment feels slow and never changes from the same room. Probably also why it’s so easy to lose track of time. In fact, sometimes it just feels like I’m on some kind of vacation somehow. It’s like everything takes away some sense of urgency. There’s really no other way right now except to focus hard and get back on the timelines as fast as possible. Then cruise and make sure to be on top of the workloads."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2385,Online learning has impacted me because U haven't been able to see my classmates and make friends with people in my class. I also think classes are difficult in some ways because I can't be there in person with the teachers and be in the classroom. To take care of myself with self care routines I always like to get at least 8 hours of sleep. I also like to go to the beach or do some of the hobbies I like to do. I like to surf and skate in my free time. Another thing I like to do is always talk to someone so I never get lonely even though I can't go to in person classes.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2389,"Online classes have affected my learning and part of it is having difficulty contacting professors outside of class. Some professors get back to be quite quickly while others don't respond at all. I believe the idea this semester was to have a lot of little assignments to help guide us through the semester more easily, but all the little assignments force us to be on the computer for hours and hours every day causing fatigue. Especially now, in week 11, doing some trivial assignments are becoming more tiresome and less of a learning tool. I feel I am getting them done, just to get them done, rather than learning the material."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2393,"The online classes have impacted me tremendously. They have their ups and their downs. Some positives will be that its less intense. I remember when I would take chemistry labs, they were very intense that it would make me nervous. I was always afraid of messing up and then that affecting my grade. So the online classes takes the intensity and the stressfulness away a bit. Some negativity is that its very easy to space out and get distracted. Staring at the screen for hours is very hard. Sometimes it doesn't feel like we're learning anything because of the environment, it not being a classroom environment. All of this takes a lot of affect on our mental health where everything about classes then becomes tedious and dull. I think one has to do a lot for their self-care in times like this. We can step out and take breaks. Its good to go out on a walk and find a hobby to give your self a break from staring at the screen for hours."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2391,I absolutely  hate it. I feel like i can't get the hang of it i feel like i'm always behind and no matter what i do i can't catch up.  I also don't  feel like i fully grasp the concept being lectured and since everything is pre recorded i cant ask questions.
