2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2386,My goals are rather simple I think. I have been interested in the sciences for most of my life. I have always been interested in sciences in some form or another. My current short term goals is to get my engineering degree. What Intend to do after is still up for debate. I like to be flexible and keep my options open. This class in that regard has a lot of usefulness. Computer Engineering being the synthesis of electrical engineering and computer sciences. What I hope to get from this class is a more broad understanding of how electronics work and how these principles can be applied to a number of different field. As previously stated I am unsure of what I want in the future but I think that this is one of the degrees that would give me the most options. I also think that this class and physics in general helps the change the ways that people view the  worlds. This power of observation is one of the prime take away from this class. The ability to view the world from a different lenses and hopefully think of innovative ways to make improvements to the world. Another one of my goals with this major is to expose myself to different areas of science then biology which is one of my main interest. In that regard I think its important to pursue things that are challenging.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2397,"My goals for this class are for me to gain the knowledge I need to better succeed in my major. The reason this is a goal is because in my journey to complete my computer science major, I must take this class which means there must be a reason behind it. So with that, I do hope to gain the experience and knowledge necessary I need from this lab and hopefully it will benefit me for the future situations that I will encounter. The way this class can aid me in achieving my goals is already being done. The class has a set schedule and presents me with the information and the lab that I must learn. It mostly comes down to me since I am the one that must be willing to learn and wiling to reap the benefits that come from this class to help me achieve my goals. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2390,My goals for this class is to actually understand everything that I'm learning throughly. Also to get the extra help I need when necessary. I also hope to use what I learn in this class in actual real life settings and everyday settings so it's not a waste of a class. This is one of the very few classes that I've taken that I think I can actually apply to real life everyday scenarios. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,173,My current goal is to pass all my classes this semester and continue towards my degree in Physics with a concentration in Astrophysics. My long term goal is to get a Masters in Astrophysics and possible working for NASA. I would also like to work in an observatory or a planetarium before than. This class will help me better understand physics and comprehend things I have yet to learn. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2392,"I am currently pursuing a bachelor's in computer science, and I am taking this class to meet the requirements. My goal is to finish my bachelor's no late than December of next year. The most I want to get out of this class is to learn the complex concepts discussed in the lecture class. Moreover, applying the concept learned in the lecture class also helps to deepen the knowledge. I think repetition has a very positive impact on learning and sustaining knowledge, and that's what this lab class provides. I also want to get a good grade in physics, and understanding the materials better would help me achieve that aim. Having the chance to discuss complex subjects with other students allows me to learn more about the subject. Apart from helping me meet the requirements, this class could also help me improve my communication skills since it provides many opportunities for group work. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,410,"Well, seeing how my goals currently graduate and be secured in the future, I need to pass this class. This class is a requirement for a computer science major, so this class will help me achieve my goals when I pass. This lab is honestly helping me learn a lot more about physics and by it helping me learn, I should be able to pass PHYS 230 as well. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,172,"My goal is to become a programmer and make games. Programming can be fun and satisfying when you do something that was giving you problems. I've liked the feeling of this satisfaction ever since I was introduced to programming back in my junior year of high school. That's one of the reasons I got into this subject, the other being my love for video games. The other being that it can pay very well if you are skilled enough. In order to reach this goal, I have to graduate with a Computer Science degree. In order to graduate with a CS degree, I have to pass all the classes required, and this is one of the classes. By passing this class, I am getting one step closer to my goal. I know the journey there will be VERY challenging, but I hope that I can make it out on the other side alive. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2396,My goals are to be disciplined with my studies and graduate in due time; This class can contribute to that by understanding the workload and doing the labs and experiment with extensive practice. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2394,I am working on my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am hoping to graduate next year. I am taking this class in order to fulfill my requirements in getting my degree. This class will help me achieve my goals by teaching me things that I can apply in real-life situations. This class helps me a lot because I get to learn things hands-on and seeing them happen.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2395,"My goals right now is working towards a degree in computer science, the work I am doing in this class connects to my goal in that the work I am doing right now helps me further my understanding of physics which will help me when doing work for a physics course. Physics also plays an important role in  computer science as many of the physical aspects of computer science uses physics so what I am Learning gives me some insight into those aspects."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2384,"Firstly, I intended to take this class just to get credits for my Computer Science degree but now I think that it can broaden my horizon with different kinds of knowledge. Even though this class is not directly related to Computer Science or coding in general but it can help me in my future endeavours. For example, I could pursue in coding something for physics related operations, so that I can have a foundation for my possible coding job. I now realize that physics related problems can most definitely be related to coding jobs, maybe automations of certain jobs like construction jobs that require calculations. I like the fact that physics gives me foundations and lets me be more open about my future endeavours. I hope to acquire a job in the future that could help me in my life. Maybe this physics class could help me in the future."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2387,"I guess my goals in life are to be healthy and have lots of money. But this class is not going to help me in that regard. I guess an acceptable goal that this class would help me in is that I need this class to graduate. Without this class, I wouldn't be able to get a degree which is a stepping stone toward the direction of getting a job and then getting lots of money."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2389,"My short term goal is to learn as much as I can when given the opportunity. These concepts so far have taught me the basics of charges and electric fields. Later we will be learning more about circuits and other electrical concepts. I want to become a mechanical engineer, and possibly systems engineer or project manager later on in my career. In order to be a leader and understand different roles and different tasks, I think it is important to learn about all types of physics including electricity and magnetism. These topics will help me understand how and why things will work. These topics are especially important because they are as essential as any other concept due to how modern world works. We are constantly using items that make our life easier such as calculators, phones, computers, etc. In the future we can better mankind with these topics as well. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2400,"My goals are to graduate from San Francisco State University with a Computer Science degree. If I pass this class, it will get me closer to that goal. This class could help me solve a problem in the future if I am assigned a big coding project. With the knowledge I am getting from this class, I will be able to know more about what we learn in class and will be easy to solve if I were to interact with a similar problem in coding."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2391,My goal is graduate with a bachelors in mathematics and a minor in physics within two years . This class plays a major role in that accomplishment because without this class i can't receive my minors in physics. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2128,"I plan on being a civil engineering so it is a requirement for me to be able move on to other classes. I also appreciate that even though it is not very hands on it is still very helpful in understanding concepts of math and physics, which definitively helps trained me to tackle future problems. This class also helps me see how the concepts that I have read and listened to actually works. It helps me connect it to other things that may or may not be related to what I am learning. Ultimately what this class does for me is help me have a better understanding of the basics of physics which is crucial on tackling my future classes and hopefully my future job.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2399,"For the short term goal, I want to pass the requirements for my major and pass this class along with the 230 class for physics. Of course to be able to pass these physics classes, I should be following along with the lectures  and doing the work that is assigned. The path basically opens up for me once I do well in these two classes. In the long run, I hope to build on the things I learned here to apply towards my career in computer science. I want to understand how the electronic components of computers work and how I can better interact with other technologies. I used to hear people saying certain subjects won’t really help them, but I’ve found myself somehow revisiting subjects I learned from school. But I get it, being focused on a specific area does have its own merits. Although, I see physics so closely related to computer science that it might be useful to know at least some parts."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2388,My goal is to graduate from SFSU with a BS in computer science and land a job as a software engineer at a large tech company. This class will help me achieve this goal because it will give me credit needed to graduate with the degree I want. It may also help me to achieve some future goals if the company I choose to work for requires physics knowledge to create its products. In that case I would be able to apply concepts that I've learned in this class.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2398,"My goal is to get a CS degree and in order to reach my goal, I would need to take two different physics courses. I already took one last semester and I'm taking one this semester as well. The physics classes are needed in order for me to reach my goal because they are apart of my major's requirement. Currently, I can't think of anything about CS that would require physics, but at least the activity will be helpful for me in the future. For the lab, I would have to work with my classmates to solve problems just like how I'll have to work with my team on the job. I think that, for now, I wouldn't be able to think of why I would need this class, but I bet, later down the line, I think I might be thankful for this class, anything can happen in life."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2385,My goals are to get good grades. In this class I am hoping to get better grades because I need this class for a pre requisite for other courses in the future. I hope to learn from this class as well. This class can help me with my physics 230 class so that can help me get better grades in that class as well. In this class my goal is to get good grades and practice what I learn in phys 230/ 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2393,"My goals for this class is to help me learn more about physics and to pass this class so I can get a CS degree. This class will help me achieve a lot with understanding physics more and how I can apply it to my real life. Also it will help me a lot with problem solving and critical thinking. I think those two things are very important factors to understand physics and to also get my degree in computer science. With problem solving and critical thinking it will help me in future classes with my programing when I need to figure out how to implement a particular code. Also I think it will be very beneficial in not only in future classes, but in future life when I get a job in my field. I think skills like this really help people grow and stay with you for a long time. You are always improving on them so this class will defiantly help in improving those skills."
