2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2384,"I think I learned and enjoyed the circuitry, especially series and parallel. I was interested in learning about it because it really applies to the outside and real world. Is it always better to use a parallel circuit in households? In a series circuit, the same amount of current flows through all the devices. In series circuits, the devices are in a line and if one device breaks in that series, the whole circuit will burn out and stop working which means no current flow. The total voltage is equal to all the devices added up. Parallel circuits are more for combining the devices to form a current flow from the source. The devices are arranged parallel to each other in parallel circuits. Even if one devices breaks down or stops working, the circuit will not burn out. Each device has its own circuit. The total voltage is equal to each individual device voltage. It is not like a series circuit. This is applicable to most of society because technology is in such a prevalent use now. Especially in households, electrical circuitry is used in lights, appliances, etc... Without circuitry, we would still be using candles and fire to light our households."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,172,"Question: How much charge is flowing through a wire?The charge flowing through a wire can be determined by using Ohm's law if we are given the voltage and the resistance. This can be applicable to people's lives because knowing how much charge is flowing through a wire can stop someone from potentially hurting themselves, or worst case scenario, dying by touching a wire with a lot of charge flowing through it. This can be especially helpful to people who deal the electricity and wires. If they know how much charge is flowing through, then they can be more careful around the wires."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2398,"After learning about potential and potential energy, I was confused as to what the difference was. Originally, I had thought that the professor had forgotten to put energy after potential or since the two were the same, it didn't matter if she added the energy at the end or not. Now, I've realized that potential is measured in Voltage and potential energy is measured in Joule. Potential energy is the product of a charge (q) multiplying the change in potential. I know that when a charge is moving along the electric field, the potential decreases into the negative, and depending on the charge, the potential energy would be positive or negative. I think the difference between potential and potential energy is that potential is used to measure the amount of energy a point in a charge's electric field has, and I'm not really sure how to explain potential energy all that well. The only reference I have about potential energy is the potential energy an object has due to gravity and how it gets converted into kinetic energy, so I'm assuming that the electric potential energy is the same. I somewhat know the application of potential and potential energy, but I'm not really sure how to explain the difference, I know that they're different, but I can't put it into words on how it's different."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2392,"Why does the electric flux through a closed surface depend on the net charge inside?The electric flux through a closed surface depends on the net charge enclosed by that surface because if the charge is placed outside the surface, the number of electric field lines entering the surface will leave from the other side, making the net flux zero. Therefore, it's important to have a net charge inside to maintain a steady flow of electric field lines through the surface. Suppose two charges are present inside a closed surface, one positive and one negative of equal magnitude. In that case, they will create electric fields opposite in direction, resulting in the total electric field of zero, and because of that, the net flux through the surface would be zero. When I first learned about this concept, it was hard to understand, and it didn't make sense to me, but after a while, it made sense. I understood it by dividing a surface into sections, calculating the electric flux through them separately, and adding them to find net electric flux.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2128,"How does current supply our appliances? We know that all our appliances run on the same voltage but they consume different quantity of power. That is because even thought they are all plugged in the same socket the current that are flowing through them are different. Heat is produced by the resistance in resistors so our heating devices consume more power than others. Resistors regulate current so even though voltage is the same current can be lower or higher. This is relevant in our society because this concept gives us more knowledge about current which, not only gives us knowledge about safety, but also gives us knowledge of saving energy."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2390,"In this past weeks lab we went over air resistance and Newton's Law. In the lab preview there was a question that asked why are rockets in the shape of a cone? I actually wanted to know the answer to that question so I did my own research. I learned that all rockets must have a body, a nose cone, fins and a propellant. For most model rockets that fly at speeds far less than the speed of sound, a rounded, parabolic shape is ideal to minimize drag and reach the highest altitude."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2389,"Why are fuses so important?The reason fuses are so important is because they can save the rest of the components of a circuit from becoming damaged. This evidence can be seen in the lab in Week 6: Short Circuit. The sliver served as a fuse and since there is too much current flowing through, it started to melt. In a real circuit, as this sliver melts away, the circuit would be open, saving the rest of the components from having too much current flowing through them and short circuiting. The more length that fuse has, the more resistance occurs, creating less current to flow through the circuit given by the equation R=(resistivity)*(length)/Area. If a fuse has a longer length, then the resistivity increases, decreasing the amount of current flowing through it.  If a fuse has too much length, almost no current will flow through it, and if there a high area, the current will be extremely high. That is why fuses vary in length and size, as they can significantly alter the amount of current. These are basic concepts that help help preserve important electronics safe in the house, car, boat, and many other electronic systems in the every day life. They are relatively cheap and easy to replace as well, while they can save thousands to millions of dollars in repairs in damages from occurring to other items."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2399,"On the topic of current, I wondered why parallel circuits don’t just short themselves every time. The way I see it, a typical parallel circuit can basically be seen as a square with the source on the left and more extended squares connected on the right; it’s a rectangle in essence. So with the shortest path being the first square, wouldn’t it be the only one that receives energy? Please correct me where I’m wrong, but I saw through the simulations that energy seems to go to every path available even if there’s no resistance. When there is resistance, such as bulb, the energy is split based on the usage and excess. So, I thought that the energy is always finding a path that lets it move the fastest. A square with a bulb constricts the path to a point that every other path is faster.The flow of electricity is a concept that can be relevant both for me and the rest of society. For example in order to build and improve anything, it is vital to understand how they work. The modern age is dominated with machinery and while learning the workings down to the basic fundamentals might not be necessary to operate, having an understanding will make it safer and easier. Like mechanics, those working with computers might also be inspecting and repairing the pcb or related components."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2386,"One of the question that I thought about recently was what causes electrons to move. One of the things that made me consider this was the question asked about the perpetual motion machine. It occurred to me that I know some reasons that electrons move. One thing that came to mind was induced dipoles. A particle that is polar can cause another particle to become polarized like with London Forces in chemistry. However the question that I was wondering about was electrons in isolation. From what I have researched I know that electron is not in any one place unless it is being observed. This is the result of superposition. What causes electrons to move around and atom and if they don't really have a finite positions unless observed. This mostly stemmed from the question about having a perpetual motion machine so I was looking for example in nature and  when considering characteristics of the atom I got slightly confused. One of the things that I though about was potential difference. If electricity moves from places of higher concentration to place of lower concentration, and the places that don't currently contain an electron are considered areas of low concentration then this could create movement. The space between the nucleus and the actual electrons is a really large distance apart. Actually, now that I think about it since opposites attract and like charges repel it make sense that electrons could be propelled by being repelled from each other. But does a single electron in isolation behave the same way. Clearly it does with Hydrogen. What I found was that this has to do with potential and kinetic energy as well as quantum mechanics which I have not formally learned yet. But am looking forward to learning more about."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2394,"In Week 5's lab where we figured out that in order for a light bulb to turn on, there needs to be a flow from one end of an energy source to another. In our case, we used a battery to power up the light bulb. When the two sides of the battery meet, our light bulb lightens up. This idea might be really basic, but it is powerful when you apply it to things. As a computer science major, I like to tinker with technology and to be able to know how to power up technology is really important."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2385,"Question: Does the electric potential depend on the test charge.      No because the electric potential is the potential at a certain point in the field. The equation for electric potential v = kQ/r. This formula shows that it only depends on the source charge and not the test charge. Potential difference is the difference in potential energy. Electric potential is measured in volts. The measure of electric potential is used every day in many things we use today such as cars, houses, phones, and computers. All these things are used in our daily lives. Our phones have voltage and voltage requires volts so something necessary like our phones are using this information every day."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2387,"I guess what is interesting about what we learned in class was circuits.  A  question I would ask about circuits is how do we prevent a short circuit so that the circuit won't blow up in our faces? And the answer to that question is a fuse. Fuses help protect the circuit from shorting out. Without it, if a short circuit were to occur we could potentially blow up something. For example a car. Also, it helps not corrupt the circuit if it were to short. If we want to fix the circuit we would just get a new fuse instead of replacing the whole circuit. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2397,"One of the main topics that I have been taught in both my lecture as well as my lab has been the concept of currents and how electricity runs through them. By definition, an electric current is a stream of charged particles, such as electrons or ions, moving through an electrical conductor or space. It is measured as the net rate of flow of electric charge through a surface or into a control volume.This information is generally applicable to people's lives because with this, they can understand how electricity runs through their living space and potentially have an idea of how it can be fixed if broken. This specific information is relevant because on a more specific scale, if people want to build some type of machine for whatever purpose they desire, understanding the electric current will be important to building such a machine."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2396,"Electric current is a daily thing for me because I am an amateur electrician; I had a battery that had disconnected from what it supplies current to, I used a soldering iron to solder it back on to allow electric flow on both positive and negative terminal. Physics in general is every day to me, I just need to explain myself in advanced terminology. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,164,"What are circuits and why is understanding them important?This is kind of an all encompassing things since all topics in this class fall under an umbrella which is why this class is able to teach it all. As it was written my lab report summary, I think that most people should at least have an entry level understanding how circuits work; maybe not exactly why they work the way they do but know how is super important. The example I used, that was also in the lab itself was in reference to appliances and circuits at home. We just know that the plugs in the walls are connected in some way but no real idea of how. Generally, our houses should have circuits in parallel but who knows. One thing that we can test though is which plugs are connected to each other. I found this out in my house because my brother and I have rooms next to each other but if we were to both plug in a heater and both have it on, it would blow a fuse and both our rooms would lose power. Before I didn't know why, I just knew it because that was just how it was."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2395,"Question what is charge and what does it do?Charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. It can be positive or negative, like charges repel while oppsite charge attract. Charge is neutral when there is an equal amount of  negative and positive charge when a neutrally charged object is brought close to a positive or negative charged object they will attract as the charge of the charged object will cause the opposite charge in the neutral object to displace faraway from the charged object. So the opposites will get close and attract to each other. All atoms are made up of positive and negative charges. Charge is important in our lives as the appliances need electric charge in order to work as the charges is what helps power the machines, charges is also the fundamental concept for any item that uses electricity."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,4,2388,Two or three weeks ago I was confused about the difference between electrical potential and electrical potential energy. A big difference between these two things is that electric potential energy is the amount of energy needed to move a charge against the direction of the electric field while the electric potential is the amount of work that needs to be done to move a charge from infinity to a point in space that is in an electric field.
