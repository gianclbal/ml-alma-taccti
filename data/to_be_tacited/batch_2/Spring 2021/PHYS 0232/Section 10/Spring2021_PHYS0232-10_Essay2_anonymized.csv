2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2476,"As I progress towards a well defined career path, I find myself heading down a road towards electrochemistry. I have begun doing research in this field with Dr. Qiu  and am left inspired to help the human race solve our energy crisis. I believe with my knowledge and skill set I will be able to accomplish whatever I set my mind to. There is a lot of work ahead of me. This class has helped me learn some of the fundamental aspects of electricity in a different light. Application of Efield and magnetism will help me better understand chemical reactions, and if I end up working on batteries the physics behind how they work. I am sure I will use the principals learned in this class again. It also helped me learn how to better work with a group as I was fortunate enough to get good lab partners who were interested in the material. I hope someday to become a scientist and use my skills to make the world a better place to live. I know it sounds cheesy but helping to solve the energy crisis is so interesting to me and something I have the talent to do."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2458,"To achieve success, I would carefully manage my time. Good time-management skills help me prioritize tasks so i am able to complete work and assignments on time. I also plan ahead, set aside the time I need for assignments and projects and stay focused to better use that time.Here are some effectively efforts manage by my time and improve my study:Create a daily, weekly and monthly schedule.Avoid distractions while you're studying.Set goals for every study session.Start working on projects or tasks early.Make a project plan.Work on one task at a time.Start early in the day."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2474,Reflection # 2What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?My future goals are to get degree in Computer Science and hopefully get job in software engineering. I also have interest in business and in future I would like to combine my skill in software engineering and business to create a new startup. This class is a required class for me to get my degree in computer science which can eventually lead me toward achieving my goals in future. This class can also give me information on how does the physics work and how we are using it in our daily life.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2466,"As a computer science major, this is a required class to complete the undergrad course and to graduate. Whether or not I like this class, it is required to reach my goal of completing my degree. I prefer to take my goals a little bit at a time, and my first major goal is to complete my undergraduate studies. Passing this class is just a miniature part of the overall goal. Since in computer science we work with software, not hardware, so I do not see the benefit of this class. If I was in computer engineering then yes, the use of this class is evident. But that's fine, as the university is just milking me of my money for a bunch of useless classes. Oh well. But yeah this class is just a small stepping stone to the end."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2464,"My goals are to understand physics and get answers to questions that I would have never known the answers for such as how electromagnetic fields and charges play a role in our daily life and the physics around us. It will give understanding and make sense as to how things movie with electricity and are able to function even when there is nothing charging them and to get more into physics and move on to bigger challenges and expand my mind and think this with a physicist's brain, looking for a solution to modern-day problems, that before I would have never thought of. And use that knowledge in my daily life when working on certain things or helping people who might not know why certain things with electricity and charge are happening and how to approach certain situations and be able to explain that in a way they can understand."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2460,"My biggest goal is ultimately to graduate college with my degree in computer science and to be able to complete the curriculum within my 4 years at sf state. To do that I have to pass all my classes and meet all the prerequisites for all of my classes, especially since the upper division classes require a lot of them. This class is the last physics lab I have to take and it will solidify the knowledge I had from my last class and help me better understand how certain processes work and even how my own computer works. My other goal is to get a job within my field and graduating and knowing fully what I learnt in class will help me reach this goal. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2468,"My goal is to be a computer games designer, my major is computer science, PHYS 232 is one of the required classes that I have to take. On the other hand, computers need electricity to operate and PHYS 232 can help me to understand how to electricity works, which can let me run the computer more safely."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2462,"Some of my goals are to first graduate with a degree in computer engineering and then hopefully find a job in that field. In that field I'm not exactly sure how much physics plays a role in that, but I'll take as much as I can out of this class. Working hands on with equipment and tools will be one thing that I can get used to from this class. I hope to be working hands on with things in my career so that will be beneficial. That's the main thing I feel will be taken from this."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2470,"For this class, PHYS 230/232, if I were to be very honest, I need to take this class to complete my CS degree. However, in this class, I have been learning interesting things about the world like fields and electrical properties that I probably would not have learned if I did not take this class. My dad went to school for electrical engineering and asking him questions from this class always lead to other conversations about his early career and college. Even though my goals may not be directly helped by this class, I am glad that this class has helped me think a little differently about the world and helps me chat more with my dad."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2463,Question: What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?Response:My goals are to work in tech and likely begin my own company/start-up. This class will help me get my degree and network with the right people when that time comes!
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2478,"My goals is to understand how the circuits work where I want to figure out how hardware and software work together. I know that we can program commands into circuits boards that contain memory or a cpu. By understanding the current and resistor allows me to have more control on the board and that we can stop things from breaking like controlling the resistors and voltage through coding. We can program things by understanding the object that we are using, One way I could get support in this would be getting a explanation on calculating voltage.  I feel that the abilities to control circuits board also connects to programing hardware related items such as CPU and memory and serial bus. Since these components are  located on circuits board and we can understand how everything get powered and transfer codes. One thing that's not related to a subject that I want to accomplish is getting a good understanding on how each of the physic topics are useful in developing games that uses real physic."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2465,"I plan to graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Computer Science. By taking this course this semester,I have been more focused on achieving daily tasks. Minimized distractions and increased productivity by, say, 40% over the next 3 months. I make to-do lists or use scheduling apps on my phone to keep me on track. It increased my productivity, to learn to manage or beat my social media addiction. Doing this gave my self-esteem a boost by reducing social comparisons. A slow typing speed slows down productivity. It is said that you can save 21 days a year by typing fast. But it is boosting my typing speed and accuracy in a matter of months. If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. Once I determined what I enjoy studying, the real work began. Students need to seek out academic advisement. Academic advisement means many different things; it can include course selection, course completion for graduation, mapping coursework to graduation, developing opportunities within your major and mentorship."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,138,"My goal is to complete my bachelor's degree and get a job in a company that I like. I want to become a web designer because after taking HTML, CSS, JavaScript classes I have found a strong interest in those subjects.  In winter break I also took one web designing class called AngularI think this class is one of the requirements that is needed to complete my major. I think even though my major is computer science still physics is required because of the physics concept and its few principles. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2479,"My goals are to catch up in all my classes since i am very far behind and to start learning the material to prepare for my midterms. I have been struggling to manage my time efficiently and haven't been able  to keep up with the deadlines for most of my assignments because I have barely started learning the material this past week. It has made class and my life very stressful but this week I did 3 whole chapter assignments for my physics class and am almost caught up which has made my schedule a little less hectic and allowed me to get back on track. Unfortunately, I will be having eye surgery this Tuesday and I do not know how long it will take to recover and it makes me very stressed out. I don't wanna fall behind again, but have a feeling I might. I have 2 midterms coming into two weeks and am scared I will fail since I have only had about 2-3 weeks to learn the material because of Covid-19, while all the other kids have had at least 6 weeks. I am very thankful to both my physics professors who have been very understanding but everyone else has been really hard to deal with."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2475,"My goals are to become an engineer that has something to do with technology, whether it's in the field of research and development or computer engineering. This class may help in my general understand of how different forces interact with each other in different circumstances. It is beneficial to understand the relation between electric charges, and other concepts such as flux.  These will help me if I were to go into a field of research for developing new methods of measuring these types of phenomena. General physics si good to understand in general."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2473,"My academic goals are to graduate and get my bachelors degree in computer science. On top of that I want to be able to get as much experience in my field and net work with people who are on a similar path as me so I have a more secure future in my career and field. This class helps me reach my  academic goal of graduating and getting my bachelors degree in computer science as this class is a required class to take in the degree. This class also emphasizes in problem solving and teamwork. Problem solving is a big aspect of computer science as, I have experienced before, coding a desired application requires a lot of thought process on how to reach what the client wants and how their wishes can be achieved in the cheapest and cleanest way. Teamwork is another big aspect of computer science as there's a lot of communication that will be involved in jobs when working on big projects. The more comfortable I get with working with others and establishing my role within a group, the easier my future will feel when working with others. All in all, this class is a great help in my degree and field. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2469,"My goal is to became a software engineer. A lot of physical modeling can be done in computer programs. Physics is based on creating mathematical pictures of the way the universe works. Physics really builds on the logic that is integral to computer science. Computer hardware (which is generally based on semiconductor physics)Large scale simulationsPhysics of computation (Quantum computing, reversible computing, etc.)Theoretical computer science etc.            "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2477,"When it comes to my personal goals, I believe my day to day one is to pass this semester in all of my classes. Considering that I am taking Physics along with this class, this class should make learning the different topic in the main course easier and more palatable.   My long-term goal is to obviously graduate with my bachelors in Computer Science. The Computer Science director and higher ups have decided that Physics is necessary for use to learn programming and the algorithms attached to those. Since that is what has been decided I assume learning the concepts in this course will aid me in programming and in future classes.   My ultimate goal is to become a Game developer. When creating a programming a world for players to interact with I imagine having an understanding of Physics and the world around me will greatly aid in creating these worlds. All of these reasons are why I am here and am sure that this course will aid me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2472,My main goal is to get my Bachelor's degree in computer science hopefully by the next semester if everything goes right.  This class helps me in completing my missing requirements.   I'm working way harder than before in every class to make it through. because all of this pandemic isn't helping in focusing to study.  it affecting me in health wise to but I have to go through it.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2459,"For me personally, this class is a stepping stone for my career. I do need to pass this class to be able to successfully go towards my next classes and continue to strive towards a bigger goal. But learning and working with others will help me be proactive towards being more social and working with others to achieve this goal of mine. I feel it's an important skill and idea to know as I personally have heard, that cooperating with your peers and others is a huge part of one's success. I try and put myself out there so that I may be able to help others if they need it or so I can receive the help of others if I need it. I want to be able to learn as much as I can and take what I learned into my future. My goal is to be able to land a job and this class will hopefully help me reach that."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,1070,My goals are to make an energy source that has a better recycling of energy that can't be found anywhere else. Physics helps me in a lot of different ways. I can learn much more about how things work and how it would affect my battery that I would be making. I hope to learn something useful in this class.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2467,I am trying to become a software engineer. Engineering needs a lot of logic and problem solving skills and this class provides this. I also think this class will make me a lot more knowledgeable and understand everything that goes on around me. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2471,"My goal is to get a job about my major which is computer science, I personally very like this major, and i take this class because it is my requirement of my major class. in order to get more progress on my major , i need to pass this crouse.And to pass this class, i need to pay more attention when we are having the lecture, and also to the lab toughtfully.So that i could learn what i need to know.those days i try to make a plan about what i should learn at what time hope i could have a good progress for that. And hopefully i will pass this class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2461,"my goals for this class are simple, but difficult to achieve. what i want to do it gain as much knowledge as possible from this class and use it advance in my educational career. Before i stared this class i had very limited knowledge of physics. I am good a math and almost everything that relates to it, but physics has just a vast range of topics and formulas to understand that at times it can be overwhelming. Not only does one have to understand the concept, but also exactly what the question is asking. Every question is a world problem and at times it can be confusing with  the wording and finding out exactly what needs to be done in which way. By the end of this class i hope that i have the knowledge and the understanding that i need to understand more difficult classes that wait ahead. My ultimate goal is to be the best computer scientist i could be and this is one of the many stepping stones i have had to take in order to get to that finish line and then i can finally rest."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,1079,"My goals are to graduate on time. I am currently having a hard time in every class at the moment trying to focus on assignments and understand the lectures. I hope this week I can improve more. I currently just had a death in the family as well as attended a funeral last Sunday. I don't want to let that hold me down. I really want to be successful in this class because the topics actual intrigue me and allow me to learn certain things that happen in my daily life. I feel like studying at home is so challenging as well. I find it difficult to make study friends and just communicate with people outside a classroom setting. I like the groups because they are constant and hopefully easy to talk to. I am hoping to do better after having constant groups because they last couple groups I had, I found it difficult to work with them. I found myself doing most of the work while others just talked rather than inputted a reasonable answer. "
