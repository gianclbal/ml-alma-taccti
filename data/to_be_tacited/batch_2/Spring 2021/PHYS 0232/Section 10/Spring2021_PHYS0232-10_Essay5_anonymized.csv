2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2479,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that working as a group makes things a lot easier. This class was not easy and having covid at the start sucked because I fell behind. I never really had a group to do the labs with so I always struggled to do them by myself. This is why I tried to ask you questions because I was always a bit confused. It wasn't until like week 8 when I was put into the group with terry that the labs became a lot easier. Whenever I needed help or felt confused I would always ask terry and we would workout how to solve it and even though it was just the two of us it helped a lot. But the biggest takeaway I took relating to physics was by far learning about how physics works in real life. I had never really thought of how physics worked in real life like lightbulbs and circuits, or blow dryers and microwaves."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,1070,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that I have been given the ability to know more about how physics work. Especially on electricity, voltage, and circuits. I enjoyed the professor a lot also. He was a good lecturer and made everything a lot more understandable. My greatest takeaway from this class is that anything can be made understandable when you are doing all kinds of experiments with it. My last lab class didn't go into this much detail and I am happy to say that I learned a lot from this."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2464,"The biggest take away from this class was how amazing electromagnetic fields are, how I have been using them, and seeing them without realizing it. How this fields are there but are invisibles; it amazes me how this little fact about electromagnetic fields really open my mind on how things around us work, such light bulbs appliances, etc. also now i understand why batteries have a long life span, with their capacitors and capacitance and how they are able to hold on to that charge for a long period of time, which before i never knew, what was going on inside the battery, how the charge of energy flows through it when use on remote controllers making them function, how this fields interact with us, and we don’t even know, and how we can generate a current with such little amount of materials. Overall electromagnetism is an amazing invisible thing, that has made the world a better place."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2478,"The greatest take away from this class was understanding how to problem solve difficult equation and breaking them down to relations of other equations. I also enjoyed understanding the battery and circuit because its useful in understanding how circuit carry energy from one place to another. The circuit helps brings energy to different places and we can limit the amount of current passing through. Thus, having a strong understanding of circuits could use items that are powered as resistors and reduce the potential problems in that. Circuit could also be used to explain water flow as well. Water moves like a current where it can change when we make the flow stop or slowed down. The circumference of the pipe is one way to reduce water from flowing too fast. Understanding concepts allows us to make changes in our world and makes helps people understand how the world works. Thanks to these concepts that we are able to make things like our cell phone and laptops."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2474,"My greatest takeaway from this class has been an ability to understand how the physics is applied in our everyday life. Before taking this physics lab I never really care about how we are using physics in everything we do and in every object without knowing. The labs that we did in class, like charge, electric field short circuit, Electromagnetic, etc helped me understand how the electric charge and magnetic work. It helped me understand how the electricity or current flows through the objects."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2475,"My greatest takeaway from this class is an overall better knowledge of relatively general physics concepts. It is difficult to determine a singular takeaway from this class, there are many concepts and ideas that were presented that will be very helpful in the future to understand.  I think many of the electrical concepts such as voltage and magnetic fields will be beneficial for me in the future as a computer engineer major.  Those are the big takeaways and there are many smaller things that I have learned through this course as well, such as how to construct a circuit or make a compass.  All of these general knowledge things are good knowledge for the future."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2463,"My greatest takeaway from this class is collaboration, communication, and reliability. This is because we've done a lot of group work and had to network, talk, and trust people to get something done for assignments. I think it's very interesting, being that we're virtual, because people are really trying their best to be present and to participate. I enjoyed my group mates thus far and trust them when it comes to collaborating or asking for help. This major tends to mold us into anti-social people who don't like to support each other and kind of leave people to figure it out; however, during this pandemic, I've formed more relationships with those in my major than I did in person. I hope to continue these relationships and take classes with others, so that we can all help each other pass our classes and graduate. This class and the pandemic has been such an eye opener and I appreciate the teachers for putting up with teaching virtually and to the students, for doing their best."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2462,"The greatest takeaway from this class was staying focused throughout the weeks. With it being online it was harder to be consistent since you get distracted a lot easier and it didn't feel as serious as in person classes. I was able to keep up with all the assignments and turn them in on time, which was good for me. I enjoyed the simulation labs because that made it easier to understand some of the topics that were a bit more confusing. Some of the weeks that were a bit more annoying were when we had to get our own supplies. Most of the time I had the right supplies, but when there is something I don't have it can be annoying t go out and get. If the class were in person this would all be fixed though. Overall, the experience of the class was good especially for how it had to be all online."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2470,"My greatest takeaway from this class is the fact that the society that we live in relies heavily on electronic and magnetic fields and forces. If we can learn to have a basic understanding of these and their applications, we can be better suited to understanding the world around us. Learning about EM waves can keep us informed about radiation, light, or electronic communication, or learning about circuits can help us understand basic repairs for electric devices in a car or a house. Many things like how computer speakers create sounds, how wireless charging works, or even how microwaves heat up food are all topics that a curious mind would ask. Topics like those are all answered in this class and I am glad that I was able to take Physics 2 to better understand the world around me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2465,"I like the part that you have options for assignments, showing of content, student options for responding, and set due dates. I am happy though that I have another option for blended learning that works better and is more student learning-friendly for low-level learners I don't think this will work, so I'm glad I have other options. I think it will be a great platform where teachers can not only engage students in learning with technology but also track students. I think it is a good way to get away from paper and to use technology in the classroom. I was a bit concerned about setting the classes up because it seems time-consuming. Online learning can provide a lot more information than just the specific content of a course. Overall the course opened my eyes to how much you can do in Physics that can make teaching a multi-level course much more fluid and successful."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2467,My greatest take away from this class was problem solving. I am majoring in computer science so problem solving is a huge aspect in the field. I learned how to think critically and use logic to answer questions. I learned how to picture the problems first before answering them and not just memorizing any random equations and solve right away. I learned how to understand the problems so that they can make sense to me. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2476,I really enjoyed the hands on experimentation we had with this lab. having done all my learning remotely it was nice to be able to interact with other students and participate something together. Making an electromagnet is something I can definitely see myself doing in the future to show other people cool things. I am also really looking forward to the lab where we measure the speed of light. I was fortunate to get a good lab group that interacts and works together. I know most of the people in the class weren't as fortunate a lot of people leave and complete the labs on their own. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,138,The topics we learned in this class was really interesting and I really understood the logic behind every experiment that we did. The main thing I learned was how to do the experiment online by using simulation.  That was something new and interesting to me. It was fun doing that. Really liked your class.  
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2459,"I learned a lot from this class. I don't know much of how to use what I learned to be honest, but there are many interesting concepts I have gained. It is a difficult time and learning was hard, but overall it was enjoyable in terms of this class. The actual experiments themselves were interesting and felt engaging. I met with some nice people who helped me out, and the professor was nice and extremely helpful when needed. The class itself is a physics class, and i'm not great at physics, but it was built that I could be able to take in what was being taught. I don't have much to say, but I can say that I did enjoy what this class had to offer."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2472,"My biggest takeaway from this is to love in groups and individuals.  I love doing work for Lab class because most of the time it helps me to learn more about the main PHYS class.  I feel independent when I do work in this class. because due to Ramadan, I had issues joining the class and since we are taking a class on zoom so I have a chance to see recordings for that specific day."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2473,"The greatest take away from this class was how to problem solve and keep my information organized. During many labs we were put in situations where we had to organize our work in a way to understand the concept better. This has helped me organize my work better for my general physics work and has enhanced my learning to understand concepts that were gone over in class and in the labs. This lead to my problem solving becoming better because as long as I had all my information on hand and organized it correctly, then the solution process is easier. Another great take away is how to team work with labs or assignments. From assigning roles to breaking up work, we all manage to find a way to put in our efforts so we can build off each other and understand concepts better. These are the things that I have taken away from this class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2466,I learned that you don't need fancy equipment to complete experiments. There are plenty of experiments that are simulations online or adapted for at home equipment making it a lot easier to learn about new topics or to see abstract ideas such as electric currents and magnetic fields. You should also be careful around exposed wires. You can make your own wires and compasses.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2469,"My biggest take away from this class is that I learnt a lot about practical physics and it use in our daily life, how the world work. Collaborating with the classmates, great use of technology learning labs online, the main was moving class to paperless. This class was especially helping learning adding task and the major was group discussion. I really liked the way they teach the class it was easy understanding and helpful making our assignments easy to solve and understand at first moment. It seem a great resource for online learning. The class was always interesting however the amount of information provided was great and very useful. This class made learn about more group discussion as our most of the assignments were based upon this and made a good impact on my educational life. The Class was amazing a lots of information to take away at the end.   "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2458,"PHY 232-10 was a remarkable and amazing experience for me during the whole semester and it was a lesson for me how can experiments be performed online and can overcome the problems of not getting to the physicals lab in this pandemic. I learn how to be patient and meticulous when obtaining observations and drawing inferences through experiments conducted in Physics laboratories. In Physics, there are several protocols for various experiments, as well as some fundamental laboratory behavioral standards. Controlling additional variables, improving measurement methodology, increasing randomization to avoid sample bias, blinding the experiment, and adding control or placebo groups can all help to improve the validity of experiments. I think this was a great experience for the professor and also for the students in their day-to-day life. After the end of the lab, the summary and feedback were the most lovable thing for me as it provides me to get calm after a lot of studies and I could relieve my stress in that particular section of the week. Thank You, Soo, much Mr. Yatrik sir for taking out class during the whole semester it was super cool studying from you and you are a good professor and hope you have the greatest days in the upcoming year. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2461,out of the about 14 labs we have had this semester there was been a lot of new information i can learned a lot. We have done everything form short circuits all the way to magnetic interactions and many other topics in between. I was glad that a lot of the math that we needed for this class was nothing knew to me in terms of the calculus we had to use for a few of the labs we did. My greatest take away from this class would have to be my greatly increased knowledge of general physics for every day tasks and just basic knowledge about the physics around us. For example if someone had some trouble setting up  something to battery i can be of some help now that i understand how the current and voltage would travel through the battery and into the wires and in turn into the machine it is suppose to be powering up.
