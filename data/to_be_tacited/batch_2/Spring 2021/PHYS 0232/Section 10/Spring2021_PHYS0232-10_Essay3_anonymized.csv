2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2472,"I'll try to make it short, so in past weeks, we learned a lot about currents, flux, and so on.  I would give examples from the very current such as current which is very useful in our daily life.  I mean everything depends on electricity if there is no electricity then we're going to be in trouble nowadays.  Every appliance, laptop, phones, house, and even cars need electricity to charge when there is not current then it's going to be trouble for all of us."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2473,"In week 6 we had a short circuit lab that had a question ""Why do you think the sliver combusts?"" after completing the lab experiment with the batteries, tape, and aluminum foil. Looking at this question, which so happens to also relate a bit with week 7's ""Current"" lab, the small piece of foil that was cut up for the experiment of making it combust with our handmade wires worked because of how the electricity and electrons flowed from the batteries, to the wires, to the small piece of aluminum foil. From this week, we can see that it would have combust because as we saw that electrons flowed from the lightbulb to the battery to the wires and back to the lightbulb again to continue the cycle, the same happened with our week 6's lab in which it was a small piece of aluminum foil instead of a lightbulb. So, the silver combustion worked because the currents went to the foil and since  it was a smaller area compared to how much charge and voltage there was, it overwhelmed the small piece of aluminum foil and combusted. This all worked because of the positive and negative signs connecting correctly, allowing the flow of electrons to flow correctly which helped make that current towards the small piece of aluminum foil. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,1079,"a concept that we discussed in class was short circuits. The discussion helped me understand circuits and help me build my own circuits for my home projects, I was having difficulty doing some wearable tech using mechanical thread. I later found the I needed more battery power and how to create a parallel circuit to maximize the amount of power. I also learned how to use switches. this class is helping me learn and actually apple it to things at home. I am glad I am taking this class and it is helping me learn more about electric currents. I enjoy learning about the way currents can be manipulated and how to get the currents to LED lights as well as finding what the voltage is on the wire that the current is passing through. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2465,"What are the two types of current used today? First of all let's start with what actually electricity is, it is a form of energy that makes heat and light. Electricity may also be referred to as electrical energy. Electricity begins with the atom and atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Electricity is created when an outside force causes electrons to move from atom to atom. The flow of electrons is called an electrical current. Voltage being an outside force causes electrons to move. Voltage is potential energy. There are two types of current we use today, static and current electricity. Static electricity occurs when there is an imbalance of positively and negatively charged atoms. Electrons then jump from atom to atom, releasing energy. Examples of static electricity are lightning and rubbing your feet on the carpet and then touching a doorknob. And current electricity is a constant flow of electrons. There are two kinds of current electricity, direct current and alternating current. With direct current, electrons move in one direction. Batteries produce direct current. In alternating current, electrons flow in both directions. Power plants produce AC electric current. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2461,"Throughout the semester I have found every lab useful in and always learn something new. If i had to choose one concept i that would be the most applicable to peoples lives it would be the concept of current. This what is used almost everyday by everyone around the world. It is what provides us with  heat, cool air, water, light, and many more things we use in our everyday live. Current does not give us that directly,  but current is what makes the machines move and light bulbs turn on. with out current we would be living in the dark, in the cold, and probably eating cold and uncooked meat. What I found very useful from the lab was the little conductor we made with the series of batteries and the aluminum foil because that is also a way to make  fire  if  one is ever stranded without any access to fire and just has batteries. To benefit society we always better understand current by making stronger batteries to hold more current, but in reality the possibilities are endless. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2474,"In our Physics lecture class and in lab, we have covered how the electric fields work. How the charge from one object to another object can travel. For example, if the object A is positive and object B is neutral (it has same amount of positive and negative charge) the charged and neutral object would attract towards each other. Example of objects that can be positive and neutral could be a charged piece of tape and neutral pen, where both tape and pen would attract toward each other."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2463,"One concept that was covered in the class within the past few weeks was electricity and electric current. One question I have from it is what are possible reasons that the lights in a person's house don't turn on. There can be many reasons as to why the lights don't turn on, such as broken or open circuits or incorrect wiring, no power from external circuits, or you're flipping the wrong switch. From one of the labs, we learned that an open circuit is a circuit that is not closed, meaning the path for electricity is not complete. This cuts off the current which results in no electricity. Another reason a light may not turn on is the lack of power from external circuits. This is something I remember, but I'm not sure if we covered it. Basically, there needs to be a connection between a house and external power, such as windmills, to power up a house. If there's no more power, the lights don't turn on and this can be a result of not paying bills or maybe a mishap with the windmills. Lastly, another reason the light won't turn on could be due to flipping the wrong switch. This is more of a funnier reason, but it could be possible that the wires are not connected to the switch that you're flipping and you need to try others. This can be applicable to everyone because everyone has encountered light in one way or another, from their houses and schools to buildings and auditoriums. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2477,"When looking at how electricity passes from and through one object to another, one might wonder just how does this work? Is it magic? Do magnets have anything to do with it? Well let we work to explain the curious phenomena.   Everything has one of three possible charges. Positive, Negative, or no charge. Based off of those they all interact with one another in many different ways. Some if they are both positive or both negative they will repel one another. If they have opposing charges, they will be attracted to one another. Now you might be wondering what this has to do with electricity. Well we’re getting to that.  When you get a battery and connect a metal wire to both the positive and negative sides to something like a light bulb or an electronic this creates a circuit. Is this circuit is maintained this will cycle the electricity throughout both the battery and the electronic. This is how a lot of out life is powered and continues to be."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2478,"I guess one thing I wanted to ask question was whether current or voltage is effected by the resistor or fuse in a circuit. In our lab we tested the current of the circuit to see if it would burn the tin foil. Because we had 3 batteries attached, it had enough voltage to be converted into current so that the in foils initial resistance wouldn't be able to stop the current from passing through. This led to us understanding how fuses worked because it allowed us to reduce the amount of current passing through a object because it would break and cut off the circuit. This kind of breaking is important because it allows us to protect people from dying. People die from the currents because the objects could fail and end up causing our electricity to come flying out. We saw this as sparks in the tin foil. Having the knowledge allows us to use fuses to protect our objects and people from harm. Circuits are used in everything we can see from wiring of electricity to devices and microwave. Circuits is important in making objects that requires electricity. Without circuits, I wouldn't know how people would make compact design that fits in our pockets."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2468,"Current flows from the - terminal of the battery to the bulb, and back to the + terminal of the battery. And series circuits are designed so that the current through each component is the same, whereas parallel circuits are designed so that the voltage through each component is the same."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2470,"Learning about voltage, current, and resistance has helped me in an interesting way. I work at a hardware store, where our electrical department has a lot of potentially dangerous items if wired the wrong way. Learning about current and voltage and how they are related has not only helped me understand the electrical side of building materials, but also their application in the wiring in buildings and homes, as well as appliances."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2458,"While I would like to talk about the class lab of current where the resistors are placed in the circuit and why resistor plays a certain role in the current flow and how can different resistors shows there resistivity at different points. Connect the 2.7k resistor to the power supply in series with the digital multimeter (DMM1) used as an ampere meter. Place the other digital multimeter (DMM2) parallel to (across) the resistor and set it to measure volts (see figure 1). Set the power supply to 0.5V, measure and observe the results on the instrument displays. Vary the voltage from the power supply from 0.5 to 6V and write down the voltage and current from 8 different measurements. and try to make a graph of the voltage as a function of the current. Calculate the resistance based on the graph. Hence by this demonstration, we can say Ohm's Law deals with the relationship between voltage and current in an ideal conductor. This relationship states that: The potential difference (voltage) across an ideal conductor is proportional to the current through it. The constant of proportionality is called the ""resistance"", R. This can be expressed in an equation as V=IR and can be manipulated to find the other two variables."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,140,"Circuits are responsible for a lot of great inventions in society. They can be as simple as batteries powering  a light bulb or the circuitry in our computers. More and more as we move into the future circuits are going to improve to allow for bigger amounts of electricity to provide faster, powerful performance in computers or lights. We use circuits in modern society for almost everything, such as charging the lights in our houses, powering the heaters in our rooms, powering and allowing us to use our devices. It was a great technological advancement discovering circuits and how they work. To the other students I discussed this with say it is a great benefit to society. That circuits have an everyday use in our lives. Circuits lead to computers will soon lead to assisted living such as AI's like SIRI or Alexa so further advanced AI. The more complex technology gets the more complex circuits will be. I asked what is a common circuit we all use and they said in our lighting we use in our rooms, in order to turn it on we use the switch to turn it on and to turn it off we flip the switch which disconnects the path of electricity flow. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2475,"A concept that was covered in this class is the connection between electric fields and how charges interact with each other and the environment.  I think this applies to everyday life in a meaningful manner because we are able to study this in everyday life, it is present all the time.  This can be applied to many situations such as how batteries or circuits in a piece of technology work, or how electric fields are present on the planet.  Although it is a relatively basic knowledge of this concept, the fundamental knowledge can be applied to much more complex applications."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2459,"A lot of the work done can be applicable in many jobs. While not much of this can be put into an everyday thing, stuff like this can help people think more about what they want to do and go further. Such as electricians or go into physics to get a better understanding to help further research and find new things we may not yet understand. I feel like a main concept has to do with maybe the wires. Having a basic understanding of how wires work may seem simple and small, but can allow a person to learn more. I have seen many people create things with these type of understandings, and while it is not beneficial to all it is beneficial to some which I believe is a great way to change someone's life. Honestly from here I do not understand much from what much experience that this one topic can have. It is a influential subject, but my understanding feels limited."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2464,"the information from past classes is helpful because electricity and current is everywhere in the world and with this knowledge, we can achieve more things and get closer to produce a massive amount of clean energy, that can help the world and benefits us as a race, in terms of making the planet a better place to live and with the knowledge of the current, and how electric flows with the capacitors and increases and decreases with the adding of a resistance, light with the light bulbs it will get more flows of current  the closer they are to the source or the more current they receive, it is possible that society can use this to make more things that take this concept into account as they have for many years, but now with more experiments and proven theorem things can become much better and we can advance in the technological aspects and eventually even achieve impossible things such as light speed travel, which it is currently impossible for the human race. But with studies and new concepts that derive from study if current and electricity new hypothesis can be made and proven to achieve what we as humans want to travel the galaxy."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2467,"How do velocity and acceleration relate? This is one of the things we discussed and was most interesting to me when we did it in lab. We realized that if velocity is changing then it has an acceleration but if it is not changing then it has no acceleration because in order for velocity to change, the object must have acceleration. It seemed very confusing at first but this is how it is. We also learned that free falling objects all have the same acceleration regardless of their mass which is gravity. We always thought that acceleration of heavier objects is more but turns out that acceleration due to gravity is never changing. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2479,We have learned a lot of really useful information but one that I personally thought related a lot to real life and could be really useful was learning about voltage  in parallel and series circuits. This was because I thought it was really cool that putting objects in parallel meant that the total voltage of the circuit would also increase because of it and it could help bring a higher and equal voltage to all of the objects in the parallel circuit. It was also cool to find out that this is how most of the appliances are set up in your house to allow for the voltage to be the same in all the wall jacks and so on. Also understanding how resistance works in the circuits felt like it could be useful as well since the resistance in parallel is a lot smaller than the resistance in series. For example adding resistance for series is R=R1+R2 but for parallel its R=1/R1+1/R2. Which when you look at this it makes sense why there is so much potential difference for parallel instead. I think no matter what you end up doing in life it would be useful to know how circuits work incase you want to remodel your house.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2469,"Potential energy is the stored energy an object has because of its position or state. A bicycle on top of a hill, a book held over your head, and a stretched spring all have potential energy. The standard unit for measuring potential energy is the joule, which is abbreviated as ""J."" Potential energy is stored energy while kinetic energy is the energy of motion. When potential energy is used it is converted into kinetic energy. You can think of potential energy as kinetic energy waiting to happen.We can compare potential and kinetic energy by considering a car on a hill. When the car is at the top of the hill it has the most potential energy. If it is sitting still, it has no kinetic energy. As the car begins to roll down the hill, it loses potential energy, but gains kinetic energy. The potential energy of the position of the car at the top of the hill is getting converted into kinetic energy. Types of Potential Energy- Elastic, Electric, Nuclear, Chemical."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2462,"One topic that we talked about earlier was charges. A question that came to my mind was, what would life be like without electricity and charges? We talked about it and saw that there are a lot of things that use electricity that would really affect our daily lives. We wouldn't have our computers to do school work, refrigerators to keep our food good, we wouldn't have lightbulbs. Life would just be very difficult if we had to do things without electricity. I think a lot of people take advantage how much we use electricity and the internet. Society keeps progressing and I think it mainly has to do with electricity. Charges allowed us to get to this point in society and as long as we keep it up, we can keep creating new inventions and progressing society.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2476,"If a chicken had lips, could it whistle?Gorillas have lips and they do not whistle, however there are lots of birds which don't have lips and can whistle. Nerf footballs only whistle when they fly.Chickens are flightless birds therefore they can not whistleQ.E.D."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2466,"We recently learned about the purpose, function, and how to make a short circuit. This is very useful information. Not for everyday life but for emergencies. As long as you have a battery and some wire it is very easy to create a short circuit in a pinch. Or when working with live cables such as when jump starting a car it is very important to know how short circuits work to be safe. Always attach the positive cable first and to never let the positive and negative cables touch in any situation. The touching of the positive and negative cables/wires can and will lead to fires. Not only can the source be damaged but you as well."
