Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2458,"The STEM field is known as science, technology, engineering, and math for the world. Today we can measure time, can travel, have access to the new technology, made our work easier, and this only possible because of people working in STEM fields. A field where a lot of opportunities come from one place whether it could be stocks or way to Mars. All those need science and technology to work. The world's most demandable electric car known as Tesla works all based on science which is environment free and comfortable for many people. I liked to go into the STEM field to make my work abilities more convenient. Technology always gave me a new way to think about the future and hence I would like to help the world with more convivence which makes the life of people easier and can work on the other stuff. Physics is there in everything even how the stock market and even a teacher writing on the board which only possible with the help of friction. I would like to work as a perfectional developer and hence I opted STEM field and which could help me to be more successful in my life. This field works based on the mind and not based on gender or color or caste. Technology is never-ending, and it won’t stop. It will increase in a more double way than now as many people now want to work in the stem field."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,1079,"I have always wanted to be in the stem field since I was younger. As a child I was groomed to be a housewife that was meant to be a wife and stay at home. I knew right away that I did not want that. I grew up with my grandma who has totally different ideals and views. When I mentioned that I wanted to go to college she was upset. She told me I should be focusing on having a family but in my mind, how can I have a family when I cant even provide? Later I started to realize I would have disobey my family and go against their ideals. I felt alone going forward with education and to this day I still do. I want to graduate with a stem degree to make myself proud and feel accomplished. I knew computers matched my interest when I created my first website. I found the structure, and process interesting and complicated which I liked. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2459,"I wanted to go into stem mainly because of my interest in computer science. I'm not that great at stuff like physics and math, but I've grown to appreciate it more and learn different methods to be able to solve it. So I never really was too interested in a STEM field, but I feel my path has lead me here and I'm honestly enjoying it. But for why I originally went into, again it was mainly due to my growing interest in computer science from high school as I took many side classes, and honestly, it's a well-paying job. I don't feel like I have much attachment to any other type of majors, and I find it hard to find interest in other subjects. So when I can manage to attach myself to something it's hard to let go. That's why i'm following computer science all the way through, and this attachment has lead me to the Stem field which I grow to appreciate and know more about everyday."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2460,"I want to go into STEM firstly because I really enjoy computer science, especially web development. I also want to go into this field because there are barely any women of color in tech and this really shows in the outcomes of software and other projects that come out of tech. Racism is a huge thing that is very evident in algorithms (for example facial recognition and hospital health insurance systems) and this is because of the lack of people of color in the field. I want to help change this and contribute to a future in tech less plagued by racism and that is much more diverse and people of all colors and nationalities know that there is a place in tech for them. I also want to go into this field because tech is ever so evolving and new things come out of it everyday. I want to be involved with these changes and use tech for the good of my community. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2461,"I have always found technology fascinating as a kid and I would always make things out of sticks and whatever i could find around to make something new that i could play with. As i got older i got into videogames a lot and wanted to make one of my own someday. That's why got interested in programming and got into the field of computer science. Now that i am grown up i find programming very interesting and just want to know how i could be the best programmer and create something amazing. I have seen in the past  how people my age or younger have been able to make something  great and have a big impact on the world. I was not born with the smarts needed for this, but I have climbed all the way from the bottom to where i am now and the goal is to some day soon see a Bachelors degree  with my name on it. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2462,"I want to go into the stem field because I felt it was what I was good at. Math in school seemed to be the easiest for me and engineering was something that I felt I was into and could be good at. The stem field allows me to pursue something that I am good at and also something I can enjoy doing for years down the road. I found computer engineering interesting so I decided to go with that as my major to pursue. I never found english or any of those subjects fun or amusing, so the stem courses was always something for me. I always enjoyed building things and engineering fit that perfectly. Hopefully I will keep enjoying and am able to find a job within the stem field."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,138,"My major is Computer Science. The reason I am in that field because I really like coding specifically in Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I am more interested in web development. I like making websites, apps. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2463,"I want to go into the STEM field to be different. Not many people in my culture get into tech, they typically go into medicine. As a woman, it's rare to be in the sciences and I hope to change that for future generations. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2464,"I like to get into STEM because it is where the future lays and the way the world is moving it will play a big part in our evolution and knowing that is a big part of astronomy which is very interesting in knowing the universe and how the black holes work and if we can ever achieve light speed in our lifetime, and how to measure light-years and the vast measurements that the galaxy is made of. We can continue the work of prior Astronomers and improve their hypotenuse to get more concrete answers to things they have been working on for years. Since the universe is so massive, we can continue to improve our ways of communicating with life forms that are out there and we can make contact with other races and maybe even make our experiment and get a break thru in the Astronomy field, and finally, answer the question, are we alone in the universe"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2465,"Studying and working in STEM means learning about the world around you, finding innovative solutions to real-world challenges, and playing a role in some of the country's major discoveries and developments. I'll have these opportunities and more in STEM."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2466,"I always had a pull towards math and science, and I always liked it better than English and history. I had my first experience with code when I was fourteen and I really liked it. I took classes and now I'm majoring in Computer Science. It has its own languages and cultures, it's a beautiful topic really. It's a new frontier worth exploring. Especially with the new research done in artificial intelligence and the creation of neural networks far better than our own. Code has so many different applications, it's a world of its own. By just learning one subject, I have access to so many career opportunities. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2467,"I am a computer science major and I am in the STEM field because I like science and I like math. I am very passionate about computer science and I want to keep growing and understanding more and becoming a better programmer. You get to live and work on the cutting edge. STEM professionals are aerospace engineers, civil engineers, astronomers, software developers, roboticists, computer scientists, materials scientists, food scientists, physicists and chemists, as well as science and math teachers, among many others. Each of these occupations is pushing our understanding of the universe and literally building the future. Also in the stem field, you can count on job security because of the growing demand on those fields. I also likesolving problems and using logic in order to find solutions. STEM fields require the use of logic and involves a lot of thinking and I like the challenge. I also learn transferable skills that can be used in anything in life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2468,"I want to go into the STEM field because I want to get to know about how machines work basically. And gain my knowledge about science. I think science is pretty cool especially physic, I so admire the people who create cars, robots, and those such of things."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2469,"I decided to go into stem field because I was more interested in computers and I chose my major as computer science, Stem field also has more opportunities of work and applicable in real world and in today's modern world everything is made from this field.Studying and working in STEM means learning about the world around you, finding innovative solutions to real-world challenges, and playing a role in some of the country's major discoveries and developments. STEM activities provide hands-on and minds-on lessons for the student. Making math and science both fun and interesting helps the student to do much more than just learn. It involve's Critical thinking, Problemsolving, Communication, Innovation. it’s been predicted that 75 per cent of all jobs will require Stem skills over next decade."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2470,"“Why did I choose to go to the STEM field?”	When I was growing up, my dad worked from home.  He would always be working on his laptop at his desk throughout the day and night, and whenever I had questions about homework, I could always go and ask him.  Whenever I asked him about his work, he would try to explain in really simple terms when he could so that I could have an idea of what he does.  He is a contract computer programmer/consultant and he was always working on something.  I didn’t start programming until the beginning of high school, but it became my hobby.  Since my dad loved the idea of me going into Computer Science as well, he always encouraged me to keep learning especially if I got discouraged, and eventually I ended up really enjoying computer science and the STEM field.  I found out that I really enjoy building and creating things, whether it’s through programming or not."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2471,"My major is computer science, I choose this major because I think this major will help me to get a more bright future,get a well-paid job . And another thing is that personally I really like this major, in order to success in my major, not only that I need to learn more about my major, but also need to learn by myself along with my major class. since this is a really hard major.I need to be more force on my major so that I could actually success.During my last semester I have found that I was kind of struggle in my major class, I tried to fill my free time with some self- learning.At the beginning it was tough,but it only get better and better, now I get more used to it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2472,I actually don't want to but it would be awesome to go into STEM field who loved mostly like physics and biology side.  STEM require a lot of learning with high knowledge.  so best of luck who choose to go in STEM field.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2473,"The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is because of a variety of reasons but, in this essay, I will cover the main top 3 reasons why I want to join the STEM field, specifically Computer Science. For my first reason, I want to cover the financial reason as to why I want to go into computer science. Financially, computer scientists/programmers/web developers/etc. earn a lot of money. It is a very broad field where I could find a job in the majority of places, considering that technology is being incorporated into everything. My second reason is that computer science (or STEM in general) is very interesting. Computer science is a great field of problem solving with the great help of creativity. I am a very creative soul and I thrive of creating things that could help others or have others see. I really want to be a part of something that helps a big group of people in some shape or form. Computer science can do that in the form of applications, software, creating websites, and the list goes on. For my third and last reason, I feel proud of myself for going into a field that needs more women, in which thankfully, the group of women are growing. This concludes my main reasons of joining the STEM field and majoring in computer science. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2474,"I have always been interested in Technology and how it works. In high school I was in my first IT class, where my interest piqued when we created a game using a program called Sketch and then started to learn coding and programming a robot to move from point A to point B. The STEM field a great field to bring out innovative ideas, which is very interesting to me and I want to innovate something that could be useful to other in making their everyday life easier. It is also a great field for me to use critical thinking to solve problems. In today’s world STEM field is in every field no matter if you are in Software engineering, civil engineering, Astronomy, Robotics, Scientist, physicist, etc. There is a new job getting available every day. In this fields there is always something new that is getting innovated and always get to learn new information that could advance my knowledge. I think STEM field could be great field anyone who is interested in technology and science like me to bring out new innovative ideas."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2475,I want to pursue a career in the STEM field because it is amazing to me how many new developments happen in this field. New changes occur in so many parts of it such as medicine or technology or new discoveries in science. It is one of the fastest developing fields in the current world and it constantly evolves and it is interesting how much is achieved over just a couple years of time. I want to be in the workforce that continuously creates new discoveries and advances in technology.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2476,I am a chemistry student here at SFSU. I like learning about our environment and how different ecological systems interact with each other. Molecules are totally rad. I transferred from environmental science to Chemistry and have always been interested in science. The learning process comes naturally to me because I find it interesting. I want to be able to get a job I enjoy whilst being able to make a good salary. In my free time I find myself watching chemistry videos on youtube. The interaction of molecules is something I find fascinating. I love being able to mix different things together and understand why there is a color change or why things start fuming and what components are changing. I hope to take my skills in a direction where I can help create a sustainable environment. Either by going in to analytical chem to test soil and make sure it is safe after industrial accidents or something. I would love to fight against companies who pollute. Either that or go in to electrochem and help design better batteries. If humans can learn to store energy better we can reduce greenhouse gasses.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2477,"When I was young, I always dreamed of designing video games. As I got older and older, I finally decided to make that dream a reality. I realized I lacked skill in drawing and making music so I would have to rely on my writing skills and my logic. I learned that many game designers learn programming to better help their designs and to optimize their games better. I decided this was the path I wanted to go down.  The STEM field is where programming lies and that is my reason for joining it. I have always been a logical person, so programming has always been relatively easy for me. My mathematics skills are also better developed so this has also helped me considerably. I plan to learn more and more from physics to better help my logic skills and to aid when I am programming a big world in my future games."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,1070,I want to go into a STEM field because of couple of reasons. One I want to become an electrical engineer. The reason for it is that I previously did not like my field which was physics. One of the reasons is that I want to help humanity go farther and better for the environment. The reasons for going into electrical engineering is that I want to help humanity go into a self sustaining energy source. Or a way to recycle energy to the point where there is no energy loss.
