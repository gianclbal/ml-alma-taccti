2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2476,"I have to make sure to take time throughout the day to do something that is not on my computer. If I have a new minutes between class sometimes I go for a walk. If the sun is out I make sure to get some vitamin d. Working and going to class on a computer is a lot. Sometimes I over work myself and need and get worn out. I like to take trips for example on spring break I went to Yosemite National Park. On Cesar Chaves Day I went to Henry Coe State park. I just moved to San Francisco a few months ago and now that I am starting to make some friends it is easier to get away from the computer. I am taking 17 credits and working, I knew what I was getting myself in to but it is necessary for me to graduate in a timely manner. The transfer system for CSUs suck eggs, pardon my french. I will be a little over worked until the end of the semester but it is ok."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,1070,Online classes have taught me a lot this semester and it was hard to get used to it at first. I was much more comfortable with this class than I was with the last physics class. This class has helped but I miss the social and physical aspects of the class. I have learned that even the best online class can't compete with an in-person class.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2458,"Online education has gained immense popularity among working professionals and students pursuing higher education. These categories of online learners find immense benefit in the autonomy and flexibility that these courses offer. Online courses can be planned around their schedule which may include full-time employment, internships and caring for family. Online learning can also help them take out some quiet time to study.Distance learning has been around for a long time, even before technology made it extremely accessible. Traditional schooling is now seeing an increased proliferation of virtual training materials and online courses. Even in a world of tried and tested schooling systems and curricula, the most successful schools are the ones who adapt to the changing times, as well as to the expectations of students, parents and the society. If online education is here to stay, then what are its implications for traditional learning? Instead of focusing on pros and cons, the conversation we should be having today is about leveraging online education to make our education systems more conducive to learning.Online courses call for a greater amount motivation and self-discipline than a classroom-based course. A classroom has one or more instructors and peers, who can hold a student accountable for their course-work. In contrast, online courses involve setting our own goals, tracking progress and meeting deadlines. One does not learn effectively in isolation so online courses do offer discussion forums, email and one-on-one support. Technology also adds on to the visual experience by incorporating animations that can be used interactively for effective learning and communication."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2479,"Online classes have honestly made life for me a lot harder. I was always the type of kid that would do their homework at school or in the library so i could get home and play video games. This has made me have to create new habits where I try to put my phone away while I'm doing homework and do it in the kitchen so I don't get distracted. My self care has been really bad, I have been eating a lot since I get bored at home and also have been ordering way too much Door dash. I gained like 20 pounds since the beginning of quarantine which is pretty sad because I used to be pretty active. I have now started to gym a lot more now since it gets me out of the house and I get to lose some of the pounds I have gained. All in all I am hoping we can get back into regular school, because I feel like I will start do a lot better in school again."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,1079,I feel like this semester has been really tough. Constantly having to move and work really takes a toll on my physical and well being. I find it hard to have motivation after a 12 hour work shift. But at the end of the day I want to graduate. I know I do not want to be left behind in school but I feel like this semester I have been. It is partly my fault but also somethings happened this semester that were out of my control. I need to focus on what I can control and what I can change I hope I can try my best to turn this semester around for all my classes but im afraid its too late.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2473,"During the beginning of the pandemic, online classes were not that bad for me. Once entering this semester it seems like online classes have felt the worse for me. I am majoring in computer science and even though my major heavily relies on computers and technology but I personally learn better in person. 8 am classes were already difficult in person but at least I put in the effort to get out of bed, get dressed, eat, wash my face, and get ready to commute to the university, this would then give me more than enough time to wake myself up. It was also really helpful to have people in class that are studying alongside me. Sadly, few to none ever turn on their cameras which makes it feel lonely. Office hours are difficult too because now people and overhear my question that I may be self conscious about. For self care, I have been making sure to journal, keep in contact with my friends, make sure to be present and practice mindfulness so I can help myself not over stress. One thing that would help a lot is to normalize turning cameras on or put people in groups better so I can work with other people, which makes learning a lot better and helps me meet people too even with the distance. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2477,"As the world has tried to adjust to COVID-19, many schools such as SFSU have moved over to a completely online format to accomidate. While this has definitely slowed the spread of the COVID-19 virus in many locations, it has also hampered the education process for a lot of teachers and students. Instead of having the hands on interactions that a lot of students crave and need to learn at their own rates they have been forced into isolation and made to stare at a computer screen to gain the education needed for their future.   While many have struggled with this, I have fully embraced the online aspects of learning. I finished my Associate’s online while I was in the military and this has more or less been a return to the status quo for me. While I am a bit upset that I am paying for a full in-person education for an online one, I am not struggling so far."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2461,Online classes in my opinion are actually better for me and it is also easier for me to get to class on time and ready. If We were in regular school then i would not be able to attend some classes because of the time. The down side of self learning is that it is very easy to get distracted by a lot things. It is also a different environment at home when it comes to studying because it is always better to be at school for that. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2467,Online class has been okay so far. It is just that I get too distracted when I attend lectures over zoom. Sometimes I have bad connection as well so it affects me sometimes that I can not listen to live lectures. The good thing about it is that all lectures are recorded so I can always go back and review. Being in class has a different feeling and makes me pay more attention. I have to study on my own sometimes just because I am not understanding very well online. My concern is that I want to be able to do things in person and see it especially physics I wanted to be able to do labs in person so that I would understand better. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2466,"Online learning has hurt and benefited me in many ways. I have a pretty long commute to campus, so it is a great time saver. I can sleep in, eat, have more time for home work. But then not a lot of teachers are used to online learning and even after a year, some still have trouble with zoom, and making sure all assignments are posted. Overall, the learning aspect is at a ""Mehh"" for me. For self care, I have started to take a full hour or two at the end of the week to simply relax, take a bath, pretty much just pamper my self (at-home-spa). I also started fictional reading in the evening to save my eyes from looking into more screens."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2462,"Online classes have made it a lot harder to stay focused on what you need to learn. When we have to go into class it forces you to pay attention to what is being taught and you are able to retain it easier, but when we are on zoom there are so many distractions at home. As for self care, I have been trying to work out more at home just to stay healthy. Im just concerned I wont be able to remember as much from these online classes as I would with in person. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2459,"Online classes have impacted many in different ways. For me, it was made harder. A lot of classes are difficult to learn from and many teachers fail to adapt to this new change. While I do not blame them, it feels as if some do not care to even attempt to adapt. In this class, we have many experiments where we have factors we may not be able to control, while it is at no fault of the professor(I want to emphasize that I do enjoy your class and believe you are trying your best!) many experiments where people cannot perform them properly come into play and may give unsatisfying results. But to help deal with this, I feel it's important to destress and relax when you can. Online classes can be rough, and some professors may make it tougher. But you can learn from this to grow and adapt. I personally learned to go outside where I can and just breathe and relax, as staying cooped in for so long can be extremely stressful. In terms of keeping track of all my work, scheduling out and writing down what work you may have can be helpful. I did work on that second part in the beginning but fell off and highly regret it. Online learning can be stressful, but I believe there are ways to combat it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2463,"Online classes have benefitted and been a disadvantage for me. We have more of a choice to attend classes, which is nice and I've been able to network more with those in my major. The disadvantages are loss of human touch, increased stress levels, and isolation. What I've been doing is, I created a new club on campus ( in the process ) with my engineering friends. I've also attempted to be more active, it's since been inconsistent. I've done meditation, that has worked but I stopped because I feel like I don't have time. I feel like my stress levels have increased and it's due to classes and their overlapping assignments and projects. It's just overwhelming and I'm not sure how to deal with it, other than to get it over with."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2465,"Online learning has literally affected the most to me, in my studies, including my overall activities, my life. Why? because being at home doing everything on my laptop has got me innumerable headaches, many other migraine symptoms too. It affected my health way much than before. My  study schedule has been changed. Now I barely do extra studies which concerns me a lot because my goal when the year started was something else and because of covid, I couldn't keep up with my goals. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,138,Even though online classes are flexible because you can plan your own schedule still when we have in-person classes we can interact with our professor easily and doubts can be cleared faster with better understanding. And when you have online classes sometimes you have technical issues. The online class has partially impacted me because now we have a lot of assignments and projects to complete. But I have made a timetable that I follow daily and that keeps me organized. I have got used to this routine. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2472,"Online classes impacted me alot with focusing, I recently dropped one of my class because I feel like I'm going to fail the class.  but overall its going good so far."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2469,"Online education has gained immense popularity among working professionals and students pursuing higher education.

2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2478,"Taking onlline courses have made me sit on the screen for too long. Doing this 5 days a week caused my eyes to hurt but I just ignored that and kept going. One thing that Im doing to help myself is by trying my best to reduce the amount of time I am on my computer. Like making a schedule on when I should do my homework would reduce the pain as well because  that would help make finishing my assignment early and less time I have to be on my computer. Some concerns I have from taking online courses is whether social interaction or participation would continue to be a issue we will face as we use zoom lectures. I noticed majority of people talking are like 4 - 5 out of the total participant and when people are in break out rooms, they are either not on their computer or just muted. Those times could be challenging but I just ignore  that and keep working to the best of my ability. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2471,"To teel the truth ,online class is kind of sucks since it make lots of things harder. For most of my class ,take it only seems only make them worse. But if there is only thing better , it might be that my self-control is become better. When the class just switch to online class, i wkip a lot which of crouse is my fault ,and it lead to my lower and lower grade. but since  i already get used to it ,things become better, now i should say that there are also things that could be better if we have zoom meetings, like  if we take class in classroom like before, it might be hard for me to catch up something in some class, but since now we are haveing zoom meeting, we could actually record the class and after class we can watch the record if we miss something."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2470,"During one of our lab sections, our instructor had shown us a video about time. The video highlighted how time can easily slip away, and how time may also be used efficiently in order to achieve what we need to achieve. It reminds me of this quote, ""If you love life, do not waste your time, because that is what life is made of."" I do my best to use the time I was given on Earth, but many times, time does end up slipping away from my grasp. It is not because I do not respect my own time, but because bad time management has become a bad habit that I need to break. One day soon, I will be able to reset my habits and use my time effectively as I have always wanted. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2475,"Online classes have not been as helpful to my learning as in-person classes, however, I think I still get all the necessary resources to understand the material that was intended to be presented. I try my best to keep an agenda for all assignments every week especially during online classes because it is easier to lose track of due dates. Once I have an agenda, I am able to complete assignments in better order in order to be more efficient and have less stress from procrastination or accidentally discovering a missing assignment. I am concerned that our learning is being bottlenecked because it is harder to learn online material outside of a lecture hall. I find it more stressful to learn the material on my own."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2474,"Online classes are new experience for me. In past I have taken some online classes but it’s where we can meet the professor in person to get help. Due to Covid-19 we are completely taking all classes online which is something new for all of us, especially me. Online classes brought a whole new experience for me where all the learning is remotely and even if I need help on something that has to be online as well. For me there are some classes that didn’t impact anything for me if the class is online or not, but classes like Math or physics (Lab) that is really helpful if we learn in person. Before Covid-19 any science class I took all the labs were in person and I get to learn the experiments by experimenting by hands and know what’s going on. Now all the physics labs are based on simulations which is something new. I think learning online has its own advantages and disadvantages. It requires more little more attention and time because there is some information that we have to learn on our own."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2464,"Online learning has a lot of benefits as well as a lot of things that students have to overcome, which makes thing hard at time, specially classes such as discreet match or computer science-related, although universities have made a lot of things to help students, the hard part is in understanding concepts, because online yes we can ask questions but some professors just ignore those questions and continue with their lectures regardless whether or not a student knows what the professor taught, which in person will be most simple to talk to ask questions and a professor can explain things a different way or show another approach on teaching a concept, only thing that helps my learning and self-care is that I can go online and find someone else to teach what the professor just did but in a different way, and understand better, and to help with the well-being we can exercise at home like find a bodyweight routine that we can do at least 4 times a day to stay healthy and in shape, while everything is closed."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,10,2468,Online classes allow me to not spending time on transportation. So I can study at any time I want. The way I self-care is I request to finish every homework before 2 days of the due day.
