2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2352,"a concept im intrested in is where you could or should apply parallel circuts and where you would series. i know houses should definatly be parallel because if you turn on one ligh all other lights will turn on and be weak so thats one use of parallel , i guess a form of series ive seen is christmas lights ? where sometimes if one light doesnt work the whole stand doesnt which isnt a good concept so i havent seen that in a while other thatn that idk where i could apply this "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,143,"Why are rubber shoes the best insulator against the flow of electricity? Without diving too much in to chemistry, rubber inhibits the travel of electrons the second most out of any substance we've created thus far and is cheaper to mass produce vs. quartz the leading resistor. When humanity first reached the industrial age and moved from steam power to electricity there was certainly the worry of electrocution. However through both scientific knowledge and rigorous testing we were able to determine how to work around electrical manipulation into the creation of the titans of industry we have today. It is truly awesome to think about how precise and detailed our creations have become, wherein if you were to try to breakdown a modern laptop or even a calculator to someone as bright as leonardo da vinci they would go hysterical. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2354,"Q: Where is electric potential greatest?In any electric filed there are two points of electric potential that are of significant interest to us. There is a point of high potential, as you do work on a charge to move it closer to another charge of the same sign, you increase the electric potential energy. The reason why electric potential is useful because it provides an alternative to the electric field in electrostatics. The potential energy for a positive charge increases when it moves against an electric field and decreases when it moves against an electric field and decreases when it moves with the electric field. The topic of Electric Potential Energy is every where, from something as simple as a light bulb that is turned off, has an electric potential. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2347,"Ostyn Sy  Reflection #3  Select a concept that was covered in class in the past few weeks, either in lecture or lab, and formulate a question. Then look through your class notes, lab notes, and/or textbook and write an essay in response to your question, summarizing the relevant information.    Discuss how this information might be generally applicable to people’s lives and/or how this information might be used to benefit society. Be sure to include some concrete information that was covered this semester, explaining why this specific information is relevant. Be sure to give examples.                Circuitry is a concept that we have covered in the past few weeks. This concept is applicable to people’s lives because circuitry and electronics surround us. As the world continues to develop the circuitry becomes more advanced and more widely used. Knowing how circuitry works is very beneficial because it can help us fix our own electronics. This is the most salient reason as to why circuitry is so important to peoples’ lives. If the world had a higher general knowledge of how circuitry works, then our world can become a more technologically advanced world. This will put us into a futuristic world where we become cyborgs and live among robots that help people improve quality of life. In the transition to this futuristic life, we will go through many amazing breakthroughs. Circuitry will become general knowledge, and will be useful in daily life.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2346,"In the very beginning of the semester, we learned about charges. As an example, if we were to take two pieces of top or bottom tapes and bring them close together, the two would repel. If we brought a top and bottom tape together, the two would attract. If object A was positive and object B was neutral, the two would also attract. In the short circuit lab, we learned the difference between series and parallel. A series is a circuit where each component are connected to a single current carrying wire. The current in each element is equal. In parallel circuit, the current has multiple paths to flow through and all ends will have constant voltage. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2349,Why do resistors actually resist current. I can see that in the name that there is a physical resistance like a something trying to stop the flow of electrons. This is beneficial to society because we need to lower current in our circuits to correctly power circuit components. If we didn't have resistors we would probably destroy many of our components. Though resistors can also damage circuits from the intense heat that can be created from the resistance. This is probably created by friction between electrons. That's my best guess anyway.  I have seen in other classes we use resistors before components such as capacitors or LED's. In the past I have destroyed an LED probably because I used the wrong resistor.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2344,The flow of electrons was covered in class. How is the flow relevant in real life? The simulators were really helpful. They can help benefit society by teaching people about the flow. It is relevant because we are surrounded constantly by the fountain of electricity. We have light bulbs and circuits all around. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,665,"How can you provide electricity for yourself if you're not near any for example maybe a cabin in the woods or in a blackout? Well one way that you could provide electricity for yourself is making an electrical circuit with double A batteries, aluminum foil, and tape we learned how to do this in the short-circuit lab. It is very easily done by taping three double A batteries positive to negative and then taping a thin line of aluminum foil on the positive and negative ends. After that anything connected to the ends of those aluminum ends will began to heat up meaning that electricity is being conducted through that connection. Although this will only produce a total of 36 volts of electricity which is not a lot of power to power something, using a bigger voltage batteries or using more batteries will aid in increasing the voltage of the electrical circuit. I believe this can be very helpful for society and people if they were ever in an emergency situation where they had to create electricity for themselves. Hopefully that never occurs but is can be very helpful to have the knowledge of knowing how to create this electrical series. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2350,"Everything i learn about physics fascinates me. when I learn about new concepts, i tried to find it in our surroundings. Youtube is a great source to watch short animation to visualized and solidify the new materials i learn every week. so far, I have enjoyed everything single topic we have covered in this course. The topics that most interested me were circuits and potential. from the lab work to watching a couple videos on Youtube i was amazed to learn about electric potential and circuits. thinking about circuits makes curious sometimes about the possibility of designing a circuit with infinite electricity. would be possible to trap electricity? or maybe building such a battery is possible. also, when i watched a video about potential, i learned about resistance and how geometrical shapes affect it. the animations were so cool, that it etched the concept of resistivity in my brain forever. so to sum it up, physics is love physics is live and these are the riddles  that  i ponder about a lot."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,179,"After reaching this point in the semester, I can say that I am somewhat worn from work and personal matters back at home. However, I continue to enjoy the learning that I'm undergoing through some of my courses, such as Physics and Electric Circuits. These are phenomena about life that I've been curious about, but have not had much of an idea of how to begin learning these, until now. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2353,"Electric circuits has been pretty interesting for me in this class. most of the notes i take are apart from my other engineering classes, especially electric circuits. my question is that are electric circuit models only 2 dimensional. also will it be better to draw a circuit in 3 dimensions? this can be helpful to grasp a better visual concept for electrical circuits in the real world. such as making a radio or computer, you're going to need a blueprint of something before you build. that is why drawing electric circuits comes in as it is a blueprint for the actual build."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2356,"I always get confused with Gauss' Law that the total charge flow through a closed area. It should always treated as a Show-to-Drain concept. As long as the charges are not from the source and the end route, it will be zero. I can use this concept to do my problems through out the course.I can apply this method to the magic we often see on the TV, a person is inside of a big cage, and all the electric charges go flow through the cage, but the person who is inside didn't get shocked at all, now we know the reason why, because the total charges flow through the cage is zero. The person who is inside of the cage is not the source nor the end of all the charges. That's why the person is safe even though he or she touched the cage."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2348,"With short circuits, I'm wondering how the use of this in homes and other areas that people frequent can be optimized for safer use to prevent things like combustion from happening. Seeing that it is used pretty widely in technology, especially in the home. Making these changes could be the difference between the kind of equipment that people use and having it be much safe and more preventative of fires."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,169,A concept we learned in the past few weeks is Flux and Gauss' Law. The concept of Flux and Gauss' Law may be applicable to people's lives or society when they come across certain situations. Electric flux is the rate of flow of the electric field through a given area. Gauss’s law states that the net outward normal electric flux through any closed surface is proportional to the total electric charge enclosed within that closed surface.This information can help when individuals may want to calculate the force and electric field of many different objects.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2345,How does charge affect attraction and the ability to repel. Positive charges repel while negative charges attract hence why positive and negative charges go hand and hand. This helps us in real life because we can use this to analyze poles of things and to understand how electricity and magnetism affect our world.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2093,"Electric Potential got confusing for me. Just kind of looking at the lab for it messes with me. It makes me wonder how electric potential is utilized in daily life, say in houses or in offices. How does somebody working 9-5 get effected by the potential? It seems to me like a specialized kind of topic where someone who really understands the concept should be the only one to bother thinking about it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,141,Antonio MineghinoProfessor GrigorescuPHYS 0230-01 Laboratory12 March 2021Reflection #3     One question from the last few weeks of material that has stuck with me the most is during labroaty in the past week we needed to come to an understanding of what current does when it reaches a junction. The topic of how current behaves at a junction is an integral part of  the daily activities in modern life. As it is a basis for almost any electrical function. While many people may not fully understand this concept they rely on its function to allow them everyday conveniences such as things from their cell phone to their car will funciton. My experimental evidence the helped me gain an understanding of how current will behave when it reaches a junction was in my week #7 post-lab knowledge check. Where there was a circuit that had four identical light bulbs and an ideal battery. We needed to essentially figure out which wire had the most current. In this case the current flowed and split into two paths. The first path had more resistance so less current flowed through it the second path had less resistance flowed through it. In doing this I came to understand how current behaves at a junction which is an integral part of not only my everyday life but the function of society as a whole.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,187,"The physic concept that I am going to the reflection on it is the electric circuits since its plays an important role in people’s lives.  For its definition, an electric circuit is either one or more loops in the wire that enable the current to flow around to function some sort of object that needs electric circuits or in common we can say any object that uses energy. Mostly circuit are controlled by battery where the battery maintained a potential different for the current flow which also known as the resistors.  These circuit has been used on our light switches, televisions and many other house hold electronics. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2355,"A concept that I have chosen to cover on that might be generally applicable to people's lives and/or how this information might be used to benefit society are ""short circuits"". Circuits exist in wires, batteries, light bulbs, etc. In addition, we get to know more about the currents, voltages, and resistance. "
