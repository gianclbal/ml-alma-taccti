2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2348,Online classes have basically brought down my focus on schoolwork and being able to pay attention in class. While on-campus there were a lot less distractions. I don't really have much time for self-care because I have to keep up with so many different deadlines for each class on top of working at my part-time job.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2349,"Online classes have made a pretty huge impact on my learning. They have made it very hard to get into contact  with students. Even in discords or group chats it's hard to make friends or just find someone to work/study with. It has made the professors harder to reach, and classes harder to keep track of. For self-care I just try and talk and play games with a few of my friends from highschool. What concerns me for my learning and well-being is not knowing how everything works online. I don't know where to go for help if I have a question. Office hours aren't usually held for a long time, and professors usually don't respond to emails very quickly. But I think I get through it using the internet and asking for help in the discords of my classes. Some other self care I do, is just to relax and watch some shows, and chill. I think getting my mind off of things is very effective. I take every moment I get to just do something that isn't related to school. Which is getting harder and harder as the semester goes on."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2353,"Personally, for me, online classes aren't too foreign considering the fact that I was homeschooled for a good chunk of my elementary and middle school. Most of the time I am working and doing homework. My well-being is good! I get a lot of good sleep at night! I have a low concern for my learning environment as I was usually used to this in my childhood."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2345,I like online class at first but now theyre are just as tiresome as normal classes. I get less sleep with everyday that pass because i have to work on weekends so i dont have much time to my self. I usually play video games but my parents tend to bother me when im playing but i cant exactly tell them to go away. idk its kinda sad rn
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2352,"my girlfriend has been able to hang out with me more like we would be in call but be doing our own thing and we finally got to hang out for the first time in a year and a half in real life which has been great, my room is clean which is helping me stay calm but my parents are hard to deal with and i need to be spending less money "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,187,"Due to covid-19 online classes have gained immense fame and provide advantage for most of the student and as well the universities, form my perception the online classes help me to have my flexibility and autonomy that I have for my studies thought its taking a lot of my time coz its totally depend on the student to be prepared. The online classes had increased my motivation and self-discipline since the course are sets goals, deadlines and track your progresses and always can reach your instructor through one in one meeting or emails to ask question regarding our concerned topics.But I miss the advantage the a classroom provide to us, a class structure, direct support from mentors and teacher in concerned topics, and a reward and penalties that enable us to groom and interact with each other physical and build up link and relation with professional student and others for future supports in term of finding jobs and informed from the existing opportunities."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2124,"I personally do not mind having online classes.  I feel that I get more done when things are on my time but I also enjoy being in class.  I enjoy the social interaction and being able to talk to the teacher immediately and get immediate feedback, plus it feels more personalized.  I do not have many concerns as I feel I can learn efficiently in both online and in person classes.  I just enjoy them live more.  It provides more opportunities to connect with people and create relationships that are quite difficult to do online. I do wish that the school work part of courses could continue to be online so that they can be done on our own time.  But then have the normal live classes throughout the week as well so that any questions can be asked and answered there as opposed to waiting on emails."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2355,"Online classes have impacted my learning by a lot, like it's something that I wasn't used to. I'm used to on-campus learning and being more active in-person, but online classes drastically changed that since I'm taking the online classes from my home, where the possibilities of lazing around is likely. I feel like if my classes were in-person, then I would do better. But then, it feels okay for me to take these online classes from my home sometimes because I get to take constant rests, like taking naps or watch videos off of YouTube. But I prefer in-person teachings more than online classes because that's what I'm used to. Some classes that I'm currently taking are long and it makes me feel tired throughout the day. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2093,"I am not a fan of doing everything online. My English, lab and math is enjoyable online, however, I do not enjoy physics and coding practices online. I am trying to relax and hopefully move back home to make myself feel more calm and easier to do work. If I move, I won't be able to take classes in person unless absolutely necessary. I also think that the stress is getting to me and I am not really enjoying the current way things are going."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2350,"The idea of attending online classes troubled me in the beginning. I am a traditional learner I need be in the presence of everything to learn and absorb the material. After a few adjustments and hard dedication, the online classes method became so easy and doable. I thought of my study room as a classroom and every time I go there, I think I am in the classroom, this idea eased everything and now I am having super fun and enjoying most of my classes. I made friends. I joined chat groups which wouldn’t have been possible without online classes. All the students seem to be really open and relax on discord chat groups. The students are willing to share and solve problems together. I think it’s one of the beauties of online learning. These last two semester I took only were great experiences. I had more freedom and opportunity to explore around do extracurricular activities. I am looking forward to new experiences and joining the campus next semester in person."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,665,"Online learning this year has drastically impacted my learning from previous years before. Before I really looked forward to going to class everyday but due to covid and these online class format that has changed. I feel like now instead of having the urge to gain knowledge and understand the material, my knew model of learning is just to get the work done regardless if I understand the material, simply just turning it in to get the grade and move on to the next assignment. this is not ideal if I truthfully want advance in these classes because without understanding the material I will be lost in the next class. The things that I have been doing for self-care are very simple, exercise and playing video games and going outside as much as possible so as to not be inside all day. a concern that I have for my future learning is that if we do not go back to in person school soon I will lose all interest in learning in the near future I am tired of looking at a computer screen all day."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2347,"Ostyn Sy  Reflection #4  Describe how online classes have impacted your learning and what you are doing for self-care. What concerns do you have for your learning and your well-being?              Online classes have impacted my learning a lot. I think that I learn a lot better through online learning. I become more focused and relaxed because I am not as tired. Usually with in person class, I am exhausted from commute and traveling between classes. As for online learning, I can eat when I am hungry and relax when I am tired. Learning from home allows me to take better care for myself. This is mainly because I am allowed more time to do the things that I want to. As for concerns of my learning, there are not much that I am concerned about. However, for my well-being, sometimes I am concerned about my fitness. I feel like I might be getting a little fatter as well as lazy. That is pretty much the main concern that I have. Otherwise, I really like learning online and believe that it is very efficient for me. I feel more energetic when I attend classes, so that I can focus and learn better."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2356,"First of all, online class does save a lot of commute time, parking issue and saving time in general. However, it is less efficient than in class on learning materials. People can focus more while we are in class, online course usually distract people from class. For example, dog's bark, kids crying and Amazon package. But as long as students can concentrate on the classes,  it is a better way than in class learning. People can have more flexible schedule even they have a full time job. Online class does give students easy access, and time friendly. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2344,Online classes are harder because some teachers are really rushed. In some classes they barely have any time to lecture and post youtube videos. I have been trying to remind myself to get up and take breaks because sitting all day is starting to hurt my back. Hopefully the gym is open soon and I can do something else to help break up the monotony.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2351,"Starting Covid-19 and everything going in lockdown was the hardest moment in my life. I couldn’t see any of my friends or my family. Time went by I started to make some habits for myself like biking in new places, making Tik Tok, playing video games and learning new stuff on the internet. School was one of the hardest challenges for me and I’m sure it was the same for teachers as well. Fall 2020 was a semester that I had to transfer from College to University so I had to make sure I get the perfect grade in my classes and make sure to send my applications on time, hopefully all the consoling's moved to the zoom which made it so much easier for me. I eventually got into SFSU and this is my first semester here, beginning was really hard finding the right people and figuring out the classes but thank god I end up figuring out all of it and now I can’t wait for the next Fall semester to go back in person."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2354,"So far online classes have been very challenging for me, because you are expected to study at the comfort of your own home and that is pretty hard for me. I prefer to study in a more productive environment such as a coffee shop or the library, but I can't really do that in this current pandemic. I do like the fact that I can save a lot of time by not having to commute all the way to school, it saves me a lot of time. The very first thing that I need to start doing for self-care is to start catching some sleep because I am not getting much sleep. However, I have been watching out for the things that I'm eating."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,141,"Antonio MineghinoDoctor GrigorescuPHYS 232-019 April 2020Reflection #4	Online learning has impacted me in a few positive ways. Firstly it has made it so I do not live on campus and can save a large amount of money each semester. As well I now have more time for self care. I, like many other people, have used this extra time to take up hobbies like exercise. Lately it has been much easier to do even more exercise since many local gyms have opened, allowing me access to new equipment. However when I am not spending my time at the gym I will often be taking some time to cook a healthier meal since now being at home more hours I am afforded the opportunity to spend more time in the kitchen. Some of my favorite things to make are pasta with red sauce, lasagna, and pizza."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,169,Classes online have impacted my learning in both a negative and positive way. I am concerned with my mental health because it is pretty much a cycle every single day. I don't really get to go out and explore as much anymore like before when we were on campus. The positives of online learning is that some classes allow us to work on assignments whenever we are available. I think this helps because some students have a conflicting schedule with many other different activities going on throughout the day.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,143,"To say online school has been different is the to say that the earth is large relative to humans, gigantic understatement. Between instructors dipping out and deciding to lean into the already super widely available other learning resources online, to the idea that having your students listen quietly while you read off a power point for 3 hours on a zoom call is the epitome of teaching it has definitely showcased some of this university's least qualified educators. Not to mention those who, despite the extenuating circumstances decide ""no concessions can be made, no extensions given, and absolutely no good will extended to our students who are going through an experience that we know nothing about"". It's pretty disheartening to hear from a professor how we're miserable at handling something they never had to deal with. That being said this experience hasn't been all bad. I've saved a butt-load of money that would've gone towards on campus housing, and I've come to realize I should've/will cherish my remaining time in the presence of my peers if/when we finally reopen, because after being in a room in my house, opening zoom several times a day, eat sleep repeating for the last year, I'm craving social interaction like a meth addict in the first few weeks of withdrawal."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2346,"When we went to class, we were able to turn in the exam at the very end of class. Exams online can be stressful, especially if we have to scan and turn in our work by a specific time. Because of this I have to have better time management. If I have more than one problem, I cannot spend to much time on it. I have to make sure that I work through all of the other problems and still have time to scan my work. After classes, when I am not studying or working on homework, going outside for a walk is a nice break. "
