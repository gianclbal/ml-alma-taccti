2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2355,"I haven't really thought about what my greatest take away from this class was, but sometimes working together on labs and using simulations to refer back to for labs helps me a lot. I'm not great at working things alone and I need some sort of guidance to help lead me to success. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2347,"Ostyn Sy  Reflection #5  What was my greatest take away from this class?  My greatest takeaway from this class is probably the ability to do things on my own and in a speedily manner. I have realized that I can depend on myself to get work done. However, if I do get stuck, I have learned not to be afraid to ask people for help. I think these are very important take aways. These allow me to be able to be more confident in myself without worrying about making too many errors. Lastly, I have learned that I retain information better through hands on activities such as labs. Labs are more fun which makes it more engaging for me. Labs will definitely pique my interest more over lectures and home works. These three things are my greatest take aways from this class. Although online class makes learning more disengaged, I felt as if I was more engaged in the class more then ever."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2356,"I have to say the greatest take away from this course is that it really helps me with my PHYS230. And I have a better understanding on the general rules. Also, it helps me with my daily life knowledge, so I won't get hurt on some of the tasks."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2344,My greatest take away is the knowledge of how so many things in the world around me work. We literally rely on electricity so much but so many people have no idea how it works at all. Understanding the world around us is really important. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2093,"My greatest take-away is the experience of experimentation at home. Using simulations is quite entertaining and helpful as it portrays what we are learning in our Physics class in an easier to understand fashion. Though not in person doing experiments or activities that may even more accurately portray the concepts or ideas we are learning, what we do here is simpler to understand and easy to perform while being quite the useful teacher."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2124,"I would say that my greatest takeaway from this class was that it is not so hard to learn physics take part in a lab even when it is all online.  As much as I would prefer the classes and labs to be in person, this was a good alternative and seemed to work, all things considered. I enjoyed the simulations and different examples from external sources because that means that I can always go back and use them again.  I do wish though that there were lists of the materials that would normally be used from week to week if the class was in person, so that I could possibly buy them myself and do the experiments.  This would allow me (and more students in the class) to still get the full experience of what this class is meant to be.  I am more of a hands on student so I think that would be have perfect. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2345,My greatest takeaway from this class is probably that physics is pretty much the most important science regarding everyday life whether that be driving your car to work or going up the stairs. Physics is everywhere and its pretty hard to avoid.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2350,"My biggest takeaway from this class is how important physics is. Physics is all around us, from dust in the ground to air in the sky nothing escapes the laws of physics except for the blackholes maybe. Learning about electricity and magnetism was super exciting and fun. One of the biggest puzzles of my childhood that why the birds don’t get electrocuted while they are sitting on a high voltage power line was solved. This was a big moment for me and made me think even deeper into the concept of induction and electrical potential. Everything and anything I learn about physics excites my heart to the core. No topic is small enough and nothing is big enough to scare me away. In this class I got motivated to think of everything that is taking place in my surroundings in the lights of physics and it makes it interesting. I am looking forward to learning more every day."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,141,"Antonio MineghinoProf. GrigorescuPHYS 232-0130 April 2021Reflection #5    One can take many things away from a life experience. I have taken many things away from my time in physics with calculus two laboratory this spring twenty twenty one semester. However the main thing I learned in taking this course was perseverance; as due to coronavirus twenty nineteen a problem we are still dealing with in twenty twenty one. This seemingly small virus has had a major impact on the world and as a result this semester has been more challenging than others, especially due to the online component of school. Yet I did not let this keep me down and despite struggling mightily with online school in my previous semester I still decided to take a STEM class, and as a result I have done good enough for a personal victory. That has helped me build confidence in online schooling, something that seems to be necessary in our modern pandemic."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2349,"My greatest takeaway is that, the labs probably would have been more interesting in person. We missed out on a lot of cool demos and things because of online learning. The simulations are very interesting and probably get the job done just fine, but I was hoping I could get to make circuits and things in person to help me out with future classes. But online labs are probably easier so at least it has that going for it. I can say that I at least learned a lot from the lab. I think we lost a lot of the lab experience moving online, even the group work isn't the same. I can appreciate at home stuff like the circuit made from aluminum foil, but I can't deny that there has been many difficulties getting things to work."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,665,My greatest take away from this class was being able to keep learning Physics in these difficult circumstances. Knowing it has not been easy as a student to keep learning and staying focused and I can only imagine how difficult it has been for professors teaching and having to keep up with grading homework and assignments as well as having to find the energy to make a zoom class interesting. But material wise the biggest takeaway I have from this class is that I learned a lot more of electricity from voltage to electric field and a lot more material I did not know pertained to electricity. The simulations that we did in lab helping greatly with a visual understanding of how exactly electricity behaves. Although we were unable to much experiments the simulations I believe were the perfect replacement to still be able to understand exactly what was going on.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,187,"What was my greatest take away from this class?This essay is meant to help you reflect on your experiences in this class.This class helped me to understand the physic theories that we went over on a lecture class, this lab brings much clarity on the most complicated physic topics such as charge, electric magnetic, circuits etc.By practically implementing the theories on the related object and other materials will enable us to remember the theories and the concept of the subject matter, but since of covid-19 this lab material was delivered to us through online not much effect as it should be in person and working in team practically, but still our instructor trying harder to bring as much clarity on every concept that we go over in the class.And the experiments of making the electromagnetic in an online lab was the most interesting and a take out from this class, because it made me to understand the current flow and how its looping."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2353,"my greatest take away was the labs about circuits. this whole semester, most of my focus has been shifted to study these circuit theoretically in engr 205. I'd say a lot of things started clicking together, but this hasnt been the best experience. i can only thank my tutoring services for all the help on homework."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2352,"i pretty much learned about electrical circuits how they work, which way they work better, whether putting in parallel or series is better or the combination of them. also i learned about some cool experiments you can do with just a house hold battery like turn a bolt into a magnet. aside from that we learned alot of functions and how we can calculate voltage resistance and other things using these formulas as reference. this class has been interesting to say the least but it hasn't been easy, not by a long shot. I am highly considering taking calculus 3 based physics next semester because of this class which wasnt an option  in my head prior to this class. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,169,"My greatest take away from this class was that I can get more stuff done than I think I can. I just have to put my mind to it and focus on the task. I thought some of the labs took a long time in this class but I ended up finishing them quicker because I remained focused. Over time, I got used to getting the assignment done by remaining focus instead of dealing with distractions because class was online."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2348,"My greatest take away from this class is more so that it is always important to stay on top of all of my work and things that i need to do for each class. Especially now, it is a lot easier to lose track of everything as due dates and assignments start to come all at the same time."
