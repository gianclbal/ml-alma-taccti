2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,141,"Since I was young I have always wanted to be in the S.T.E.M. field. When I was in elementary school I always had a liking for math and science. This liking carried on throughout my education. When I was in high school I began to take my interest more seriously and went on to become president of the math club. Later in my junior year when it was time to apply to schools my family mentioned engineering as something I might find interesting. After looking into it for a while I thought civil engineering would be a good choice because of my interest in science and math applications in the real world. So far I have spent my first four semesters studying these topics and enjoyed concerning civil engineering very much. I have no plans to change my major and find learning more advanced levels of engineering, just as I did when I was in elementary school."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2344,"I want to go into the STEM field because out of all the different areas it is the one that is challenging and rewarding. I find other subjects fun and cool but there is no way I could do it for a career. The problems are challenging and practical and frankly they give several different avenues. I can take a computer science degree and still work in the automotive industry for example like Professor Grigorescu did. I can also work for the government again, since I did enjoy my army days. There are also so many different and cool companies in the tech sector that who knows where I will end up. That is why I am excited for the STEM field. There is so much that I could do! "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2345,I want to go into a STEM field to make lots of money and to feel like I actually used my education to help me in my life. I hate having to put so much effort into something just to get nothing in the end. I feel like i wasted a part of me that i cant get back. I want to make something out of myself because i was given everything to me from my birth and i wanna learn what it is like to work hard for something.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2346,"I want to go into the STEM field because there are a wide variety of different opportunities. STEM refers to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Some of the careers are in mathematics, computer science, and engineering. It is very beneficial that colleges are preparing students for future work. We are learning critical thinking, problem solving, time management, communication, and creativity. When in class and working together on a project, we collaborate and share our ideas. We have to communicate with one another to solve a problem."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2093,"I love the sciences, so I think working in the STEM field is a good way to enjoy my living. I greatly enjoy space, stars, the universe and all that, so why not find out more about those things and getting paid for it? At least I will be able to choose where I want to work as opposed to looking for a job anywhere. Where I lived in Los Angeles before I moved to San Francisco, Hawthorne, back in Southern California, SpaceX has their main headquarters right around the corner from my apartment. I loved seeing what advancements they made, touring the site and seeing what goes on behind the scenes. That was one of my first wants for space and an Astrophysics degree, but it all really started when I thought about how the moon can change the game of humanity, lunar colonies, mining for resources, etc. It's all extremely exciting to me and I would love to be a part of it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,1942,"Hey guys so my name is Daniel Wahba, I am junior in SF State, My major is civil engineering. The main reason why I am in the Stem field is because it is a major requirement in my major. Especially physics classes are the most important when it comes too engineering. Another major reason is because most of my favorite classes are included into the STEM field. Such as physics and math which were the main reason why I chose my major."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,187,"Before I open my own interest in the field of STEM I would like to point out that STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematic) are in the highest demand around the globe, most governments and private organizations are-engage in finding innovative ideas and solution for the challenges that exist in our today's world.  by being in the STEM field we can be a part of the new innovative ideas and discoveries, thus STEM fields provide more opportunities for us around the globe. My interest in this field is being out my interest in science and technology and being creative and plus in our today’s world technology become a part of our life that I can say no one could proceed their life without access to technology, meaning technology has a direct relation in our life, for example in this pandemic most of the work has been done through technology no matter it’s a professional work or delivering pizza to your door.  These are advantages that STEM fields provide to this world."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2347,"Ostyn Sy  Reflection #1  My major at San Francisco State is Computer Science. I originally wanted to become an electrical engineer, but it was a little bit too difficult for me because of the physics. However, I had found passion in coding and chose to follow that path. I want to go into the stem field because I think science and technology is amazing. Seeing how and why the world is how it is and discovering things that can make our difficult lives easier fascinates me. I want to be able to know how things work and create new technology of my own to solve my own problems or of others. In addition to the ability of useful knowledge, I also feel like the stem field has a high possibility to make a lot of money as a career. So, not only is the stem field a stable career, I can also do what I enjoy doing."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,416,"I have wanted to be a programmer since I was small -- some of my earliest memories involve the computer. I want to go into the STEM field because I enjoy the work that I do. I am a programmer, and it's very useful -- you can create tools that are useful, or just write programs for fun. I enjoy learning about how I could become a better programmer and am seeking ways to do this. I am interested in learning about new things in the field. I find low level programming to be particularly fun, but all programming is fun to me. I have experience with robotics too, and am exploring the hardware side. I am thankful of school as my knowledge of computers and programming have grown over the years. I like other STEM classes as well, I think they can be fun too.That being said, it should be balanced with other things. I like cars and have a long history with being around them. The maintenance part of cars is a hobby of mine (and my brother). I have an artistic side, and I like going outside to exercise, and exercise inside. In the future, I want to have a garden, take take of the plants, and watch them grow, so they are happy. I also want to help out the bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2124,"I did not always think that I would be going into the STEM field but once I did, there was no going back.  I was all about baseball growing up so that was all I did but once I got to college, I realized that I needed a contingency plan; so I chose Electrical Engineering and then later added Computer Engineering as well.  My first taste of wanting the join STEM was the movie Iron Man and all of the advanced technology that was displayed in the movie."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2348,"My main reasons for going into the STEM field is from my interest in computers and wanting to help in the development of new or innovative technology. I'm also going into the field with the promise that whatever position I am able to find will have a stable enough salary to live comfortably and not really have to worry about paying bills and/or utilities. Lately, that interest has been wavering since getting into the realm of music production and performance but I've sort of decided that I want to have engineering as a main job until I can safely transition over to doing music full-time."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2349,"I wanted to go into the STEM field because I think I did better in science classes usually during high school than other classes like English or history. Maybe It was because I actually enjoyed them more? Probably. I always enjoyed learning how things worked and doing things with my hands. I also started to appreciate math more during high school. It kind of clicked for me during high school, and I feel like I have a better grasp on it. So I thought the STEM field would probably be the best fit for me. Another reason I joined was for the security it will provide when looking for a job later. Living in the bay can be tough, so a good degree/job I feel like is necessary to get by here and STEM fields almost always can do those things for me. STEM checks all the boxes that I need it to. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2350,"My enthusiasm to be around  computers started when I was 13 years old. I still remember my first computer an IBM Pentium 2 with a huge monitor. I would save my school money to buy parts for that computer. the first time i learned to install a windows 98 from a floppy drive give me a sense of achievement and further motivated me. eventually i replaced the ram, hard drive, processor of that computer and made a pentium 4 out of a pentium 2. my curiosity never stoped and it kept me pushing into learning new things like programming and learning about robots. the reason i want to go into STEM is because i want to make a difference and hopefully a good one. through the knowledge i gain i want to make advances in IT and STEM fields and feel the thrill of achievement i felt from installing my first windows 98."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2351,"My strong suit has always been computer coding. I always looked at it as Farsi being my first language, coding being my second language, and English my third language. Back in Iran, my parents couldn't afford to sign me up for coding classes, therefore I started teaching myself, which was hard at first, but I developed such a passion for it as time went on. Years down the line, I never knew I would be working at a coding school teaching coding to kids and young adults."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2352,"i joined the stem field because i have always loved math and physics and i always liked constructing things so that lead me to the path of engineer that was my main reason, i wanted to be an arospace engineer however sfsu doesnt have it so i might just get my masters in arospace i am currently a computer engineer and i want to learn the hardware parts of computers but ive been only learning coding part of it last 4 semesters."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,143,"Originally when I came to SFSU I was a humanities major, specifically a criminal justice major. I had been interested in joining a federal agency and working for them. But with this major selection came these super repetitive courses of reading and writing, reading and writing over and over again. There was no extrapolation of equations into the real world or utilizing different approaches to solve a problem, all it was was either routine memorization from a given text book or interpretation of a given textbook. About 3 semesters ago I ended up taking a repeat calculus course with my girlfriend, and despite not being very good at it I actually enjoyed it. I choose my major based around that and trying to graduate in 4 years (at least that was the idea before covid)."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,169,"The main reason I want to continue going into the STEM field is because I think the future of our world depends on it. The technology industry is easily the most needed/important field our world is relying on now. The future of technology is very bright and I can see it continuing to evolve as time goes on. My major is computer science and once graduating, I want hope to find a job with a big tech company. Afterwards, I want to branch out on my own or with others to create a new mobile app. I one day would like to work for Apple or Google. Designing a program for one of these two companies would be a dream. I always have ideas of how programs can be advanced and excelled to a new level when using them myself. Hopefully, one day I am able to achieve these goals."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2353,"The reason why I joined STEM was because I thought it was a good choice for my situation. My previous major was in Broadcasting. It was a fun major to be in, but not the best one to graduate with. I thought the technical aspect of the entertainment industry was interesting. I found a lot of inspiration at Music Festivals and Concerts and though how cool it would be to work on the sound design for shows. The more I learned about the major, the more I realized how impossible it is to get into the field. So, I switched to Computer Engineering, because I would like to tinker with tech. I grew up with videogames, so computers are a huge deal in my life. I would want to know the basics of how to build a computer so maybe in the future I can work on hardware for a music or tech producing company."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,179,"I desire to join working with technology as it has always been a big personal interest, which is why I am majoring in Computer Engineering. I've always been fascinated with understanding the nature of reality and understanding the overarching functionality of computers (microprocessors, the connections between software and hardware, and many more aspects), as well as using these tools to document even stranger phenomena about the universe. There is also the benefit of using complex maths, which I really enjoy learning (there is always something so satisfying about having complex formulas simplify to mere integer values sometimes). "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2354,"For as long as I can remember, the only subject that I had aptitude for was math. I hated comprehension and short answer questions as a kid. However, I really liked how forward and direct the answers were once your understood how to confront a certain math problem. Math is a really fun subject, when you understand what is going on. I know the same can be said about a lot of subjects but this is especially true for curriculums revolving around STEM. To be honest, I am not really sure why I want to pursue an education in STEM; it might be the six figure jobs or just the financial perks that comes with it. One thing for sure is the STEM is heavily reliant on math and I want to surround myself with the one subject that I have aptitude for. STEM enables me to keep doing what I enjoy doing while contributing to a bigger cause. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,127,the reason that i go into the stem field is because i am a computer science major and for me is that it always keep me thinking and its coding interesting for me. there's also the benefits that this is a great field to join and also to get into. For me i can get distracted easily and when I'm doing my coding it keeps me engage and tinkering to produce the best work that i can. Also i would like to get into some type of robotics because i am a vary hands on person and don't like just doing one thing. Also i heard from my teachers that this field needs more diversity so why not help out in that as well since i am a latino student and would like to helps those numbers out of latinos in stem. that's why i want to get into stem
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2355,"I haven't thought about the reason why I wanted to go into the STEM field. My sister thought that I'd fit in for Computer Engineering out of all the other STEM majors, because I'm good in math and I like technology, especially computers. Besides Computer Engineering, I don't know any other majors to take. Although it'll be a tough journey into the major, I hope that I could be successful and potentially get a good career and job to help my family.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2356,"STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) plays a major role in the world's growth and stability of economy. And it is one of the critical point which makes US the most powerful country in the world. STEM education consistently discovers new area and creates more jobs. People using STEM products everyday and it has shifted human's daily life into a new milestone. The society should go with the trend of STEM, it will only goes more and more advance from now on. In general, STEM education could be the key for younger generation to become successful, it leads them to a stable life and be able to concentrate to evolve further. And that's the key how a country can move forward. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,665,"At first I did not have a reason for joining the STEM field other than that's what my dad told me to be when I grew up. So when I applied to college I enrolled as a Civil engineering major, however I would later change it to Mechanical engineer sometime later. At first I was not sure if I would want to stay with that major until I graduated, yet once I started to take engineering classes I realized that the subject was something that I indeed wanted to do for the rest of my life. I fell in love with engineering, it is a part of our everyday life it is all around us we can't avoid it even if we tried. Almost everything that one deals with in their everyday lives from your cellphone to your car is a product of engineering. I just hope I can be part of future engineering innovations. "
