2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2124,"My goals are to have this knowledge so that I can create and innovate on multiple subjects moving forward.  Several of my personal designs and projects could be even better with a further understanding of physics and a better understanding of how things work as a whole.  Science classes like this one are interesting to me anyways so it makes wanted to learn the material just that much easier.  I have an addiction to knowledge and specifically, scientific topics.  I more I learn, the more I feel I can really make a difference when it comes to making our lives better and easier as a species.  Yes, I have my own projects for my own personal interest and use but for the most part are for the greater population.  I will use this class to help me gain the knowledge I require to do my best work."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2356,"My goal for learning Physics is to understand the basics of the Universe, so I can develop my critical thinking and be able to apply it in real life. By learning Physics, I should be capable of increasing my creativity, therefore, I can solve real problems in the future, perhaps it will empower my skills in my job role and daily family life. Lastly, I believe learning Physics can improve my academic resilience, in easy words, if I can finish this course, I will pass every other class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2093,"I really haven't thought of my goals. I suppose I want to get my degree and graduate, move back to Los Angeles, and work a job where I feel like I am doing something big. This class is needed for my major and to understand more about physics, so taking this class will help me with that. I also feel like this class teaches me more about physics than my lecture class, so I like it a lot. With being able to do some form of experimentation at home, I think I am gaining a better understanding of physics."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2348,"My goals are to finish getting my degree and to find a career that can help me gain financial stability and still allow me to pursue a future career in music if I am not already on the road to doing so. The way that this class can help me in achieving my goals are by passing this class since it is a requirement for my major. If I am unable to do that, then I won't be able to move forward in getting closer to accomplishing my goals. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2354,"My goal is the to try to complete work in the company of others, because I'm a pretty antisocial person. I'm usually the type of person that thinks it is a bother to try to converse with a person about a project and try to the marginalize on an answer. I thought that it would be a lot more efficient if I just relied on myself and try to finish it as fast as I possibly can. After these fast couple of labs that I had it seems clear to me working with others has clear perks too. First they introduce you to certain concepts that might have not been clear to you when you are alone. This is a lesson that can be applied to my major; which is computer science. And this class forces you to work as a unit and try to work together, making me get out of my comfort zone work. More brains put together are better than one.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2347,"Ostyn Sy  Reflection #2  What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?                            My goals consist of quickly finishing college to get my computer science major so that I can hastily get a job and start getting real life experience and make money. This class is a stepping stone to get my degree. Not only will this class help me towards my major. It will also help me prepare for the real world. I will get experience doing work, writing, doing experiments, and most importantly working with others. These will setup the basic fundamentals for me to practice for my career. In addition to all of this, I will also get to learnt he subject of physics which is very important. It allows me to have better insight and understanding of our physical world. I will have a better idea how objects interact in the world and will not be as surprised when I encounter something abnormal. Ultimately this class will help me prepare for the world at large."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2345,I want to pass this class so i can continue my college journey and eventually graduate. This class is required for my major so i hope i can get a good understanding of what the fundamentals of this class are. I feel that physics is probably one of most used sciences in terms of every day life because it involves a lot of common sense. So in term it should help me out a lot.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2349,"My goals for now are mainly just to pass my classes, and eventually graduate. But I guess a more short term goal is to try and get all my work done on time, and to try to understand material in all my classes. This class will help me by helping me learn physics more hands on. At least as hands on as it can get nowadays. It will also help me for my major, as physics is a pretty big part of it. So hopefully I will become proficient enough to help me in later classes as well. But from what I've heard this class seems really important in ENGR 205 which is circuits. I've been warned by friends to make sure I get this stuff down or I'm going to have trouble down the line. So this class will help me reach my goals by preparing me for my future courses and my future career as a whole, I'm assuming. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2352,"my main goal right now is just keep on top of my hw and study on my own, this class cant really help me with that to be honest. some of my other goals is to move out of my parents house and into sf asap because i cant stand being in this living condition where my dad yells at eveyone if one person makes a mistake and somehow makes excuses to drag everyone else into the fight. on top of this i want to be supportive of my gf who is working super hard in UCI and is constantly studying"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,187,"Physic is one the science branch that has its own connection with many different field so to deal with engineering fields or its important to have the basic knowledge of physic since I am a student in the field of computer and science for me it’s important to have sufficient knowledge about importance physic topic. As a software engineer, I will face with creating either we application software of apps that need to perform a task, in which some these web application may not be able to build without having basic physic knowledge. let’s take the example of units convertors web application which is not a big application but it required the knowledge of physic similar to this there are many others. This physic lab class designed for us to understand the topic that we cover in a lecture class with more details and work physically on some of these physic topic experiment to enhance our knowledge on such important topic and as well get its benefits for the field our studies to gain the established goal of Designing an application that functions in a perfect way. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2350,"My ultimate goal is to have my own software development company. this class is one of the steps that takes me closer to my goal. Learning about electricity and signals will be useful when coding a program or designing a circuit or an electric board. This class will also help pave the way for broader subjects and concepts are yet to come. This class also goes hand in hand with my physics 230 course, it helps solidify all the material and new things i learn in that course. It's always useful and exciting to actually see all the theoretical topics come together  we cover in my physics 230 course. I am always excited to do experiments and see the results myself, this way I never forget about the things i learn."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,179,"Currently, my goals lie with working on my personal time-management skills, as well as continuing to never lose my hunger for learning. There are times where I still have emotional pulls, holding me back. It takes a few days for me to break free from these and regain my motivation. Though not common, when these arrive at me they hit strong. It's nothing serious, but more of a remnant response to a previous life I used to lead. Matters have changed for the better, but there are personal areas still to work on for me. As for how will I achieve this goal, is simply a matter of breaking my old routines (daily) and learning to break off the trains-of-thought that hold me back significantly as a consequence. Again, these are nothing major but have been one of my greatest limiting factors that I've been learning to fight on my own. I have asked for help when I need to (not nearing a breaking point of any kind), but I've also ensured to learn as much about myself along the way. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,143,"My goals? To graduate, to make money, to have a job that I can do to the best of my ability that I'm not worried about being fired/ downsized from constantly. To gain skills and tools that make this immense amount of debt, an unprecedented amount for me in my lifetime at least, worth its weight. To be able to say that I enjoyed my time at college. To say that not only was it a time of learning for me, but also a time of great socialization and new experiences. To be able to travel, to see things I've never seen in person, with people I never thought I'd meet in a million years. I think most importantly my main goal is to blow up, then act like I don't know nobody AGHAGHAGHAHH"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,169,"My current goal is to complete college and earn my undergraduate Computer Science degree. In the time being, I also would like to be very versatile and do many other things along with focusing on school. I think that if a person has to focus on only one thing in life the whole time, they would not enjoy life as much because it would get boring and redundant over time. This class will help me achieve my goals because it is a requirement to graduate and it keeps me hard working. The more work I do in college, the more I will grow as a person. I will continue to expand my knowledge over time."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2344,"My goals are to graduate with a college degree. Leaving the army that was my only goal and this class helps me to achieve it. I will learn as much as possible but every class is important to that goal. The more I do in each class, will also ultimately help me with getting a good job one day which is more of my long term goal. Everything now is focused on filling out my remaining classes and getting the degree. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,665,"My goal is to become a Mechanical Engineer in the future and I believe this class will be of help in the future. Bring that this a lab I believe it will help me in the future because I will be working on projects either with partners or by myself constantly. This class is helping me to learn how to be in a group and working together as one in order to successfully complete the experiment. I think is very important because in the future I will not always being working on projects by myself some may be too difficult or too big of task to be done by one person, so I have to be open to different opinions without seeing it as criticism. I also believe that the post-lab checks will be helpful for my future because it is important to reflect on the work you have completed as well as being able to understand your results."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2353,My goals for this class is to have a better foundation for concepts i will be working with in my future field. this class deals with a lot of electrical work in the physicality of most technical engineering. i like the fact that we are studying these topics because they also help me with my other electrical classes . currently i’m taking electrical circuits and some of the concepts i’m learning from this class are very apparent in my other class. the electrical circuit class that i’m taking is a bit far off from my physics class because it’s stuff i would have already went over in my physics class. i hope too that one day i will all be caught up with everything material wise by the end of the semester. i’m a bit stressed by not understanding some material. but hopefully the things will click the more i gets through this semester 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,141,"Antonio MineghinoProfessor GrigorescuPHYS 0230-01 Laboratory26 February 2021Reflection #2My long term goal is to become a successful civil-engineer, a key competent of my course work is to become proficient in physics in order to apply it to my engineering classes. Taking physics is in addition helping me to achieve another personal goal of building confidence in my ability to become a civil-engineer. As in any engineering major many courses are difficult. However physics is notorious for being a tough class for almost all students, especially the laboratory component of physics. As a result my ability to succeed in this class will build my confidence in being able to become successful. Not only in my physics class but in my academic career in general. Which will help me achieve my long term goal of becoming a successful civil-engineer, and help build my confidence in being a college student."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2346,"One goal that I have for this semester is better time management skills . What I can do to have better time management skills is, I can write down all assignments on a calendar along with their due dates. The calendar allows me to see the amount of work that must be completed before the end of the week. I can also set a time and day to complete the homework before the assignment is due. Lastly, for every class that I have, I can organize notes into class folders. It will save me time since I will know where all the notes are located. At the end of the week,  I can go back and see what has been completed and see where I can improve for the following week."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,1942,"My goal is to be a civil engineer one day. This class helps in two ways, one of them is expermenting physical laws, proving physics laws to me will be a huge boost as engineering is all about physics and math so experimenting and proving physics laws will help understand more what each law is talking about rather than hear the law and imagine it. the other main reason why this class helps me is that solving for what I see. For example we make an experiment we grab our results and we solve using the equations of the specific law we are following we solve for the results. which helps me see the numbers to what I am doing to understand the scale of the surrounding around me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,1,2355,"My goals as of now are to pass all my classes, graduate college, and find a job. Physics isn't my best subject to take, but I want to try and do my best. Physics has some key components to my major, so I want to see how it affects my major. I also want to know a deeper understanding about my major and see how it can benefit me and my family. I hope that things will go smoothly and fine, no matter how difficult it may be. "
