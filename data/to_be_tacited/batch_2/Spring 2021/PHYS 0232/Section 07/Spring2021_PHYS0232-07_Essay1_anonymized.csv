2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2431,"I wanted to go into computer science because when I was in high school, I saw one of my friends coding a game cheat for one of the games me and my friends played regularly. At the time, I didn't really know much about computer science and coding, and I thought that what he was doing was very cool. The next year of high school, I decided to take a computer science class, and learned a lot from it. I thought the class was pretty fun, and after that, I decided I wanted to go in the STEM field and major in computer science. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2432,"Reflection #1 - ""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?""              I want to go into a STEM field because I have always been interested in understanding the fundamentals of how the world around us works. Furthermore, I love creating things that allow me to manipulate my surrounding. Whether that be something I design in CAD and 3D print, or a physics problem that I solve after fully understanding the concepts. I also think I want to go into a STEM field because I don’t find enjoyment in other areas of expertise like business or law. My goal in my career is to create something that people get to use and feel like it makes their lives even a little bit easier. If I can accomplish that then I will feel like I have succeeded. Lastly, the people I look up to the most in life all come from STEM backgrounds which leads to believe I have a fundamental attraction to that sort of life."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2433,"I want to go into the STEM field because I was always interested in why things were the way they were. I was always curious but I think over time, I changed the way I thought about things. I want to find out what the point is of doing something rather than why things are some particular way or in some particular fashion. I guess what happened was I became more philosophical and learned to think for myself more. I found out that I didn’t have the passion anymore for discovering why things worked and instead found that I wanted to find out why we should do these things that work. My thinking has changed over time, and I’m not sure if I have the fire inside me for it anymore, but maybe in the future I’ll find something that will ignite it again."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2434,"I want to get into the STEM field because I always had a passion for technology as a kid growing up. I was always fascinated by Apple's keynotes, I always watched them right after school when they came out. I was very into gaming as well and at one point I wanted to be like a game designer as a kid. I remember trying to take my Gamecube apart so I can see the insides of it, my dad got mad at me. I was very informed about new products coming out and constantly talk about them all the time to my parents and friends. But I actually never applied tech that as a kid, like I never built a computer or coded until recently. I should have started earlier as a kid, like getting myself more invested in it, but I was a lazy kid. Throughout my life I knew I wanted to do something with tech, that's when I found out about the computer engineering major so I just went for it. I just have a big passion for technology, you can revolutionize the world with it and impact many people. That's my dream to use technology to impact people for the good."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,131,"The reason I plan to go into the STEM field is mainly because I love to be around technology and understand how its works. But before that, my parent had also been into the stem field ( engineer and a doctor) and it was expected of me to be in the same field as well. And although i was always inspired by the nature of my parents field, i never seemed to like their job. My mother was always stressed out because of her patients and my father had to stay long night at field supervising. But the day I learned about computers and how it can solve any problem with right thinking, I decided that i will go into the field of computer science. Moreover, the more deeper i get into this field, the more i understand its importance in the very existence of our society that depends on technology. So the greatest reason for me to go in this field, is to contribute my part as best i can to this global society that will flourish with moral technological advancement."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2125,"The reason I want to pursue a career in the STEM field is that I know this is somewhere I know I can succeed while doing something I can passionately do. Since I was younger, I have always been fascinated with the automotive industry which is a trait that follows me to this day. Currently as of now, I am working on two cars, a Mazda Miata and a Subaru WRX, with the end goals being that these are still street driven cars that can outperform others by superior handling. I just want to prove to my car group that power is not everything and that a car with better chassis stiffness, suspension, weight can hold their own than others with more power. In addition, another reason I want to pursue a STEM career is that the opportunities I receive can be used to help my mom and give her financial opportunities we never had growing up. It would be great to finally give back and thank her for everything she has done for me. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2435,"Ever since I was little, I've always liked working with computers and other forms of technology. The main thing I enjoyed in school was working on my computer classes like Computer Science Principles and Computer Science A where we learned the basic fundamentals of coding. So I knew that that is what I wanted to do as a profession later in life, was to work with computers. I also like working with my hands when it comes to building things, as along with computers, I also loved building Lego and K'nex sets. So when I found out that I can learn to combine both of these interests, building and coding, into the major of Computer Engineering, I decided that that would be what I would major in. So that is why I want to go into the STEM field. It ""stems"" (pun intended) from a childhood sense of wonder of computers and building things."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2436,"I want to go into the STEM field because I am in interested by all that it has to offer. I enjoy doing, math, figuring things out, and creating things which are all part of the STEM field. I believe that the STEM field can bring profound knowledge to me and I can do many remarkable things in it. Plus, when I think of what I want to do in the future, all I can think about is something related to or in the STEM field. I see that the STEM field can bring profound change and benefits to the world by advancing many things and is pushing humanity forward as a whole in terms of innovation and technological and other advancements. I would like to get onboard that and help to do so too."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2437,"I want to go into the STEM field so I can continue to learns things about the world through the lens of STEM. I have learned so many things up until now that have helped me better appreciate the world by understanding it more. Going into STEM has also helped me understand different things that I am not studying. With that I have the confidence to go into any avenue and try to learn new things. I also hope to learn information that will allow me to better other people's lives. Positively impacting people's lives is something that brings me great joy. I am hoping STEM gives me more tools and access to jobs that allow me to do that. If I lived a life where I was a millionaire, I would probably run on trails all the time. It is a dream of mine to complete a 100 mile foot race one day, and if I had a large amount of money I would probably just run all the time and run races around the world."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2438,"I want to go into the STEM field in order to learn more about programming. The reason I wanted to learn more about programming is because I joined a Computer Science class in high school and found it enjoyable. In addition my dream job is to me a game developer, so I feel it’s necessary to know how to code in order to make more progression towards that goal. And if the whole game designer thing doesn’t work out, programming is a sought after skill so I can probably find a different career that utilizes those skills."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2439,The reasons why I would like to go into the STEM field is becasue I am really passionate in learning more about technology and  making things which is also known as engineering. I personally have a lot of experience with technology because I taught a coding class to adults back in high school at my local library which is in the East Bay. I currently want to get into the cyber security and data analyst field. What made me want to major in computer science was becasue I took a free online course during my sophmore year of high school and thought it was fun and something to think about to do as a career and major. Cybersecurity as of right now is in high demand and it is something that intrests me. After completing college and recieveing my degree I would love to work with any government agency around the US. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2440,"The reason why I choose the stem field is that I really like solving problems. I like working with my hands and it makes sense in my head and I love learning sciences and learning certain topics that are super interesting in my mind. I really want to work with space sending objects into space which I have been inspired by since watching star wars and space which is super awesome. I love the laser in there which inspired me to get into it. At first, I really wanted to work with Nuclear reactors but not many jobs in the US to find so I went down mechanical engineering because it was such a broad subject and would help me the best. Another reason my dad worked with nuclear reactors in the Navy when I was little so that inspired me a little bit. That is why I got into the stem field because I was inspired by those topics."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2441,"I ended up in the STEM field because I wanted to major in Computer Science and make a nice living for myself. I don't know what jobs I will do exactly in the future but I assume they will be computer related so that's why I chose Computer Science. The job I am hoping to get would be a software development job creating software or creating websites and maintaining these software. If I had a million dollars and did not have to work a job, buy a motorcycle and ride across the country on a road trip. I want to take a break from society and live on my own and enjoy life for a while. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,132,"Bhargava KadiyalaReflection #1I’ll start off this reflection by admitting that I am a little happy that this is an informal writing assignment. If I am being honest, my main reason for going into the STEM field (computer science specifically) is mostly that it seems like the best choice of major/career for me, also helping me achieve many of my goals. Frankly, I cannot really say that I am particularly good at math or physics, which does cause me a fair amount of anxiety at times. Although this may seem to some people like I am just selling out for a high paying major instead of picking something that aligns with my own interests, I have given this issue extensive thought before making my choice. Regardless of all else, I am satisfied with my choice of career/major, and hope that I am able to contribute something to my field in the future. If in the future I am a millionaire, I will still keep working, but I will also travel to different places and invest."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,380,"I wanted to go into the STEM field before I even knew what it was. In elementary school, I knew I wanted to go into the medical field in some way. When I went into high school, I realized that chemistry was something I was good at. There was nothing else I had that I was really passionate about, so I decided it would be best to pursue something that I was good at and that interests me. Also, there is a lot I can do with a chemistry degree, in case I change my mind about what I want to do. Right now, I am on the path of pharmacy, but I could change my mind and do something else. I am glad I would be able to change my path if I wanted to, but still stay in the medical field. I have been looking into becoming a vet recently, and the steps to get there. If I did not have to worry about having a job and making money, I would travel the world and enjoy what life has to offer instead of spending so much time studying and working. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2442,"I chose to go into the stem field because I love computers. Since middle school I have always been fascinated by how computers work, what they can do, and watching computer technology grow. While there are many dimensions to the computer world, my personal favorite part about it are desktop computers. Desktop computers may seem smaller and incomparable to self driving cars, rocket ships, or robotics but the reason why im so fascinated by it is because as time passes computer companies release more powerful and more efficient technology into their desktops. This is very exciting for me, watching this type of technology grow. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2443,I want to go into the STEM field because I always have been better at math and science. I enjoy math and science because I liked the idea of there being a right or wrong answer. My dad is a computer engineer so he is kind of my role module and inspiration for wanting to go into the stem field. If I was a millionaire I would move out of calli and go somewhere that has actual seasons or maybe live by the cost somewhere. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2444,"I feel like that getting to better myself in the scientific fields can yield me a better future for myself. Most types of study; English, mathematics, and history do have some beneficial factor, everything in the world revolves around science itself. The scientific field requires mathematics to compute different variables, English to write different thesis' on a theory or argue on someone else's, and there is a ton of history revolving around the many different people who discovered the many variables it takes to create the science we know today. Back then, people haven't figured out how the world works, or if the earth is flat or round rather. Over time, those breakthroughs of discovering how our world works evolved our way of life through advancing technology, agriculture, and general knowledge.  "
