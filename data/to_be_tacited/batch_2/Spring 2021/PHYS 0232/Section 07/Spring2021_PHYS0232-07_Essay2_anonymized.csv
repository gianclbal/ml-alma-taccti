2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,132,"Honestly, I can't seriously say that my goals have changed since the first week that I took this class. This course is a required (prerequisite) lab course for my major, and is the lab course for the other physics course that I am currently enrolled in. At the moment, I will admit that this physics course is pretty fast-paced and difficult. It may just be me, but I kind of like that this course slows the pace down and breaks down concepts so that they are a little easier for me to understand. I love that we get to collaborate with peers in this class, and find that this makes for a much more immersive learning experience. Though my long term goal is to fully grasp and understand the concepts being taught to me, my short term goals are to do well in both my physics courses. I feel that I can achieve these goals by continuing to collaborate with my classmates and participate in the class activities, which will hopefully help me better understand the material and consequently result in a better performance in both courses."

2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2434,"My goal in my life is to have a career in stem, anything that relates to science. I have wanted to be in that field ever since I was a kid. I got the inspiration from Steve Jobs because I used to watch the keynotes growing up. Seeing the new products getting announced was so inspiring and gave me motivation to pursue computer science. Now that I’m in computer science, one of the goals is to work for any company to be honest. I don’t really care which company I work for, it could either be a startup or a big company. The reason this is one of my goals is because the money I earned from the company, I can help my parents out. It would be nice to help them out in the future. This class can help me reach that goal because I’m learning how to problem solve different types of problems and can prepare me for my career. Even though it doesn’t relate to my major, it is still nice to learn how to problem solve other different types of topics."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2440,My goal in this class is to learn physics and the basics of it. This will help in the future if I want to work in a space agency where using physics can help and learn the basics and deep understanding helps around seeing engineering in a different way. To help me find any other job that's related to physics and this class can give some basics to further my knowledge. It's just like playing a game say rugby the basics are tackling and passing once you have a good base then you can start with more advance and better you will get at the game. This class can help like these labs are pretty nice and interesting I wish it was in person but the pandemic. I need this as well for my major so I can go on and get my degree but it comes back to that physics is basics for everything so you need to know what and how you're doing it. That is why and how this class can help me achieve these goals.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2432,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?  The goal that I am currently trying to accomplish is beginning my career in a computer engineering field. This class will help me achieve this goal by allowing me to graduate. Furthermore, the material in the class has a great deal of crossover in computer engineering. For example, electricity and magnetism is at the core of what makes circuits work. As a computer engineer, I know very well that electricity flowing through circuits makes up the fundamentals of a computer. Having a better understanding of the fundamentals helps make me a more knowledgeable engineer and will reinforce more complicated applications of the topics covered in this class. I am confident that by understanding how electricity and magnetism works and a deeper level, I will be able to begin my career and achieve my goal of becoming a computer engineer."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2435,"My goal is too eventually have a job in the computer science/engineering world that I'm happy to have and enjoy my time working at. I remember I heard a quote that went along the lines of ""find a job that makes you happy and you'll never work another day in your life"" and that is what I want to try and do. This class could be a great opportunity to start learning some more of the electrical/engineering side of my career as we'll be going over circuits and electricity and other things. I'm looking forward to the labs that are in store for this class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2436,My goals for this class are to learn about electricity and try to get a better understanding of it. I would also like to get hands on with some of the concepts while learning them as best as I can even though it might be harder during these times. I would like to learn this because I want to make and design electric circuits and to be able to understand for myself what is going on in them. This class will help me reach those goals by aiding me with labs to learn and understand them more and to get some interaction with each of the concepts so that I can become closer to fulfilling my outlined goals.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2443,"My goal is to major in computer engineering. This class will help me achieve this goal for many reasons one being that this class is a lot about electricity and that is a huge part in computer engineering.

2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2442,"I honestly am not sure of my goals right now. While taking physics courses will help allow me to land a job in the stem field, I can't imagine myself working in an office indefinitely. Sure, a job and a secure income would be great but, right now I would like to focus on myself and my happiness. I feel like I can achieve this goal by balancing school and my life outside of school. Things like taking breaks, going outside, and talking to my family and friends would help keep my sane during this semester and through the pandemic."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2125,"My end goal is to get a career in the field I am studying in. The goal I have right now is to pass all my classes. This is because if I fail again, I might end up in academic probation. What sucked about being in academic probation was that I was limited to a few number of units. Instead of having the ability to take 15-16 units, I was limited to only 13 units. Another reason why it is important for me to pass is that if I don't, it will slow me down and stop me from take other classes due to pre reqs. The reason I want to achieve my end goal is that I know with opportunities I get, I want to take advantage of them and give myself a chance at a better life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2438,My goals for this semester is to figure out how to manage my work load and focus on passing each of my classes. This class has allowed me to become more open to asking for help from my classmates when I feel stuck on a problem or want clarification on a question. By allowing myself to reach out for help I can feel a bit more confident about managing my work because it feels like I have support in doing it.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2444,"My only goal in life is to start on my career working in a video game company. In order to reach my goal, I would first have to finish up my computer science major degree and make sure I graduate. By studying in this class, I can work to improve my skills in calculating complex physics equations and apply them to creating physics in videogames; set the speed of certain objects and other NPCs to make a wonderful game."
