2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2444,"I think my biggest takeaway is that life and everything that revolves around it can always be traced back to science, even the most minuscule things. No matter where I look or where I go, there's always an explanation for it; whether if it's something physics-related or an animal I see having to do with its biology. Everything we eat can all be chemically engineered. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2440,Something I learned was about adding parallel and series circuit which can be very useful if say you were wiring your house and how it can help. Then also learned about AC and DC current and I weld so learning the difference is big of what materials I can weld on and which settings I should I use when using the machine. Welding is a big help in applications of building structures and knowing the difference is key. Another thing is when building an energy circuit and seeing how much resistance there is. I really like this lab it was great and it helped very much and I feel like I'm never behind. This can really help and this class has helped me to understand it.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2437,My greatest take away from both the lecture class and the lab class is that I have learned that I am capable of understanding the material present in physics. Prior to taking physics I heard many horror stories about how difficult the class is. I think I have learned that everyone has a different experience when taking classes. I have also learned that as long as I study hard then there is a high chance I will be able to understand the material. I was gone from school for 2 years and being back and taking these classes has helped rebuild the confidence that I had lost in myself when I first left school. Perhaps challenging classes aren't as scary as some people make them out to seem. With that knowledge I feel more ready to tackle future classes such as Physical Chemistry which has a reputation for being a difficult class.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2438,"The greatest takeaway from this class was being able to work together with my classmates as this encourages us to talk to one another in order complete our assignments. Being able to work with others or hear others participate a lot seems to help my focus in class, so it was nice to be in work in an environment  like that."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2443,"Through this tough time, taking any lab class has been a lot harder. In that my greatest take away from this class is being able to make the most of my learning by adapting to the conditions we are in. Being able to use house hold items to help with the labs even though we cant go into an actual lab and use the equipment there."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,132,"To be quite honest with you, I have to admit that this lab class did help me throughout the course of the semester, and contributed to my overall knowledge. Although PHYS 230 is the actual physics class, and this is just the lab section, I feel like we focused a bit more on learning the actual concepts rather than simply just doing mathematical calculations related to the topic we are discussing. I can honestly and truly admit that although the actual physics portion is supposed to also go over concepts, it is predominantly just doing math. I would say that this is a key difference between the lab and the actual portions, and is also (in my opinion) my greatest takeaway from this class. Though this may seem like a vague and half-baked response, I genuinely feel like I have learned many of the concepts that were taught at a deeper level, just because I chose to attend this lab portion."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2433,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that if I want to do well, I have to put in effort into my learning.Last semester I was struggling with physics, but this semester I think I did better because I tried harder to do my work and I was not hesitant to ask for help if I needed it. I think that by going to labs every week, it taught me that I have to pay more attention if I want to retain the information relayed to me in the labs."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2432,"What was my greatest take away from this class?My greatest takeaway from this class was a refresher on the topics and ideas around electricity and magnetism. Since I am a graduating computer engineering, I have thoroughly covered all the information, yet it was good for me to brush up on prior knowledge especially since I am applying to jobs in industry. Having a refreshed understanding of the fundamentals will surely help me during interviews. Another key takeaway from this class is getting to interact with my classmates. I can gage my understanding better by speaking with the others in the class. An important aspect to labs is the interaction with others and gaining knowledge from them. I think this class helped me reconnect with others during remote learning."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2436,"My greatest take away from this class would be learning about electric circuits, how electric energy/magnetic energy works and how they interact with each other. After learning about it and seeing it in the labs, I am starting to see it elsewhere too such as in how motors work and in electric circuits by seeing how the electricity would flow and behave in it with all the different components of it. I am now understanding the designs of things when I look at them and can just about tell how they should work now."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2439,My greatest take away from this class is that I got to learn about a bunch of cool physics projects that I never go to leaarn before in my life. Professor taught the class really well and anytime myself I was stuck she would help right away which I appericate. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2442,My greatest take away from this class is how electrons interact with the world. We have learned so much about how electricity acts when it moves through certain objects and orientations. We also learned about how electrons act like magnets since they attract opposite signs and repel same signs. I think the most important aspect about electrons for me is how electrons act in parallels and series circuits. This is important to understand when giving current to an electronic. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,131,This lab was an interesting one because it was more hands on and intuitive. My greatest take away from this class would probably be analytical as well as time management skills. With various physics problems and finding solution improve my analytical skill where as completing labs managing due date really helped me with my time management
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,380,"I believe that my biggest takeaway from this class would be all of the different physics concepts that I have learned and experimented with. I also think that a big takeaway would be perfecting a routine of doing the lab on Thursdays and making sure the additional assignments were done before the end of the week. I think it is an important part of life to stay organized and do your work efficiently. All of the concepts that I have learn have been things that I can apply to my daily life. By using the summary part of each lab, I could think about the different ways that the physics concept could be applied to me personally or how I see it in daily life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2125,"My greatest take away from this class was that I was able to hopefully succeed while it was online. Also was that I was able to learn new things. I was amazed on how many things in my daily life revolves around physics. I also was able to meet with new people despite it being online, they were helpful when I needed it when I did not get something"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2431,"My greatest takeaway from this class is everything I have learned from the lab explorations, which include everything about electric fields, charge, potential, current, etc. Also electromagnets and everything thing about them as well. I think these topics will help me in future classes and jobs, so it will be very useful to have this knowledge later on in life."
