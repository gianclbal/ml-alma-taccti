2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2442,"A short circuit in electronic objects is the process of an electronic not being powered since the current skips the component it is supposed to power, i.e a lightbulb. To achieve a short circuit, the electronic must have a path for the current to travel that shortens the distance between the positive side of a battery, to its negative side. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2438,"Why can birds sit on power lines without getting hurt while if we touch power lines we could most likely die? Most people assume that birds can sit on power lines because their feet appear to be made of different material than our skin, thus most assume that birds just have insulated feet. However, this isn’t the case at all. The reason birds can sit on a power line and still be fine afterwards is because while they’re sitting on the line they’re making no contact with the ground. The electricity within the power lines are trying to find ways to reach ground level quickly and will flow through anything that takes them further down, and as birds are not in contact with the ground the electricity doesn’t go through them. However, if a human were to touch the powerline without the right equipment we would get seriously hurt because there’s hardly any ways to touch a powerline without making some form of contact with the ground."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,380,"In class, we covered charge as well as Newton's Third Law. In this law, forces are equal in magnitude and opposite direction. For example, if I push on a book, it is also pushing on me. My question about charge would be when you rub two things together, what happens to charge? Looking through my notes, I found out that charge isn't destroyed or created, but it is transferred. One object would lose a certain amount of charge and the other object or objects would gain that same amount of charge. Charge is everywhere, so people see charge everyday and in a lot of things they might do. For example, when you run a comb through your hair, the property of attraction through charge is present. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2443,One concept that was look at is that current and electricity can create heat. This was shown in last lab where the small piece of foil got very hot. We have also studied ways that the heat created is used like in welders and other things. The question I have is why is there heat created and what creates the heat from electricity? Why does it not get very cold instead? 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2441,"Electric fields act like the gravitational fields of planets, when attracting particles with the magnitude of E=Q/d^2. Planets have a very similar equation F = G (m1/r2) where the strength of the pull gets exponentially reduced as the test charge or object gets further away from electric field or the planet. The difference between planets and electric fields is the fact that there could be repelling forces if the charges are the same. The repelling forces are the exact opposite of the attracting forces pushing the test charge away at E=Q/d^2."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2437,"Over the last few weeks in class we have gone over circuits. This is the first class where I am learning about this information. I had heard about it before, but I never knew what they looked like. They are apart of every aspect of modern life. Without them we would not have the technology that we have now. During physics lecture I saw a video where they printed a tiny circuit on onto a surface that  was capable of storing a huge amount of energy. The idea was very interesting to me. I wonder if we could print things like this onto organic life and somehow influence organic life with these circuits. Advanced living organism such as animals have lots of electrical signals that run through their body. I wonder if we could somehow use these printed circuits to influence the electrical signals that run through the human body. Perhaps it can be used to send information or save someone's life. Maybe instead of having pacemakers in people's bodies, we could somehow use these circuits directly on the body to convey some sort of electrical influence. Perhaps it could also be used to improve human performance. Maybe even the ability to study and learn more."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2439,"I will be talking about the lectue/ lab that was covered last week which was on forces. This might be generally applicable to peoples lives and the society, because you can find the forces on a object by using physics for example, you are drving a car. The car moves when you apply pressure on the accleration. This topic is important for us to learn because without using force you will not be able to know whether the object can move without using force. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2125,"Why are Tesla battery cells wired in a series?When you attach batteries in sequence, the positive of the first battery connects to the negative of the second, and so on. The sum of all the individual battery voltages is the final voltage. The voltage generated increases as the number of cells increases. As batteries are wired in parallel, the positives and negatives combine to form a chain. The more batteries you have, the more amp-hours you'll have. The more batteries you have, the more amp-hours, reserve space, and cranking power you'll have. However, the overall voltage does not change."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2431,"My question for last weeks lab is, how did the small piece of foil combust while the larger piece of foil did not combust? Looking through the lab, I found out that the smaller piece could not handle the current passing through it, causing it to combust, while the larger piece could handle the current, so it did not combust. This is similar to fuse boxes in homes."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,132,"So the question that I want to ask in this particular reflection relates to last week's lab, where we created a working circuit with three batteries, two pieces of folded up aluminum foil and a thinner piece of aluminum foil. The question that I want to ask is related to this circuit, or more specifically, getting shocked by the circuit. As we saw from last week's lecture, the circuit was conducting electrical current, as the thinner piece of aluminum foil was clearly being combusted while it was in the circuit when the circuit was closed. Since the folded up pieces of aluminum foil did not have any insulating material covering them, would someone get shocked if they were to touch those pieces of aluminum foil with their bare hands when the circuit is closed and there is current running through it? If someone actually did touch the two pieces of aluminum foil but did not get shocked, maybe it was because the current that was running through the circuit was too small to hurt anybody? Also, if there was a thicker piece of aluminum foil that was used as the strand that connected the other two pieces of foil, would there be a greater ""shock"", due to the fact that more current is running through the circuit? If so, what about if the circuit used a material with less resistance and more conductivity?"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2444,"What are the differences between a series or parallel circuit, and how do both types of circuits have their advantages? disadvantages?The major difference between a series or parallel circuit depends on how the transfer electrical circuits around. A series circuit simply goes around a linear pathway where the battery connected with two wires on each end, and a parallel circuit has multiple circuits connecting across each other creating different sets of currents flowing. The advantage of a series circuit is that it is simple and affordable than a parallel, but once one component breaks, the entire circuit will stop working. Parallel circuits have a constant voltage in their parallel connection however it requires the most resources and time to construct it. Since the parallel circuit is splitting the energy source across the system, it will also lower the resistance it takes it. This is the opposite compared to the series circuit as the resistance increases the more components there are. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2436,"What happens when you combine a series and a parallel circuit?When you combine a series circuit with a parallel circuit into one large circuit the current from source will flow along and divide according to how each branch of the circuit is structured. For instance, if the circuit was parallel but one of its branches has its components in series, then the current would divide along how much current that branch will need which will be lower than the branch that is parallel to it since that branch will have the least resistance to the current with only one component in it.What happens when you combine two batteries in series versus parallel?The two batteries when connected in series will have their individual voltages add up since they essentially boost each other. For example, if I took two batteries with a voltage of 1.5 V then the resultant voltage will be 3 V. When the batteries are connected in parallel, the total capacities of the batteries will add up resulting in a higher capacity power source that can run for longer."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2432,"The flow of electrical energy is the core concept that this course covers and as a computer engineering student I fully understand the importance of electricity. The flow of electricity is crucial in providing power to billions of people around the planet. If we didn’t understand how electric charge and current behaved, things like computers would not function. By creating a potential difference between two nodes in a circuit, a device can be powered by the electrons flowing within the conductor. There has to be a lot of research into how we design specific circuits because as was shown in the “Potential” lab, if we use a piece of material to carry the electricity that is too small, it will heat up until it melts. This can cause serious problems when the wire is hidden away behind a wall for example. The concepts covered in this course are extremely important because people can get hurt if we don’t understand what is required to carry the electric energy. Ohm’s law is very important in order to confirm that the implementation of a circuit will be able to carry the required current without failing. Safety is very important and one way to confirm that electricity will be safe is to fully understand the topics covered in this course."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2433,Something that I wondered about in the past few labs was how did the current of the circuit know which way is positive or negative? Does it not matter which way of the battery is connected to the bottom and the side of the lightbulb? I was curious and I didn't know what the answer was. I thought about it a bit and maybe it's because as long there is electricity going through in the first place the lightbulb will light up. I think that electricity is cool and making the lightbulb light up is interesting because it gives us the opportunity to see at night.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2440,The current of certain objects and how some objects have more resistivity then compared to others and that's why to use certain materials for wires like copper because of low resistivity. I learned also about parallel and series in either resistors or power supply and see what the current will be depending on grater the current is in parallel but in series the same amount. That's what I learned in Physics 230 so far.
