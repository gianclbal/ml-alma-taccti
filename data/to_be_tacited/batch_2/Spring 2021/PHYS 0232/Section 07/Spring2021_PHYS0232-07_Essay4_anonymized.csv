2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2433,"Online classes are difficult for me. I struggle to do work because it's all online and I'm not very organized to begin with. Some concerns for my learning and well-being are that I'm not sleeping well, only for 3-4 hours a night. It's hard for me to get enough sleep and I struggle to stay awake in the day. Some self-care that I’ve been doing is flossing my teeth every day and trying to keep good dental health. I also try to drink a lot of water and eat at least 2 meals a day with some snacks in between. Another overall concern for my well-being is that my gums hurt when I floss, so I might have a cavity there. I wish we didn’t have online classes anymore, but I also need to get my vaccinations soon before I can do anything outside. Hopefully I can get them soon so I can resume how life was before the pandemic."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2444,"Online learning has greatly impacted both my learning and self-care lifestyle unlike before where I sat in a classroom with different other people and socializing. Most of my socializing now come from voice chatting and video calls. With the learning aspect, I've been getting a lot more time finishing up assignments and getting things done quicker than usual; Back then, I had to commute every morning for long hours. With more online class sessions, I feel like I barely go outside anymore, only preserving weekends as my time to go walk outside. But after going through a whole semester online, there's really nothing for me to do most of the time. I surely miss walking around campus and getting fresh air and going to the mall a few times to eat some lunch and walk back to my next class. Sometimes I have to go back home really late and I get tired of trying to stay awake on BART."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2439,"Online classes have impacted my learning because when sometimes help or questions  is needed for any class you have to rely on the professor or someone to help you and dont get to you on time. it has also impacted my learning by sometime having to teach myself the subject if due to some professors lack on the teaching, but that is okay because we are all on the same page. For self care I just do the daily which is washing my hands frequently and keeping myself and family safe. My only concern I have for my learning is will I actaully be learning the concepts and main points of the subject? I strongly believe in each in one of us and teachers we will get through this together. TEAMWORK!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2440,How online learning has affected me is learning is not the same online I prefer in person. I am a hands person and not being there doesn't help. The learning online isn't the same I really hope we come back in person for classes so I can get learning. Then they charge us as much as if we were there and it's not fair like the wellness center where I'm not using it why should I pay for it and the student health center too I'm not using it. Then the professors assign a lot of homework compared to in-person which is kinda weird in my mind. Then the stress of the pandemic is not helping to try to get supplies for me and my family and also working a job to help out the family and pay for school bills. That is the impact online learning had on me and on my wellness and energy.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,132,"Quite frankly, I am a little bit overwhelmed. I have to say that although it may be a little bit ridiculous of me to say this, especially as we are approaching the end of the year, but this is sadly just the undeniable truth at this point. I am swamped by midterms from my classes, and have been working hard to maintain my grades. Despite this, it seems like it's just bad timing, but unfortunately there have been other events in my life. My family bought a house, we have COVID vaccinations and also have a trip to India planned later this year, so things are definitely hectic. I hope I can keep up, but I am a little bit overwhelmed at this point. Hopefully I manage to catch up, but I guess that remains to be seen. I just have a little bit more to go until the school year is over, so I will hopefully manage to keep things together."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,131,"As a returning student, I have been much more comfortable as well as prepared for this semester. However, it is not to say that i have faced any sort of issues at all. The most the online classes has impacted me is in terms of my sleeping routines. The reason i say this is because, as international student taking classes from a completely different time zone has heavily impacted how i used to plan out my day. This was particularly hard the first semester, since i had to adjust, but even now i had to compromise my morning for the sake of late night classes"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2434,"Online classes have pros and cons to them. I like the fact that I can wake up a minute before my class, instead of being rushed to class in the morning. Also doing school comfortably in my home is also nice I feel like since I have my own room. But the cons are pretty bad. I feel like I’m not getting the full education that I’m paying for online and it’s not worth the same price as in person school. Another reason, even though I’m comfortable doing it at home, it is still tiring just staring at my screen. I feel like I’m doing the same thing everyday and stuck. I also miss living in San Francisco, like the majority everyone went back home to live with their parents. For self-care I have not been doing that much the past year, but recently been going on more walks with my dog."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2436,"Online classes haven't impacted my online learning as much as I thought it might. In fact, I think it may have even improved my online learning since I have more time to study and do my work now without the pressures of having to commute and get to each class and having to find some time in between to study. The only thing that would make doing online classes harder would be being distracted by all the things at home. For self-care, I am just doing everything that I did before but just all at home. The only concern for my learning would be what I said earlier which was getting distracted by all the things at home."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2432,"Online classes have impacted my life in a beneficial way. They have allowed me the opportunity to move back to Michigan where my family is located. I also am able to pay significantly less in rent while still attending SFSU. I am fortunate that I only live with my fiancée who also works remotely so distractions are kept to a minimum. On top of that, I started the remote learning with a superb work area. I have two large screens which help with productivity and a standing desk. I have plenty of room to do homework and study. For self-care, I consistently go outside for walks and getting fresh-air. I also go to the gym because I find that I am happier when I exercise. Remote learning has allowed me to make my own schedule and I don’t feel like I am wasting time during my commute or waiting in between classes. A concern I have is that I don’t see my classmates which I think helped motivate me to do better. I appreciate labs because they force me to interact with my classmates and I make time to ask how they are doing so I can gage my progress."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2125,"Online classes have impacted my learning greatly. This is because to be honest, I haven’t learned as much as should have. This may be my preference , but I prefer learning in person. I appreciate what my professors have done for us as students as they tried their best to make sure I learn the material. Also, what I miss about in person is interacting with people and making new friends. For self care, I have been taking walks in parks to pass time and hanging out with friends. I also picked up more hours at work than I could now because I no longer have to commute so it gives me more to save. Another way I began to self-care is that I have been training on the mountains to improve my driving ability for when I eventually compete in time attack trials. As for my well being, I am fine. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2442,"Online classes have actually made my life a bit easier but at a cost. Arriving to class has never been easier and its been a lot easier focusing on schoolwork. However, I have not been able to see my friends very much and it has taken a small toll on my mental health. I really miss seeing my friends, hanging out with them, and studying with them. For now, the most I can do is call them over the internet and keep on pushing forward with my school work."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2438,"Online classes have made it pretty difficult for me to learn the subjects I'm being taught mostly because I feel like I can focus much more on my work in a school environment rather than at home. The pressure of a teacher physically being there is stronger than watching one through a screen, so I feel more inclined to take notes and do my work due to that presence. Also, it's much easier to get help in tutoring if you can walk in rather than schedule an appointment each time. There could be technical difficulties causing problems in learning because you can't clearly hear what a professor says or you disconnect from the class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2443,Online classes have been a real change in the way I take my classes. I originally thought that I would learn better online instead of in class but I quickly realized that was not the case. I found out during online classes that I actually learn better in class without the distractions of other things in my room. I also really wish that I had taken the labs for physics in person because I feel it would have made me learn the subjects better. For self care I found out that keeping a schedule during the week has helped me a lot to stay focused and not loose track too much. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2437,"Online classes have definitely made it more difficult to learn. Interactions in classrooms are not the same, so communicating information during online lecture does not get communicated as well as information in in-person lecture. The loss of the feeling of community also makes it more difficult to power through assignments. Having classmates and studying together in person was very helpful pre lockdown. Sometimes you could gain valuable insight while studying with classmates. It also gave you an opportunity to teach someone if they needed help. Teaching a classmate who is confused helped to solidify information. Mentally I have been doing okay, but I do hope we can return to in-person classes to have a proper learning experience."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2431,"I think online classes have definitely impacted my motivation to go to classes and actually learn. I think staying inside all day isn't good for my health as well, so I try to go out sometimes to get some fresh air. I think when we go back to in person classes next semester, I probably won't be used to it and it would be harder to get back on track.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,2441,There's a good side and a bad side for online classes. The bad side is that it is really difficult to build meaningful relationships and friendships on zoom or discord. Class material and concepts that are easily explained become more difficult to explain over zoom lectures. For self-care I recently started working out and also started to developing a positive mindset when facing challenges. My concerns are that I am missing the real university experience with all these online courses. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,7,380,"Online classes have really impacted my life over the past year. The way that instructors have had to transition makes it very difficult because they do not fully understand how it feels to learn virtually. Not being able to have peers in your class that can help you out or support you, and not having a better connection with your instructor can impact you immensely. Even just being at home all the time is very draining and makes it hard to focus. Its not easy when the line between school and home disappears. I have definitely experienced lack of motivation and distraction while virtually learning. It is really hard to motivate yourself on your own when you feel that way. I also think many instructors in my STEM classes are so scared of students cheating, so sometimes the work is 10x harder than it usually would be to prevent cheating. I completely understand where they are coming from, but in my opinion if you cheat, it only hurts you in the end. Especially taking the amount of units that I'm taking, having to do more work than necessary in every class can be very overwhelming. "
