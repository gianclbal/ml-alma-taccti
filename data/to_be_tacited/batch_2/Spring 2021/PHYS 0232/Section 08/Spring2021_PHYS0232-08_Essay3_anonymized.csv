2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2455,"The most interesting topic I found was the potential energy once. Let's take an example of a car on the road offer another example of potential-to-kinetic energy, whether driving a gasoline-fueled automobile or an electrically powered model. The fuel stored in a gasoline-powered car's tank is potential energy, ready to be used for transportation; the ignition, spark and firing of the engine begin the potential-to-kinetic cycle, and the car's response as it leaves the driveway and heads onto the road is an extension of kinetic movement. Electric cars store their potential energy in batteries, waiting for the switch-on that begins their driver's kinetically-powered trip. Nowadays, we will be working with electric car in which the main concept is of the potential energy that same we sure in the cells. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2117,"Can objects have negative or positive charges?The answer is yes, yes objects can carry a more negative or positive charge. No this does not mean an object has just one kind of charge, this simply means while there are 10 positive charges on an object there are also 30 negative charges associated with that object as well. Having a dominantly negative charge, thus the object has a negative charge. We found that to be true in Lab Exploration (charge) in week 2. When we ran our simulation ""negatively charged objects"" still also had positively charges as well, we saw this when testing charges on our sweater and wall in the simulation.Why might this be of relevance for you?This might help you in designing complex next level projects. While for now we can see it in small things for example in our lab we were able to recognize and realize that same charge tape strips repelled one another while differently charged tape strips attract, could be of great importance in the big picture. During the lab we are talking about small objects but imagine this on a larger scale? What if you are working with large scale objects that have to be able to move with charges, this would be a big break for large engineering projects in different industries."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2448,"The concept of Short circuit was better explained based on last weeks lab. This helps provide the world the proper voltages that are calculated and measured for daily usage. This also helps protect everyone from hurting themselves due to high voltages. This information is used to help society because almost everything we use nowadays revolve around electricity and circuits. We need it to safely power on all our devices. I got to see what would happen if you do unintended contact of components and consequent accidental diversion of the current. This caused the smaller sliver of aluminum foil to conduct and burn. This is a result of a short circuit; this is why things are calculated so they are created to be safe for consumer usage. This was based on a simple simulation created from linking 3 batteries together and adding two lines of aluminum foil at the end of them. This is where a resistor is created by making the sliver of aluminum foil a little bit thicker and larger. This will not conduct the aluminum foil as fast and would be a considered as a fully capable resistor to help contain that current so that whenever it makes that contact, it will not combust immediately."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2449,"The concept that I chose are currents. Seeing how electricity is very much incorporated in our daily lives, one would wonder, how would we live without the use of electricity or energy? Thanks to the lectures and labs that I have worked on, I now have a better understanding of this topic and can discuss a bit on how this applies to our lives and benefit society as a whole. The current that we have discussed in classes are used everywhere in our lives and even powering the computer that I am using right now. With the current that is running through each appliance that I use, it powers the light bulbs, refrigerator, and computer that I use on a daily basis. The current that flows through each of these goes at a constant rate depending on if it is a single circuit. However, when there is more than one in a circuit, the current is spread evenly between all that is needed. Depending on whether the circuit is series of parallel, the current will decrease or increase. If the battery is too strong and the resistance is too small, the thing that is being powered will explode and thus cause a fire. However, if the resistance is too high, then the current will be unable to go through to what is wanted to be powered."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2129,"A few weeks ago we learned about the flow of electric current through a circuit against resistance. We tested this idea by creating a circuit with aluminum foil and a battery. We saw how current flowed through the material, and we connected a small piece of metal to the circuit that did not have enough resistance, and because we had so much current from the battery, the metal burned itself out, causing the circuit to short out. This concept is applied in terms of fuses in electrical systems, common in cars, where 10-30amp fuses are layed out throughout circuits to take the heat in case a circuit fails, as to not destroy any critical components in the circuit. The same principle is also used for breakers in homes for lighting and appliance circuits, where the breaker can be flipped to re connect the circuit and to prevent failure of appliances and lighting systems."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,130,"Something that seems to be a point of confusion and seems pretty simple to me is resistance vs resistivity. Resistivity is a constant that is linked to an element such as gold(Au). Resistance is the total resistance of a wire or a part of a circuit that takes into consideration the length, width, and material of the said wire. An equation is used to find total resistance while resistivity is always given. It is like finding the area bounded by multiple curves in calculus. That is a simple way to look at it. Mostly everything in physics is also like this; we are given a certain amount of constants and we need to find the unknown value, deriving the answer from our seemingly endless number of formulas and equations. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,150,"A concept that I really enjoyed going over in Physics Lab was the concept of circuits and current. A question I have is if a current is closed, then does that mean that the current will continue to flow and power a source until something interferes? Professor Violeta talked about this in lecture. To answer this question, not necessarily because she said that the battery would obviously die and therefore not be able to fuel the circuit any longer. Once the chemical reaction is done in the circuit, it results into a clustering of electrons at one end of the battery so theres an imbalance which doesn't allow it to function properly.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2447,"Although we are learning about it now but I serious think capacitor is really a helpful information to know because we are learning how engineering of the electricity works in our objects. There are switches that disconnect the current from reaching the other side that might not light up the bulb or You have battery which can be a source of the energy of the currents in the wires. You also have resistors that decrease the strength of the current. You have short circuits that can make current flow to the shorter path because other path might have higher resistors meaning a higher resistor will receive less current, resulting dimmer light bulb compare to the light bulb connected to the short circuit. Real-life example for this can be Fuse. If you have a strong current flowing in the wire, the fuse will cut the wire so it doesn't make fire and cause damages to the object. One of the way for you to stop from this happening is by putting more resistors. All the technologies around have some part of information about this. More examples can be cars, circuit breaker in our apartment where it is similar to fuse but it does not break the wire, but it will turn the switches off so no more current can flow into the object."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2445,"In our world there is physics everywhere around me we can’t live without physics, from the planet rotation to the moving of the small object everywhere there is physics. the topic which I learn in the last week about the circuit and current. it helps me to understand the flow of the current at our home another places . the flow of the current and circuit  help me to understand  main concept about the current and types of current "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2450,"I believe the lab in which our instructor taught us how to create a short circuit with tape during zoom video call with the class was great. We used batteries and tinfoil, it was a great demonstration on how a short circuit that is and generally all around our house. It taught us generally about how circuits are and most importantly the do’s and don’ts. Such as when connecting wires it can create sparks even a small invention such as this. Also, Silver combusts because the electrical current is flowing throughout the short circuit. Going from right to left and around so when it touches such it can combust. More general knowledge we have gained includes the wider thicker wire has low resistance meaning when connected there is no sparking/combustion for it has high conductivity. In regards to wires in my daily life If there is an overload or simply too much current than the fuse wire will conduct and take in all the power causing it to combust instead of the other equipment. (In order words, protecting the other equipment essentially) And Fuses should always be in a series because if it is connected parallel then it will short circuit and not work."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2456,"One of the topic that I really enjoyed working with is the electric field and the electrical charge. first of all because of it's importance almost all the class of physics two is about this topic deeply. secondly,  as an electrical engineering this idea of the electric field and the electron spinning around the neutron is just amazing for me. not because it sounds or looks interesting it's about how it's apply to our real life and to the small things around us. as well as the fact that it explains a lot of electrical physics as well.   "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2453,A concept that I found that can be applicable to people lives are the electric circuits because almost everything we operate has one. If you do not handle is carefully it will short out and sometimes that can be a big problem if that were to happen in your car. Without circuits we will not have any electricity and things would not be the way they are now.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,149,"I am surprised on how the current work differently than how I think it normally function. but after learning about energy, and different matters within the current, I realize how different it work and how it's possible for the current to cut. and now I know how my electricity at home short circuit back then."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,161,One concept that we learned about the past week was about electric fields. What is electric fields? From what I have learned electric fields are generated by charges and charge configurations such as capacitors. Electric field is important in peoples live because electric fields are present when you are getting an x-ray. With X-rays you can solve many problems about the human body or any organisms. This benefits society because with electric fields you can potentially save many lives.   
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2446,"One concept we can take from the lectures and labs is the concepts of capacitors and the inherent dangers they pose if not handled properly.  For lecture, I remember a homework question from chapter 25 asking why it's dangerous to touch the terminals of a high voltage capacitor even after the applied voltage has been turned off. From reading the chapter, I concluded that there can still be some charge left on the capacitor despite turning off the applied voltage. And in addition, to make the capacitor safe to handle after the voltage source has been removed, one can handle the capacitor with an insulator or attach a resistor to it to discharge it. In last week's lab, we explored circuits and how they work. We connected three batteries in series as part of a circuit and conducted charge through thin strips of foil to make a small piece of foil glow. I can recall the several safety warnings in the lab exploration instructing us not to touch the wires together. Doing so would've shocked us due to the high potential difference between the foil and our fingers. The point is, when we educate ourselves or get educated on how circuits work, we become more aware of the dangers they pose if handled incorrectly and know how to avoid potentially fatal accidents."
