2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2456,"This question is divided into two parts. the first half, is what are my goals? i've been into electrical engineering and i'm pretty interested in engineering and it's different majors. like electrical, computer, and mechanical engineering. the first and main goal is to be expert and learn a lot about engineering in general and electrical in particular. this class will help me a lot because it discusses a number of main concepts about physics which is about electrical fields, and charges and a lot of main ideas. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2453,"My goals for this year was trying to pass all my classes because of all the stay at home situation, I feel like it makes it harder to focus in my classes. At the same time I want to also balance things this year since it is so different and it really took sometime to get used to. My main goal in life is to start finding jobs that relate to my major so I can have more background in that area, that can also make it easier to get the job since you have some type of experience. This class can help me achieve my goals by just keeping the way it is because it does not give me a load of homework to do and I hope it stays this way throughout the year. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2455,Physics is a field in large expansion in the direction of computer science and numerical calculus. Almost every field of modern physics requires numerical computation that eventually is pretty big and demanding both on hardware as on algorithmic and parallelization side. I am majoring in computer science where major of the part includes problem-solving where we have to apply basic algorithm and calculus knowledge. Here working with this physics lab it helps to break down the problem into small problem that helps to solve the problems easily. Working closely with teammates helps to increase the team management and handling skills. A simple diagram in computer science is very hard to understand where here we are working to understand the diagram. Physics is everywhere around us we just need to understand the concept. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,190,"My goal is to be able to push through the rest of the semester. Although not all of the issues I had last semester is resolved, there has been some improvement. I was guilty of submitting things late last semester and,  although I am submitting things late now, it wasn't nearly as bad as last semester. It used to take me weeks to do an assignment due to the lack of motivation. However, I told myself that I would do better the next semester. I may be turning in some assignments late, but it is never as late as I would turn in last semester, so I am a bit more proud of myself for this semester. I think it is just best to be understanding when things get turned in late. Some of my classes don't accept late work at all and it does make my stress levels go higher, especially when due dates change or when I have many things due on the same day. All I can ask for is to be understanding!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2117,"I am a little anxious as I am writing this as I have other things going on and I am thinking about those things as I write this, hopefully by the end of this I am a bit less anxious. My goals are to hopefully get an Engineering Degree in Mechanical Engineering. This class is one of the fundamentals in my foundation for that degree. It's scary as learning can be hard and scary but we must take it as it is and fight it. This class will hopefully allow me to increase my knowledge in physics and applying those situations to real world problems with hands on experience. At least the most hands on it can be when going through zoom university. To be honest I am scared to join the workforce as I feel ill prepared and feel the reality as once that happens I am a real adult. The gap between University and Reality is terrifying, I really do feel the feeling of not wanting to grow up. The feeling of not knowing what is happening and just standing around as time passes us by is again, terrifying. I think that this feeling also never goes away regardless of age or job status. It makes sense as to why so many 40 and even 30 year olds have ""mid-life"" crises, life is scary age doesn’t make it any less scary. As I am finishing my writing, I feel a little better. As if those big problems we have maybe aren't so big, maybe we will be okay.Thank you for providing a safe space as writing this and letting out maybe even just a little and being off topic made me feel a little more sane than I did before writing."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2448,My goals is to get a better understanding of the subject. To pay attention and make sure to follow what is being asked within the course. By taking this class it'll help me advance in my skills as a student for my upcoming classes and duration here at SFSU. This is a requirement in order to graduate as a computer science major here at San Francisco state university. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2447,"Since my Professor Ligouri really doesn't teach during the class, you as my lab teacher teach more than her and I thank you for doing that. It really helps a lot because she expects us to just to textbook chapters and videos that are on Online on Youtube or Khan Academy. Not even a video that she herself made, but videos that are accessible for free for other people as well. I complain about that because I am a student who pays for the class and I am not getting much out of it. So this class, lab class, can help me achieve my goals by helping me finish Physics 230&232 as a Prerequisites for Computer Science Major. My goals is to finish Physics on best of my abilities possible although one of my professors is not working. Your lectures on the beginning of the class time are very helpful and I encourage you to do that as it will help me understand for the lab because I don't think I would understand much clearly without it. Through the lab, I can actually work on my skill I learn in this class and whenever I have a question, I can actually call you through zoom instead of getting ghosted or getting yelled by the main Professor during class time."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2129,"Overall, my goals in life are to achieve academic excellence by completing my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering in order to lead me into a path of success in a field where I can apply my knowledge to the field of automotive engineering. My class experience in electromagnetism will pay off when I am working on computer based systems as well as any system with microcontrollers affecting mechanical movement in any automotive applications."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,150,"I am taking this class because it is a requirement for my major, which is Civil Engineering. I took Physics 1 with the lab last semester and I learned the introduction and basic principles of Physics. Therefore I hope I am able to learn more in this class. My goal is to learn as much as I can so that I am therefore prepared for my job in the work force and I can complete my job to the best of my ability. This class will obviously help me achieve those goals because Physics is a significantly major component in Engineering. It helps us understand how to build just about anything and the weight it can hold. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2445,"every person in the world has a goal if they try hard to fulfill their goal then they will definitely fulfill their goal. Setting goals gives me long-term and short-term motivation. It also gives me the confidence I need to achieve higher and more complicated goals. By setting goals and continually reminding myself of them, I feel as though I work harder to achieve my goals. my goal is to become a software engineer and after doing a job for three to five years i will start my company. so my passion is in computer science but my interest in the business., so now I am confused that which path I should follow. As I have taken computer science as my major so physics was my requirement so in my field this class is my of no use "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2451,"My goals are to succeed in physics. I think that If I allow this class to give me some sort of extra practice, then succeeding in physics will be really easy, or much easier. I also don't want to fall behind. because then I just get more stressed."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2454,"My goals in the short term are to be able to graduate with the next few semesters with my degree in Computer Science. As for my long-term goals, I would like to able to find a career that would bring me the most happiness rather than the most pay. How will this class help me attain those goals? Well, the quick answer is that I need to pass this class since it's a requirement for my degree. On a larger scale, I believe the lessons taught in this class will help me break down complex situations that may come up in the solution by breaking down the problem and analyze them."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,184,"The reason I went into the STEM field is mainly because I am a first generation student although I do have two older brothers that went to college as well, none of them ever really finished. My goal is to graduate college and get a good job in the STEM field because at that time my parents needed help financially and they had started their families already. So the burden kind of fell on me in a way to set an example for my younger sister and to get an education and bring my family forward. But not saying that I was forced to go into STEM but at first was interested me to go into STEM was the financial aspect of it and knowing if I got a good job in the STEM field I would be able to provide for my family. That changed. I slowly became more invested into the STEM field after I took my first CS class and even as a kid I loved messing around with computers and learning how they functioned and wanting to know how games were made."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2446,"As a computer science major, I’m required to take physics for my major requirements. It could be how the class was run, but I thought that taking physics 220 last semester was a breeze. The class was structured well with plenty of support should we have needed any help. Also, the subjects discussed weren’t too complicated and felt like kind of a refresher from high school physics. However, this semester, I feel like it’s a bit different. The topics we’re covering seem more complex and not as straightforward. And because of this, I find physics 2 to be more challenging this semester. I’m sure this is already the purpose of having labs in the first place, but my goal is to treat this lab as a sort of review to help further my understanding of the concepts learned in the lecture. After all, we practice and use the concepts/ideas we learn in the lecture class by performing “hands-on” experiments in this lab class. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,130,"My goals right now are to make sure I have a good foundation to build a career off of. I hope for it to be in the engineering field so physics is definitely something I am paying close attention to along with my other classes like calculus and coding. The physics lab is somewhere where I can actually see these equations and numbers and letters come together to solve a real-world issue. It really helps me understand better instead of just staring at math problems, I get to actually participate in using them. This lab has also helped me grow my team skills as we usually work with a small group. This is very important in the engineering field; getting input from multiple brains and bounding ideas off of each other is something that I can see happening every day, so it is nice to work in small groups. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2450,"My main goals for this class is to participate every day on Thursdays but most importantly be attentive in the class even though it is all online (zoom classes). It is a commitment that I should do that so not only do I know the material but also prepare myself for what I am about to do. Attending/being attentive during class especially having a great instructor to help one guide themselves through these labs because is long and is very helpful. Not only will we have the instructor to help us but we will also have our peers as well. It is a good thing we have a zoom chatbox for anyone that is in the session to communicate with one another as well. In addition to the chatbox, we can also contact one another outside of class because we can easily ask one another in the zoom call or use the chatbox which I have done before. I also would want to keep up with my other physics class because most of the material is taught before this class so I am also up to speed with that because most material is related to one another."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2081,"At this point, even though I’m a mechanical engineering major, I don’t really know what I want to do in the future. As of right now, my goals for the future include learning as much as I can about various concepts of math and physics to help me figure out what I want to do in the future. This course is crucial for that goal because the type of critical thinking required for these labs will help me immensely moving forward. The labs offer an excellent supplement to the material covered in lectures, in that the theories and equations that I learn are then proven in real life during lab. Another goal I have is to simply understand why things are the way that they are, and physics, at its core, strives to answer those questions."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,161,"My goal is to pass all the classes, and graduate in time with a degree. My ultimate goal is to find a good paying job where I actually like to work, and the working environment is friendly. I think this class can help me prepare for other upcoming classes, and this class can give me knowledge about physics. With that knowledge I can carry it over to everyday life situations or carry it over to other related classes. Passing this class and gaining new knowledge is like the roots to my goal. Since this class is online it also provides me with extra experience because online classes teaches you to use your resources."
