2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2445,"Since childhood, I was interested in mathematics so due to interest, I have the class to learn abacus and Vedic math in childhood apart from my study .then after as I was introduced to computer language in 10th grade. as like other children I was also fond of gaming. then after 10th grade, I was introduced to core coding so I got interested in that, and then after I have complete a government-certified course and I choose it as a bachelor stream. in the future, all the work would be done by computer so there is a huge scope of success in the future in this field, as money is the primary thing in one 's life so in this field there is also big money. after seeing money and my interest in coding. after doing a lot of coding and completing my assignment till midnight I was never tired so I love it thus I choose stem field "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2446,"My inspiration story isn't very interesting, but here it is. When I was a junior in high school, it was college apps season, and I struggled to come up with a major to declare. And after careful consideration and advice from friends and family, I decided to pursue computer science. I wanted to go into STEM for a couple of reasons. First, I think STEM is cool and very interesting. It's always changing and evolving in today's modern world. Second, I wanted to pursue a major that guaranteed a good salary and high job security, very typical. There are so many opportunities and a high job demand in the STEM field. And lastly, I want to make a positive impact on the world and, with my CS degree, get into a profession that would help people or solve world problems. For example, CS is becoming more and more involved in the health/medical field, and it would be amazing to do work that could help improve everyone's quality of life."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,130,"Ever since I was young, I wanted to go into the stem field; figuring out how things worked and discovering different ways to get to the same solution has always been one of my favorite things to do. Math and science were always my favorite subjects in school and when I took my first physics class it felt like a lightbulb went off in my head. It seemed to all come together; everything I loved about solving problems and figuring out how things work just all came to fruition. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2447,"I joined the STEM field because I would to be a Computer Scientists and I am looking to make a website also known as Web Developer. During last semester when I was taking the Web Site class, I realized that coding websites and styling and implementing code was very fun and exciting. So that is why I want my career to be web developer for now. If I am honest, if it was not for the money I would not have joined this major. This major is secure for job and high demand. I do like solving math problems, but I do not like science because I think it is more work trying to understand Physics. Whenever I have a hard time understanding or hard time solving a problem, I love to work hard to research and try and error to solve the questions, and When I am able to do so, it is the most amazing feeling ever because of how much effort I put it in. And next time I would see this problem, I would know exactly how to solve it because I put so much sweat on it. This is why I would like to go to the STEM field. Money, jobs, comfort, and satisfaction when solving problems."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,190,"I want to go into the STEM field because it is what interested me the most. Technology has made such an impact on everyday life and I think it'll be interesting to learn, especially when it comes to how technology is made to work. I always found the inter-workings of technology to be interesting, so I decided to pursue a career in the STEM field. It is definitely hard work, but it is good to think that one day, I will be in the field being part of the impact that made so many changes in society. Technology can only grow more and more advanced, so to be a part of something so big and important motivates me to continue the path I chose and see to it until the end."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2081,"I think I just fell into this STEM field (Mechanical Engineering) because I didn’t know what else to do. I had been good at math growing up, so I just assumed I was going to end up in some part of STEM. I decided to pick this field because when I started college, all of my friends had majors picked out and knew what they wanted to do in their lives, so I kind of panicked and decided to go into this field. I’m certainly interested by certain concepts in math and physics, especially when I can learn how those concepts can explain the things going on around me in the world. At this point in my life, I really don’t know what specific part of mechanical engineering I want to specialize in, but I hope something piques my interest so I know what I want to do."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,149,"I want to get into STEM field because I want to become a data scientist in the future in the post graduation of my undergraduate of Computer Science study. I do hope to continue onward to graduate school at UC Berkeley (my dream school) for the Master degree in Data Science since the degree itself does not offer as undergraduate. I love looking at data, coming up with solutions, messing with database programming language like SQL, Python. I am hoping to even go higher too to obtain a PhD in that field myself after gaining my master in Data Science, and probably looking into little bit of political science and game designing since I do love to meddling around with different topics on my free time to educate other people about how things work and using art to release my stress, beside playing video games all the time."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2448,"I got into the STEM field primarily for my major which is Computer science. I'm taking the required courses needed in order to graduate as a Computer science major. I enjoy programming along with understanding the fundamentals and theories that go behind it. I also enjoy seeing my code come to life and to see what I can do once I graduate. I've always enjoyed science and seeing the motion of how things are done. There's usually a theory behind everything that's backed with extensive research and development. I also enjoy mechanics as well, such as working on motorcycles and cars. Seeing how they function and what each part does also really intrigues me as well. In terms of technology its amazing how people can come up with ideas and turn them into reality by creating software that makes everyday life more seamless and optimal. I also feel that being a computer science major will help with any future endeavors that I'll have in my oncoming years of education."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2449,"Why I want to go into the STEM field is due to the fact that I find it enjoyable. I think that discovering new things and understanding why what is happening is happening is fascinating to me. Another factor for going into this field is to create applications that I would later use for things I play or do in the future. I want to be able to create my own things without having to rely on another person to complete the job for me. This way, I can solve my own problems and have some self-satisfaction. A reason for going into STEM as well is because none of the other fields interested me as much and I was more interested in technology when I was little. In the future, I want to be able to create a game that many people would be interested in playing with all the criticisms that I have for games implemented. This way, I can create my ideal game and share it with others."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2450,"I want to go in the STEM field because I believe in this field and technology as a whole. I believe that STEM is the future and all the careers that you can do in STEM will be able to create a bright future. Not only for yourself but for the entire world as a whole. Many jobs in the future will be based around STEM and I believe you can do many things with a STEM degree because it is very versatile. For me personally, I am in the STEM field for Computer Science and I believe that in my journey to get this degree I will make many great friends and find my niche in the field. There is so much to do in the field of Computer Science that I just want to explore and figure out the projects I can do with my current skills. Though I'm still near I’m eager to find out what I can eventually do. I know I have to take small steps though and I’m ready for anything."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,184,"The reason I went into the STEM field is mainly because I am a first generation student although I do have two older brothers that went to college as well, none of them ever really finished. Because at that time my parents needed help financially and they had started their families already. So the burden kind of fell on me in a way to set an example for my younger sister and to get an education and bring my family forward. But not saying that I was forced to go into STEM but at first was interested me to go into STEM was the financial aspect of it and knowing if I got a good job in the STEM field I would be able to provide for my family. That changed, I slowly became more invested into the STEM field after I took my first CS class and even as a kid I loved messing around with computers and learning how they functioned and wanting to know how games were made."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2451,why do I want to go into the stem field? because it is the door to Computer science and any other math related profession. I wanted to be an architect because of my family. But highschool brought computer science into my life. That was when I decided to choose Comp Sci over engineering.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2117,"Engineering has always been pushed on my community, as we come from a town where Chevron is next door. I also come from a low-income community where often times your best chance to improve your future is through education that concentrates around mathematics, thus engineering it was. I do find the everyday world fascinating, how we walk around and dont question how that is even possible. We have been told especially us with parents who don't have a lot of education (not just through school, but education in general) that the world is just how it is because it is. Although thats not the reality, there is so much more to why we are able to walk around and not fly into space which is fascinating."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2452,"I got into the stem field when I was first introduced to robotics in middle school. I didn't know at the time that that was related to stem. Once I entered high school and they started doing career fairs I found that robotics fell under engineering. I already had found that I was decent at math. As the years progressed I learned more and more about the different fields of engineering. In my senior year, I decided on my major, mechanical engineering, as I enrolled in different schools. Now being three years into it I found that it is a lot harder and more complicated than I perceived it to be in middle school. I didn't really take into account how many different components go into engineering. As far as classes go I found that they all go hand in hand which makes it easier. Although it is a lot of work I found that I very much enjoy it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,150,"Ever since I was in middle school, I realized that I wanted to get a job that had something to do with math and thinking creatively. Math has always been my favorite subject, one that I actually enjoy learning in and challenging myself in, Therefore, I then started to research what jobs I could use math in, and the main one was Engineering. I have a lot of Civil Engineers in my family, my dad being my sole inspiration. I would go to work with him when I was younger and visit project sites in Napa Valley, and I could see myself doing that. About 2 summers ago, I got an internship with Solano Transportation Authority and shadowed a Civil Engineer, and I realized that I could actually enjoy doing what they do. So all in all, I know getting a degree in a STEM field will be challenging but definitely rewarding in the end. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2129,"When I think of why I joined the stem field, many things pop up into my head, and on top of that, many things fell into place over the course of my teenage years. It was apparent that I loved tinkering and building things as a kid, whether it was legos, small robotics, or building rockets with my dad. I was in love with all of it. Ironically, I hated math as a kid, but I loved science. As conflicting as those were, they later merged together in high school when I took my first physics class and 3 engineering classes. I then applied my knowledge to working with my hands in auto tech shop my senior year, where I got student of the year scholarship and realized the passion and knowledge I had. I was initially a CE major, but then switched to mechanical engineering, where I felt much better suited as opposed to construction and architecture."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2453,"I decided to join the STEM field because I wanted to stick to something about cars and  when I began to look into what kind of jobs that would work, I found that being a engineer can get me somewhere, but it also took me some time to figure out what kind of engineer I wanted. I figured mechanical was the path I should take because I like doing things hands on which helps me learn better as a person. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2454,I joined the STEM program because it is the path to getting into video game development. I have always loved video games and I would love to be able to work with various companies creating worlds and experiences for other video game lovers.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2455,"Well during my high school I spend most of my computer lab hours playing games but later on, I realize that I can make something interesting using HTML and later I start developing web pages for several institutions. Then later I was introduced to the word programming in which my skill of lazy worker became my key to success as I find the easiest way to solve the problem that leads my interest to pursue my major in computer science.Here in the world of programmers, we need to so talented that we should be irreplaceable in our field of interest. I enjoy doing coding and the best part of life as a programmer is that we can work as per our mood. I like to work till late at night and wake up late in the morning that late-night work gives me more interesting ideas and a pleasant environment to focus on my work.Every time money is not the only thing that we can achieve in our stem field. If we will be happy working with our field job our health will be healthy, with whom every we work with we will enjoy the company so that all thing I experienced in my stem field of computer science."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,161,"Well, first and foremost I need to go into the stem field because I am a Mechanical engineering major. I have to pass these other classes or else I will not be able to move on with my major courses. I also think that the things I learn in these classes might come in handy later on in my job field. All the stem classes are closely connected and they intertwine with one another. In order to pass one, you need a little knowledge from all the other courses from stem. Plus stem is also in a majority of the jobs we see today, and many of the high paying jobs are in this field. The stem field is usually challenging and I love to challenge my self when it comes to learning new things. This is the majority of the reason I choose to go into the stem field. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2456,"There are many reasons why I entered the STEM field. one of the reasons is actually the fact that I enjoy studying science. but going deep into science ( at least deep for me) is making me feel even more excited about my major. my major is electrical engineering even though I switched to it from computer engineering I still enjoy it because I always been amazed by the surrounding, engines, mobile devices, electricity, and a lot of staff that makes me comfortable about it.  "
