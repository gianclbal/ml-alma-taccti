2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2449,"How online classes affected my learning and my daily life in general is how I am more lazy when compared to before this whole pandemic happened. My online classes that I am taking are tough due to me not being there in person, so I know that I know I can slack off a bit more than if I were in the class in person. This is really bad in my opinion due to having my attention focused on other things rather than the material that is being taught. And I know that this is not good for when I get further into the class. I was always looking forward to going out before quarantine happened, but now, since most of my classes are online, I am sort of forced to stay on my computer a lot. And when I do this I tend to not eat as often as before. My concerns is that I won't be able to go back to how things were due to having lived in quarantine for over a year and I have gotten used to this environment. Hopefully, I can get used to going out once I get the vaccine so that when everything is over, I will not feel awkward for leaving the house anymore. For now, I still do some exercises so that I am not a complete couch potato in my home."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2450,"I feel like online classes haven't drastically impacted my life that much but the fact that I'm not at school makes it harder for me to get help. I feel like I lost a lot of on-campus resources as well as friends and peers to help me. I can't just bother all my professors past their office hours anymore! In terms of self-care I just talk to friends on a social media platform app called discord and so many of my friends have moved to that app because of the pandemic that it is nice to have since they're all there. In terms of concerns for my learning and well-being I just hope I pass all my classes, I am just aiming for a B in all of them or more if I can. I wish I had more at-home gymming material but I don't and I live in a relatively small place. I honestly just want everything back to normal so I can gym and be healthy again. I really miss that. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2445,"From day to day, the Covid-19 pandemic has changed the way people live around the globe. People will start realizing and doing more things, which they really enjoy, and hopefully, they will stop complaining about life itself. the way of study totally changes and my schedule is totally disturbed. As the world has adapted to the online way of study .this online classes have massively impacted my learning. I have visited the USA in January 2020 for my bachelor degree so I have only attained the university for 2 months then I have to attain the classes online and due to this I was not able to make friends and  I am not comfortable with the online learning as I don’t to study at home. I take very precautions because I am very afraid of corona. like washing hands every hour and going outside wearing the mask only and many other precautions also."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2129,"Online classes have made me a lot more relaxed while doing work, being in my own home environment and having everything I need at my desk, however, I significantly have a harder time keeping my focus while here at home learning from behind a computer screen. My self care has definitely increased while my anxiety has decreased, but at its toll, comes my focus and memory retention, which is now rather ""lacking"". I am hoping that going back to school in person, there will be some leniency with participation and grades, as we are totally shifting the way that we learn yet again. Everyone including faculty will need time to readjust and I think some understanding and possible curving would significantly aid this transition back to the way life used to be before the pandemic."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,149,"online is great, just missing the in person engagement between students and instructors. some classes I wish to be in person because it would be a lot more easier to understand than being online. not much that I have any concerns since if I feel stress or tired from staring at my computer screen long period of time; I would then take a break by going for a walk, coffee runs, snack, or sleep, or just hit a friend up for a drink or two at the bars and then back to the house sleeping a bit before continue more studying. I do find reading, listening to audiobooks by my favorite authors (Barack Obama and Michelle Obama) relax my mind, and drawing on my recent purchased on the new iPad Air and it pencil to take off all the stress that I always feel."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2457,"Online classes have impacted my learning in a positive way because it helps me organize time better in a way. Instead of taking some time to travel to classes or any traveling at all for classes, there is more time to get ready or review before I log on to a zoom meeting. I know there are others who do not feel the same as they are more hands on than learning asynchronously however for me, online learning was better for me as how I like to learn. The ability to find resources and hustling my way in getting information and able to expand the creativity in learning on my own by pushing my mind to think a lot more to get an answer without help giving me the ability to work without having my hand held every step of the way. The resources given by professors for any help is very helpful in a way where it is easier to contact them as we get used to contacting through online tools. Though some things may be better seeing in class or working in class there are many resources(videos) that help teach me in a way where I am still capable of understanding a certain topic easily. Even if there is something I am stuck on, like previously said the availability of contacting professors is easy through office hours online if I ever need help. Overall the idea of online classes something that hasn't really been a negative impact on learning or self care. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2455,"As per the situation of the COVID - 19 has made our life very difficult as we are only connected virtually. The experience of learning online has made all people frustrated as the productivity of the work is not proper we just passing our days. For me learning online is just a waste of time as we all have become lazy. Because of COVID-19, most professors and students suddenly find themselves forced to use technology as they teach and learn. Maintaining a regular schedule is important to your mental health. In addition to sticking to a regular bedtime routine, keep consistent times for meals, bathing and getting dressed, work or study schedules, and exercise. Also setting aside time for activities you enjoy. This predictability we can make ourselves feel more in control. A distraction can get you away from the cycle of negative thoughts that feed anxiety and depression. Enjoy hobbies that you can do at home, identify a new project, or clean out that closet you promised you'd get to. Doing something positive to manage anxiety is a healthy coping strategy. Don't become overwhelmed by creating a life-changing list of things to achieve while you're home. Set reasonable goals each day and outline steps you can take to reach those goals. Give yourself credit for every step in the right direction, no matter how small. And recognize that some days will be better than others. This all are ways that I have been trying and getting the most out of it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2454,"My learning has been drastically impacted during this time of online learning. Personally, I do better learning when I'm in a school setting. I find that learning subjects online comes with a lot of distractions. I am also not a huge fan of asynchronous teaching it feels like I'm better off just going to youtube and learning the topics there. As for self-care I picked up an old hobby of skateboarding to get some exercise since I do not feel comfortable going to the gym at this moment. My concern that I have for my learning is that I am not getting the full scope of topics compared to being in a classroom. I don't have any concerns at the moment when it comes to my well-being due to that I am receiving the vaccine soon and I keep my need to leave the house to a minimum."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2447,"Online classes have not impacted well on my learning from my perspective because I tend to keep it less serious and always attached to doing something else on the side. It feels wrong to not have phone during class or just doing anything on the side. I get distracted very easily. On the academic part, I have trouble as well. I would have to review a lot more than I should but often times I do not review the concepts after the class. I also use online a lot many times for the homework solutions to get help and I personally do not like that because I feel like I wouldn't be able to solve the homework questions by myself and have hard time during the midterm. I don't have the same excitement or the feeling when I wake up or go to sleep because I feel like I have not done much in a day. I wish professors can work harder on explaining and helping us learn better instead of some professor not even teaching at all and not even going over the problems to solve one by one. I wish we didn't have to rely on the textbook and other professor's youtube video for us to teach ourselves and do homework. I also think it's not worth of $1500 tuition as well. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2448,"This is my second semester here at SFSU as a transfer student and transitioning to full online courses haven’t been so bad. I like that I won’t have to commute to campus and worry about camping since its about 20-25 mins away from where I currently stay in. I personally don’t mind online teaching because it’s very helpful that our meetings are recorded so that way, I can go back over what was taught in case I needed to reflect on something. In terms of self-care I’ve been trying my best to get more sleep and work out when I can since we’re currently dealing with a pandemic. In terms of concerns for learning and my well being it doesn’t seem to bad at the moment. I haven’t ran into any issues or cons while going through online learning at this point in time. Overall, I would like to say that I prefer online classes more than in person lectures. We have more resources we can use to help learn the material better."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2117,"Online have been hard as hell for me, living and being at home 24/7 has been impossible. It has affected me in negative and positive ways. Its made learning material 10x harder because there is no pressure to go to classes, learn hard, and study. Everything is mushed up into one. It feels like I am in school all day since classes, studying, eating and etc happens in the same place. Being social in activities regarding school have been non existent for me, along with joining clubs, mentorships, internship opportunities. It's been super hard doing everything online. It doesn't help that there are already some generally bad teachers being, ONLINE teachers. In some ways I cant wait to get back to how it used to be but at the same time I'm scared to go back to reality.When you are at home people around you don't acknowledge that you are at school and trying to do work, they think you are just at home.These past semesters have been really hard, I hope those around me don't feel alone in the stuggle."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,161,"Online classes has changed my learning completely. Online classes has made me a little lazier, however it has taught me how to do research on subjects and help myself learn the material. Due to online classes I feel like I have more time to spend on one subject, and I have more time to spend on studying for a test or a quiz. Online classes definitely has its ups and downs, and the way I take care of my self so I don't overload on work is I either workout in my garage, play video games, or watch anime. By doing these activities I usually take my mind off of the stressful work. By doing these activities it also helps me prepare for any work that is assigned to me because after the self care session I feel more refreshed and ready."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2446,"My opinions about online classes haven't changed- I have mixed feelings. Some positives are that they’re more convenient in terms of commute time. You just need a stable internet connection and anywhere's your classroom, whether it's your desk or even your own bed. However, I find online classes to be unengaging for the most part, due to the lack of a real connection between student and professor. So the convenience factor may be a plus but learning is definitely taking a bit of a hit in a negative way, in my opinion.For self-care, I frequently keep in touch with friends. It's super helpful to keep each other in check and work together on homework. I’m fortunate enough to have readily available animal therapy since I have an adorable dog.I feel that everyone’s health and well-being are taking a toll because of this online lifestyle with increased exposure to screens and sitting in one place. I’m also not too confident that I’m learning my best and fear that I’m falling behind compared to other students who had a “normal” in-person semester. At least everyone is more or less going through the same thing, and we’re all suffering through this together. 🙃"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,130,"I feel like online learning has been a blessing and a curse. It definitely helps to schedule and it helps me keep on top of everything I am doing easier since less of my time is taken up by school because we are not there in person. On the other hand, I feel like online learning itself has been a very difficult transition for me. It is difficult to learn effectively while not in a classroom with professors there and peers to talk to. It is also much more difficult to stay on top of every single assignment for every class since we don't have the association of classroom, learning, assignments, etc. It is all based on waking up and trying to make sure you have all of your assignments for every class turned in on their own web portals or homework portals all before 11:59 PM. I feel like it is just a race of trying to read all the material, make sure you have the notes for the class, and making sure you know when every single assignment is due to allocate enough time to each one. This has been difficult because we don't have the professors there or peers there to remind us every day in class when there is something coming up. Another thing that is very difficult to deal with is trying to find enough time for self-care. Since we are all doping the same thing every day going to class at home, it is difficult to say enough is enough and take a break since we are not constantly moving around, I could be doing assignments for hours and hours and not even realize I haven't moved all day. It is seeming like the professors are assigning more work as well since we do not have that in-class experience and most of the learning done now is self-taught instead of collaborating with other peers and discussing back and forth in a classroom setting. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,190,"I think online class doesn't feel like school. Like I don't feel obligated to go to class, so I often opt out of going especially if attendance isn't required. I was doing fine until that grind season that leads up to spring break. I felt pretty dejected and unmotivated. I was just doing things because I HAD to do it and it was what was required of me. I wasn't intaking a lot of information anymore at that point, so midterms came, I just wanted to get it over with. As grateful as I was for spring break, it didn't help with the aftermath since even then I was still working on homework that was due during the weekends of spring break. I told myself that I would give myself a proper break and hold off on working on things for a few days, but I took that break for granted and left a lot of unfinished work. I kept telling myself that I should do the work, but then I started thinking about how much work it is and how tedious that it all was that I just didn't do any. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,184,Describe how online classes have impacted your learning and what you are doing for self-care. What concerns do you have for your learning and your well-being?The way online class have impacted my learning I would say it's definitely not for the good I feel like I’m more unmotivated to do class assignments and it's been difficult for me atleast to wake up and go to class knowing that I won't even pay attention to the lecture because it's harder concentrate just watching on a screen. What i've been doing so far for self-care has been sleeping and trying to get some form of exercise to take out all my stress. What concerns me for me is that if we do go back to school its going to be hard to break the habits I have created.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2453,"I felt like it was  hard to get used to the online learning and I found it very difficult to get use to. Overtime I did start to get the hang of it but I still do not like it and I hope to start school soon. Concerns I have is that I feel like I am not learning as much as in a classroom. To me it feels much easier having a person in front of me teaching me and also having classes online, it helped with time management so I would know which homework is due and such. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2451,"I think overall online classes have impacted my learning and learning habits in a negative way. For self care, I am mostly just hanging with my girlfriend and playing video games when I can."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,150,"Personally, online classes have negatively affected my learning experience. I feel like I am not learning much, because I am more of a visual learner and most of my teachers just upload pre recordings of themselves or have us watch other videos. Therefore, I feel like I am just going through the same motions every day and just trying to submit assignments by the deadline. instead of actually learning the material. However I have been better about taking my time and trying to learn. For my self care, I like to go on runs or do yoga and meditate. I think school is all about balance and having enough time for yourself to relax as well. "
