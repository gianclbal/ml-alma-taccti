2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,150,"All in all, I really enjoyed taking this Physics course with calculus incorporated into it. This is the second Physics class with a lab that I took at San Francisco State, and I definitely learned a lot of new things and went in depth of topics I skimmed over last semester. I had a lot of great takeaways from this class. One was that I actually learned new information about topics such as circuits and how electricity flows through them through the simulations and other activities we learned in lab. This class also allowed me to manage my time more efficiently and learn how to relate information learned in lecture to real life labs. I really appreciate everything Ms. Grigorescu did for the class!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2447,"I learned that there are always a way to help myself on my current concepts I am learning. Because my main professor does not teach and I am not exagerating, but my professor in Lab helps us actually learn the concept and being able to step forward instead of standing still and feeling like I am stuck. I like the fact about the Charges, how charge particles work and magnetic field using electron and proton as a coil. This class actually worked together as a team and students were actually active with the professor. This professor actually helped that big time and she help us with the lab and helps us go through in a flow. I also learned the relationship with the professor and student is really important because it gets students attached to the work materials and lectures she is teaching and feel like I have easier time understanding her and bored is not there."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,149,"the greatest take away from this class for me is the amount of helps and patient the instructor have been offer to help me succeed in this class. Aside from that, my classmates also help out with understanding the materials as well too."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2455,"Goals range over reinforcing content, learning about measurement and uncertainty, practicing communication skills, developing teamwork skills, and, more broadly, learning that physics is an experimental science. Some labs try unrealistically to hit all those targets.We and others have recently been examining how effective labs are at achieving various goals. What we’ve found is that traditional labs fall way short of achieving a frequent goal. The surprising—even shocking—results make a strong case for reexamining what lab courses are for and how they are taught. Fortunately, certain goals and teaching methods have shown good evidence of effectiveness. Moreover as my major is computer, where we have to work in group with teammates here in this class i learnd to work with people who i meet only vairtualy then also going great and learn the skill of team coordination. Setting goal and working till we didn 't achive it that was the main focus of the lab till we did""nt get any answer we work hard till end and rest our hard work pays off."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2454,The greatest takeaway from this class is that I learn more when the professor is more involved with the labs. The presence of the professor makes it easier to ask questions and get feedback during the lab just like how it used to be pre covid. Having that professor-student relationship is what I feel helps us as students learn and retain topics and subjects that is being taught to us.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2129,"My greatest take-away from this class is understanding how circuits work and flow far more than I learned before. Despite me being an avid car enthusiast, I did not know much about circuits and various components such as resistors and capacitors, and how these are applied. Through the hardships of the course thus far, I have significantly learned more about electrical systems that I have been able to apply while working on my car, which I am very happy about. I hope to continue to expand on this knowledge!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,161,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that you can learn about physics and how it works through stimulations. I always thought to learn about physics you had to be in class in person and do labs. However, I never imagined that you could learn about physics through stimulations such as the ones we used this semester. This semester really gave me a different view on learning, and I learned how there are numerous stimulations I can use to learn about physics. For future reference if I ever come across a physics question that I don't understand I will use the stimulations to help me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2449,"My greatest take away from this class I would say is how easy it is to understand most of the material than in the lecture course that is suppose to be taking alongside this course. I learn much more compared to the lectures that I am attending in the other class because most of the time the professor explains how to do certain things whereas the other one does not really teach at all and only says what we need to learn and go over by this week and then providing videos on the webpage. The step-by-step process that she uses for each lab really helps me learn since we aren't able to meet in-person, having her explain what she is doing over the zoom call helps me understand what is being done in the lab. Due to me being a learn-by-doing person, this really helps."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2446,"My biggest takeaway from this class is learning how to use technology more efficiently to get school work done. This pandemic has forced us to adapt to a drastically different lifestyle quickly. If it weren't for Covid, we'd all still be on campus and perform these labs in-person and work on the lab explorations face-to-face. For the past two semesters, we've learned the ins and outs of Zoom and, most significantly, screen sharing and Google Docs when it comes to working on our labs with our groupmates. One skill I've personally learned is how to use Microsoft Word extensively. I've always been primarily a Google Docs user. But since our labs are given in Word format, I've learned to adopt Word and familiarize myself with all the tools it has to offer. Some notable features include the equation editor and the drawing tool (I didn't know this existed, and you have to enable it in the settings). With the equation editor, I can type out sub and superscripts in equations correctly and accurately. And the drawing tool is super handy when it comes to drawing out electric fields or filling in diagrams usually done on paper. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2448,"The greatest take away from this class was learning how physics has so much involvement in everyday life. It has created new theories and formulas that helped the human civilization get to where it is today. We can advance in our continued research as to how physics works, thanks to this research we know the following. Theories such as  electromagnetism, electric fields, flux etc. are all replicated in tests to see how these are affected on objects. I find it so fascinating how science has developed over all these years and it will never cease to end as we find more and instances that have yet to be discovered. I didn’t know a simple pulley system had so many forces acting upon it. To the naked eye we just see two objects being pulled back and forth. But these machines are made from deductive and planned calculations which has a combination of forces, tension, gravity, etc. Physics overall is such an awesome subject."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,190,"I often turned to this class to help me with physics concepts that the lecture teaches that I don't understand. The power points that were provided has been a great help in helping me understand concepts and I am grateful for this class to act as a cushion of sorts for when the lecture isn't effective and I need to teach myself the concepts. The experiments were also a great help as I take information better when it is applied to the real world rather than by reading a textbook and a bunch of equations or just listening to a lecture with the same equations. The labs were a breath of fresh air from the constant calculation work that the lecture would give us, making physics a bit more enjoyable for me. There were many times where I got overwhelmed from the physics content that we would receive, but the labs and power points helped me work my way through the concepts and have a better understanding of them."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2117,"My greatest take away from this class will be about potential energy and how simply from your position you can hold potential energy. Along with Kinetic energy how by having movement you have kinetic energy. It is interesting to be able to have an understanding on things you can't see with the naked eye. The lab we had in this class was also really helpful in seeing something you can't actually see.Along with having a little further understanding on circuits was great. Understanding that some aspects in circuits are a bit more of common sense than we think. For example if there is a route that is ""easier"" for energy to flow through, they will take the easier route."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2457,"The greatest takeaway from this class is that to fully understand the topic of discussion, manually doing the experiment lets you see clearly how one object can react to another. For example learning about currents within wires from a battery and learning the direction and what each side of the battery does can be seen clearly when you do the experiment. So mainly throughout the class you understand that many times in your everyday life you come across things that have a complex internal working that you don't see. When we learn about the internal processes of certain things we can fully understand how the object works as a whole. That is why lab was helpful for me to understand when we can see an experiment work or even just doing an experiment. Electrical circuits really gave me a more understanding in things I see at home and anywhere that requires electricity."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2450,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that online physics labs aren't bad at all the way it was all structured was nice. I actually enjoyed physics labs online more than I did the other labs that I have in the past. I feel like many of the labs having the simulations online helped immensely and the fact that we are online just makes it so much easier. We didn't have to go to school to do these labs that many of which we could've done at the comfort of our own homes like we did. Our instructor was great, she stayed for the entirety of the lab to help us and many who stayed during that time finished the lab. We could choose which breakout rooms we wanted to be in and that was nice for a change. Furthermore, students were comfortable taking turns asking the instructor questions which I feel is more helpful because some students may ask questions that others didn't know they needed to hear or they just ask a better question if they may ask. Violetta made it a comfortable and welcoming class. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,2451,I think one of my bigger take aways is just the practice of the mathematics.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,8,130,"I would say that I have taken away plenty of useful tools and skills that will help me later on. One of the most useful takeaways from this class is just the overall knowledge and understanding of the physics of how things work. I love understanding how every little component of everything works and the more physics that I study, the more I understand about how the world works. This is something that I hope to take with me to my career and to continue to seek the knowledge that is out there to get a greater understanding of how things work on earth as well as maybe even get a little better picture of what is going on outside our world here on earth. Something else I will take away from this class is the use of cocalc; cocalc and other matlab programs are going to be very helpful in future classes and possibly a career as well. Coming from a background in coding, cocalc and matlab coding is very easy for me to understand so implementing this language in the labs really helped me better understand how to use it to make my life easier when doing these calculations in physics. "
