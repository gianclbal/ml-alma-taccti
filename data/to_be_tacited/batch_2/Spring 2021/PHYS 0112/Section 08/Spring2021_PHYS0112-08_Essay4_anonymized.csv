2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2285,"This is a difficult question to answer. I am a pretty independent person, so I rely on my own for things to support me such as income, motivation, school, and so on. I am grateful that I qualify for financial aid and that I have enough financial support to get me through school. I also have a place that offers enough quiet and alone time for me to study and get through difficult subjects. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2280,"I don't think that I lean on any resources.This prompt is too broad and I don't like it.I guess the resource that I rely the most on would be the internet.  I say this because it is the tool that I use the most, whether I'm having trouble with something, whether I want to learn something new or whether I just want to relax by watching cute cat videos on the internet.Academically, I've been struggling a lot lately.  I'm still trying to balance life and academics but for some reason, everything feels so heavy right now, and I don't think anyone is helping me in any way.  But I'm here and I know I'm capable, but I just want someone to help me out because as I said, I really need a hand right now..."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2287,"For me most of my resources to support come from my family and friends. For the most part, they have been there for me for specific emotional support. With the quarantine, I was lonely as I have ever been in a long time and through one specific friend in general I've been able to feel a little less lonely at this period of time. Academic wise my family has always supported me in my academic adventures through mainly funding my college tuition and my dorms so once I am able to get on my feet and make my own money I will definitely try to pay them back."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2288,"It's been difficult to handle the pressures of physics lab online but it hasn't been impossible. I have had the pleasure of returning back to the videos to be able to review the material and to be able to reteach it to myself. I initially wanted to take the psy class but it would not fit my schedule and I have been forced to rely on the videos to reteach myself. I also have the privilege to take an intro physics class in high school and was also forced to have a book with examples. This has been a lifesaver thus far and it has been my savior. I'm hopeful that I can continue to succeed this way and hopefully, I can take the Psy class next semester. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2281,"When it comes to academics, I get the feeling that most of my professors want me to succeed in their classes. I feel comfortable with sending many of my professors an email, attending their office hours, or staying after class to ask questions. Even when I have a one-off on a quiz or exam, I feel confident that my professors will provide me with the resources to improve my upcoming scores. When it comes to my mental health and emotional support, I have many friends to talk to. Sometimes I just want to get food and get away from work for awhile, or go for a walk, or play a game of chess. And for those who I can't see in person, I can talk to on video call or play some games with online. I think my friends, very symbiotically, need this as well. Even my brother and sister can offer me company when I just don't feel like being alone. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2294,"One resource that I have that supports me is my parents. My parents have always supported me and have always encouraged me to pursue my dreams and aim high. Even if they are not familiar with the college process or any obstacles that I face, they still show moral support. A second resource that I have that supports me is my friends. My close friends are the ones I have known for 6 plus years, and they’ve definitely seen me at my lows and highs. They are always so motivational, even though it may seem cliché, and they truly are here for me whenever I need it. A final resource that I have that supports me is the faculty here at SF State. I truly feel comfortable to reach out to my academic advisor, professor, counselor, TA, etc.…. if I need any help or encounter any problems. I’ve generally had a positive experience with all of them so far."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2299,Family is the one driving me to be successful. I am also doing this for myself because I really wanna be successful in life. I want to be a man that will my future children aspire to be.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2297,"""What resources do I have to support me?""I have my Pearson textbook, and Professor Dave on youtube has been my go-to resource for trying to understand the material.  Professor dave's youtube channel has plenty of beginner and more advanced concepts that you can watch in a comfortable setting in your free time."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2286,"I have many resources to support me mentally, emotionally, financially and physically. I'll start off with my parents, growing up they were my my rock. They held everything down for me. If I needed them, for anything, they would always be there with a lending hand. I have quite a few resources to account for. My time in the Navy has provided me the resource of have financial stability, but also the benefits of the Department of Veteran Affairs after serving time. These include home loans, disability compensation, tuition compensation, and housing allowance. For school, as I attend certain classes, I am also participating in study classes that provide me with the resource of a tutor and other classmates to guide me through difficult problems and the understanding of the topics at hand. Resources that support me outside of work and class, I am married, and my husband provides me with balancing things we must handle for our lives. He gives support in the day-to-day tasks that must get done so I can either have more rest or if I would like to spend more time and energy on other things. Another resource I have in the location I am presently in, being near 2 cities provides me with social opportunities instead of having only a few that are constantly available. This is especially crucial now due to COVID restrictions in place within some areas. I have more to describe, but this is just a few."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2279,"One of my strongest resources that I have that will always support me is my family. Especially my mother and grandma, whenever I need something or just need to talk to someone they are there with open arms and are ready to give me the best advice. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2284,"I have my friends and family to support me if I ever need help with anything. I also have really great professors who care for my well being and want me to succeed in life. Academically speaking, Zoom recordings for all my classes have been super great for me and they really let me understand the material. I know a lot of people hate Zoom for various reasons, but it’s been the total opposite for me. Pre-COVID, I used YouTube a lot because I wouldn’t be able to fully comprehend my chemistry lecture within the same day like most of my classmates so I would have to supplement, but the OrganicChemistryTutor was such a great resource for me. Professor Leonard was another great YouTube teacher that was a clutch resource for me. My fellow classmates have been so helpful too! If anyone has a question we try to answer them as best as we can and it really helps with understanding out class material too."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2293,"Personally I feel that I have a good amount of resources to support me in life. I feel that not only academically like things in school from counselors, advisors, or professors. Or resources like websites given to us but also a good set of friends and a great supporting family that helps me whenever im in need of help. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2283,"The resources I have to help me in school right now are: for physics, there's lots of good content on youtube and articles about physics principles. Plus I am i contact with some students in my lecture and we collaborate occasionally. Similar story with calculus. We have an online forum that we can post to too, and the teacher checks it often and points us in the right direction wjen we are stuck. For my geology major classes, there is a lot on the internet too. My profesors have been great to talk to during office hours and have been plenty helpful in helping me understand material from lecture as well. My other support resources are my friend, parents and grandparents, who I call or text sometimes just to talk and destress. My older sister is also a good person to talk to about school because she has been though school already and can help me when I have questions about uni. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2295,"I have many resources that can help me. I am so lucky to have the resources I do. I have my family's support in everything I do. My mom is a teacher so while she can't help me with stuff I need to know for my major, she's always there to help me figure it out or support me through other acedemic things. My mom is my biggest supporter and I am lucky for her to always be there. I know I have resources at school available to me that I could look at if needed. I know the food and housing resources as well as academic support from teachers or peer tutors. I know I can go to office hours if I need to. My friends support me in other aspects of my life which is nice because I don't need all my resources in one place. I am lucky to have resources for my well being and academics."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2282,"I tend to have a lot of resources to help support me! School wise, I used to be really stubborn and I hated asking for help just because I felt very belittled and stupid. Along the way I kind of just got out of that bubble and realized that it is okay to ask for help/ reach out! I tend to use my peers, professors, study groups and more to help me out whenever I need that extra bit of help. It is super beneficial and I feel completely comfortable with all of them to ask for that extra hand/ push! Emotionally, and thankfully, I have my family, friends, and professors/peers to help support me. This year has personally been one of the hardest years of my life, I have had a lot of ups and downs but I realized that communication is key and reaching out and asking for that extra bit help/ support is what helped me out a lot. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2296,"""What resources do I have to support me?""That is a good question. To answer this question, I have to identify what the word resource means to me. Personally, I think resources could be human, people who can ask with, online materials, and even experience could be resource thou. Resources are everything I can get to take advantage of. In this class, most of my resources are professor and classmate. They help me to step away from the error area of the lab of Physics. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2290,"Some resources that I have to support me are my family, friends and the activities that I can partake in. to start off, my family do a very good job in keeping me family orientated throughout covid times. There is a lot of love and support that they provide through hard times like these. When it comes to my friends, they help with emotional support. We still tend to have fun even though things aren't what they used to be. Since places are limited, We enjoy going to the park, bowling and all these other stuff. Now when it comes to my career, there's not a lot of resources. I fail to find motivation in times likes these to continue on with what I want to do. To enter a PT program, I have to have community hours/ volunteering hours, but with covid it makes it supper hard to even reach those ours. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2278,There's school resources that I know about for help with anything I might need such as tutoring if I need help with my course work and advisors that help me chose classes. There's also other resources for my mental health at SFSU. For when I feel stressed out and need to relax there's an emotional support cat or I can talk to a therapist at the college. There's a lot of resources at SFSU but I know I haven't utilized them as much as I should. I hope that once the university opens up I can start to utilize them more and realize these resources are here to support me and see me succeed. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2300,"When it comes to school, I have a lot of resources that I can rely on to help me. One resource that I utilize is counseling and advising. This resource helps me to know what classes to take in the future and they help guide me and prepare me for my future career. Another resource that I utilize is the internet. When I have trouble understanding a concept or a problem, I turn to YouTube or Google to help me understand and learn. There are a lot of resources that SFSU offers that I have not yet taken advantage of but will eventually. My family and some of my friends support me in everything that I do."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2301,"My family is my biggest resource that supports me. Without them, I would not be here where I am now and they are currently paying for my school and gives me food and shelter. They inspire me to do better and that I do not want to lose this opportunity to get the most I can with my education. They had a hard life in the Philippines and worked very hard for the kids that came here to America. We are the second chances for them to give back to our future children the resources they couldn't provide for us at such an early age."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2291,I have resources from school like the peer stem to stem program that connects people in the biology program to other people in the biology program that can help with anything they need. I also have my teachers that support me by holding office hours if we are confused about the material taught in class and they are always helpful in helping me understand the concept. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2289,"I have my friends and family. I have my local food bank that I volunteer at to support me because they are a place I go to because I cannot stay at home all the time. I have my co-workers to support me because they are there to support me socially. Moreover, I have my colleagues at SFSU to support me because they are who I message to work on assignments. They also hold me accountable to complete the assignments as we are moving towards the end of the semester. Also, when it comes to friends, I have someone to support me to go to places because I can go to more places when there are more people. Also, I have resources at SFSU to support me with classes. Specifically, I also have the internet to support me with my classes. Specifically, Youtube and Google. Moreover, I also have counseling at SFSU to support me choose my courses."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2298,"While I don't really use the resources at school, I do know that they're there. I just don't like talking to new people, and I feel a little bad that I go to them with issues that I'm facing even though it's sort of their job. I guess it just makes me a bit uncomfortable trying to lean on a ""stranger"". But I usually rely on my family because they're easy to talk to and I live with them, so I get answers right away whether I like it or not. I also just have random hobbies that I would consider support. Sometimes, it's just a way to help pass time if I'm bored, or it could be a therapy-like activity. It really does help my mental state, especially because I'm at home for most of the week. Since there's not much to do, playing instruments, exercising, and even chores have become ""resources"" of helping me calm down; it sort of brings me back to square one (not in a bad way)."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,555,"The resources I have to support me are my family and friends. I receive mental support from my friends, they encourage and give me great advice. There are multiple tutoring centers around the campus like the Metro college success program that are drop-in or the tutoring and academic support center (TASC), there’s appointments, drop-ins, and group tutoring located on the second floor of the library. There are Sci courses with concurrent enrollment of the class that you require assistance in, it’s taught by students that have already taken the course prior and are able to teach it in more similar and understandable ways. In the sci courses, we’re relearning or learning the materials before it’s taught in class is beneficial to remembering and understanding it more. We’re also practicing worksheets and mock exams than going over them is a good way of studying for the actual exam. There are also Counselors at the Metro College Success program to receive advice in anything.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2292,"The most important resource I have is my family in Italy. They have helped me in time of difficulty, especially financially, without them I would not be still here. I don't have a lot of friends, but the ones I have helped me a lot with several issues I had over the last years. My therapist I think has been the most supportive, listening to me during times I had no one to talk to. "
