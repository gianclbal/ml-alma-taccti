2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2285,"If I am being totally honest, I usually try to find an easy route around the situation. Being overwhelmed with a lot going on in my life tends to make me want to find the easy way out of things. Lately, this has been something that I have been trying to fix and break the habit of. Challenges should be something more motivating, something that makes you have to overcome, achieve and be proud to concur. Being able to change my outlook on this and decide that when things get challenging is more positive than negative. Finishing school is one thing that has been more challenging for me, I have made it a hard goal to stick with full-time and really push through these more difficult upper-division courses that I will be getting into. Talking myself out of this and not following through when things are tough is the ultimate challenge that I am focusing on to change and overcome. Not accepting tasks that I don't truly want to do and not taking to many tasks in at one time to avoid getting overwhelmed. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2286,"when my life gets stressful or challenging i tend to occupy myself with either exercise or bring out my creative side. I do not normally workout, which I should, but that is besides the point. I like to do a couple rounds of boxing. I have a punching bag in the garage and at times I will grab my gloves and start boxing. It gives me a sense of relief and satisfaction at the end. Usually when I am angry at my stressful situation I tend to do this and feel relieved at the end. Other times, when I am sad and stressed out I will start baking. I like to make cakes. Not your ordinary ""from the box"" type of cake, more like from scratch homemade cakes. I like to decorate them as if I was going to sell to some rich people. They come out so pretty and I am usually very satisfied at the end because I made something even during my stressful situation. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2278,"When life gets challenging I usually take time to myself by not going on my phone much, and just laying in bed sleeping or watching a movie, or listening to music. I find this really distracts my mind and I'm able to take a breather from reality. This really helps me when I mind something challenging and once I feel relaxed and relieved of stress I can go back and do what I need to do with a clear mind and attitude. I also try to stay positive and think that this little challenge I face won't last forever.If I'm stressed about school then I often try to talk to someone who can help me find a better way to deal with it. I know SFSU has resourced but I don't utilize them at all and I think that's something I should work on. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2280,"When life is challenging, I usually just flow with it.I have had come to the realization that everything will be solved at the end, and if its not solved, then it's not the end.  In this class I usually struggle a lot when it comes to homework (lecture), so what I do is I lean back and try to relax, to not be overwhelmed.  This is a common tactic that I use in everyday life, I would just lean back and analyze everything that's bothering me at the moment.  After I analyze the situation, I approach it from a different perspective, and it often works. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2287,"When life gets challenging I take a step back from everything and try to collect myself. During this time I spend a lot of time self reflecting and determine what are the issues in my life that I can control and those I can't. And if it's something that I can't control I try to come to terms with it and have the mentality of ""it is what it is"" and I'd rather not waste more time stressing about something that I ultimately out of my control and cannot change at all. With that, I often do relax things and stuff that makes me happy like spending time with my friends (online because of the pandemic), watching some shows, playing some games, listening to some music, etc. Overall when life gets challenging I try to approach it in the most logical way because like I said I do not want to waste any of my time, emotion, etc on something that is out of my control."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2284,"When life gets challenging, I try to meditate so I won’t get overwhelmed, but a lot of the times I usually forget to do it. I have a tendency to read fiction books so my mind can be transported to an alternate universe. I also like to play video games and easily lose track of time. Karaoke is fun for me too! I like to sing in front of my dog Stella. I know she judge me with my horrible singing skills, but she tolerates it. These distracting techniques end up helping me in the long run because I get the chance to be refreshed from whatever challenges I’m facing and I can now tackle the challenge head on. If all of my distracting techniques fail, then I usually cry which is just as helpful sometimes! Pent up emotions are no bueno and I’ve learned that it can actually make life more difficult and challenging."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2293,"When I find that life gets challenging, I like to pause for a moment and take a few minutes to think. What I really think about is what is it that's getting challenging in my life? Is it something that I can overcome easily? or something a lot harder to overcome? I then like tell myself that if I don't overcome this challenge all its going to do is set a road block in my life and stop me from accomplishing my goals in life. Once I tell myself this it gets me motivated to overcome this challenge and pushes me to overcome them. At times these challenges might get harder and sometimes you just have to go with the flow because in life if one faces these hard times then they enjoy the good things in life more."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2279,"When life gets challenging I tend to distract myself, escape reality. I'll scroll through tiktiok, watch my favorite tv show, or go for a walk. I try to imagine my life after this period time is over and remind myself that this state is only temporary. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2297,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?""When Life gets challenging I tend to accept the challenge, depending on how hard I want something. When life gets really Challenging I tend to procrastinate, if there is an issue I sometimes leave it for a later date or when it's more convenient. I like it when I can put my head to the grindstone and work hard, the sense of growth and accomplishment feels good. The only times I feel most bleak is when I feel like there is no objective for me to obtain. Sometimes I wonder if the career I am going into will be something I enjoy. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2300,"When life gets challenging, especially when I feel that all hope is lost, I pray to God. I am a religious person myself and it helps when I pray because it provides comfort knowing that God is listening to my prayers. I try to keep a positive mindset and I try to stay optimistic in spite of everything that is going on around the world. The world is not getting any better as of now but I believe that eventually, things will come to a balance and life will return to normal, if not better. If life becomes challenging when it comes to my own personal life, I pray and I meditate. I think about all the things that I am grateful for and I believe that things happen for a reason. I think that going through challenging obstacles gives me the opportunity to grow as a person. I learn to embrace my mistakes and challenges in life. I don't really think of it as a burden, but instead, as a benefit and instrument in helping me grow to become the best version of myself. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2283,"Not really sure how to answer this. I guess I'm of the mindset that life's challenges are never permanent and that any stump or obstacle or depression is alleviated by chugging along, and eventually you find a way to be ok with things, I dunno. This semester has definitely been an unstable period for me relatively speaking, so when I feel stressed or depressed I go for a walk or a bike ride or listen to some music or smoke weed or whatever because I know that this is not something I'll have to deal with forever. It sucks but there's not much I can do. I don't want to lean on my vices so much and once normal life resumes I hope I can easily bring back that part of myself that's still stuck in early 2020 somewhere. The transition is not going to be the easy peasy 'everything is normal again' thing that I'd prefer but we all are going through the same things together and I'm really not too worried because I know that when classes are back in person I'll have a social life again, and I'll be able to learn better, and all that. I don't intend to have not learned anything about myself or my life from the challenges of this past year-ish.Maybe in a more general sense sometimes I'll think about all the things in my life that I am grateful for and consider myself very privileged and lucky to have. Like walking less than 10 minutes down the street and sitting in the grass right by the painted ladies. Who has that kind of luck? Not that many people."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2298,"I have a somewhat specific schedule for exercising. From Monday to Saturday, I will work out around noon. It's mainly for self-discipline, but I also like to think of it as ""me-time"". It is a method of self-care, and not thinking about the worries in life gives me a sense of relief, so I always have that portion of the day to take a step back and give myself a reset. Another thing I do when life sucks is just doing nothing. Sometimes, when I'm stressed from an overload of work, I'll just stop; I'll get up from my desk and lay down in my bed. I'll just look up at the ceiling or anything that doesn't change much and space out. It'll take no more than like 30 minutes but it's effective. I get to think about whatever I want. It could be what I want to eat later or just a random scenario I make up based on anything that I've been interested in at the time. I guess that sort of thing gives me something to look forward to and sometimes motivates me to finish my work."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2289,"I talk with family and work. When I talk with family, I feel acceptance, and when I work, I feel a sense of social fulfillment. By feeling acceptance, I believe that there are people who are there to support me during hard times. Moreover, being social makes me feel better because talking to others means that I can still get out there and communicate with others and not be isolated and deal with problems on my own. Also, I take breaks and spend time with friends, volunteer, and shop. By volunteering, I feel better because I am being a part of something that is bigger than myself. Moreover, shopping lets me treat myself for all the hard work that I have put in. Also, realizing that hard times aren't going to be forever is something I always keep in mind. I reflect on how COVID-19 has lasted over a year, and I am still here and many people around me are still here too."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2299,"When Life gets challenging, I usually stand up and do not let it affect me. I focus on the positives rather than the negatives. Hate is everywhere in the world it is up to us whether to cover ourself under a blanket or stay out and live our life. I done know about other people but I would rather die being out and have fun and savoring my life which is given to me, rather than being safe and live with fear. I am an Asian, I understand that there are racism everywhere and people will treat us like minority, I really don't care about me. I always think if I act like a minority I will be looked as a minority. I stand up and act who I am and who I want to be, I don't please people to like me I would rather be hated for who I am than loved by everyone who I am not."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2281,"I know a lot of people who, when life gets challenging, their natural response is to make themselves busy, put themselves to work, and ultimately get their mind off of things. When life gets challenging for me, I like to think I make the polar opposite response. If I feel stressed, or angry, or emotionally distraught for whatever reason, I try to slow down my pace instead of quicken it. I sit down for a bit and close my eyes, take a quick walk, or do some online chess puzzles. Something that will make my breathing normal and get me deep in thought. I always have a fresh canvas ready, since I find painting to be extremely therapeutic (though I’m not very good at it). I read a new book, or pick up an old one that I found a lot of comfort in. And, I like to surround myself by people. It can be my brother, my sister, sometimes my parents, or my friends, though that last option is quite limited nowadays. I like to reward myself for "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2294,"Honestly the first thing I do when life gets challenging is stress myself out. I know that this is awfully bad and counterintuitive, but I cannot help but stress. I think that this helps me “relax” in some sort of twisted way because I just let go and like let it all out, so it will not continually eat me alive. Another counterintuitive thing I do when I face a challenge is procrastinating. I seriously do not attempt to “work” at the resolving the challenge until time dwindles down to the point where I then essentially must. It is like weird because I am stressed out with the challenge itself, yet I am also stressed out with not dealing with the challenge, so I find myself in a deadlock. I am trying to get better at coping with challenges in the sense of being more and self-caring and self-loving. I constantly have to remind myself that I don’t have to be working or studying 24/7 in order to be productive. One of my best friends has definitely influenced me to “take it easy” now and then by encouraging, or rather literally dragging, me out of my house and making me do fun and de-stressing activities."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2301,"When life gets challenging, I tend to go to the gym or go for an outdoor activity to release stress. As I try to do a physical activity, I tend to go more into my thoughts and figure out my life and how to properly change it for the better or give myself a breather to look back at the past and fix what I have to do for the future. However, there are times where life is too much to handle and I would call my friends to talk and chat to see how their life is going. Sharing life challenges and being able to understand and share similar struggles makes it easier because it makes it seem less lonely in the world knowing that one of my friends are constantly trying to do better for themselves even when life is hard, and that motivates me to work as hard as them."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2296,"On the road of life that we must pass, there are sometimes ups and downs like mountains, sometimes the wind and rain hit, difficult to travel; sometimes the weather is fine, birds sing and flowers smell. It’s not going to be smooth and smooth, and it’s going to be boring and lonely. With these difficulties and setbacks in the company, it will be another exciting, all-inclusive scenery. In the face of difficulties and setbacks, many people On the road of life that we must pass, there are sometimes ups and downs like mountains, sometimes the wind and rain hit, difficult to travel; sometimes the weather is fine, birds sing and flowers smell. It’s not going to be smooth and smooth, and it’s going to be boring and lonely. With these difficulties and setbacks in the company, it will be another exciting, all-inclusive scenery. In the face of difficulties and setbacks, many people choose to escape, did not challenge their courage, but to lower their heads to be a coward or even forced themselves into a dead end. In fact, the difficulty is just a thorn rose, just like a sharp thorn flower, contact with it will inevitably be a few sharp thorns. But this does not hinder our enthusiasm and courage to pick flowers, because the lessons of being pricked by Needles are in themselves a treasure, it will be for us to accumulate essential experience and experience.    I once read a story in a magazine about a famous company that was going to hire good people. Among the many people who applied for the job, there was a very good young man who did very well, all eyes were cast on him in praise. It was a blow when he was told he was out when he was so confident that he could become an employee of the company. However, half a month has passed, the director of the company said, “Due to a computer software problem on the day of the interview, the information of the outstanding young man was wrong, resulting in his being eliminated. They feel very sorry about it and hope to rehire the outstanding young man as an employee in their company.”However, the notice they sent out was returned and was told that half a month ago, the eliminated young man because can not withstand the heavy blow diving died. The person in charge of the company said regretfully: “Life on Earth, can not because of a setback from the battlefield if halfway, will regret life!”! Although that young man is very good, he is so weak that he can not stand up after a little setback, and our company is not willing to recruit such staff. facing the setback, some people take it as their friend and dare to accept its challenge and experience its charm, while others take it as their enemy and, in the face of a powerful enemy, lay down their arms and surrender to the enemy. Life is like walking, the head is the sun, the bow is the shadow, do not care about some personal gains and losses, mistakes, or failures, they are only a part of the growth of life. Failure is not a great tragedy, failure no longer with the fate of the next round of the contest, that is a great tragedy. Meet them unexpectedly, should greet them with a smile, accept their challenges, then experience that memorable episode, you will feel their infinite charm!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,555,"When life gets challenging, there is nothing that can recover me faster than music. Listening to my favorite music helps me feel refreshed and reduces depression. It calms and prevents me from overthinking about negative things. Sometimes life hits me hard at a certain point but I’m not overwhelmed by emotions when listening to calm, uplifting, and happy music. With this type of music, it motivates me to become more positive and erase my bad thoughts. It gives me the power to continue what I am doing. Nonetheless, music to me is something that I consider important in my life. Without it, I probably don’t know what I’ve done and if I was able to continue to be confident. However, music quickly became part of my mental treatment because it calms the nerves and helps my brain transmit positive signals to my body. That's why I have the courage to spend some time immersed in music when life gets challenging."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2282,"What I tend to do when life gets challenging is take a day off to really focus on my mental health and figure out what to do next. I tend to get a lot of anxiety and I tend to stress out super easily. Looking back, I have always been like that and it wasn't until I got older I ended up learning more about myself and how I can help myself out instead of just burning out or shutting down completely. when life tends to get challenging, I like to write out everything that I have to do just because it helps me feel more on track and helps ease my mind a bit. I also tend to listen to good music, work out, go on walks, practice breathing exercises, eat a healthy meal, or even meditate! Over time I was able to learn more about myself and how to really take care of myself when life gets hard just because I tend to feel like that all the time. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2288,"In all honesty when life does get super challenging or I get to a point where I'm about to break I go to a place where I find peace which is either the ocean or the golf course. both are closed at the moment, I'm literally just waiting. Now the alternative is to enjoy the cold weather and go into spring break with the intention to relax after these past difficult months.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2290,"When life gets challenging, I tend to remember all the other times where I overcame the optical that made me frustrated. This gives me hope to overcome whatever is in my way, I also learned how to monitor my emotions in a way where I don't get as frustrated with myself. I clear mind is what helps people overcome their challenges. Also, another thing that I do is dance, dance is a coping mechanism that makes me feels so much better, it clears my minds and it helps me better express my emotions by the song that I am dancing. Dancing has definitely helped, especially in times where I’m going through difficult times. Another thing that I do is eat a lot, I know its an unhealthy habit, but it somewhat helps with the situation that I am in. most importantly, the way I control my emotions in a challenging situation makes me over come the challenge  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2295,When life gets challenging I usually rely on my friends and mom for support. I am a big talker (im a gemini lol) so being able to vent and express my feelings helps me get them out and get my frustration out. With school I just keep trying until I physically can't handle more but it's so hard to feel relaxed especially when the work is challenging. I try to make as much spare time to relax as possible. I have been trying to get into spirtuality to have something to believe in so I try to meditate and journal. I talk to myself sometimes lmao just to clear thoughts out of my head and feel lije everything is less messy. I have been trying to get in the habit of laying out what I need to do so I can visually see it and get the stress out of my head. Sometimes I indulge in vices but I try to keep that to a minimum which sometimes can be difficult in challenging times. I am trying to find coping mechanisms for when life is hard but I only feel like I can do so much. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2292,"When life gets challenging, I used to get really depressed. After my daughter's birth, I have found the strength to keep going despite the challenges, and instead of focusing on the current difficulties, I focus on what I have achieved so far, and that really helps me. I have become more positive and wiser, and I know now that I am able to survive any challenge if I am in the right state of mind. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,557,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?""When life gets challenging, I would have to accept the fact that there is another wall I have to go over and figure out what to do about it. I will probably dread it, definitely be sad about it, and procrastinate just to stress about it, but when I do have the motivation and energy to overcome it, I will have to the most I can in one sitting or else I overthink and stress out even more about it. At this point, it just sounds like I'm talking about doing school assignments or necessary tasks for the week, but it is when life gets challenging for me. It burns me out and has me unmotivated but, I do try to get the most I can and have it finished whether it be on time or not. So I'm basically saying when life gets challenging, just get it over with. "
