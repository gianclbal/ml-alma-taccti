Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2277,I am here because it is a course requirement for my major. I am a biology major. I used to be a health education major and never thought I would take a physics class. To be very honest I have avoided physics all together. Even throughout high school. I guess it will be good to understand the fundamentals of physics. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2278,"I am here in this class because it is required for my major. My major is biology and in the future I want to be a clinical lab scientist. I have never took physics so I'm not sure what to expect but I hope it's not very hard and I enjoy it. I don't know much about it, all I know is that it is the study of motion and gravity. The reason I chose to pursue a degree in biology is because science is pretty much the only things I'm interested in and I can see myself doing it in the future. English or history are just not my things but I kind of like math so I think a career in science would be best for me. In the beginning of college I originally had a major in nursing but I decided to change it because I realized how difficult it is to get into nursing school and I don't want to stress myself out to much."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2279,"I'm attending SFSU because I have always wnated to go to school in the bay area, I love San Francisco and I have a lot of family up in norcal. I've lived in the desert in socal all my life and it's quite boring and I have always loved norcal when I come up and visit family, it feels like I belong in the bay area. When Covid happened and campus closed and I was forced to stay home in socal, I was a little bummed but I get to spend a little more time with my family during this difficult time. I am here in this class because it's one of my major requirements and I must take this class to graduate. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2280,"I don't know why I am here.Don't take me wrong, it's not that I don't think about this, it's just that I don't actually know why I am here.  On the surface level, I guess I can say that I'm here because I need to take this class to fill my major requirements, and that way, evade taking organic chemistry because I prefer physics over chemistry.  Fun fact, before becoming a Biology major, I also thought of becoming a physics major, but my intellectual capacity is not as high as to meet physicists' standards.On a deeper level, I guess I'm still here, studying at San Francisco State University because I have to finish my major. My dad would have loved to see me graduate, and now that he passed away last July, I feel like I owe it to him, even though I never promised him that I would finish my major.I like learning, and I like my major, but it is a bit of a waste of time pursuing a degree in something that I'll most likely not going to use. I know I can be successful without a degree. People tend to think I'm pessimistic, but I'm not, I'm realistic; And if the reality of the situation turns out to be slightly depressing, it's not my fault, it is what it is and I need to confront it either way.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,555,"I am here at San Francisco State University during spring semester 2021 being prepared to get good grades in BIO 240 Introductory Biology II lecture, seminar, and laboratory, and CHEM 215 II: quantitative apps lecture and laboratory and PHYS 111 general physics I and PHYS 112 general physics laboratory for my general biology major, each of these courses is my lower-division necessities. I am majoring in general biology because I want a career in the health field. The goals I want to accomplish in the year before I graduate San Francisco State University is to decide on what career I want and would I do schooling for another four years. Be more adamant if I want to become an optometrist, then go to optometrist school. What are other careers I will consider and job experiences will I need to acquire before getting hired. Learning how I would apply my bachelor’s degree to obtain the occupation I want."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2281,"Why am I here? I guess mainly I'm here because I need to take a year of physics if I want show myself off to physical therapy schools, and this class happens to be 1/2 of that year. Although nothing beats biology in my heart, I definitely enjoy physics more than chemistry. My favorite thing to tell people is that I do not like chemistry. I'm still trying to figure out how chemistry has anything to do with physical therapy. Biology makes total sense. Physical therapy is literally physics. But I don't know how chemistry fits in. A secondary incentive to take this class is to understand a bit of what my brother likes to do. My older brother graduated last year with his mechanical engineering degree from UC Berkeley. So, this type of class is right up his alley. He and I don't really get along, so I take every chance I get to understand the type of person he is a little bit more. Physics is, in my opinion, the most relevant of those 3 core sciences because you can literally see it with your own eyes everyday. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2282,"I am here because I have never taken a physics course before. I also have to take this for my major so that's another reason why I am here. I personally have never taken a physics course so I am not too sure what to expect. So far, speaking in the present, this class is super cool and super informational. I would have never expected it to be this cool. I was not too sure what to exactly expect but my expectations for the class were definitely reached. I have always heard that physics is considered to be a super hard course to understand/ learn and sometimes I totally understand why people would say that. I get lost here and there but the explanations and the help of my peers really help! Personally, I have always wanted to avoid physics due to what I have always heard, but honestly I'm super glad that I am here because I really enjoy the class and all of the topics that we have already covered! They're super cool!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2283,"Why am I here? Well, I'm here because I switched to a science major which required General Physics 1 & 2 as well as their associated labs. Why did I switch to a science major? Well, I was going to get a BA in Geography at first but realized the science was way better to learn about, so I switched to a BS in Geology. I have always loved natural science and initially didn't start with a BS degree because I didn't have the confidence in myself mathwise - I thought I could never do calculus and all that... I like geography as well and liked that it would be more holistic than geology too. Geology as it turns out does include lots of the other natural science stuff that excites me, including physics. I actually didn't know I liked physics as much as I did until about a year ago. Before that, I thought physics was just work, and levers and pulleys and newtons and boring numbers and stuff. It's felt too basic and nitpicky and uninteresting, just details to larger, more interesting concepts. I have since realized that physics and math is cool as hell and is some of the trippiest stuff ever. My inner druggo gets a kick out of that. Couldn't be happier to have switched my major and take this class, I know it's elementary but it's all fun and I'm happy to learn it and move on to learn more amazing stuff in physics 2, and so on."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2284,"I’m here because my major requires it. Would I take physics voluntarily? Hard no, but alas, I am here and actually really need this class because the MCAT has a physics section. What does physics have to do with medicine? Yo ne se, pero no me gusta. I’ve heard horror stories about physics, but I am a firm believer that it can’t be worse than organic chemistry. I know physics is in our everyday lives, but I think it’s just so unnoticed because it’s always been there. I will admit that I’m glad that I’m taking physics online because I’ve come to the realization that I really suck at in person classes. I can never really retain all of the information in one go and even if I record the lecture, I can’t see it visually because it’s only an audio recording, but with online learning, I have both visual and audio!! I’m able to pause and rewind as many times as I want until I’m able to grasp the part of the lesson I’m having trouble with and it’s really improving my learning and grades."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2285,"I am here at San Fran State to study biology. With that being said, I had to take physics in a sequence as a part of my major. I am a transfer study from multiple community colleges and this is actually my first semester here at SF state. I chose this college over the others because of the different atmosphere and honestly because I got a scholarship. That scholarship helped me actually become full-time, and will ultimately help me finish faster. I also wanted to branch out from the environment that I grew up in. At 25 years old, I stayed primarily in the south bay area and felt stuck there. Coming to the San Francisco area gave me more job opportunities and opportunities to meet/branch out with new people. I am very happy with my decision and actually enjoy being closer to a big city. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2286,"Why am I here?    I am at San Francisco State University because I chose to be. I was in the military, I served 10 years on active duty, and finding a school was one of the hardest thins to do. While I was serving I completed my Associates degree however I attended like 10 colleges. SFSU was the first university that I have attended. I was looking forward to the whole sit in class situation but I got out and started school during the COVID pandemic and it has been difficult, to say the least. I am also living in Texas at the moment, due to my husband transferring jobs and school being online this was an easy transition. However, when school starts back “normal” I will probably choose to stay in Texas with my family and enroll in University of Texas at Arlington. This class is a requirement for my degree in Biochemistry but I do hope to really enjoy my time and learn a lot.   "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2287,"I am here in my hometown attending SFSU online because my parents wanted me to stay in our hometown since they believe that I will be safer here than back in San Francisco. I am attending SFSU to get my bachelor's in Kinesiology in order to gain the chance of getting into Sacramento state's DPT program. I am in physics 111/112 in order to fulfill a requirement for both my major here at SFSU and the prerequisite for DPT school. Life wise I do not know what I am here for yet but I am sure that I will know with time l even if that takes 10, 20, 30 years but I am just taking life day by day. Also I attended sfsu because my parents would not let me attend long beach state"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,689,I am attending sfsu because of the fact I felt a connection when first visiting the school back in high school and knew I could see me being happy and having a great college time here. I knew this was the school I want to be a student at. I am here in this class because I need it for my prereqs for my major which is biology. Besides having to take this class for my major I am interested in learn more about phys. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2288,"I’m here because this is on the path on my way to becoming a doctor. Because I want to become a doctor one day I need to learn physics to have an understanding in order to apply it to my practice. I’m not sure if I’ll be applying it in the real world will be simple physics or if it will be complex, I honestly have no idea the only thing I do know is I need physics in order to become a doctor one day. I hope while I am here I’m able to understand physics and apply to what I’ve learned from Neil Degrasse Tyson, who makes physics such an interesting topic, it really makes me excited to learn more about physics. I’m not sure if go into astrophysics but I hope I can understand enough to be able to apply it to tomorrow's daily routine and be successful at it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2289,"I am here because I have to take care of my father. I grew up taking care of my father who is disabled because of nystagmus, a condition that causes the eyes to move uncontrollably. He most likely acquired the condition due to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. Having to take care of my father, SFSU is the closest university to home (Berkeley) that I was accepted to. Having taken care of my father growing up, the selflessness that I’ve learned has led me to become a pre-medical student. As a biology major, I am required to take Physics 111. Along with Physics 111, I have to take Physics 112. Besides this class being a course requirement, I am in this class because it will teach me how to approach physics on my Medical College Admission Test. Also, I plan to attend this course every class session so I can try to earn an A for my GPA. If I stay close to home, study physics, and remain in the Bay Area, I can still take care of my father, improve my MCAT score, and attend extracurriculars to increase my chances of attending medical school. If I can get into medical school, I will bring my experiences from my upbringing to the school's diverse student body."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2290,"why am I here? I'm in college to earn my bachelor’s in science and to further my education by getting into a physical therapy program and become a physical therapist. I am here because my parents and society taught me how important a degree is for any career, but I don't think that's true. Well, at least for some careers. I am in this class because I need it as a pre-req to make me more eligible for a PT program. But the reason why I am here, is because my parents left everything behind and immigrated from Mexico to the United States so they can have a better life. And I feel as if it’s my job to strive for grates because if I don’t, I feel like I would be a disappointment and everything my parents did would be for nothing.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2291,"I am in this physics class because it is a lower division requirement for the biology major. I have also never taken a physics class before, so I think I will learn a lot in this class and I am excited! My overall purpose is to graduate from San Francisco State University with a degree in biology with a concentration in physiology. After I graduate, I plan to get my bachelor's in nursing, which is my career choice. I am the first in my family to go to college, so I want to continue my education. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,557,I am here taking these classes right now because I am majoring in general biology. I am working on my prerequisites to get into zoology. I will be using that major to go to vet school and to be a veterinarian that specializes in pet animals. I have goals I want to accomplish while I am in college which includes keeping track of my Biology Major prerequisites by looking into the General Arts of Biology degree path and picking the right class to keep up since I’ve started to take classes for the Biology major a bit later into my college path. Then I would think about what i will have to do after college which includes finding a job that is possibly a pet clinic or a pet store and get accepted to a Veterinary school that I will choose knowing it’s the right one for me. So these goals will keep me motivated to stay and pass my classes.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2292,"I am at SFSU because I want to major in marine biology and want to work in a non profit organization involved in whale conservation, especially orcas. Physics has never been my favorite subject but here I am, already struggling, but doing my best to learn and gain the most from this class. I am also here as a first generation college student, I have a 2 years daughter and I want to be able to give her the best life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2293,Why am I here? Im here in San Francisco State University because it was one of my top schools that caught my eye and interest in attending. I didn't know what to expect when I was coming in to the school but I have to say it has been a very fun and exciting experience by far. Im here to get a start and the knowledge I need to succeed in my future career which I think will teach me a lot in my specified major. Im also here to make new experiences in life and make new friends along my journey.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2294,"This is my first semester at SF State after transferring from USF. At USF I was a finance major and now I am currently a general biology major. Over the course of the summer and early fall, I literally felt like I was having a mid-life crisis no lie. Being stuck at home seriously made me think about what I wanted to do with my life. Originally, I chose to major in business because it seemed like the “safe” and “natural” thing to do. I was heavily active in my high school’s business club, so I felt like had to continue along this past since I had already invested so much time and energy into this field. To basically sum everything up, I had a change of heart and decided that I wanted to pursue a career in medicine instead. I am still trying to figure out and narrow down what occupation. I came to SF State because it was easier to fulfill the pre-reqs I needed for grad school! There was also a lot of flexibility when choosing classes and naturally SF State is more cost friendly. If you asked me 5 years ago what college I would be at and what major I would declare, being a bio major at SFSU was not even in my peripheral vision. Never in a million years did I expect to end up here, but in a sense, I am glad this quarantine allowed me to make the first, and definitely not the last, “grown – up” decision in my life."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2295,"I have been born and raised in the bay area so I haven't really moved far. I am at sfsu because I had health issues in high school and it really messed me up on what I wanted to do. I only got into two colleges and one was sfsu. I picked sfsu because I didn't want to move out of state and I had a grant to come here. I love it here at sf state but it was never a school I really thought about it was more opportunity. Honestly I am in physics for the degree requirment. I mean I guess it's pretty cool because I have literally no idea about physics, what it is, what it tells us. I would say the only thing I knew was newton's law. I am here in a biology degree program because I want to be in a medical field but nursing felt limiting and that's why I switched. The more I learn about biology the more intregied I get and more pulled away from being a nurse and wanting to be a researcher. My purpose here really is to contribute to society however that may be. I want to work with people and care for people but I'm starting to think maybe it doesn't have to be direct medical care and it could be researching cells and helping cure diseases. I for sure am in the right area and that why I want to do biology and my purpose is to contribute to society but I am a little lost on how."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2296,"Why I am here? I am here to reflect on what I learn in lecture Physics class. I need the general physics to acknowledge background to base able to filling my major as an engineer. I believe that what I learn here will be very helpful as an experience of collaborating and creating with groupmates. The reason why I choose Mechanical Engineering is in the bay area the Mechanical system is not at the top of the country, and I believe that it will have a lot of opportunities to get into those programs if I graduate as an engineer."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2297,"""Why am I here?""This is a question I think to myself on a daily basis? my conclusion is I am here because of the sacrifice and hard work of thousands of years of survivors. Life is easy and the further back in history you go it seemed to be even more difficult.  why am I in physics as a 28-year-old man, I have taken a long journey trying to figure out what career I want. I spent 5 years slowly completing all the prereqs for nursing just to change my mind, and pursue a degree in micro bio. I'm here to continue and succeed. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2298,"I am mostly here because this is a requirement for my major (biochemistry). I have studied physics before, but I didn't really pay attention to it back then, so I think this is a good opportunity for me to develop a good understanding of this topic because it does seem relatively straightforward; You just have to know what principles/formulas/theories to apply. I also think it's pretty cool to ""predict"" how a certain simulation will carry out without even seeing it in person. Although I don't find math fun, it is interesting how a lot of things just fall into place if that makes sense. People always talk about how it is present in nature. Patterns are often a trend in nature, and maybe the same could be applied to physics, but I guess I would have to learn, at the very least, the basics if I ever want to figure that out for myself."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2299,"I am here because I want to pursue my dream. By taking this class, it will put me one step closer to my goal and I chose SFSU to pilot my education because it is one of the school I aspire to get into when I arrived in the States. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2300,"I am attending SF State to pursue the career of becoming a Physical Therapist. I had first set foot in college about 4 years ago but did not know what to do, but I knew I wanted to major in some degree and that I wanted a good paying job, at the same time, I want to be in a career that fulfills my passion in helping people. I am also here attending college because I want to gain worldly knowledge. I want to continue to push myself, especially in college. I am also here because I want to be able to provide for my family. I want to inspire others through my accomplishments and actions. I am here taking physics class not only in fulfilling a prerequisite to apply to PT school, but to also learn how to do critical thinking and improve my skills in problem solving. I am here because I have a purpose. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2301,"I am here because life goes on. I used to have a lot of thoughts about this question, but I hardly thought about my actions of what I am doing. I try not to overthink this question because I had always backed up in a lot of my decision, and now my goal is to keep going forward and ask this question when I am too stressed and remember what I am doing in the first place. My motivation thought and the goal is to work hard and play later. I was raised to do work now in order to free up your time for myself. Furthermore, I want to put in the time now to be the best of whatever skill I need to do in order to be more successful in life and currently I am a student so my goal is to become a successful student here at SFSU. "
