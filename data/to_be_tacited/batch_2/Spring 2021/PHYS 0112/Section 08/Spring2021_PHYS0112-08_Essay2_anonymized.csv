2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2281,"My goals are to graduate with a Bachelors degree in Kinesiology. After that, I'm hoping to be accepted to one of several PT programs in California. My first choice is, naturally, the UCSF/SFSU PT program, but want to keep my options open to schools like Samuel Merritt, USC, and a handful of the other CSUs. This class is helping me achieve these goals because taking 2 semesters of physics is actually a common prerequisite for many PT schools. This was previously unknown to me, but I'm glad to know sooner than later. With that said, it makes me slightly regret not taking AP Physics A in high school. On the other hand, there's plenty of things in life that look better in hindsight. It only makes sense that physics is a prerequisite for physical therapy, considering it is literally given in the name, but I was never proficient in physics. I hope my skills will continue to improve throughout the semester."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2292,"My goal is getting my degree in marine biology and start a career in whale conservation. I am really passionate about whales, orcas in particular, and I dream about moving up north to Seattle and study them. I also have a two year daughter and I want to be able to give her a good life. And that is why I am here, learning physics. I actually starting to like it, it is challenging my patience and determination, because even if the topics are tough for someone that took physics ages ago, I keep trying and trying until I get it, and these are some good skills to have in life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2301,"My goal is to pass all my classes will an ""A"" on the class. This class is a stepping stone for my career in the future and this class will teach me how to work hard and to put in the time and effort. No matter what kind of obstacle I am thrown in, I will work hard and try my best to collaborate with my peers and work hard as an individual. During this pandemic I had to do classes and lab online and doing lab online is different and this class is also teaching me how to adapt and hopefully, this skill will be sharpened in the future when I will need to adapt to certain circumstances. No matter what is thrown at me, I should be able to adjust properly in order to study well and work hard on my part to get where I want to be."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,555,"I am currently a pre-biology major, I want to go into general biology as my major because I want to become an Optometrist or to have an occupation within the medical field.Do more research on other jobs that I might be interested in that’s in the health field. Go volunteer at hospitals or veterinarian clinics to get more experience and learn more.The goals I should accomplish in five years is probably to have a stable job and purchase a vehicle to drive myself to work everyday.The goal I should accomplish in ten years is to be happily married with children that’s paying a mortgage on my house. Have health and car insurance and then be saving money towards my children’s cars and college funds. Each summer, I go to different countries I’ve never been to with my family members and friends. To be a bridesmaid at my friends wedding, occasionally helping them babysit or having play dates. Eventually think about saving money towards retirement and what I would want to do after. This class is helping me achieve these goals because I need to pass this course to graduate."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,689,My goal is to be able to pass all my classes this semester. Including this physical class. With me passing all my classes this semester it will only put me closer to finishing my degree here at San francisco state university. It will also help me be able to graduate and be able to get to my future career and attend the schools and programs I want to in the future and for my career. The career I want to be able to do after graduating is to be an orthodontist. This class will help me get to my goal because I need this class to get my bio degree. So in taking this class it only helps me learn more about physics and helps me better understand it for future classes.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2289,"My goal is to work in the medical field. In order to work in the medical field and treat patients, I must have a good MCAT score. The Medical College Admission Test has a chemistry/physics section. In order to score high on this section, I must have knowledge of physics. This class is helping achieve my goals because this is the first physics lab class I have ever attended in my life. This is the lab class where I am beginning to strengthen my physics knowledge to do well on the MCAT and understand how physics plays a role in the human body. Moreover, by improving my physics knowledge in this class, I am going to get a better grade in my Physics 111 course. As I work to get a good grade in this class and my Physics 111 course, I am maintaining a good GPA for medical school and demonstrating that I understand science."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2278,My goals is to graduate college and move to the program for my career. In order to complete my goals I will have to do my very best in each of my classes including this one. It might be hard since I'm not actually in lab or my other classes so its harder to learn but I will work hard. My other goal for once I graduate it to get a successful job where I can buy the things I want including a house for my mom since we don't currently have one. I hope I can help my mom in the future for everything she has provided me with. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2296,"My goal today is to finish the lab of today and the reflection from last week. I just keep forgetting the acknowledge check from each week's lab. I will keep my mind today. Also, I will try to collaborate with my group. Last week, we basically doing individually. So I want to try collaborating this time if I have a chance. And I will learn to understand motion and velocity, and acceleration this week. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2284,"My goals are to get an A in this course, try to really comprehend and retain the lecture material from the labs and to apply it when I take my MCAT! This class is helping me achieve these goals by being recorded. For me, having the ability to go back and rewatch a certain part of the lecture has been really crucial in my learning because there’s no pressure for me to try and absorb as much as possible like in-person learning usually is. Another aspect that’s helping me is being a part of a group! Sometimes I have trouble with certain aspects of a lab, but the groups that I’ve been in have really helped clarified any confusion I had. This class is also helping me graduating because it’s part of my major requirements and I definitely need my bachelors degree in order to apply and matriculate to medical school."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2290,"My life goal is to be happy and healthy,  but the goals I have for myself are 1. to graduate from sfsu, 2. be accepted into a PT program and 3. start my career as a physical Therapist. Although those are the goals I have now, I feel like something from my road map is going to change, I feel as if I'm going to enter a different career. I want to be in the medical field, but something is telling me that I might enter the business field and work in marketing or something along those lines. Whatever the outcome is, I just hope it's a good career. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2282,"One of my goals is to graduate sfsu and go to medical school. This class has helped me achieve these goals because it is a course that can help prepare me for my future courses for medical school. The reason that i'm here specifically in physics 111 is because i don't have much knowledge on physics. I went to a high school that wasn't really that good once it came to education just because we were considered to be a lower class high school. This is my first time taking a physics class so it was hard to pick up the material just because we're doing everything through zoom and I don't have much beginner knowledge on it. I really think that this class will help me grow as a person and within school, i really like learning about things that have more of a deeper and wider insight within education and life"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2297,"My short-term goals are to try and learn as much as I can, and fully understand the topics we cover, be able to apply them in real-life situations. My long-term goals will be to apply critical thinking and problem-solving techniques throughout my career. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2279,My goals are to graduate college with good grades and apply for veterinary school. This class is helping me achieve these goals because it is a class that I need to take and pass in order to graduate and without taking this class and getting a good grade I wouldn't be able to do that.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2298,"My current goal is to get through all of my classes with good grades. This semester, I'm only doing science and math courses. While the physics lecture portion seems pretty okay with me, I guess I am a little worried about the lab section because it is more based on self-learning (I think). While it is the better method for me to learn about whatever concepts we may be focusing on, I do think that it may become more and more difficult to do so on my own when the principles get more and more complex. Because a lot of physics is dealing with equations, I am concerned that I might mix them up or use the wrong one for certain occasions, but I guess I would have to get to that point to find out. Anyways, worrying won't do much for me, so the best I can do right now is just attend every class. I'm sure I can find solutions anywhere if I have the will to finish my tasks"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2295,My goal is to become a person with a biology degree. I am still debating on what I want to do with it so I am not quite sure what the overall goal is but I know that's where I want to be. Physics will help me achieve these goals because well this is a required class but also it helps better my understanding of biology. I don't know a lot about physics and what it is. But as far as we've gotten I know at least that it helps in the study of motion. This is important to understand in biology when talking about movements of animals or cell or other things. My goal is to someone who is well rounded in the field of science and by taking physics that helps me achieve being more knowledgable and can I can apply that to other fields of science.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2288,"It is my goal to become a doctor and in order to become a doctor I have to go through the process of completing prerequisites and one of those prereqs is physics. By taking this class I will knock out the necessary class needed to apply. I am positive that in this class while giving a patient the necessary dosage of medication I may need to calculate how severe the pain is in order to give the medication. For example, I may calculate the distance from the top of a tree to the bottom, and once I do that I can then give the proper medication to the patient. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2293,"My goals in life is to become a dentist (somewhere in the dental field). To reach that goal I first have to complete my biology degree at SFSU then move on to a dental school. As part of reaching that goal I must first complete a section of classes one being the class i'm currently in, Physics. To be entirely honest i'm not so sure how this class connects to a lot of the things in the dental field but I do know that taking this class will help aid me in future classes for instance this being a pre requisite class for the next physics class needed. By attending this class and passing it get more a few steps closer to achieve my degree and began the next chapter of my career goal. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2283,"My goals are to get my Geology degree and learn a lot about science. I would like to have an intuitive understanding of the basic physics things. This class is helping me do this by exposing me to these basic concepts and having me play around with the different ideas. It also is giving me experience with the mathematics that are important to have down in science. I do not consider myself to be very good at algebra and have lots of gaps in my knowledge, something Im coming to terms with especially in my Calculus class. This class has some algebra in it, and I can take all the help I can get in getting some more experience and feeling more comfortable doing some basic arithmetic and algebra for this class, future physics classes, Calculus, Chemistry, and so on. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2286,"My goals for post graduating at SFSU is to get into a medical school. I do not have a specific school I am leaning towards. Just as long as I get into on that’s all I care about at the moment. I am currently living in Texas but going to school in California and eventually want to end up back with my family in Utah. So as far as where I want to study, that is still up in the air. Being that I want to get into medical school taking this physics class will help me understand medicines current technologies like ultrasound and x-ray machines. the more I understand how they work will help me understand why I need to use them on specific patients. I am excited to continue my journey and expand my horizons. It will also help become more efficient as I progress through my career as I would know more about technology in the medicine world. Also, this class is a required course for my major."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2291,"My goal is to graduate from San Francisco State University with and bachelor's degree in biology. This class will allow me to fulfill the lower division prerequisites needed in order to take upper division classes. I have also never taken a physics class and was curious about it in high school. Taking this class will fulfill my curiosity and hopefully, I will learn things in physics that will help me in my everyday life. My goal after graduating from San Francisco State University is to go to nursing school and I feel like phsyics will probably be helpful in my career."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2287,My goal school-wise is to pass this semester so that I will have the chance to graduate in fall 2021. After I graduate I plan to take a year break before I work on my next goal which would be to get into the DPT program in Sac State and hopefully become a physical therapist. This class is helping me achieve that goal in that this is a prerequisite for DPT school and this class is a requirement to graduate with a bachelor's in Kinesiology. But I guess overall one of my life goals is to learn everything that I could have a chance to learn.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2300,"My goal is to help and inspire others. Also, I am striving to be the best version of myself. I want to build confidence within myself and I want to make a difference in someone's life. Being a Physical Therapist or Nurse will help me achieve that goal and I know that I want to work somewhere in the medical field. This class in Physics will help me to work on my critical thinking and problem solving skills. It will also teach me to be persistent because physics is not easy and it may take a while to solve a problem. I am attending college because I want to build knowledge and obtain a degree that I can be proud of and know that I worked hard for it. There are so many goals that I want to accomplish but I want to take one step at a time. I believe that goals are one of the foundations to success. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,557,"What are my goals?My goals are lots of things. They can be the most simple thing or something that can affect the rest of my life. For the most part, my goals are school-related. Like passing all the classes the best I can and too not stress too much about the assignments and tests coming up. I still do stress about these things, but not as much as I did back then. I do also have other goals outside of school, like taking care of myself more. My other goal is to apply to a veterinarian school. Although I’m unsure how high in my career do I want to go. It’s a lot to consider for the future and the reassurance that I can handle them.How is this class helping me achieve these goals?So far, the only way this class is helping achieve these goals is because it’s part of my biology major."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2299,"my short term goal is to get my bachelors degree and my long term goals is to take my Masters and become a Physician Assistant, with Physics, I think this will help me on think I the things I would do in my everyday life."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2294,"In essence, my long-term goal would be to go to grad school and have a career in the medical field! However, I am still trying to narrow down what profession/occupation. From a broader and non-career standpoint, one of my most ambitious goals would be to travel to every country (or at least 90%) of countries in the world! I think that there are so many nice places out there just waiting to be explored. Sky diving is also on my bucket list, but we will see if I will actually go through with that one.   I am taking physics because it is required for my major (General Biology), but it also be useful if I decide that I want to go to medical school later as physics is a pre-requisite course. I think physics is a bit intimidating for me, but I have slowly chipped away at learning the hard concepts. Maybe my outlook on physics will be more positive after taking this course! "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2277,My goals are to get my bachelors degree in biology. After graduating I would like to attend a PA school and obtain a career in that area. This class will help me achieve these goals because this class is a prerequisite for my major. I have never really gravitated to the science of physics and I avoided it throughout high school. I really enjoy studying anatomy and disease. I am actually taking a interesting disease class this semester. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2280,"I have many goals, going from working out to feel better about myself to graduate with a degree.  One thing in common that is present in all of my goals are directly influenced by a personality trait that I'm working on; be more disciplined.  Being more disciplined will make me a better person at the end of the day.  It'll make me push harder through obstacles and not quit no matter how difficult it may be.This class is helping me being more disciplined because it gives me work, sometimes very difficult work, and doing my best to have a good grade and being on track, definitely helps me be more disciplined.At the end of the day, all that matters is if I'm a better version of myself than what I was yesterday."
