2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2286,"I would not really say I have values from my community as I never was big on community involvement growing up. However I have many values I learned from my family. One value in particular that resonates with me and throughout my college experience is the value of education. My family was never wealthy, we were not exactly ""poor-poor"" but I never had the new things other classmates did. However I always went to a good rating school in my area. One thing my parents showed me when I was younger was how much better I have it compared to them. They were more on the poor side growing up and always made it a point to tell us that we HAVE to do better. In school, it was never good enough coming home with a C or even a B. I had to strive for an A. My dad would make sure i had a tutor after school for an hour and go over any topic i struggled with that day. I definitely realized early enough that if i came home with anything less than a B I would get a tutor and that would be an expense on my parents part. I was quick to adapt to getting good grades so they would not struggle. Since high school I told myself to be better and learn what I can. This continues on to College now, because since I am no longer in my parents care any extra expense will be coming out of my wallet. So what I got from my parents lesson is value education because it is not cheap. Also setting realistic goals helps make school so much easier. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2298,"Even though a lot of people say that you don't need to go through college to be successful, I still think that it is a valuable resource. College is not just the education; It is also the experiences that you come across as a young adult. It is a time where you find more about yourself. Coming from an immigrant family, my parents never really got the opportunity to explore their working options. However, for me, I have to option to branch out. Had I not gone to college, I would be working part-time jobs or helping out with family outside close relatives. Perhaps, I would've taken piano more seriously to consider it a job somewhere or do something with media, but me being the shy person I am, I highly doubt that. Sure, some of the stuff you encounter in college is sort of a repeat of high school, but once you get past that, there is so much to see. All the stuff you see on TED talks or whatever is right in front of you. I guess, with college, you get to control what you learn to a certain extent. It's just another step to what you want to do in the future. For me, I've seen my parents come back home very tired, and to be able to help their physical state would be a dream. I know that they work very hard, so I would like to give something back in return someday, which is why I'm interested in the medical field. One day, I would like to branch out and go on missionaries with a medical background to help people living in poverty."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2295,"The values of my family have always been to work hard. Since I was little my parents always pushed me to do my best and had some high expectations. I learned to work hard to achieve what I want like even getting into college after some hardships in high school. My work ethic is the most valuable thing along side the support of ny family. My mom belives in high education and the importance of it as a teacher and a person with two masters she instilled in me how important education is and that has given me the drive to want to learn, to want to do well and understand school. My best friends are so supportive socially. I moved away from them and yet they are always there to support me and help me naviagte new social things that come with college. I think the value of having a strong support system has really helped me find people I could rely on. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2290,"Regardless of being one of the richest country on earth, The United States battles with an undeniable degree of poverty and homelessness, particularly among the youth population. According to the National Conference of State Legislators( NCSL), 40 % of the homeless population in the United States are under the age of 18. 46% reported being physically abused, 38% reported being emotionally abused and 17% reported being forced into unwanted sexual activity. What I have been doing during this pandemic is volunteering at the Bill Willson youth center where I help provide homeless youth with recourses that will help them and their path to achieve greatness. These youngsters are the future and it brings so much joy seeing them start a new chapter in their life. By having conversations with these kids, they tell me all the time how they would like to pressure an education but they feel as if it is too late for them. Hearing what they have to say makes me strive to finish my education and pursue my career that way I can can give back to the community that deserve so much more. I always make sure that these kids have a path to pressure an education even though they think its too late, everyone needs a support system to drive for something great. My Family are another group that makes me drive to finish my education. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2294,"I think that college was always a path that my parents and relatives pushed on me. I am the first person in my family to go to college and I am also an only child. Essentially, college was the only practical choice straight out of high school, and I do not really regret not going to college instead. My parents always stressed that education, particularly a higher education, would open up more doors and set me up for a good/secure life ahead. Coming from a low-income background, my parents really wanted to give me a “better life” so they always made me prioritize school before anything else. I also did not have the so called “security” or luxury to do whatever I wanted post high school like take a gap year and travel, move to a different city, etc.…. Even in college, I had to work and do other stuff to support myself financially because I did not want to depend and rely on my parents 100%. Overall, I think that most Asian families or Asian culture in general, place a huge importance on education because they hold the beliefs that more education is directly proportionate to more success (financially and in general life)."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2300,"I think the people that I am surrounded by has helped me navigate through college. In the beginning, I never really took school seriously up until the first few years of college. At first, I did not have much guidance. I wasn't really motivated to take school seriously. I never really knew what I wanted to do. As I met people along the way, in church, school, or at work, some of them inspired me to stay in college and to really think about what I wanted to do in the future. They had success stories of where they also had similar experiences, where they did not know what to do in the beginning. Some of them did not even go to college but they worked hard and ended up being really successful in life. What they taught me is that hard work is key. They taught me to not rush into things and to enjoy and trust the process. I think I would not have been here in SF state if I had not met certain people in my life."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2292,"I am the first one in my family that went to college, so honestly I can't really say I share all their values. For sure one thing I learned from my dad is strength and perseverance to keep going despite difficult times. I had a dream to come to the USA and building a life for myself, and that is what I am doing. My family gave me the gift to care about others, and to always smile, even in hard times, and to always be honest with myself and others. This is what they showed me while growing up. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2293,"The values of my friends and family help me get through college by knowing that I will always have people by my side to help me in case I run into any obstacles and struggle between classes. I know they will also be there by my side in case I have a moment where Im feeling down and begin to question everything if college is really worth it, they will be there to help me straighten back out and continue to push through my journey. Also seeing that my family once started from almost nothing really pushes me to try even harder and put my all into school to become successful in life and be able to give back to my family for always being there for me. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2279,"My family values commitment, if you commitment to something you must finish it and I think that relates to college a lot because there have been times where I've wanted to change my major or just drop out entirely but I remember that I committed to this and I have to finish it because I will be so much happier knowing that I pushed through it and didn't give up. My family also values having a plan and try your best to go through with that plan. College is my plan right now and I plan on graduating and so that I can move on to my next step. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2291,"My family has always drilled the idea that school is the most important thing to be able to get a good job after you graduate. They taught me to work hard in school. This idea is mostly true for all Asian American households and in the Asian American community. However, I feel like this idea plays into the model minority myth of Asian Americans. Many assume that all Asian Americnas work hard, do well in school, and go on to have successful careers. When this does not happen for some people, their families are embarassed of them and become disappointed. So, to get through college without letting my parents down, I just try the best I can taking 18 units and working two part time jobs.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2280,"The values that my family implemented on me that helped me through college are minimal.  Don't get me wrong, my family taught me very important values, but only a few have helped me through college.  Sorry, I am blank right now.I"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2287,"In my family they placed a great deal of value on education, being from an immigrant family they want to see me succeed in academics in hopes of attaining the vision of a better life than my parents have dreamt for me. Because of this I have always taken academics seriously and always placed college first before anything. I hope that I could pay back my parents for all the help they have given me in my life through my college education. For the mental aspects of college though my friends have definitely carried me through my tough times where I felt like I wanted to quit."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2281,"I went to a public high school, but I remember discussing with my friends about how high schools in our area had a negative stigma towards community college. We went to school in an environment that was high achieving - it was normal to take 4+ AP classes your senior year, and it was normal for students to be accepted to schools among the likes of USC, Cal, MIT, and several Ivy Leagues. Consequently, we had many resources available to us that helped us get the information (or advantage) that we needed to succeed. It was a double-edged sword. We were extremely motivated to shoot high, and many students often did hit their mark. It also created an environment where those who were planning on attending community college were left behind, or discouraged. It also forced many students to take classes that they were, in terms of academic vigor, ill-prepared for. My school was extremely good at creating a very segregated environment, where only the AP students were friends with other AP students, and those taking normal classes, same thing. At graduation, it was interesting to note who you did and did not recognize, based on the classes you took. Like, oh, I didn't even know that person existed! Because they've only taken normal classes their entire high school career."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2299,"My family showed me too much values that I couldn't even count how many. The things they told me on how to act responsibly. But the best knowledge I have learned is the only that they did not say but the things they show. I think the thing I learned most that I have use all my life especially in college is to never give up. No matter how bad I did on a test, I need to move on and continue life, and prepare for the next one. They showed me that life will not be always in my favor, and I have to make to make a way to cope with the changes and adapt to the best of my abilities. This is why I strive my hardest to do the things to pass college even at 26 years old. Which in my thinking is too old even though people don't think that way."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2297,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""One value my family instilled in me to help guide me through college is their hard work ethic, when I think of how hard it is for me in school I think of how much harder it would be if my family never worked to provide me with the opportunity to be in school and try to find a career that no one else in my family had the chance to even try. My family is pretty close with one another, I am the first to college and they always try to be supportive in any way they can. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2288,"My family values are very important to me they are ones that are a part of my values and are very important to my ritual for the past few weeks. One that sticks out to me is that the knowledge that I must complete my work before I spend time enjoying it. Basically, it is literal finish what needs to be done tomorrow before you enjoy today. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2285,"I am going to refer to the community or group of very close friends that I consider to be family. I am very fortunate to be around such hard working people that have shown me what time and effort can do. Being able to have such a supportive community that allows me to work hard but also encourages me to keep up with work, school, hobbies and social life. It is something that I believe has kept me going for years and allowed me to always do my best. When it comes to college, I have always been held to a standard to do well. This has always shown me that I have people that not only expect me to do well but know that I am able to achieve these things. It has also never been about good grades or the amount of time to do the work, but about finishing strong and learning the material that is needed. I am grateful for this."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2282,"The values of my community and my family really helped me navigate through college just because when I really wanted to give up they have always reminded me of how hard I have worked to get to where I am today. I grew up in an area where not a lot of people usually go to college just because we didn't have many resources to help us succeed compared to other schools that were in better areas. There were multiple times where I felt as if I wasn't good enough just because everyone else was so advanced compared to me. There were many times where I wanted to give up and not push myself to go any further. My family and community always reminded me of how hard I have pushed and worked to go to college. They have always taught me that no matter how hard it gets, to always keep pushing and shoot for my dreams no matter how difficult the obstacles may be."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,555,"The values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college because, at an early age, we’re taught that with education, we’re able to further our career path, to have a stable income. How college is crucial to attaining middle to high income, which is the beginning of being successful in life. As the first generation in my family to be attending college, I didn’t know what to expect. There was no guidance when applying to colleges or any advice given relating to college. When I was a freshman, entering college I didn’t know what courses to enroll in or where any of the buildings were. Eventually, we all learn what are general education (GE), Upper Division B: Physical/ Life Science, Upper Division C: Art/ Humanities, upper-division D: Social science and what our major requirements are. Sometimes we have to experience and learn first handed by ourselves so we can be the ones giving advice. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2296,"“The family is the basic cell of society, the First School of life. No matter how much the times have changed, no matter how much the pattern of life has changed, we must attach importance to family construction, family and family education, as the most basic unit of society, building good family-style and carrying forward family virtue is the most important basis for building a harmonious society, but also an important symbol of social civilization. From the point of view of the human development sequence, the family is the initial place of individual life growth. Schools, on the other hand, are for the majority of students, providing only public, universal education, with a unified schedule and curriculum, and it is difficult to really pay attention to the differences of each child.Child discipline is a lifelong, exemplary education. From the point of view of time and space in life, most of the time children spend at home with their parents. School for me is only a short period of life, so the impact of family environment on a child’s growth than school is much greater, much longer."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2301,"My family has always been supportive during my college life, but I only get financial support from my parents. I am more independent on college choices and career goals. When making decisions, I tell my parents what my goals are, and it does not matter if they give positive or negative feedback because I just want them to know that I am alright with what I do. Most of my family graduated college in the Philippines so they are not too sure how college works in America and that is why I became more independent in choosing and acting on my college choices."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2284,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college by raising me to believe in myself and to always try my best. As I advance through my college courses, I’ve started to feel imposter syndrome. It’s been a really difficult thing to process this past year as I’ve never experienced it before, but I look at my family members and I know they’ve felt the same way at one point in their lives too. I also look to others for inspiration, like Michelle Obama. Her book really helped me to focus on what I did to get where I am and that I put in the work so now I should enjoy the fruits of my labor. The values of my community has helped me be vulnerable and ask for help. I was (and still sort of am) a stubborn person and it was difficult for me to ask for help with class material because I never wanted to be a burden on anyone and I felt like I could solve things myself. In college, I soon came to realize that not asking for help hindered my learning and it was ok to ask because people do want to help!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,8,2289,"My family values efficiency and optimism. Throughout the pandemic, these values have helped me navigate me through college because I've always grown up getting things done and remaining stable no matter what the conditions are. I've completed all my assignments because of these values and practicing them growing up around people that value efficiency and optimism. Moreover, optimism is a value that my community holds that helped me navigate college by letting me focus on the brighter future to push through the rough times. By surrounding myself around these people that hold these values, I've learned to get through a different/unique start of my college education. Some other values that my community value is creativity and growth. As I navigate through college, my community holding these values now and holding them in the past has created a great influence in my life. I learned from these values to overcome so much throughout these first two semesters of college."
