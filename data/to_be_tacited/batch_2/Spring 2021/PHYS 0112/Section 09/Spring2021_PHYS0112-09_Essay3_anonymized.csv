2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2312,"When life gets challenging, I find out what exactly is challenging me and causing me issues and try to resolve it as best as I can. Most of the time, I'll just take a small break and think about what I can do to make things easier the next time, or what I can do to prevent the challenge from presenting itself again. I also make sure I balance things so I'm never, or hardly, overwhelmed with one thing at once. I also use resources to try to help me overcome these challenges and it works out pretty well for me. I take things one step and day at a time and just hope that things work out, while doing everything I can to influence the end result. I take things one small step at a time. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2319,"What do I do when life gets challenging? Shut down. No but seriously I just take a break and find something that kindles joy. It’s the little things that help, sometimes I’ll go for a walk and sit at the park. Other times I’ll pet and play with my dog or go fishing with my boyfriend. Sometimes all I need to do is make a cup of tea and breathe. I remind myself that nothing is forever and to not stress over what I can not control. If it is something I can control that is stressing me, I ask myself what I can do to change it and what am I waiting for? Once I complete whatever is stressing me, my anxiety usually completely disappears. I get really bad anxiety over everything and try to compensate by ignoring whatever is bothering me but that’s a super temporary solution. For example, with school I will simultaneously stress about school work but still not complete it until the day it’s due. I’m not sure what my problem is."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2309,"When life gets challenging for me I tend to step back and take a breather/break. I have a really hard time focusing with millions of things going on around me and in my head so in order to avoid these challenges, i've learned that keeping a clean room and work space helps calm this anxiety. But as you can tell with my late assignments and missing work, shit has been hitting the fan on my side of the screen so I had to step back despite this work overload. Coming back into the working space is pretty difficult, especially knowing that I have so much work to catch up on, but after that breather I am always a little bit more energized and motivated to finish my work. It gets pretty hard sometimes when I have to switch from that peaceful mentality into my school working mentality because I hate school so much, but I just am working for the weekend and summer break at this point. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2321,"When life gets challenging, I tend to cry as I am an emotional person and tend to cry often. When life gets hard or I feel stressed out, I cry and afterwards I feel better. Crying helps me to let out my emotions that might cloud my judgement and prevent me from being productive. Additionally, I try to exercise whenever I might have time. I find that after a workout, I feel that I have much more energy and that I feel more motivated to go on with the rest of my day. I also talk to my friends and my grandma for support whenever I need some encouraging words, these people help uplift me and make me feel better. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2314,"When life gets challenging, all I do is stay calm. I discovered that I am always stressed about something in my life, whether it be about something in the future or about something currently happening in my life, it has reached the point where I have forgotten what it was like to feel free in a sense. However, I have also realized that I have this natural ability to come through with something, regardless of how difficult it may be. And this ability of mine applies to everything in my life, whether its something about school, work, relationships, I have this uncanny ability to get something I need done no matter what. Admittedly, I often put myself in difficult situations by trivializing necessary things in my life. But at the same time, I just tell myself that the issue I made for myself is something not worrisome, and that I would get through it. That is how I stay calm."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2302,"When life gets challenging i try to give myself extra self care, especially when it comes to school, i try to keep up and when i can't i just keep getting more behind. but once i feel like motivated I start getting all my work done"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2313,What I do when life gets challenging is that I like to take a minute to myself and kinda to just separate from reality and ignore all the problems that are going on with my life. This allows me to calm down and think and I guess I start to realize that my problems can have easy solutions if I think about it to myself. I also reflect on people's lives who have it harder than me and realize to myself that my problems are way smaller compare to those of other people. I also tend to look towards others for guidance and help. I believe there should be no person In this world who doesn't need help ever in their life. Thats why I look towards my family and my friends to help me when life gets too difficult for me to handle and they can just take the stress off of me. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2308,"When times get hard, sometimes I start to lose motivation because I am usually overwhelmed with school and everything else. I usually end up having so many things to do at once, and deadlines start to pile up and everything gets hectic. But I found a system that helps me to relive stress while also finishing what I need to do. I plan out my deadlines in a planner so I can see when everything is due, then for other assignments that i need to do in a day, i go through all my classes iLearn page, see what i need to get done and such. Then I do the assignments that have more urgency to get done. If i have very little motivation, what i will do is take a break from everything and take a shower and listen to my favorites songs or just go on my phone. I try to take things a step at a time and remind myself that I am going to get through everything and at the end of the day I know I am trying my best and my hardest. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2310,"When life gets challenging, I usually take a nap. From my naps, I typically feel refreshed and not as stressed, so I go back to work. If I can't take a nap, laying down and taking a break from the assignment or whatever makes my life challenging helps too. I listen to music while I rest or go on social media. If none of that helps, I go out to get coffee or boba, as those drinks are my comfort drinks. I would ask one of my friends if they would like to come, so I can converse with them while waiting for the drinks. If not, then I don't mind going alone. One last thing I do would be playing video games with my friends. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2317,"Honestly, I am not really one for healthy coping habits and tend to prefer a bit of cider with my friends to overcome the doldrums and trepidations of life. Admittedly, I'm from a very Scandiwegian-Scottis American family, ""lightly pissed sharing people"" to some. Otherwise, I play a lot of stringed instruments as music and music theory was a major coping mechanism for me during a wicked and pointlessly violent childhood. Lastly, a bit of irreverent singing can really do the trick; whether it's something sprightly like George Formby or vibrant son jarocho like old Belafonte a bit of song can really lift one's spirits. Though cheesy and monumentally cliche, I've always reveled in Gene Kelly's rendition of Singing in the Rain when life gets really stupid. It's possibly one of my favorite musical takes on absurdism and learning to smile when you're quite in the shite. Rather impressively, it was done in a single take; they really don't make actors like they used to. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1ZYhVpdXbQ"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2320,"What I do when life gets challenging is take a step back and evaluate the situation. By being able to process what's going on I am able to make conscious and timely decisions that will help me combat these issues. Additionally, it gives me time to breathe as I tend to hyperventilate under pressure. I can't really think about what else to say so I'm just gonna go off on a tangent about life. Life has been particularly hard recently, maybe because it's the zoom fatigue or it's the lack of motivation to do anything anymore. I also try not to stress over life too much, it becomes draining and it negatively affects my mental health. Even if it is finals week, and I'm trying to catch up because of my procrastination, I know that if I take it one step at a time I will eventually reach my destination. I already reached the five-minute mark so imma head out, peace!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,1769,"I don't handle things well when things get challenging in my life. I start to stress more and fall into more of a deeper hole than before. Although I don't handle it well or good enough as much as I would like to, in the end, I always try to push myself to accomplish the things I need to do even if I'm doing it slowly. I tend to find things that will motivate me to keep working despite how hard life is at that moment. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2307,"When life is challenging usually I just take a step back and do some self mental care. But most important, I try to think of the positive rather than negative and just push myself to get through whatever struggle I am in. I also tend to distract myself from the actual challenge, but eventually I force myself to come back, take it in, and push through."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2318,"When life gets challenging, what I do is I pretty much try my hardest to try all the options that I have out there and use them like let us say, when it is with school, then I try everything possible to pass or even succeed in that class like office hours or even asking the teacher for extra help or extra work in that subject or that chapter. If it's with personal problems, I try to be sane and try to be healthy and make myself happy to do things that'll only make me happy and not try to be sad or depressed, especially in a situation I can't control. If life gets challenging, then Imma has to be up for the challenge and take it head-on because life is filled with obstacle courses, and if I make it past them all, then it'll just be easier from then on. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2305,"When life gets hard honestly, I start wanting to give up. Like right now classes are getting harder and I made sure to keep up with all my assignments at the beginning of the semester, but it still feels like I have a lot to do. I noticed that I start feeling like I’m in a pit, things like cleaning my room stops and I just don’t want to do anything. I also realized that I don’t want to fail so the anxiety of that doesn’t really help much. Some things that help me get through whatever I’m going through are doing little things every day. I make a list of all the important things that I need to get done and I make sure to do them. I also make sure that I clean things around me. If my space is clear and clean my mind will be too and I’m a firm believer in that."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2311,"When life gets challenging, I sometimes take a step back and have a day of self-care. My mental health is more important than whatever it is that I am doing at the moment.  I have had many instances where life gets challenging but I remind myself that any obstacle is only temporary. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2303,"When life becomes difficult, I do my best to try all of the options that are available to me to use them. For example, when it comes to school, I try everything possible to pass or even excel in that class, such as office hours or even asking the teacher for extra support or extra study in that topic or segment. When it comes to personal issues, I try to stay sane and safe, and I try to make myself happier by doing things that can only make me happy, rather than trying to be unhappy or depressed, particularly in a situation about which I have no influence. If life throws a challenge at Imma, she must rise to the occasion and face it head on, for life is full of obstacle courses, and if I get through them all, it'll just get better from there."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2316,"External challenges, usually societal degradation or threats, cause me to dissociate from the situation into melancholy (technically speaking). This is not particularly healthy to suggest to others because this is my optimism adapted from experience. But if you are curious (and have seen X-Men: First Class) there is an understanding that peace/focus is the point between rage and serenity. And that is the best description of what I ground myself to when life becomes challenging. If life becomes internally challenging, I am able to recognize now that I am not focusing. For this, I start with working on my aphantasia by focusing on creating an image and holding focus there. If I am having trouble with motivation, I give myself 2 days to fight the phrase ""what is so impossible?""..after which I have to continually work (i use twitch study rooms or just move to a different subject if I stop working). Life this semester became challenging because I found that I could not reasonably force myself on a pace that was not my own-and I fought myself the whole way. So I also learned that I will take my time: it's not impossible because I will get there."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,691,"What I do when life gets challenging is that I make sure that I am organized. When classes and homework start to pick up it's really helped me to write all my assignments down in my weekly planner and cross them off as I go. I also make sure to take care of my physical/mental health because 1- students often put their physical or mental health on the back burner to focus on their studies and that could be super detrimental 2- because I just feel more motivated and happy even though i'm going through a tough or challenging time. Also, it helps me think about other people who may be going through challenging times also and it's nice to know that I’m not the only one going through a hard time. These are some of the things that I do when I’m facing challenging times to get me through."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2304,"When life gets challenging, my immediate response is to want to take a break from everything and do what gives me happiness in life. I have found that sometimes this can cause issues because it will cause me to get backed up in the things I do. For this reason, I try to take a few deep breaths when I see something that is challenging for me. I find that when something is especially challenging to me, I will have to take a 10-15 minute break. After the short break, I usually feel energized to get back to what I was doing before the break. I have found that in the past, when I would take a break for too long it would make me too stressed out after the break because i have less time to finish whatever it is that is giving me challenges in the first place. I think that 10-15 minutes is the best amount of time for a break because it gives me just enough time to turn my brain off and try to relax. "
