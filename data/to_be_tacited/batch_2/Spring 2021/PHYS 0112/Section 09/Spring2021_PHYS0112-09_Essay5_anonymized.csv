2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2303,"My family's ideals aided me in deciding on a major and what I want to do after college as an engineer. My uncle works in engineering or something similar to areospace. My family values the family business and how I can structure my major, studying, and classes around the dentist mentality. Another factor that helped me get to college was constantly doing my assignments and turning it in on time in order to be better one day in the future. Finally, the most important thing that will motivate me in college is that anything I do can lead to success and prepare me for success later in life. I should look for ways to help myself and those around me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2322,"Neither of my parents graduated college, and they don't have any specific expectations for me, so they aren't really involved in my college experience."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2307,"The values of my community has probably help me navigate through college. I say this because mostly people around my community are older so they help me as well as my family. I feel like they already have experienced it so they would put inputs here and there, and shared their side and what works for them and not. Very thankful for family and the community I met through college because they are helpful. I tend to be inspired by people who are goal achievers and very educated. The values of my community, I feel like we share the same goals and aspirations. Hopefully, I can push myself to reach there."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2305,Growing up I was always taught that college is an important thing to do it was immediately the first choice after I graduated from high school. My parents come from a small island that you can't really see on the map so education was always something that was going to take them far in life. As for me I always knew that I wanted to go to college my parents actually didn't know anything or even how to help me. Sometimes I get really upset and it's something I often think about because I was supposed to graduate a year ago and because of some misadvising and my parents didn't really understand what was going on or what to do so I had to stay longer. In my culture education is very important. Historically women weren’t always allowed to go to school. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,691,"Coming from a community of 95% Hispanics, I grew up seeing people who had to fight their way into this country continue to fight and work so that they could give their children a better life. So I would say that since I grew up in a community like this, I grew up with the mentality that hard work is crucial to make something of myself and make my parents proud. I would say that another thing that helped contribute to me navigate through college was that growing up, my mom made sure to give me chores to do around the house and kind of taught me how to, for lack of better words, ""keep a household"" I feel like because of this, I transitioned very well to living on my own and taking care of whatever comes with that. Most of what I know can be attributed to my parents ,my family and community they made me independent."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2306,"Ever since I was young, it was instilled in me that I should always aspire for success and greatness. And to my family, nothing is better than having a successful kin so I was already somewhat guilt tripped into the place I am right now. I hated it. I never got to take control of the steering wheel of my life But whenever my mind drifts to this topic I always ask myself: do I even know what I really want to do in life? Sometimes I just want to be like Donna Sheridan from Mamma Mia but we know that it is impossible bc 1.) thats fictional 2.) things like that do not really happen to WOC (let's be real). So everyday I wake up with a heavy baggage on my shoulder– doing whatever that makes my family happy even if I am not. Because I am hopeful that one day I might start to like whatever I am doing. I recently lost two grandparents in a span of 40 days and it broke me that I never got to see them in their last moments because they are 7000 miles away and we cannot go home with the restrictions happening. So maybe this is it, I am doing this for them. My grandfather told me in my first year of college that he would be happy and satisfied to see me on stage in 3 years time but he did not make it. But it does not mean  that I would not stop pushing. Other people are counting on me as well and I want to make my grandparents proud. The may not be able to physically be in my graduation, but I am sure they'd have the front row seat to every event in my life from now on."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2316,"The values of my community through the National Society of Black Engineers is to help engineers of African descent make it through and succeed in Engineering: personally, I gain a sense of prescence-pressure to do well because they are spreading themselves and accomplishing so much, as well as a pressure to do well and remove easily on any other underrepresented engineers who will follow after us. The Futurist Society is a community of (mainly) engineers who are continuously doing research and discussing relevant topics to our field: I feel the pressure of being behind which provokes me to move forward. Although I do not have to know about the topics we are speaking about, I know that the circumstances in the way that academics teach engineers(problems which are unlikely to encounter in the field due to the purity of the problem or the formation of problems are imagined by the instructors), I know that I should stay updated in politics/to find a division. (sorry for the run-on sentence!) I am also a part of first-generation students which I have not met but I feel the challenges it brings. Personally, I would like to help first-generation students that I encounter, but could not if I drop out of school. Individually, I feel a pressure to validate myself as a first-generation scholar by making it to graduation and succeed after the hardships that my parents have faced to be able to provide for me with the very little that they had."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2310,"The values of my community has always been to work hard which would lead you to success. My parents were never really that strict on me growing up, but because of that they expected me to work really hard in high school, in which I did. With that, my skills in high school were transferred to college, so it is a little bit easier for me to balance so many things at once. My community has always told me to follow your dreams and they are supportive with what I am passionate about.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2311,"My family has helped me navigate through college since they have done so much for me. I am going to college for my well-being but at the same time, the values that my family has shown me throughout my life have made me want to take this step."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2319,"The values of my family are to be honest, be smart and be wise. One of my mom’s rules is to at least attempt to go to college and see where it takes you. So from a young age, I always knew I was going to college, I just needed to figure out for what. Like most kids, I wanted to be a vet or a doctor when I was older. Once I was in high school and realized how good I was at debating I decided I wanted to become a lawyer. I'm good atg advocating for others and it is something I enjoy. I then taught myself about political science and researched the different kinds of attorneys and looked for what most interested me. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to go to law school but every uphill has  a down hill. During my first semester, I took a political science class as I was a political science major… immediately dropped it. It was so boring! I realized it wasn’t my passion because although I love debating, going to school for it did not excite me. Not the way science does at least."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2302,"I grew up with the mindset of being a first generation student. and when im struggling with school, the back of my mind and motivation is what my mom did for me by bringing me to the U.S for an education and better lifestyle "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2308,"In my life, I have learned many values from my family, friends, and community. Some of them have stuck by me and have helped me to navigate through life and college. For one, honesty has big one the biggest values to me. With being honest, I tell my teachers if I am struggling in class so that I am able to be helped and find alternative ways to learn and or get helped by tutoring and such. Another big value for me and probably the most important is doing what makes you happy. With this, I figured out what I wanted to do with my life and I am now pursuing the career that I want to do. I learned that your life is yours and you do what is best for you and what makes you happy. This has helped me to create motivation for myself because I now have something to look forward to in the future which makes me want to succeed with what I am doing. These have been the biggest values for me and have helped me through so much and get me where I am at today. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2304,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college a lot. Growing up, I was taught to always help those in need. I think this is why I chose to go into the medical field. This is how I decided on what I would study as I rise through higher education. So far, I have chosen my classes according to how I think I could help people best. With the new knowledge I am gaining, I am hopeful that I can do my part to help the world become a better place. I think that especially in times like now, it is important to learn more about the world around us, rather than just what comes from books and labs. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2312,"The values of my community and value have helped me push through college when I was feeling discouraged. All the people in my life are big supporters and really big advocates for going to college, as well as believers that a college degree is necessary to be successful in life. Although there was a slight pressure I've felt more support in my college career than pressure to be in it. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2321,"Nicole HlushkoThe values of my family have helped me navigate through college and to act as motivation for me not to give up and keep pushing to obtain a higher education. My grandma really wants me to succeed and she really wants for me to be able to pursue my dreams in becoming a Dentist, my grandma motivates me and gives me the support that I need when I am having a difficult/stressful time during school. Whenever I feel upset or overwhelmed because of school, I try to give myself a break and give myself time to breathe so that I can feel rejuvenated and motivated to finish up my studies. My grandma is a doctor and has been through tough schooling in Belarus to obtain her credible position, I want to be like her and stay motivated along the path towards my career so that I can help people like her. My grandma reminds me of my worth and how I am smart and can get through college if I put the time and effort in.

2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2313,"My family's ideals aided me in deciding on a major and what I want to do after college, whether it's as a soccer player or anything else. My entire family is involved in soccer or something related to college and education. My family places a high emphasis on the family business, so I'm thinking about how I can structure my major, schooling, and classes to reflect that.Another thing that helped me get through college was to always finish my assignments, turn it in on time, and complete everything in order to be effective one day.

2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2320,"Even before entering college, my life was heavily influenced by my culture and my family. Going into a STEM major was a choice that I didn't wanna make entirely on my own, but I did it to fulfill my family's expectations. However, going through college I realized that my family doesn't define my future, that is all entirely up to me. It sucks to hear those who regret letting others choose for them when in reality you can and should choose for yourself. As a Pilipino, it's expected that you will pursue a degree in STEM, medicine, engineering, lawyer, etc. Mainly a profession that promises good money and fortune for the future. I get that, but there's an aspect of happiness that can't be fulfilled when you work for money unless it's a career that you are actually passionate about. I hope to find that one day, even if I am a bit lost today. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2314,"Well, I have been in college for two semesters but I still feel like I have not yet truly experienced life as an actual college student. Obviously I am a college student learning from college-level courses, but I feel like having to learn while social distancing prevents me from experiencing the college life. I believe that college serves as a transition from your young dependent life to your more independent and real life, not only in a career-sense but also a social sense. What gets me through college, is the end of it. I like to think that the harder life is, the better it will be later on. College is not easy sometimes, as it can certainly get really difficult. But knowing what I can get from it and how my life could be easier if I plan things right certainly serves as a motivation for myself to get through college."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2318,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of the origin or choice) helped me navigate through college?""My family's values helped me figure out my major and what I want to become after college as a dentist. My whole family is dentist-related or something that has to do with the dentist business. My family values all about the family business and how I should format my major and my learning and my classes based on that dentist mindset. Something else that helped me navigate through college is always to complete my work and turn everything in on time and complete everything to be successful one day in the future. Lastly, the most important thing to help me throughout college is how everything I do should lead to success and lead up to being successful later in life. I should see to benefit myself and others around me. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2317,"I'm from a Scandiwegian-Scottish American family that doesn't stay too true to my roots and doesn't really keep in contact with my American part of the family. To be completely honest, my recent family heritage hasn't played much of a part in terms of helping me navigate through college. That said, I work in Professor Simonin's botany lab and have been an active member of a 1-1/2 year long book club dedicated to understanding and mitigating racism in STEM. I realize that as a white American person that science and STEM fields haven't been as inaccessible in terms of personal identity or actuation as Americans from other communities. I believe it's best to level the playing field with respect to the more nuanced and less apparent systemic racism that affects lifestyle choices and accessibility. "
