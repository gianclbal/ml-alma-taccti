2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2313,My goal in life is to live a very happy and successful life with a little less stress. I plan on doing this by playing soccer and going to school which I believe is going to help me through my life. Another thing is my family helps me through all this and is amazing to me. This class is helping me achieve these goals by taking me into developing skills that I know will come in handy in the real world. Physics is something this is always applied in our everyday life and can develop us to have a better understanding of things. This class is showing us the secrets to all this. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2305,"At this point I have two goals one is to understand physics and to become a doctor. Physics is something that I’ve always tried to avoid because it seemed hard and boy was I right. Sometimes it feels like the things I know are wrong when it comes to physics. It takes me longer to do the classwork and I feel like a lot of other kids understand the work better than I do which frustrates me, not because they know it and I don’t, but because I don’t understand. I know that I will pass and become a doctor because it’s honestly my calling. I enjoy helping people."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2319,"My goal is to  become a veterinarian. I am majoring in bio with a concentration in physiology. This class has helped me better understand physics and things such as Newton's laws. Although it doesn't directly translate into my future occupation, it is still one of the classes on my career roadmap. I also enjoy physics so no biggie! This is my first year and it’s been rough online! It’s hard to focus and I have not been engaged with any content for any class. The reason I love science so much is because it’s hands-on. That is how I learn best. I started off with a positive attitude despite this, but it’s still been a struggle. I appreciate the simulations in the labs though because that’s the next best thing. That helped to make some of the content stick."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2311,"My goals are to hopefully graduate and go into the PA field. I just recently pursued becoming a PA, hence why I am taking this course. Despite me being a psychology major, this class is helping me achieve my goal by making me understand, and grasp the concept of physics. It is a slow process, but I'm enjoying my time here."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2312,"My goals are to get a kinesiology degree and hopefully become a physical therapist. This class is giving me the basics I need in physics to understand and learn about in my higher division classes. This class is doing exactly, providing me with a background and base in physics and satisfying one of my GEs. In addition to that, I've grown more curious in the scientific field as I grow older and understanding physics helps with my personal curiosity in science. This class also deepens my understandings from what I learn in lecture which is always a plus."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,691,"I would say that my main goal for this class is to finish this semester with a better understanding of physics. I've never taken a physics course before so I literally had no idea what it was gonna be like but so far so good. Another goal I have set  for myself this semester in physics 111/112 is to ask more questions. Sometimes I feel awkward/embarrassed asking questions and continue on without understanding completely but I realize that for many reasons that isn't the best approach to college or life in general lol. So yeah, those are my goals for this semester in and out of our physics class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2303,"My aim is to pass this class and complete my GE as soon as possible so that I can take all of the upper-division courses I can in order to get my degree, go to Tesla become a Mechanical engineer. This class is assisting me in completing those goals by making it easier for me to finish the class and move on to upper-division classes, bringing me closer to the point that I need to take around 20 more classes to finish college, get my degree, and becoming something great, and it is also assisting me in moving closer to my goal and towards achieving my dream of working beside Elon Musk. I want as an adult and have fun with it and start making bigger productions and bigger plans in life and becoming greater."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2315,My current goal is to just finish college with my degree of bachelors in Chemistry. At the current moment This class help me achieve this goal because its a pre-requisite to my major. But in seriousness I hope physics will help me improve my overall thinking skills improve. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2317,"My internet went out Friday morning and wasn't restored till Monday; my motorcycle controller blew out and I was stuck on grizzly peak. I'm having one of the worst weeks of my adult life, everything is going wrong. It's my 33rd birthday and all I want to do is cry. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,1769,I have a couple of goals. One of them is that I want to graduate high school with good grades. Another goal of mine is to have a career in the medical field. This class is helping me achieve these goals because I enjoy learning physics and I believe taking some courses you like in college will help you achieve good grades since you enjoy those topics. This will help me achieve my goal to have a career in the medical field because it is a requirement to get into medical school.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2304,"My goal is to graduate from SFSU, then pursue a degree in nursing. After that, I would like to specialize and become a CRNA. This class is helping me pursue my goals because it is a prerequisite for my upper division biology classes. I hope to do well in this class so I can keep a high GPA, so that ultimately I will have a high GPA so I can get into a nursing program."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2307,"My goals are to hopefully succeed in this class and lecture. Physics is hard but I could reach my success by reaching out and even going to office hours. Doing the homework will help me practice more also, and studying each problem by step by step, going over slides as well and notes."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2302,My goals in life is to just be comfortable in the future. I don't wanna stress about money or my job. Im hoping this class just helps me fulfill the requirements i need to get my degree.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2318,My goal is to pass this class and finish my GE hella fast so I can take all the upper-division classes I can to get my degree and go to dental school and become a dentist and run the family business for my dad.  This class is helping me complete those goals by making it easier to finish the class and start heading for the upper-division classes and getting m e closer and closer to the point where I need to take like 20 more classes to finish college and get my degree and become something great and its also helping me get closer to my goal and towards me achieving my dream of running my dads family business and making loads of money to buy all the things I want as an adult and have fun with it and start making bigger productions and bigger plans in life and becoming greater.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2320,"My goals are to finish this semester off with good grades and to get another Dean’s List on my official transcript. I also plan to graduate from SFSU with honors with a Bachelor of Science degree in Cell and Molecular Biology. This class is helping me achieve these goals by understanding the fundamentals of physics which can be applied to other aspects of my studies. Additionally, I have to take this class for my degree anyway so I couldn’t avoid it. More goals regarding this semester include staying consistent in my work and not falling behind, trying to maintain the sanity I have left from being in quarantine for too long (excuse my language, but f*ck coronavirus), trying to stay alive and healthy, and try not to burn out too early in the semester (I don’t know why I’m saying that I feel like I burned out months ago). Well, the timer is about to run out have a good day and stay thriving!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2314,"I do not really have any goals in life except to be extremely financially wealthy. I grew up in a family that had money, but my parents did not spend it wisely. They always had bad credit, bought cars they did not really need, struggled on bills; plus, I think they also filed for bankruptcy. Not only was the issue that my parents could not spend money properly but was the fact that we had it. My parents could never agree on anything financially as they did not when to save money or when to ball out which would eventually lead into many arguments. In the future, I want to be able to live a life where I would not have to worry about having to pay my mortgage, worrying about my credit score being too low, and in general, avoid being in the same situation my parents were in."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2306,"To be honest, my goal is to just be happy with my life. It does not have to have to most well-paid job or live in the biggest house but I just want me and my family be genuinely happy and satisfied. Money would be nice, though. I want to travel and see the world and have new experiences everyday and we all know in order to achieve that we have to find a good paying job. But I do not want to be as slave to capitalism and I was not born rich or have a trust fund waiting for me when I turn 21. But to be practical, it looks like I have to work hard now so I can get a job and work again until I am satisfied. This world is weird but hey– I got no choice am I right? Unless some kind of miracle happens to me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2309,"Right now everything has been really up in the air for me, I just switched my major from Marine Biology to Business, so a lot of my original goals are changing. I am quite happy with the switch, I realized stem wasn't for me and I couldn't envision myself in a stem career for the rest of my life. My current goals though are to be able to travel the world, and I believe that by doing so I will need to learn about finances and all that money stuff that will set me up for my future, and in my opinion, open up many more doors for me. My parents are business owners so I will begin to work with them on the side of school and work. So my goal is to continue to do well with them, and grow my own business apart from them to provide for my future filled with traveling. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2310,"As of right now, my goal is to graduate. It is kind of hard to connect with my classmates and professors since everything is online but I hope once everything goes back to being in-person, I get to connect with my classmates more. One of my career goals is to become a pharmacist. I am accomplishing those goals by taking courses in order to get me into pharmacy school. I have yet to connect with anyone who is in pharmacy school, but I have a list of people to contact once graduation gets closer. I also created a list of pharmacy schools to apply to once graduation gets closer. Honestly, I didn't know how this class is helping me achieve these goals, but I suppose it is because of critical thinking abilities and how I need to build those skills in order to get into medical school."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2316,"My goals are to leave the semester with a strong foundation in physics that I can rely on when the discipline of Calculus I, II, III and possibly IV are added to this science. I am insecure about my mathematic skills because I have not given an honest attempt to the classes. Here, I am hoping to sincerely try with all of my classes, but time is my major constraint against my learning pace and finding the right methods to fit the time that I have. This class has been helping me regain some of the time investment into physics because concepts are more easily broken down in a way that I can understand and apply to the lecture. I tend to do better in lab classes than lectures, so my goal is to look at this class and then apply the lecture coursework to what I learn in here. It seems backwards, but that is how I have been successful in other science classes thus far. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2321,"One of my overall academic goals is to be prepared for the DAT (Dental Admissions Exam) and to be knowledgeable on topics/concepts that will carry on in graduate school. I hope to gain a better understanding of Physics by the end of this semester and to feel more comfortable in solving Physics problems, as I didn’t really understand Physics that well in high school. Another one of my goals is to attend office hours as much as possible whenever I need help with my Physics homework, assignments, labs, and other questions that I may have. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2308,"My goals in school are to try my hardest to succeed and make sure that my mental health is taken care of. Even if I am stressed, my goal is to maintain my stress so that is does not become overbearing and make it hard for school and other things in my life. This class will teach me new things that I have needed help on in physics lecture and it will teach me new ways to learn. I like that I have a chose to work in groups or by myself because sometimes I think working independently helps and sometimes working in groups help. I will learn to grow as a person from working in groups and individually. Another goal of mine is to try new things so that I can learn to become open minded and a better well rounded person. I want learn new skills and be able to develop my adaptability skills. I want to better my skills sets as a person, and I feel that becoming more open minded will help me in the long run. "
