Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2302,"I'm here because for some reason I have a purpose to do in my life. Whether it is big or small I'm supposed to do something in this life, I don't think I know what it is exactly or when I'll know, but for now I'm going to just live my life I guess. I hope when people answers this they feel that they are here for a reason, everyone matters."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2303,"I am here because I want to move forward, I am here because I want to better myself and my family, I am here because knowledge is key for growth. I am the eldest child in my family and I need to set a good example for my younger siblings since my parents didn’t have the luxury to do so back home. I’m here because I’m afraid of the thought that I can’t or won’t be anything of myself. There’s so many people that look up to me and expect me to do great. That’s why I am here."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2304,"I am here because physics is a prereq class I need in order to take my upper division classes and get my degree. I am a student at SFSU because I applied for the nursing program at the school. On the application, it made me select a secondary major just in case I did not get into the nursing program. At first, I never really gave it much thought. I assumed I would get into nursing school somewhere because of my high GPA and test scores. Unfortunately, I did not get into nursing school. Giving the option for that second major choice really helped me have a back up plan that I did not know I would even need. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2305,"I am here because I want to be a doctor, and this is one of my medical school requirements. I feel like that’s the reason that I’m on this earth. I know I’m here to help and to heal. I want to make a positive impact in the world and that includes all the people and living things on it. I’ve wanted to be a doctor ever since I can remember it’s my biggest passion in life. That and to have my own farm where I take care of animals. Honestly, those are the only things I really think about. There is a lot of bad and greed in the world and I just want to make the world a better place to live in."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2306,"I honestly don't know why I am here. But everytime I ecounter this question I am always reminded of the quote ""God made the planets, stars, nature...etc, and he decided that the world needs you too."" I am not religious, but the thought of a greater being placing me into this world makes me (somewhat) feel wanted. Yeah, the world is a big place and it seems like it is impossible to know what your purpose truly is but what if... some of our purpose in life is to just...live? Meet new people, enjoy the beach, eat your favorite icecream, etc. It does not have to be something big like winning a nobel peace prize or be like Jeff Bezos (eat the rich!) but I think my purpose is to just live life. Appreciate the little things. Make the most of what I have. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2307,"I am here because I am required to take this class in order to get my Chemistry degree. I am very passionate about Chemistry and want to look into achieving a good career wherever this degree takes me. This is my first physics class I have taken, I want to succeed in this class hopefully, and use what I learned and apply it in the future. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2308,"I am here in this class because it is a part of my pre-requisite for my major and also for the grad school I want to go to, I also am required to take this class. Am I excited? Not really. Am I really nervous about taking this class? Yes. I am scared that I will not succeed, and I will not understand that class. I have never once taken physics of any kind in my lifetime, and physics is very intimidating to me. Right now, I am already lost and confused in lecture and it is only the second week. I want to be able to do good in the class, but it is not an easy subject to understand. I have never been good at word problems and physics is full of word problems. I always have a hard time understanding what I am being asked in word problems, but I guess this is a challenge I have to face. I am glad that I am no longer working and now I can solely focus on school. Hopefully I find success and the ideas of physics clicks with me and hopefully I will understand physics."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,691,Alexis Banuelos PHY 112Feb 4I am here in college because I want to become a doctor and college is the only way to do that. Im in physics 112 because I have to be in order to get further in my major. I’ve never taken a physics class before so I can’t really say I like it but I’m excited to learn more about it because it seems pretty cool so far.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2309,"Why am I here. Honestly that is the question of the century, I hate school, I do not like homework, and I honestly don't even like science. But I like it more than anything else. I grew up wanting to be in the ocean 24/7, being a san diegan that comes easily, but that pull to the ocean grew to because a strong urge to learn all of its hidden creatures and learn all its secrets. So, I am here now, majoring in Marine Biology, if not for present me, then it's for the younger me who was always so eager to learn and explore. That same pull for adventure remains, honestly even stronger than before, which is why I question my decision to be here now when the world is open for the taking. So, I take my free time to my advantage and leave my homework for later because wasting a single day will drive me insane."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2310,"In high school, the artistic director would always ask students this question. I would hear “Why would he ask this so often,” or “I just go to this school because I wanted to.” Since my high school was an arts school and had different art focuses, it was very difficult for those who studied (let’s say creative writing or photography) to know why they attended that school. Once you start studying something you’re interested in, there’s a chance that you can fall out of passion. I didn’t know why I went to that high school, but I do know why I go to SFSU. I am here at SFSU to study biology with different professors and classmates with the same interest and goal as me. I knew I wanted to be in the medical field once I started volunteering and I wanted to force myself to be in a new area (since I am from San Diego.) I am at SFSU to study and explore."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2311,"What am I here? If I focus on my existence as a whole, I did not necessarily choose to be here. I was brought into this world without a purpose. As you grow older, you tend to focus on your path and start to think about your actual purpose on this earth. It can mean many things for different individuals. For me, I do not think I have a set answer on what my purpose is, but I know what I want to become. I want to become an aid to the community that I was brought up in and be there for them like they were there for me. I want to help them in some way, but do not specifically know what that is going to be yet."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2312,"I am here because this is part of the requirements I need to get my degree and graduate. However, I'm also here because I thought I would enjoy physics, and to some extent I still believe that. It's been a little rough, taking a semester off and the math that i have to use for this course being very stale in my mind, but I think i'll get the hang of it again soon. I've also always been very curious to know the specific and detailed science behind things, i like seeing and understanding why things happen, or what something really is, on a smaller/more detailed level. I'm also here because I wanted to take a class with one of my friends and this satisfied both of our requirements, and when we talked about it, we realized we were already in the same class, just at different time slots. I've also come to enjoy learning alot, I just hate the extra work that comes with it. (homework)"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2313,I am here because I was born into this world with a purpose that I have to fulfill in life. It might not be anything big or small but I have to live my life out and enjoy it. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2314,"im here because i want to develop my skills in physics, and to prove to my family that i get good grades. im also here to learn new topics about this class and to overall become smarter. i appreciate you teaching this class daily and providing me with the knowledge to excel in this field. Idk anything about physics, I just took this class as it is a prerequisite for most classes I need for my major. I am actually working right now while typing this so I have no idea what is going on."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2315,"Why am I here? From a general POV, I really only took this class cause it was a pre-requisite for my major and even though its a pre-requisite, I still like to enjoy learning the other science classes since its still nice to learn some new things that I don't know much about in that specific topic. From a general POV, I'm in college for a major because its a basic pathway to take in order to ""succeed in life"" or to ""make lots of money and live free"". That if I want to live happy and well, I am required to go to college to have a happy future. From MY POV, I am here to live out MY life, to do what I love to do. I love to just listen to music, doing my thing on the computer, hanging out with friends and playing video games, playing with old friends and making new ones around the world. Some days I gotta go to work and make a small living for myself and keep myself in check while I do so, but whats wrong with a lil challenge in the road. I am here because I am here and I'm ok with being here and doing what I gotta do while also doing things that I love to do. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,1769,"Why am I here? I’m here to achieve my career goals. I decided to go to college because I want to pursue a career in the medical field, and I hope to follow my family’s footsteps. Not only it’s for my family but I’m very passionate about learning more about science, medical field, and I just want to help others as a career. I’m here because I want to be successful in life and I want to be able to live my life without no regrets."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2316,"The purpose of me being here is, first and foremost, to get an introduction to physics. I will be taking Physics in the future and want to build a foundation of the concepts and even equations before having to add Calculus to it in Phys 220. I have not been admitted into the engineering major and did not expect to be taking this course, but I decided because I honestly have only been introduced to physics once in my previous 16 years of school curriculum. I do not know why is made so inaccessible, especially when it is the science that I understand explains all sciences and understanding of the physical life. I only was able to take it one semester during my senior year and honestly it was still taken away from me by the classmates. Heart to heart, the boys kept trying to overpower me in the labs and discouraged any questions I had in various ways. If it wasn’t my being unable to do much beyond gluing popsicle sticks, then it was me allowing others to take my attention away from the class. Generally, the teachers and students in my academic foundations did not focus on the academics which I also did not start to do until maybe last semester. I am definitely not the best at physics, and I am still trying to find a schedule to study more, but personally I do not have a family to go back to, so its physics or nothing for my future. I hope this makes sense and I hope I can pass with comprehension this semester."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2317,"I’m an adult student, I used to work as a paramedic and cardiac + EKG technician also licensed in phlebotomy and practical medical assisting. I never really intended to work in medicine, I just grew up in a ridiculously abusive single-parent household and was homeless in Chicago halfway through my senior year of highschool. I’ve always been interested in plants, plant taxonomy, the history of plant-related trade, and general plant evolutionary bio/physiology and am taking your class as part of my overall major trajectory for botany. I also build pretty bulky hybrid electric bicycle/motorcycles in my spare time (65mph+ 75mpcharge+) and would like some more comprehensive technical physics-related knowledge in regards to this motion-related side-hobby."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2318,I am here cause this is not only a GE requirement but it's also part of my major to take this class and pass for this semester. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2319,"It’s funny because this is something I think of often. Do I base my purpose off of religion? Or society? I remember in my seventh grade science class we were told our purpose is to reproduce and die. The only thing I’m sure of so far is that I’m here to learn. Learning is fundamental. During my time here I plan to make an impact and care for the Earth. I was born on Earth day so I’ve always had a corny connection to mother nature. Currently, I am in school with the intention to become a veterinarian. I think my purpose is to love and care for Earth and all its creatures. I’ve never really been fond of people but I do see the good in us, we’re just so destructive and hateful sometimes. I hope we can gradually find a form of peace and begin to restore our beautiful home, because we’re killing it!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2320,"I am here because my parents decided to have a child and I suddenly became a human being. 19 years later I am sitting in my room on a zoom call with Jonathan for my physics lab. I wouldn’t have expected this to have been asked in a physics lab if I am going to be honest, but it really does get you thinking about your life and stuff. I honestly hope this suffices as an answer because I am just writing as I think about how to answer this question and even now I don't know if I answered it correctly to the fullest extent. Going further into this topic, I’m physically here in my room on a zoom call because of something called COVID-19. It sucks, but what can we do? I am in this zoom call because taking this lab is a requirement for my major and I hope I do pass this lab section because I don’t want to retake this lab in the future. Okay I have a minute left and I’m supposed to wrap up but I hope this answers the question and have a good day!Word Count: 193"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2321,"My name is Nicole Hlushko, I am a second year Biology student at SF State. I am taking PHYS 111/112 because it is a Prerequisite course for admission to Dental School as well as a Prerequisite for my major. The last time that I took a Physics class was my Junior year of High School. When I was taking Physics in High School, I had trouble understanding the main concepts and formulas for solving Physics problems. I hope that after taking PHYS 111/112 at SF State, that I will better understand these main concepts and be more comfortable in solving Physics problems. At this moment, I am not sure how I will use Physics in my everyday life after completing this course. I also question why Physics with a laboratory component counts as a Prerequisite for Dental School or how it will be useful in my future career as a Dentist. I hope to gain a better understanding of Physics and its importance in everyday life."
