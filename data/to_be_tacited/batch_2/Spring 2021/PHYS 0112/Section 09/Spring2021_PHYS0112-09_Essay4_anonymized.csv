2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2302,"I know I have EOP and metro as resources but i vdont know im so hard headed when it comes to asking for help but here i am, behind on work "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2303,"I have videos from my professor that teach me the subject and show me examples that I can use as tools. I still have office hours where I can get support and get my questions answered. I still have my lecture to help me out because the things we're learning in Physics are the same topics we're learning in the lab, and they should be able to help us understand the topic and things to do in the lab and lecture at one stage, so it'll be like killing two birds with one stone. Another guide is the internet khan academy or other blogs that can help me read or understand the subject or topic better and learn the homework or mission at hand. However, it does not always support as well as it can, but it is still a useful resource to have on hand. However, the videos and the class make more sense to use than just Khan Academy."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2304,"I feel like this can be a very open ended question. I have my own support system in my family and friends. Outside of this, because I have not been able to take classes on campus, I am not exactly sure about the resources SFSU has to offer me if I need assistance with either classes or what classes to choose. I have made an appointment in the past with a counselor so that I could pick the classes I may need, but at times it feels like they do not always help me with what I need. Outside of academics, fortunately I have not really needed to seek outside assistance with any problems I have encountered in life. Luckily for me, I am able to seek assistance from my family and friends when I need it. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2307,"Resources I have to support me is family, friends, and education like professors, peers. Usually when I need support I usually lean to friends and family to support me. Also, if we are talking about different resources I also have a therapy to help support as well. I can depend on any of those for resources mentally and for like school.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2318,"""What resources do I have to support me?""The resources that I have in my grasp is I have videos from the professor that teach me the subject and show me the examples. I also have office hours to help me out and answer my questions if I have any. I also have my lecture to help me out too because the things we are learning in Physics is the same thing we are learning in the lab and that they should be able to help us learn the subject and things to do in the lab and lecture it'll be two birds with one stone at one point. Some other resource is the internet khan academy or extra websites that can help me learn the subject or the topic better and better understand the subject and learn the homework or the task at hand but sometimes doesn't help as much but still a resource to use at hand but the videos and the class makes more sense to use than just khan academy. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2305,"There are many recourses that I have to help me. I depend a lot on my family and boyfriend since I don’t have many friends. I find that when I get stressed out that’s when I need the most support. Things get hard in life, whether it’s school or work I find that there are many things that I do to try to calm myself down. I know that if I need a lot of help there are professors there to help me out. I know that physics was really hard for me this semester. I struggled a lot and honestly, it was hard for me to understand things. I took a SCI class which really helped me understand a lot of the stuff that I need to get done. Physics is hard for me to conceptualize so that’s why I struggle. I know that there are also tutoring services to help me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2311,"The resources that I have to support me are my peers, friends, and teachers. I will say that I tend to get help from my friends first since we are pursuing similar career paths and can help me understand topics"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2316,"I have the resources from the school supporting me. The Dean on Call can help if there are nonacademic issues happening. I also have Tarshel Beards, the director of the Black Unity Center, and Dan Curtis Cummins who is my director over EXCO. My academic help for tutoring has better options with San Diego Miramar College which offers live tutors. I also have a connection to the Gator Crisis Housing Chain of command if an emergency occurs. I'm sure that if I attend office hours, I can gain support from mainly any professors I talk to if I am asking questions or speaking genuinely. When I have had conversations with my professors or tutors about how they developed into their positions, they usually provide me enough perspective for me to take away encouragement, even if they aren't as open to talking as others. Also, I have various resources through the San Francisco Public Library such as language learning apps, online databases, tutoring, and more. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2310,"One resource that I have to support me would be my friends and family. My friends are always there, listening about my day and help me look at situations in different perspectives so I can better understand myself and the situation. I'm not that close to my family, but I am trying to build that bond with my mom and obviously the first step to do that is to open up. I also have my professors for some moral support and to help me understand material better. My advisor emails me some links to mental health resources so I have her as well. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2317,"Honestly, this semester has really stretched me thin in terms of resources. I've been in it with my landlady since February; it has caused me an immense amount of stress. I don't have any family, and my estranged little sister is going through the motions again despite over a decade of advice. One thing getting me through this is a happy hour that my friends and I have been doing on Zoom since the pandemic started, we're a close group of bar friends that have known each other for some 8+ years. Unfortunately, as I write this, one of my older friends is on life-support due to COVID, and his partner is absolutely devastated, it will be the third or fourth COVID passing related to the bar patrons.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,1769,"I have quite a lot of resources that support me. When it comes to education, my professors and classmates are good resources that support me in learning and sometimes mental health. Resouces that help me with my well-being and mental health would have to be my therapist, social media (sometimes), and art (helps me be stress free)."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,691,"Some of the  resources that I think I had this semester to support me are the Tutoring and Academic Support Center(TASC) at sfsu, the library website, my advisors and my professors. TASC really helped me when I had specific topics that I felt I didn't understand after a lecture. I used the library website a lot this semester for a research project. It was super easy to use and was super helpful with my project. Another resource that I had this semester to support me were my advisors. I would meet with both my EOP and major advisor and both really helped me organize and plan out my next couple of years at sfsu. For the most part, all my professors were super understanding this semester (given the current situation of the world). I felt comfortable enough asking questions and when I did they explained it to me until I got it. I really appreciated the support that all my professors gave their students because it really made a difference."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2319,"My main sources of support come from my mom and my boyfriend. With school being online, class has been abnormally challenging for me. I have always had a problem with procrastination but I have never had an issue with actually learning content. This school year I have found myself in an uncomfortable and unfamiliar territory. My mom has been here to remind me that failure is a part of learning and is an unavoidable part of success. Yes, I struggled this year, but I’ll do better next semester. I’ll be great, because there’s no other option for me. My boyfriend is always there to listen to me complain about my coursework and who I cry on when I feel overwhelmed and want to quit. Lastly, I am my support system. I remind myself of who I am and who I will become. I’m not just doing this because I have to, it’s my passion. I love animals and I love learning. I was born for this and it is what I will die doing."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2320,"The resources I have to support me are my professors/teachers (some of who really reinforce that they can help outside of lectures and laboratories), family (my day one support system), friends (especially those who take the same lectures and laboratories as I do), and counselors/health experts if it comes to that (for mental health reasons). I also have resources online that can help me in terms of school work such as the online textbooks that I have to read for lectures, iLearn where I can find the work I need to do for my labs and lectures, and google in general for the docs feature, slides feature, and sheets feature which I frequently use for most if not all of my classes. I also use Google, in general, to clear up any confusions I may have about a topic by searching up articles and websites that can help clarify and confusions. Lastly, and most importantly, I also have my counselor who is very compassionate and caring and I know that I can ask him for help with regard to classes and university stuff."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2312,"The resources I have to support me are alot of friends, both for academic purposes and personal purposes. My friends who are older are there to support me academically and also just as a friend. I also have friends who are just my friends to support me in life and any endeavors and things I'd like to do/try. Strictly academically, I have all my professors, and previous teachers I can ask for help and advice if my question applies to them. I also have this class as a resource as well as any group chats and servers that I'm in with my fellow classmates. All those together are my support system both academically and personally."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2321,"The resources that I have to support me are the tutoring resources at SF State to help me with homework assignments/projects. Another resource that I have when it comes to asking for help with an assignment is going to my professors' office hours, I find it very useful to attend office hours for additional help and guidance. Apart from academic resources, I also have resources at SF State to help me with my mental and physical health, such as the Health Promotion and Wellness program that I am part of. Being part of HPW helps me connect with other students and student leads as well as engage in enriching activities which help educate me on the importance of mental and physical health, this program provides me with useful presentations and informative sessions regarding multiple topics around health (sexual health, mental health, drugs/alcohol awareness, de stress methods, food/housing, etc.) Lastly, I have my grandma and my boyfriend as resources, they help support and uplift me in challenging times. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2313,For when I look at resources I don't usually look at them as materials or objects. I think things or people that will help me in life and move me towards in life. So for resources that are supporting me we can first talk about my family and friends and how I know that they only want what's best for me. These are the resources that I feel comfortable moving towards and knowing that they got my back 100%. Another thing is the professors in State where if I have any questions about school or anything in life they would be there for me to talk to. I feel like that I can always be relaxed and comfortable with my professors since they are so caring and understanding about a student's life. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2314,"I have access to many resources out there. I have access to libraries, the internet, certain programs or workshops, tutors, and many other things. The internet in particular is a great resource because it can give you access to many things. I also have access to school services that could provide me with the support or information I need about something. I also have the ability to communicate with many professors and past teachers that I believe would be willing to help me out in any way possible. In a sense, I also have access to many food resources and necessities I need to live a proper life. But most importantly, my most important resource is friends. True friends would be willing to help you out in any way they can regardless of the situation. Great friends can be great resources for anything. You could learn many things from friends and they could connect you to many other things in the world. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,9,2308,"I have so many resources in my life that help me get through school and so much more. For school I have textbooks, other people in my classes, teachers and so much more. If I need help, I can ask teachers and other classmates for help. I could also use the internet as a resource. The internet, especially now, is one of the biggest and most used resource that I have. Since covid, this is how I am able to communicate with everyone in school, learn and go to school via zoom and etc., and so much more. My family, friends and all the people I love in my life are also my resources. They help me through life to help guide me in life. They give me the love and support I need and they are always there when I need them. They are the best and my favorite resource in my life. "
