2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2263,"So my current goals of this class is to get a better understanding of physics. I will not lie when I say I can get easily confused with these topics but I want to be able to understand these topics. So the way this class is helping me is giving me these interactive labs, these interactive labs help with some of the information that I'm trying to digest by making it shown in a easy to understand format. So, for me these labs really help with trying to understand all these topics especially with this being my first year in college with everything moving a lot faster then I'm used to with high school. Another goal of mine is to finally understand those post-labs because I'm failing those and I do not know why, so for that I asked a question on the reflection and answering back will be really helpful."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2265,"There are multiple reasons why I am taking this class, the main one being that it is a prerequisite for my other lower division classes, but I definitely developed an interest. I want to learn the basic factors that our world uses in order to function, whether that is acceleration, velocity, force, or work. This class is definitely helping me achieve those goals by showing me various situations where these concepts can be used. Using the textbooks, the slides provided in class, and more really helps me understand. I am also taking advantage of the videos that my peers are posting on the physics lecture page. Since we are supposed to post videos that we found very helpful, they are actually great at assisting me through a problem and clarifying any potential questions that I have. I am also thankful for the recorded lecture videos as I can go back to them as many times I need to."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2268,"My goals are to do better by learning from my mistakes. I'd like to manage my time better, take advantage of my resources, and be sure to stay in communication with my instructors to be sure to succeed and that I am meeting my goals. This class would help me by understanding that there are deadlines, there is the opportunity to collaborate with partners in our assignments, and how it is open to ask questions. I will be able to succeed and meet the goals I have set for myself by setting an organized schedule for myself to stay on task and focused. This class can also help me reach my goals of learning more about physics that I planned on because I can apply l learned concepts to my professional field or when others may make connections to what I have learned preciously too. My goal is to understand more and I think I can also improve this by doing more research on physics concepts and learn through other resources such as YouTube videos or tutorials. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2260,"My goals are to reach a certain level of achievement academically and professionally so that I may have peace of mind and stability in my future and my future home. I think it is a big question to ask young people what one they want to be or what they want to do for the rest of their lives career wise, so my goal is to receive an education that directs me down a path of interest but have that path branch into many niches. I am sure throughout my future, life will change directions many times and I want to be able to change and adapt with it. Physics, this physics class, and future physics classes are necessary for me to complete my degree. These classes are necessary because they correlate with so many other important classes I am/will take like calculus and biology and kinesiology. Physics is in our everyday lives as well. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2270,"Reflective Journaling #2My goals are to be hard working and achieve the things necessary to succeed. I will try to turn everything in on time and study to understand concepts. I want to work in the medical field, whether it be medical research or as a physician. For that reason, I'm taking many science related classes. This class helps me achieve this goal because physics is necessary to understand some parts of biology. Physics plays a big part in our lives and affects us each day, such as gravity. It's interesting to see just how significant physics is in our world and systems. Therefore, my understanding of physics will help me in the long run. Sometimes, other sciences are required to interpret biology. A more specific example would be if a patient I’m diagnosing has symptoms such as dizziness and fatigue. Many possibilities could be considered, but we also need to consider the cause that could be disorientation from gravity and high velocity as possible explanations."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2261,My goals for this semester are to finish the semester with a piece of strong knowledge for most of my classes and try my best on learning even though is hard to keep up motivation in these difficult moments and with online learning. One specific goal that I have this semester is to be able to understand this class and know how to do physics. this is the first time that I am taking physics I didn't take physics in high school so this is my first physics class which is why I want to end the semester with strong knowledge in this class and my other classes. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2267,"My goal is to become a scientist at Genentech. that is my current aspiration as I have always had a passion for the science field. I love this subject and have only found joy in school doing labs and doing this subject. this made me pursue my Biochemistry major and am looking forward to the future to come. Currently, I am in this school because of the Genentech Founders Scholarship Program and I am extremely grateful for not only the scholarship but the resources they have given me to excel during college. I look forward to continuing working with my program as well as Genentech in general to pursue my dream career. This class can help me achieve my goals since physics is an essential thing to learn for my major. It is an essential course to know in general. Physics is used every day with everything we do from motion to force to electricity to anything really. Knowing physics is a must if I want to excel in my major or in life in general so I'm looking forward to learning as much as I can in this class!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2262,"My goals are not very in depth and are just something i make up to give myself at least some motivation. I want to at least pass my classes, I want to understand the topic, and I want to be able to say i tried. So far i have not been able to complete any of my goals. I know thats not at all what i want to realize and something i dont want to accept but its true. Im not a good student and I dont pass my college classes very often. I need to do better. i cant keep disappointing everyone around me. Its too hard. I cant keep doing this to my self. But i cant change it. I still cant get motivation. The only thing that helps me achieve my goal is spite. If i know i can do better than someone and if i know i can get something out of it, i put alot of effort into it. Its not a reliable way of motivation but when i do i make sure it gets done."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2274,"In the broader, big picture, point of view, my goals are to have a successful career and to live a happy life. However, in order to do so, I must have smaller goals in mind to help me work my way there. My current goal that I am focused on is to find something that I am passionate enough about to have a career in. I feel like this has been very difficult for me because I have an interest in so many things but I cannot do everything and I need to focus on one specific career that I want to pursue. I think that this class helps me with my goals because it gives me a look into physics and math/science to see if I have a big enough interest in it or subjects like it for a potential future career. In addition, this class is helping me gain the real world knowledge and problem solving skills that I would need in most careers so that it can be useful for me in the future when I do have a career. Most importantly, I am learning to become more gritty and hard working to prepare me for the hard work that will come with a good job in the future."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2271,"One of my main goals is to become an orthopedic surgeon or a trauma surgeon, and on top of that goal I hope to get closer to god and start family with someone I love! This class is helping me reach my goals because for one it is a prerequisite in my biology major and because without my bachelor in biology I will not be able to get to medical school so I can study to become a medical doctor. So this class is ultimately a stepping stone in order for me to get into other classes which will further my scientific knowledge in order to be able to do the surgeries I am interested in. On top of that this class is also helping me reach my goal of eventually starting a family with someone I love because through this class I have met many guys who could potentially be the love of my life, and even if they aren't many are really great people who have I have become pretty good friends with. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2264,"An overall goal that I've been working towards for a while now is completing pre-requisite classes to get into a DPT program. Although I graduated last spring with a degree in Kinesiology, I'm still missing some requirements before I can apply to any program. Despite having taken a physics course in the past, that particular course, 101/102, is supposedly not applicable to graduate schools; hence why I'm taking this class. Taking this class so far has been an interesting refresher on the ideas I learned about years ago; which also helps to prepare me for whatever related material comes up in graduate school. That being said, I however still feel a bit uncertain of whether or not I'm actually prepared to go through with a DPT program. Despite finishing a bachelors, the idea of doing more college studies to get into more years of schooling feels a bit overwhelming to think of; almost as if the finish line is farther out than expected. I figured that maybe this uncertainty will change over time, but all I can do for the meantime is just take things a day at a time I suppose."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2276,"My end goal in all of this is to get my degree in biology. Physics plays an important role in many scientific fields, and biology can also benefit from it. In a sense physics lays the groundwork for all things in the universe, including living things and how they function in their everyday lives. I read somewhere that biology applies physical natural laws to the study of living organisms, and I get their point. Physics can explain how birds can move through the air, or how some animals use echolocation to find their way around. At the moment, I am not sure how I plan on using a degree in biology or if I will even stick with it, but even so I think understanding the concepts in physics is very important. Whatever major I stick with, I am interested in scientific fields so I would end up having to take a physics course anyways."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2272,"Reflective Journaling Essay #2       Why am I here? Well, I am in this class, because I want to use every tool and opportunity that will help me succeed in my classes and in this case Physics. As far as why I am here attending SFSU my reasons are the same, I see education as an opportunity that will help me succeed in my life. I want to make the best of any situations I have to face, and this is where I am starting. I am not here just because I had the opportunity, but I am also here because I want to be. I want to prove not only to my friends and family that I am willing to work hard to obtain my goals. I also want to prove to myself that I have what it takes to get through my undergrad studies. I can't wait to receive my diploma so I can move onto my next objective, as well as see the results for my hard work."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2273,"My goals are to work hard and maintain an honors GPA. I have been dedicating a lot more to my studies than I ever had before. I never once dreamed I would be given the opportunity to go to university since my parents did not and we had no money to support my education. For now, I am relying on loans but I am doing my best to keep my grades high so I can collect scholarships for my education! Currently, I am also looking into research opportunities. It is important for me to succeed in this class since I will need to also complete physic mechanics in algebra 2 to complete my requirements for my major! I feel this class is challenging but it is refreshing to push myself and really focus to get the right answer. The labs have been especially challenging for me in some aspects. I appreciate this class for taking me out of my comfort zone. I think that is an important skill to have."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,1280,My goals are to finish the semester with nothing lower than a B in all my courses. I hope to graduate next spring and go onto medical school then practice as a plastic surgeon. I hope that sometime in-between I win the lottery and could turn my hobbies into a business. This class is a requirement for my physiology major so I need to take it. The class is also good practice for communication and collaboration with my peers. And exercising my brain is always a good thing.
