2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2260,"Why am I here? I am in this class because with need it for my degree. I am at SFSU because I this was my too choice of colleges I wanted to attend. I am in college because I want an excellent and fulfilling medical field-based career. I want to be a cardiac or pediatric nurse. Having been a nanny for many years has made me patient, caring, attentive, and learn to not sweat the small stuff. I think these are a few traits that would transfer into being a great nurse. I have always loved learning about the medical sciences, especially human anatomy. I think I can leave an impact on people’s lives and guide them towards happier, healthier lives. I am here because I want to thrive, not just survive and I enjoy giving back to those who need it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2261,Why am I here? I am here not only because this class is a requirement for my career/major but also because I enjoy trying different things that I haven't done. this class will be something that I have never taken or learned before during my education in high school or the past years. I have always been scared to take any classes that relate to math and physics because math is not my favorite subject sometimes it makes me struggle a lot and if I could choose to never have math in my life then it would be something great for me but as I grew up I gave up on skipping math classes because anyway I would always need math in my life and especially because the requirements of my major which is biology are composed with math and science. I am here to learn the concepts of physics and to enjoy this class.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2262,"In a very morbid and some what distressing way, I dont really feel like I am here for anything great or anything in particular. Im just another passing face. But the future can change drastically from what I think might happen. I dont think there is really anything that can or will show me what is meant for me in the future. And theres nothing I can really do about that. All i can hope for is a positive future. Currently things are not really looking up but I am here to learn from the classroom and my numerous mistakes. I hope its worth it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2263,"The reason why I am here is so I can continue my education into Biology. If i'm being honest I don't even know if Biology is the right career path for me as I only chose this major because I've had multiple Biology classes back in high school. I guess this makes for a second reason why i'm here and that is to see if Physics might be something interesting to get into, although as it currently stands I really dislike math so even though physics seems really interesting I don't know if it would something I would be fit for. But, going back on topic the reason why I'm here is for my current major and to also look into other topics to study. I would even like to add a third reason more petty, it's just to see if I can out do my high school self as back then I really hated physics I just want to see if I can get a better grasp of it this time."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,1280,From a biological perspective I am here because my mom carried me for nine months and had me. I never really thought about why I am here. I am here so I can take care of my dogs and little sister. So that I can enjoy yummy food and explore the world we live on. I don't believe it was to work a job till you're too old to enjoy the world. Somewhere down the road of evolution something went very wrong and people developed currency and jobs! I am here writing this journal so that I can get points and pass with a good grade. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2264,"I've always asked myself this question and have never come up with a definitive answer since there doesn't seem to be one. In the broadest sense, it seems that you're meant to spend your entire life trying to answer this question of purpose and meaning; as in living itself is the means to find that reason of being/living. If I were to look at this question in the immediate sense, it would probably be that I'm here taking classes after post-graduation because I need them to get into a graduate school program; but even then, what does that mean in the grand scheme of things? At least right now, everything feels more like a means to an end; and assuming I get to that goal of getting into a grad program, what then? More school until work? It's still the same thing. I get that living and purpose is what we make of it, but I don't think I've come to that realization to really answer why I am here. Nonetheless, I'll just keep moving forward. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2265,"There are multiple reasons why I am in this class. The main reason of course was just to complete my lower division requirements for my major. I thought that I could take this class and eventually just move it out of the way and continue. But I did choose this class over the other ones like chemistry for a reason. I have actually never taken a physics class before, as I was never required to. So, I decided that maybe this year I can start learning something new as I could look forward to learn a new subject. I also never really had a great relationship with chemistry, so honesty speaking I am pushing that for later so I can get more help when in person classes start. I also took physics his year as I heard that it is a math-based class, and I am not that bad in math myself. So far, the class is nice, and I hope that I get to learn a lot from here and find a love for physics."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2266,"My name is Adriel Evaristo and the reason why I am here is because I want to become a better scientist. I want to ensure that I can express myself by using science in my everyday life so I can use it in my job, by teaching, or just by looking and sounding like I know what I am talking about through science. I want to become a forensic scientist so I can help solve different crime problems or solve science solutions through the world of trouble, and use science to solve problems that people might have such as with people's DNA can help out solve these problems. I always thought it was a cool job since I was a kid and I still think it's cool because it drives me to be a scientist while also having a little bit of fun or looking like I know what I am talking about. The other reason why I am here is because I need to complete on who I am. I have to take these science classes because I don't know what other careers I want. I wanted to become an artist, but I figured science will take me to more places that I can imagine more than art. So, I will do my best to understand physics, biology, math, etc... and ensure that I can become the scientist I want to be. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2267,"“Why am I here?” Depends on what context. If you are asking why I am enrolled in this course that is because I am a Biochemistry major and I need this class for my major. If you are asking why I am alive, well I do not really know. I feel my purpose is to do what I love. I am enrolled in this school to graduate and become a scientist because I have always had a passion for anything science-related. But while I do have goals and ambitions there are times where I think of the question “why I am here” and think about humanity in general. What is the purpose of humans? Why were we born into this world? I have also thought methodically and scientifically rather than religiously. I was born in a Catholic household but personally, I do not believe in my family’s region. Because I can’t help but ask questions. Wonder if there is a God. If there is a Heaven or Hell or anything at all after we die. So, you ask why I here. My answer is that I am here to learn physics and learn more about the world. Answer the questions I have and do what I love for the rest of my life."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2268,"I am here because I want to genuinely learn and understand more about physics. I would like to incorporate what I will be learning in my career path and in my field. I am here because I do this for myself and my family. I want better for myself and I am here because I have the opportunity to be and because I want to be here. I also need these classes to graduate, but I am enjoying the classes in the past. I am looking further strengthen my skills in physics and expand my understand of it. I am here because I want to learn from my professors, my peers, and learn to continue to adapt to the adversities that these unfortunate events has brought upon many of us. I want to be here and I will make my presence worth being here by studying, learning, and asking questions. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2269,I believe I am here at SFSU to further help my educational background/knowledge.As well as help me with organization tactics.n high school I felt as if I had a little bit more structure due to the outside help my private school included.I want to carry the same  high school academic success into college and believe I have everything I need in order to do so. I personally stand on having the experience and educational gains of college can help create a more successful future in a variety of work fields.This particular class will help develop my science and math background. With my current biology major this class is clearly essential.Another take on this question is also I am here because of my mother's hard work in always keeping me focus/always having my head on track.As she consistently growing up reminded my brother and I the importance of school and always having us in private schools till we graduated high school.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2270,"I'm here because I want to learn more about the way works. I've always been into science and it has helped me grow as a person. The main reason I say this is because I'm naturally curious as a person. When I needed glasses and braces, I was confused when other people did not. For that reason, I began researching. I researched for days just to find answers. From there, I wanted to know more about the human body and understand myself. How does this relate to physics? Physics is the way the universe works. It includes Earth and other planets as well. Gravity is in our lives everyday. To know more about myself, I need to learn about the universe too. In conclusion, it's mostly just because of who I am as a person. I'm curious and I want answers. I believe that my childhood played a big part in that."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2271,"I am here for many reasons, for one I have not died and I still have goals and dreams I want to achieve and in order to do so I need to go to school and take certain classes which in this case is physics. As of now my main goal is to become an orthopedic surgeon which requires me to get a bachelor in any major of my choosing, I chose biology, and then I would have to take the MCAT and pass it in order to go to medical school which I hope will be at San Francisco. After graduating medical school I will apply to an internship and then to a residency and finally my specialization in orthopedic surgery. I know its a long road ahead but as long as I continue to move toward my goal I will one day achieve it, and for that reason I am here because I need this class in order to continue moving forward along my path. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,1465,"I am here (physically) due to this class being a requirement for my major. Looking at the bigger picture as to why I am here : going to school is because it has been my dream to become a veterinarian and I feel the only way to get there (literally and figuratively) is to go through school and try my best to be accepted into any vet school; hopefully one on Pamona. Going through this process I have come to terms that it will not be an easy one and at times I do lose motivation in class (which resulted in my failing some classes last semester and having to retake them this semester). Due to the difficult times I am having in most, if not all, of my classes my motivation to finish and continue on the path I created is at a minimum. Meaning I catch myself asking ""if I cannot pass these undergraduate classes what makes me think I will pass my veterinary medicine ones?"". After a moment thought I realize everyone's path is different and no matter how long I have, my purpose is to become a veterinarian and succeed in that field. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2272,"My name is Jim Carrasco, I am 20 years old, and I am a Mexican-Filipino American whom is chasing a degree in Biology with a focus in Botany. I have finally made it to my third year at SF State. I wish to go back to school and learn about Pharmacy, and hopefully obtain a Pharm. D. However, as many people with where I am now in life I can do anything I want, I have much time. As, I near my senior year at State it is a weird feeling indeed, I finally feel that fire inside of me that is determine to be rewarded for my work. I also have the desire to be done with undergraduate studies and be able to have a world of options open for me. I am finally ready to begin the next chapters of my life and make a little money hahaha. I am excited for this year although my schedule is rigorous I am ready for the battle ahead."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2273,"Why am I here?   I am here in this Physics class to further progress my education and subsequently my understanding of the world. Ever since I was young I knew I wanted to help out in some way. As I got older I explored different outlets of how I could achieve this goal. After years of experimenting, I realized that my gaze had always been fixated on science. I have always loved retaining facts from documentaries or books and would always be excited when I found a way to apply those facts. This Physics class is part of the path to my major. However, I respect all of the classes I will have to take to get to my goal. I am a Biology major and my goal is to work in Biotechnology. Growing up I really despised math but now that I am older I understand it is a necessary tool in securing accurate measurements  Knowledge is power and I am excited to understand more about the physics of the world. I am especially excited to participate in the Lab portion of this class. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2274,"The question ""Why am I here?"" is a very broad question that can apply to many things currently but in regards to attending San Francisco State University and being in this Physics 112 Lab class, I am here for my future. I am here to educate myself to qualify for and build the knowledge and skills to earn a successful career for myself in the future. Although I am not exactly sure what specific career I want to pursue just yet or if it even has anything to do with physics. But what I do know is that physics can teach me valuable critical thinking skills and knowledge on real life functionalities that can be applied to almost anything. And in order to provide a happy and successful future for myself, I need to continue pushing forward and working hard in school, although that has been getting very difficult for me in these times especially with the current pandemic and being forced to do my schooling at home and online, but hopefully I will be able to succeed nonetheless."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2275,"Im here in this class because this a requirement for my majors. I need to take this class to help me prepare for the future and understand more of physics labs. When I grow to be a medicine doctor you have to have experience with lab and know what you are doing. Physics is such an important aspect for my future because it will help me build more problem solving skills and strengthen my knowledge to a whole new level. Physics plays a big role into everybody lives because it's going to teach us about energy, movement, motion, and etc. Many more subjects out there that will help you build on skills. I know that this class will help me prepare for my future because I want to make my parents happy with my dream job which is medicine. I want to help people fell better and satisfy with my service which is making the proper medicine for patients. In conclusion, this a class where everyone will build problem solving skills and help you understand more about the world."
