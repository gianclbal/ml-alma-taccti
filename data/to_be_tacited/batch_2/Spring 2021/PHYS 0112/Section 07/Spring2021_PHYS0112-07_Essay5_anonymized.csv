2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,1280,"I have a really big family but have never met them. They all live in Georgia, the only family I know is my sibling and two aunts whom don't have any children. My family has always stressed the importance of education and ability to provide for yourself. Going to college was never not a choice for me. My mom always says as long as I study that she would take of the rest. My family is extremely supportive of me going through college and that helps motivate me a lot. I am the first out of all of my nearly forty or more family member to go to a four year college. I think that Is another reason why college was something my mom really wanted me to achieve."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2270,"The values of my family and community have always taught me to prioritize education. The ability to learn and the access to learning is an extremely emphasized value. College is seen as a must and necessary for a good job. I believe these values too. My family has always discussed how important having a proper education is. I think those beliefs have helped me in college. I always put out my best work. I try my hardest to receive good grades and try to stay motivated. The staying motivated part has been difficult for me this semester. I've caught myself skipping lectures and putting off things till the last minute, which I normally wouldn't do. The problem is I do not know how to fix it. I'm just unmotivated. It's not caused by any event or circumstance. I just feel unsatisfied. Despite it, I will push through because I need to. Overall, I think that the values and lessons my community and family has taught me, gave me the strength I need in college."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2261,I come from a Latino family where they worry too much about what their children choose to be in their future and how they manage their careers. both of my parents didn't have the opportunity to attend college or even finish high school and for them having their kids attend college or even finish high school is a big accomplishment but they still ask for more like being someone with a well-paid career. I see how my parents struggle to have a stable or well-paid job which is something that makes me think about the importance or value of attending college. My parents see college as a big accomplishment or a valuable thing and they are the ones that helped me navigate through college I just get more motivated to finish my four years by thinking of them. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2265,"The values that my parents and family have taught me came in use when it comes to college. Both social and educational values that I have learned from them helped me throughout the first. It can be just to stay positive and listen to others and what they have to say. It can be just to be respectful of other’s time and what they have to offer. Examples of educational values include not to procrastinate. Also, to study concepts learned in the day, that same night so that we can remember better and attain more information. I also learned to utilize my textbooks and notes to the maximum so that I can derive as much information as possible. Note taking is something my parents swear by as it really helped them throughout their years of college, hence they want me to follow that too no matter what class I am taking."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2264,"Throughout college, my family has played a significant role in keeping myself grounded as they’ve been, and continues to be a pillar of support for me. Going through college and now extended learning, it's apparent that I couldn’t have made it as far as I have without having people I could turn to. Based on my personal experiences, it is really easy to become overwhelmed by the commitments and responsibilities that are associated with adult/college life; not only do we have to balance out school and work, but other daily life obligations as well. From the slightest bit of faltering, it becomes easy to fall into self-doubt and being overwhelmed by that negative feeling to the point where it begins to affect not only school and work, but personal relationships as well. Having family I was able to confide in helped to break out of those cycles by reminding me of the work I was doing and what the purpose of my academic career was. Without a solid support system there to support me, I don’t know if I could have this far into my academic career."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2260,"My mom went to beauty college and my dad went to community college for about one year in the 70’s, so it is fair to say that their experience of what college is, is not helpful to me navigating my way through college. They had never planned on me going to college and did not set aside savings. My first year at community college I failed all my classes and was so sad, my mom said perhaps I was not meant for college. It has taken me a long time but I am so proud of my accomplishments. I have 2 certs, 3 AS degrees, and have one more year at SFSU until I receive my BS degree. Then I will continue on to get my BSN and MSN degrees because I want to be a cardiac nurse. I do wish I had people to lean on for college advice but I simply do not. Instead, I ask my classmates, professors, and guidance counselors as many questions as I can. I have made it this far somehow, so there is no doubt I will continue to go even further. My mom and dad had small, low income jobs, we were never struggling to make ends meet, but we were certainly in a poorer community. I look at that, and that is fine, but I what I want for myself is to achieve much greater. So I am thankful for the way my childhood was because it has shown me what I want to do like my parents and what I want to do differently. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2274,"My family strongly values hard work and the importance of not giving up. This has helped me navigate through college because although the work can easily become stressful and difficult to catch up with, I know that if I keep on persisting and as long as I dont give up on my education, I can get through it and succeed. Hard work has definitely helped my family get to where there are today because my parents and my older siblings are immigrants from phillipines who worked hard to provide for this family and has given me the opportunity to go to college even if they couldnt and I know that they support me in every way that they can. I want to make them proud and hooefully provide for them in the future in return for all that they have done for me. I especially want to make my mom proud because of all of the struggles that she went through as a child living in poverty and having to live with the consequences that it has made on her health mentally and physically."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2266,"I think that the values of my community and family helped me navigate through college by learning different cultures and groups in my college that are willing to accept anyone to learn of themselves. Since I am a Latino, I tend to stick with my cultural aspects and be part of the Latino community and do my part to help out as one of them. I was glad when I first started out in college, I saw that the Metro programming was majority of Latino based people and I didn't mind them at all that they helped me out with my learnings, how to navigate through college, tutor on my classes, and helped me with my finances. I was very glad that SF State is a big part of accepting any community and that it does not discriminate any group or individual, this school gladly encourages any group to join through ethnics and communities. My family were very happy that this school is very diverse and will increase my chances to be part with anyone. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2267,"The values of my community have given me the opportunity to go to college whilst the values of my family have given me the strength to go to college. My community gave me the opportunity to go to college by not making me need to worry about my financial situation. This is because I have part of the Genentech Foundation Scholars Program and they help me financially, academically, as well as just in resources. The community within this program has really supported me and allowed me to thrive so far within my college experience. meanwhile, my friends and family give me the strength to go to college. I want to become a successful man and become a child my parents can be proud of. So I strive for success and their motivating cheers give me strength to keep on going even when times are tough like right now."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2262,My values of my community and family have not helped me whatsoever in college. I was a gifted child with a very good understanding of everything going on in school up until college. All though high school i can feel my knowledge waning. I knew i wasnt going to get though college and now im in financial trouble because of it. My family thinks im doing well and passing my classes but all i have is a 1.83 GPA and i dont see how i can increase it. I try. I know i do. But the burden of expectation and past experience in academics make me feel even more like a failure and a fraud. I know i can do good. but im just not.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2268,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""My outside job is actually working with kids and families of underrepresented communities with the objective to help family's children stay focused, interested, and active in their educational settings. I know that from personal experience it has tough for me even in my college career to stay focused, motivated, or inspired. Therefore, through my setbacks and mistakes I am able to teach and encourage the youth in our communities that can do better. My family has helped me navigate my way through college as well with the motivation that they are immigrants that have worked really hard to make a good living and move on from the corrupt situations in their own countries. I know by keeping that in mind a part of me does the best that I can for the people that are in those countries that do not have the same or the equal opportunity to attain an education and aspire to be their dream professionals because of limitations and certain circumstances. I know that this grants me the opportunity to value my people, my community here, and my family. Through recognizing that value I am able to take actions upon myself and hold myself accountable to do the best that I can for myself and my family's future. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2271,"I honestly feel that I am a very strong person because of my family, my family has always taught me to be independent and to never give up, they truly have raised me to believe that anything is possible as long as I put my mind to it. As a child growing up, my mom never was on top of me telling me to get my homework done, telling me to pay attention in class or anything, she always told me that if I wanted to be something In life I would do that on my own without her having to tell me, so in my mind I grew up believing that if I don't do it no one will do it for me which was a really great thing for me to learn at such a young age because I never depended on anyone other than myself, which is why I am so independent which has helped me time manage myself in college and be so successful. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2273,"I think what family life someone came from really can affect a person. I come from a divorced family who never really had a lot of money. I never thought I would make it to college. In high school, my teachers told me to drop out since it was a bad reputation for the school and they never even let me have a college counseling appointment. So I got into working some part-time jobs and saved up some money to go to community college. After getting near the completion of my associate's degree, my mother informed me that I likely would not be going to university. It wasn't mean-spirited, it was just due to the fact that we made too much money to qualify for financial aid but due to all the bills we had, did not make enough money to pay my tuition. I am a first-generation college student and I put me all into everything I do. I focus on my coursework to get good grades so I can get a scholarship and pursue grad school. I want to prove to my family and my future family that there is always a way to accomplish your dreams. This may sound stressful but in reality, I am thankful. Thankful that this has helped me develop a strong work ethic and become a more responsible student."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2263,My parents are people who are very understanding helping me make some of the hardest choices I need to make. Like when the decision needs to be made and I'm stressed out of my mind about what I should do in response my parents are some of the first who help me with that. Then there is my sister she's someone who helps out with assignments I don't understand or helps me with understanding how to pick my classes. My brother he doesn't help with work but we play games together a lot and helps alleviate stress. All of my family are people who help me navigate my life through college and I thank them for always helping me out with it all. My family besides helping me in this fashion always make sure I'm striving to do better to always go out of my way to the extra work. As my brother would say if it's allowed take advantage of it.
