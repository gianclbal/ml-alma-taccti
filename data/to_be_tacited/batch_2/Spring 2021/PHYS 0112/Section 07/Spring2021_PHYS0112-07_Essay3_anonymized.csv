2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,1465,"What do I do when life gets challenging? Honestly, when I think about it I have no absolute answer for this. Usually when life gets tough or challenging I try to keep my mind busy with things that will distract me from what I was stressing about. Usually I stress about my classes and homework that I am behind on and so to distract myself I end up working more hours at work which unfortunately is one of the main reasons I am behind on most of my classwork/homework. Right now as life gets challenging especially at this point in the semester, I noticed myself starting to take care of my mental health which means self care days and days where I just try to ground my negative thoughts about my future. What may be difficult about this is that when I do try to take days off of thinking about stressful aspects there is always a thought in the back of my head saying ""You know you have tons of work to do yet you're taking time for yourself."" "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2260,"I do a few different things when life gets challenging. Usually I get overwhelmed by all the buzz of life so I spend extra time at home in a quiet room with music and candles and I focus on reading for fun or reading for school. Going on long and hard runs is a great way to shake off the stress. Running tires out my body and quiets my mind. Sometimes I just need some extra sleep, so I will take more naps or give myself a mini spa day. Self-care is always important and when I look good, I feel good. When push comes to shove, my body goes into hyperdrive mode where I know the only way to stop being so stressed by life’s challenges is to get work done. I know at the end of the day, everything will always work out. Tomorrow is an opportunity to start fresh. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2270,"When life gets challenging, the first thing I will do is take a step back. Though I know this could be detrimental to the amount of work I have to do, I will clear up everything and set a day off for myself. During this day, I will focus on myself and things that make me happy. Usually, I'll end up feeling refreshed or better than I did previously. Life getting challenging is something that can't be avoided, so finding ways to cope is extremely important. Another thing I do when life gets challenging would be to tackle the problem head on. I would use this strategy only if it's possible. I'll identity the cause and then find ways to combat it. When I try to solve an issue by confronting it, I'm regaining control and not feeling helpless. Overall, life does get challenging at times and that's okay. We just have to keep going."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2262,"What i do when life gets challenging is usually just figure out what is stressing or challenging, figure what i can do about it and attempt to fix it. But this last week has shown that i will actually just stray away from challenges, but when they are forced upon me, I try my best before i give up and feel like a failure. I worked for 3 days straight in the morning from 5 am to 9 am, then came back to a loud household, where i still need to do chores and do homework and help people when i can. It just gets me tired. I know thats how adulthood is. But i just want it to get abit easier. only alittle. so i can manage it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2267,"What do I do when life gets challenging? I take a break. I make myself focus on my health rather than something like my academics. I can overwork myself; however, if there is any possible way where I can not do that, then I would much rather focus on myself rather than anything else. For example, lab 6 took a heavy toll on me so I chose to use that as my drop rather than forcing myself to do it even though it hurt to not understand it. Overall, when like gets challenging, I want to take a breather. Take a break like spend time with family or friends or even play video games by myself or with friends. Go outside or take my dogs on a walk. Taking a break to better me as well as my health is something I prioritize because if I really can't handle something, I feel a breather really is necessary."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2265,"When life gets challenging, I used to feel like giving up, but now I feel like I understood that there are multiple options I have when talking about getting support. I usually get frustrated when I don’t understand concepts and have a bunch of work piling up relating those topics. I first of all remind myself that I have resources like textbooks and the internet to easily access information and ask as many questions that I need in order to get what I need.  Apart from that, I do have professors and mentors who I can go up to in case I still don’t understand any concepts. As far as this class is concerned, my father is really good at physics, so when I am really struggling, I can always go to him for guidance and reassurance. Another great resource to use is office hours as it can be used as a one-on-one time with a professor. That can be a beneficial time to go over concepts and specific questions that I have."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2274,"I think that this question is actually quite difficult to answer for me. I feel like for a long time I have always been struggling with trying to keep up with school, and I feel like I have not improved much when it comes to it. Most of the time, I feel like I try to run away from my problems or avoid them, which end up making things worse when I know I need to face them head on. When life does get challenging, I know it is important to take care of yourself and to give myself breaks so I do not get too burnt out, but sometimes it is not all that simple. Something that I have tried in the past is going to therapy to help me deal with my issues, but that did not seem to work. However, something that has worked for me in the past is reaching out to friends and mentors for support in times of need. I think its always important to ask for help because you do not always have to go through struggle alone. The most important thing to remember is that things will always get better and to not give up."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2264,"When life gets challenging, I try to push myself to keep moving forward until that challenge is overcome. More often than not, we can find ourselves in situations trying to solve problems we can't immediately solve; which often brings about feelings of doubt, inability, and diminishing will. When we get caught up in this spiral of negative thinking, it becomes more tempting to give up and avoid challenge all together; making it easy to become complacent and absent in our lives. From past experiences, I've often found myself in that negative spiral and have had to pull myself out of it a few times. But as challenging as those times were, it was those experiences that have made me a stronger person overall. Although it is different for everybody, I've come to understand that life is never going to be easy, but it doesn't have to be necessarily hard either. Even if it seems impossible now, choosing to work through opposition is more life-fulfilling than simply running from it. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2268,"When life gets challenging, especially during these times I have changed in ways that I did not want to. For instance, I shut down when life gets challenging. It's really difficult for me to reach out when I need the help to lift up again or to recharge. I have been doing my best to get back on track and doing my best to stay motivated. I know what I do when life is challenging and they are not the best options or form of approach to remain a successful student. I have been able to communicate much more effectively about what I am feeling and by doing so I can reflect a bit more about it and create solutions to prevent setbacks. When life gets challenging I will work on catching my mistakes to be a better student and seek for help when I am struggling. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,1280,"When life gets hard I tend to handle it, in a variation of ways depending on the situation. Sometimes I try to find a solution and push through the obstacle and try not to become defeated. And sometimes I just let it defeat me, I remember not to get angry at the things we can't control only the things we can. So if there is a solution ill try my best to fix it and if it is out of my hands then so be it. If the situation is not as grave then I usually will go to my garden and trim my flowers or plant some new ones as a way of releasing stress. Or I take a me day and go to trader joe's, world market, target, Michaels and just buy things that make me happy. ill usually pick out a bunch of flowers from world market and make a floral arrangement for my room.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2271,"When life gets challenging I like to step back and plan out how I can get everything back in order. In order to do this I grab my planner and first write down all my classes and meeting or appointments that I have, then I write down all the due dates for assignment that I have, and finally I plan the time I have to work on the assignments and in what order in order for them all to be turned in on time. Finally after I get my life back in order I reward myself with a night out with my friends or with a self care day where I just do my skin care routine, I order food in, and I watch a couple movies. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2261,"When life gets challenging  sometimes I want to give up and just feel overwhelmed or sometimes I even feel guilty with myself because o couldn't do any assignments or didn't know how to do them. I feel that this semester has been the most challenging for some reasons and I believe it because the motivation to attend college is not the same when you are learning online as if you attend personal classes. After all, I get more motivation waking up knowing that I am going to campus and be with friends and learned in person. when life gets challenging I like to try multiple times on finding solutions but I don't like giving up easily. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2273,"Life can get challenging when you feel like everything you're doing is right but then you find out it's wrong. There's nothing worse than putting you're all into something mediocre. I think that it makes you feel like you have limited power over a situation when really there is always a way to fix these situations. For example, I studied all week for my calculus exam and failed it miserably. I felt really confident going in but then looked at the material and had a panic attack. It made me feel like maybe I was not as smart as I had deceived myself to be. However, I know that I can change my attitude and do better in the future. Obviously, something was not working so I can just tweak my study habits. Physics makes me feel like I'm not a lost cause with math because I feel like I am somewhat understanding it. I definitely am better at algebra than calculus."
