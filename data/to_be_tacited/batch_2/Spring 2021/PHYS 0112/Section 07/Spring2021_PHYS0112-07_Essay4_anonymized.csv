2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2267,"I have many resources that will support me. Whether it is academically through Metro or financially with the SEO office, I have many resources on campus that will help support my college experience. I even have my family and friends to support me mentally and emotionally. I have a resource for everything, it is just up to me whether or not I want to use that resource or not. I'm glad to have so many outstanding resources to count on; however, at times it's difficult to go out of my way to wisely use these resources when I already feel so burnt out. To be completely honest with you, I'm burnt of school but primarily because we are learning virtually. It's so difficult for me to grasp concepts virtually which led to my burnout but I am hopeful that within the future, I can find my motivation to pursue college."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2262,"I only have my one friend in college to support me. and he can only help me when he knows how to. i dont blame him. its not his fault he doesnt understand something and i suddenly ask him to explain it to me. Other than him i dont have anything to support me in school. I cant take this online learning style. Sure it seemed fine at first then i got sucked into a spiral where its just hard. And i cant focus. I cant do anything in class. All i can think about is ""when will the semester be over"" or ""when can i get back to campus"" even ""why do i feel so alone when i talk to so many people"". I cant do this anymore. I know im introverted and i dont like people. but i still need them."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2264,"The immediate resources that I most often turn to when I'm in need are my family and a handful of close friends that I can rely on. Going through work, school, etc. it's important to have a support system that you can turn to when things can get overwhelming; especially nowadays when it's easy to become disconnected from the world with everything that's happening. As adults, there's the widely adopted notion that our problems are our own burden and that turning to others is a sign of weakness or lack of will. While it's possible to get pretty far on your own, we all need a bit of help from time to time. Something as simple as having someone to lend an ear or talk things out goes a long way in the most darkest of times. Although I would consider myself to be fairly independent, there have been plenty of times when I needed to fall back and turn to those that supported me because I knew in those instances that I couldn't shoulder everything alone. Kindness and support, no matter how small, goes a long way. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2271,"I have many resources depending on what my issue is, if I am having friend or family drama I have three resources either my sister, my best friend Fatima or my best friend Nubia. If I'm having troubles in school I know I can talk to my teachers for help in their office hours, I also have my academic coordinators which are Natasha Crawford and Benjamin. I can also talk to my parents because they are very wise and have a lot of experience in many of the troubles I go through since they most likely already went through that. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2275,The resources that help me understand is the simulator stuff and actually recording our data because this will help me understand with a better picture to see how there lab is about. The first thing on lab days I will go to the simulator to test out the stuff and see how it works. There are questions that will help me feel more confident that will connect to the simulator. We need to test it out the question on the simulator to get out the results of the problem. But the rest of the lab should be simple because after we do the simulator we get to see the questions that are related to the results after we completed it. Its like an analysis where we get to explain all the work of the simulator and share out what we understand of the problem. So in conclusion we get use most of the simulator stuff to help us understand the questions. Thats the resource that will always help me because Im a visual learner and I like seeing pictures to will help me.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2268,"I have resources that can support me through my educational journey. I have classmates, friends who know the subject best, professors, tutors, and online resource like YouTube tutorials that can teach me concepts that I may not be the best at. I think I need to take better advantage of these resources that are available to me to ensure that I will succeed in my personal goals, academic goals, and professional goals. I have also learned to understand that I need to reach out when I feel that my things are getting overwhelmed or when I do not understand concepts that are being reviewed. I have resources that are available to me and I will do better to utilize them as much as possible. If I take advantage of them and use them as much as I can I will feel more confident about my academic success and performance. I will receive a better understanding of my course materials and perphaps in a better perspective as their is many point of views. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2260,"My boyfriend and my best friend are probably my main supporters. My boyfriend knows when to give me gentle support and when I need some tough love. My best friend knows to be a good sounding board. I know my professors have my back so I try to keep in communication and in good standing with them. I try to be very independent and self-sufficient but I tend to put too much on my plate and I get overwhelmed. I always make it out in one piece in the end! I know asking for help is typically the main struggle I, and others experience, because we do not want to appear weak or lesser. I remind myself that we are all just human and all have our own struggles but if we project kindness we will receive kindness and support back."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2270,"I have many resources to support me. On campus, I have the advisors and College of Science and Engineering. I've visited them before and they have given me guidance. Besides academic, my friends and family support me. They listen and give me advice when I need it. I think having resources to support myself is super important. Sometimes, I feel unmotivated and lack energy to do things, but I feel boosted whenever I ask for help. My support system is one of the key things that keep me going. Despite physical resources, the internet can also be used as a support system. Information is valuable and having knowledge on things that trouble me can also be used as a resource. For example, I looked up why I'm so tired all the time last week. I started trying the methods the internet stated to get less drowsy and it seems to be working so far. The methods I've tried so far are sleeping at the same time every night and exercising daily. Overall, I have a lot of resources to support me, which is super nice."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,1280,"I have many people who have and still do support through whatever it is I am working through. Such as Schoo;, I have my family and close friends who are very supportive of my choice to study physiology. My biggest help would of course be my Mom who financially supports me. If I ever need anything or am in a crisis I know she will be there to help me. My sister has been a great help as well and any questions I have she is there to assist me. And I myself make sure to save and I have always been very independent so I will find away to make things happen for myself."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2273,"I think that resources to support your learning are super important in university. We have so many services to help us, it seems almost wrong not to use them. For me, I use my teacher's office hours and my help from my classmates. I think that help from my classmates is my favorite resource and also the one that has helped me a lot this semester. It is not because I need them to find the answer but they help me stay motivated. During this quarantine, it is very hard for me to stay motivated. When it is just me I am worried about, I start forgetting my responsibilities. That is why I like to keep in touch with my classmates and coordinate meetings with them. It helps me build a schedule. A schedule really helps me stay organized and I have seen a significant improvement in my grade ever since I have implemented a schedule. In high school, I was one of the worst students in the school and it was because I had no idea how to organize my life. I feel like I have found a good balance. I can be productive without stressing out too much"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2274,"I know that there have always been many resources available to help support me in times of need, but unfortunately I never really reached out and took advantage of any of them when I should have. This is a habit that I need to change because it can help make my life and my struggles a lot easier to deal with. For example I have been made aware of many tutoring programs and mentors and counselors that I can reach out to in San Francisco State University alone, but I have yet to take advantage of this opportunity. Another important example is there are office hours that I can attend to get help in my classes and on my assignments. One of my main struggles right now involves deciding a career path for myself, and I know that I can talk to my counselor and my metro program and scholarship mentors for advise on the topic. Now that I am reflecting on this I am realizing the opportunities that I am missing out on and all I need to do is put in the work to reach out. Although it may seem a little bit intimidating for me to talk to people, I need to keep reminding myself that help is usually offered to those who simply ask."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2263,"The resources I have to support myself really comes from the recorded lectures and everything. Although I write notes when I attend class being able to go over the class again and having the teacher explain it over and over again until you understand is a really helpful tool while we're preparing for a new test of something like that. Another tool that's really helpful is just writing notes. Even though I was raving over how good the recorded classes are I feel like the notes is how I really get the information stuck inside of my head. The amount of times that having the notes helped with homework or labs is astronomically large. Then finally I have my sister to also help me out, she was someone who already did a large amount of the classes I'm currently taking so occasionally when I need help she finds her old notes and helps me out with things I don't understand."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2266,"I guess the resources that have to support me can be anything that is being offered to me. I see many people during the semester saying that they have free classes, office hours, or even free tutoring classes that are offered at any times. As well as having mental and physical health that San Francisco State that is available for almost every student even people who might not go to the school, it is always there for anyone to use. I have seen many resources offered me although I sometimes don't have time to look at the resources given to me because I already have other things to use that I already find helpful. Like for example, I am in this program called Metro where they can help with with my finances, tutoring, and even choosing classes, although I sometimes get emails for free invitations of free programs such as CARP where they do the same thing as Metro. I am very grateful for many programs and health services available for me, although I can never find the time to actually do it. When I necessarily need help, then I will make time to use those available resources if I have no other options to do so. I hope I can use those resources available as I am busy with my family and my work but I always have to ensure that I make time for my school full time because I am trying to get it out of the way. I will occasionally drop in through these free available resources from time to time in order to settle myself with a particular resource that can further help me with my classes or just asking for any help at any time."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2265,"I have multiple sources available in order to support me. The main one is my notes and textbook, as this is a physical copy of information to rely on. The notes in the presentation slides are more concise, and in the case I need more information, I can look at the book. Apart from that, I always have Khan Academy to learn new concepts. People wise, I always have the professor and my peers. I can utilize office hours in the case I need help with concepts, and I can always have private meeting with peers and treat it as a study session with friends. Last but not the least, my father is really good at physics, so I can always ask him in the case I don't understand the assignment or how to go about a problem."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,7,2261,A source that I use a lot is youtube. I use youtube most of the time to search up for examples or explanations of words that I feel are confusing to me. Taking this class online have taught me to look up options on sources to have because if you get stuck then it is on to you to find the correct sources to be able to finish the assignment which I feel that youtube is one source that I use for almost most of my classes on an assignment that I get stuck.
