2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2335,"Reflective Journaling #3	When life gets challenging I find a way to overcome/ get through it the best way I can. This usually looks like me looking up to God, as a religious person, I have very strong faith in the man above us all. I believe that no matter what I may be challenged with in life, he makes a way for me to overcome my challenges and obstacles. In this class specifically whenever I am challenged with a problem or the work overall, I will reach out to my peers and most importantly the professor. Teamwork makes the dreamwork which is something I have really learned and acknowledged in this class, because without the help from each and every group member we would probably not finish the lab or be doing it right. As for asking the professor for help, I usually like to solve it either on my own or with the help of my classmates, so asking the professor is always much needed because when we can’t figure it out, we know who can. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2329,"I feel like every time life gets challenging for me, I tend to react differently depending on the situation. Sometimes, if it is school related, I sometimes take some time to get back to how I was before falling behind. I sometimes just feel really overwhelmed and lost on where to start to catch up with my classes. If it is out of school related issues, I tend to cry about the situation at first or any time life gets even more challenging but after crying I try to find out what I can do to make things better for myself. For example, when I get stressed out with my schedule of work and school and my other responsibilities, I sometimes callout from work to just have a me day to relax and get back on track with everything else. I also tend to seek help from my friends and family to see if they are able to help me someway so I won't feel so alone when struggling."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2332,"When life gets challenging, I try and take a break and reset my mind. I try to let go of all then stressors in my life and gain composure once again and when I feel in control, I come back and face the problems that I have in my life. I like to get away from the stuff that made my life challenging and I like to participate in activities that get my mind off of those things such as playing basketball and volleyball, playing video games, coaching my volleyball team and hanging out with my friends. I look for groups of friends that are able to get my mind off of these things as well. But I do not always stop trying when life gets hard. I sometimes choose to face these problems head on because that is how I was raised. If something gets challenging, I do not run away but work harder to face the challenge."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2340,At this point in my life I just try to do my best. I’m not as young anymore and probably it’s true the older we get the more experiences we have. Life gets tuff sometimes but just do your best and stop worrying too much just live every second as if it was the last one.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2327,"When life gets challenging I remember to not force myself to be positive, to see the good but don’t ignore the hurt, to let myself feel so,etching other than happiness without shame, and to be human. Of course I’m going to cry, feel hurt, get into my head, but I just remember that it’s temporary and to keep moving forward. I remind myself that I did my best and even though things have not been easy on myself I still am strong enough to make it through. I hold onto myself with kindness and love during this small season of strangeness and her and let go of everything that is heavy on my heart that does not allow myself to be who I am meant to become. My favorite quote is “ Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass but rather learning how to dance in the rain.”"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,1501,"This is a very good question. I don't thinkI have every thought of asking myself this question but I must say, now that I think about it. I do a lot. Usually go to the gym and work out. Ive noticed this helps me be less stress and focus more on a goal I put myself to be on. I also do a lot of hiking, another way tp focus on myself and de- stress.When I realize that life is getting a bit harder, I seek advise and help so I don't give up.  For example I have seemed advise from school so I can be led in the right direction in order to continue school.A good example was when I lost my home due to a fire and I wasn't sure if I was going to finish this semester. I looked for help from the advisors there and they were able to push me to finish as much as I could.  I also listen to a lot of music, this helps me look at life in a way that isn't too challenging for me. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2337,"What I usually try to do when life gets challenging is go out to play soccer, whether that be on my own or with people. I just try distress and tell myself everything is going to be ok, because it most likely will.  I exercise a lot and while i'm playing I try not to think about what I have to do.  When I come back from were I was at I come with a clear head and just ready to work,  I also like to listen to music to just relax and go on walks. Whenever I go on walks I can think about the work I need done but to that extent. I tend to go towards social media lot but that is a terrible thing to do and I wouldn't recommend because when I do this my head just begins to hurt.   So definitely stay away from social media and try to do the things you generally love. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,705,"When life gets challenging I try to think about myself succeeding, you have probably heard of this before but its been proven that our brains react better to stressful situations when you think of a position outcome. No matter what you're doing if you struggle it does not help to feel sorry for yourself and let defeat overcome your thought process because most challenges are all in your head. There are some things that no matter how hard you try you cannot succeed as well as others but as far as college goes if you are without severe disabilities anyone can succeed. You might not be able to get through college as easily or smoothly as some others but all you can do is your best and improve on yourself and at the end of the day you will surprise yourself. Once you start succeeding and improving you will be able to take things another step further and keep improving and eventually find yourself in a better spot but it does not come easy in some situations."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2328,"Life isn't easy, everyone faces some if not many obstacles during their life. And at the end of the day, we have to overcome these obstacles. When life gets challenging for me, I just take a step back, take a breather, and remind myself of my goal, remind myself ""why am I doing this in the first place?"", and most importantly I would remind myself that I can do this and I will do this. Just because life throws at me a couple of obstacles doesn't mean that I should give up, on the contrary, one should never give up. Not to mention that the experiences that one goes through in their life, and the obstacles that they face, makes a person stronger. Once a person goes through the rough patch, through not over and not around, they come back from the other side stronger, and feeling like you can conquer the world. So it's more than okay to take a minute and feel your feelings when life gets hard, because if you don't go through your problems then you'll never be able to get over them. So take a breather every once in a while :)"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2330,"What I do when life gets challenging I like to relax in my room and listen to music. I feel like the music takes away all my worries I have in my mind, and lets me focus on the positive side of my mind. I also like just to go to the park near my house to take fresh air. The fresh air makes me calm down, and it gives me a positive ora around my body. I also like to talk to my sister and friends because they also make me laugh. And they also make me forget about all of the challenges that I have in life. And the most important thing is to accept the challenges that I have and overcome them and try my best to get rid of those challenges. I think this is the most important part that I do face my challenge. Because I never overcome the challenge it's still going to be there and being negative ora to my life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,672,"When life gets challenging, I try to do some things to destress and cope in a healthy way as much as possible. First, I love listening to music and tuning out from the world. Usually, I do this alone or I do listening music sessions with either my boyfriend or my best friend. Listening to other people's music while sharing parts of my own is a great way to learn about their music tastes and add new stuff for my playlist. Second, I like to get my emotions out whether its having a good cry or taking some time to sleep and take a break. Also writing them out to yourself or venting to someone else really helps. Third, watching a show or youtube videos really help! Especially getting into a new anime or having movie nights with my family is able to distract me.Fourth, when I feel like it, I spend time with my loved ones and especially my boyfriend or just video calling with friends to help out."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2338,"When life gets challenging, I honestly just cry, so the main thing I do is just feel all those feelings. I find it to be really helpful to embrace the sadness and hardship or else it’ll never go away. I usually start off very emotional and I can possibly send myself into a whole panic attack unfortunately, but afterwards I literally start to thrive. I put my big girl pants on, wipe my face, and face the challenge head on. Without that moment of pure defeat, i don't think i would come back as strong as i do, that sadness would just wallow inside me holding me back from my full potential. Something I also like to do when life gets hard is switch up my environment. I'll either go for a walk, go workout, or just get some air outside. This allows me to ground myself and just gather all my thoughts without feeling any pressure. Life is like a videogame, if there weren’t any challenges, up, and downs, we wouldn’t want to play and it wouldn’t be as interesting. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2342,"When life gets challenging, I will try to get through it by myself first. For me, I think the most challenging thing is that I have many things I need to do but I don’t have enough time, and they are all difficult. In this situation, I will make a list of these challenging things from the most imperative one to the least imperative one, then solve them one by one. However, if I cannot solve the problems even if I try a lot, I would like to get help from the people that are around me. As long as I persevere, all difficulties will be solved."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,566,"I feel like there are many things that I tend to do whenever life gets challenging. I think this really depends on the type of challenge that I am facing. If it is a school challenge I like to sit down and write down what it is that I need to get done and give myself a timeline of when I would like to get those assignments done just so that I don’t overwhelm myself and give myself a whole other challenge. If it is a sort of personal/life challenge I listen to music and allow myself to listen to the words and make sense of them. I also like to write in journals and just write until I can no longer write or I feel like my thoughts are going in circles.And in the case of work, if things tend to get challenging I usually will turn to my manager and/or supervisor and we will come up with a plan on how to better or resolve whatever challenge is it that I am facing."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2339,"What I do when life gets challenging is go to the people around me. A few years ago I would’ve just found my own way to deal with it and push through, but now I have gotten more used to asking for and accepting help. The people around me support me by keeping me motivated and calm when I feel as if I cannot continue or if I will not be able to achieve my goals. Even if it’s as simple as going to class, it’s hard for me sometimes and I have people that help me determine if it’s worth going and if I absolutely need to. Because I know that they are supporting my mental health and if I don’t need to be in a class, they allow me the option not to attend even if I wouldn’t give myself that option. It is important for me to know that sometimes if I’m ahead In a class, that it’s okay not to go. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2333,"Personally, when life gets challenging I just wanna take a step back and like observe what's going on. for example like if I'm having like a stressful week or something I just take a breather from all the work that I'm doing and I decided to just whine down like maybe watch a Netflix show read a book or whatever that would make me feel more at ease and then once I feel more relaxed that's what I try to get back to what I was doing but instead of doing at the pace I was before I'll just try to take my time with it. Especially now everyone just needs time to relax and not feel like everything is just rushing and trying to get done as fast as I can be done. It's really important to know your limits and know how much we can handle enough for how long."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2331,"Life is difficult when you don't have time to get things done and so do poorly in some areas of school. This is nothing compared to losing your life, as people do every day. Luckily most people can turn to their family to help, though this is not always the case. We can't get too depressed because we have so much."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2324,In all honest when my situations in the past has gotten tough I have gone into states of mind where I do not feel motivated to do anything. It used to take me a few hours even days to get back into my normal state of mind where I can confidently go about figuring out my issue. An example of a tough time would be when I began to fall behind on school work due to one particular class taking up so much of my time. If it wasn't an exam it was an assignment that took hours to complete. In those days when things seemed to just piles on top of one another I took upon myself to take time off of school and reflect on what was going and in that being with close friends and family so as to distract myself from the troubles that school presented. Once I feel that my mind has cleared and can focus on one thing at a time; I sit myself down play some relaxing music (with no lyrics) grab a warm tea and continue with my work. This is how I believe I can get over most challenges in life.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2326,"There are many things to do when life gets challenging. My favorite things to do would involve going to the beach and just laying there listening to the waves and getting lost in my thoughts. My other source of distressing is being with family. My family is extremely supportive of all my efforts and everything I do. It's always a fun time with them and they always keep me inspired. I also love listening to music. I feel like music can sometimes guide you and keep you sane. It helps to know that you aren't alone that there are others who may be going through the same challenges in life. Lastly friends, they are always a great shoulder to cry on. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2336,"When life gets challenging, I tend to ask for help when I don't know how to do something. It is hard for me to ask help because I like doing everything I can on my own but sometimes you need another person to help you understand class material. This semester has been challenging because of everything that has being happening around the world and with midterms coming up right now is very stressful. To not allow bad test results or the world affect me I like disconnecting from the world by watching Tv or doing something that makes me less anxious. "
