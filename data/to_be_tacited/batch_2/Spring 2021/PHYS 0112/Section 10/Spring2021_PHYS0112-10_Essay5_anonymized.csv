2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2324,"Reflective Journaling #5:“How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?”The values of my community or my family have helped me navigate through college in multiple ways due to the overwhelming amount of support given to me ever since I started my freshman year. By being the first generation to go to a university, I imagined getting through college would  be difficult since my family members have no knowledge of how the education system works. Adding to this, I was extremely nervous about having to be a “role model” to my younger brother, who is graduating high school next year, because I didn’t have that one, older, person to go to for help whenever I needed advice so I hope that I’m able to do that for him. Continuing further, even though I did my freshman year online, doesn’t mean I wasn’t extremely busy and never had time for my classes. I had to manage helping my mom with her business, school, deal with family issues, having a social life and overall just being in a good mindset throughout the entire pandemic. In my opinion, I truly believe that the pandemic changed my perspective on the majority of things but as well brought me closer to my family. Because of me getting closer to my family, they were extremely supportive whenever I told them I couldn’t do things due to school, which was greatly appreciated since I didn’t feel a crazy amount of pressure on me. Overall, I wouldn’t have made it through the 2021-2021 school year without the support of my family and close friends. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2329,"The values of family have helped me navigate through this first year of college a lot. Since I'm a first generation college student that is also an immigrant, college has always been the goal for me to be able to have the career I want. All the hard work that my parents have done for me and my sister encourages me to work hard for my dream career and to be able to give them the life they have always wanted. I want to be able to give them their dream house that they have never had and not have them to worry about money once I'm working in my dream career. I know they will always have my back, even after I probably fail one class or change my mind on my major. I know they will always love me and support me on my decisions if they know that decision will make me happier."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2326,My family was very accepting of me to move out and follow my dreams in which I have felt it has helped me to stay focused. I know that no matter where I am at if they are always there to support me and motivate me. My community has always embedded in our brains that college was not a choice but a point of matter. It wasn't much of a choice of which I had to decide if I was attending or not. In fact it was sure that I'd attend a college whether a CalState or community college. Being a first generation student I have always wanted to represent my family and make their move to America from Mexico worth it. They came here for a better future of opportunities and it was only right for me to take advantage. While attending my goal is to become Dr. Gutierrez. I want an occupation in which I will represent those who made me who I am. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,672,"Being first generation in my family to go to college, I'm able to set an example to my younger brother and guide him through the resources that I had to learn from myself and my mom. I struggled a lot with being able to navigate tutoring, advising, and what resources to go through when I'm struggling with something like FAFSA or learning of free groceries. I had to attend lots of workshops and discover for myself that these opportunities exist and I couldn't have done it without the programs such as SSS-TRIO and EOP who navigate and hold educational workshops for these. Being in STEM, as a womxn of color, I want to be able to represent diversity in the STEM field and my occupation (once I have settled in with what I decide to do in life). I want to be able to be a role model for someone who may feel intimidated in entering the STEM field and share my experiences. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2339,"My family has always been set on the idea that you need to attend a college in order to be successful in America. I have kind of always had good grades and done well in school so they automatically felt as if there was no push needed to attend a college. My brother is not very academically oriented and they were kind of disappointed when he decided not to attend any college and kind of just pursue his own thing. I think some of the reason that I attended college right away and did not take a gap year to pursue anything else was, because I felt as if I needed to since my brother did not. I dont mind going through this path, because I honestly dont know or think that there is another path for me without college involved, but I do feel the pressure to get a degree in order to be successful not just in my family but in America. I respect the push for my success, but I also feel like if I dont succeed I not only wasted my time, but my parents as well. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2333,The values of my community and family that help me navigate through college we're basically to go at my own pace in a way. That goes for everything that just went to finish college but also when you're going to do certain things in your life. Honestly over the past few months school has the college is that we’ve been really hard so values that my family has taught me and friends I’ve taught me like help me get the colleges will leave to take my time. I’m just like if you’re feeling too stressed or something just take a step back and just sleep take a breather and don’t try to overwork yourself to accomplish something Because if you do that you’ll just end up not only stressing yourself out for not showing your full potential. Another thing is really to communicate because you don’t know what’s going on with people so if you communicate with them and tell them like your stress your problem it makes it more understanding and easier to discuss.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2328,"Personally, I do not view family as the people who you are related to by blood. This is because it's not where you come from, it's where you belong. And the people I belong with are my best friends. Looking back, I could have never over come the obstacles that I did and went through my life without them, not to mention gotten to where I am today without them. Even through my college journey, when everyone told me ""you can't do it"", my best friends were the one to tell me ""if you can't do it then who can"". They provide me with nothing but love, constant support, and compassion. Everything most people receive from their own blood-related families, I receive from my best friends. I am forever grateful for them and I cannot imagine my life without, they basically make me who I am. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,705,I have mostly had to navigate through college myself. I think if I was younger it might have been more difficult but being 26 years old I feel that I am mature and I know that if I want to receive a degree I have to stay motivated and stay involved to keep up. My sister graduated Cal Maritime in Vallejo and so she has been there if I had any questions about some of my courses but overall I haven't had much help. If I were to give anyone advice on navigation through college I would tell them to find self motivation and choose a major that they know they can use. I would also tell them to make sure they take advantage of student aid and stay up to date because I have lost out on Pell grants that I didn't know I qualified for. I would also tell them to use rate my professor and drop any class that they feel is not for them because being stuck in a class with a bad syllabus or professor can be bad for your college experience and sometime your grades.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2330,"I growing up I was always told that I need to go to college. My parents and teachers always told me that If I wanted a good job, I needed to go to college. My parents always told me that I need to go to college because they didn't have the opportunity. I feel like having my older sister in college has been easier to navigate through college. I also feel like EOP has helped me a lot with choosing my classes for each semester.  My family has been really supportive, All they want is for me to focus on my college. The reason for this is because they want to succeed in life, and they want to do things that they couldn't do growing up. My high school has been really helpful when applying to college and applying for financial aid. If it wasn't for my high school college counselor I would have been lost figuring out how to apply to colleges and financial aid. I'm really grateful for everyone that has helped me navigate college because if wasn't for them I would be lost. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2337,"My family hasn't really navigated me through college because they themselves didn't go.  They did however tell me to pursue school and go on forward with it to learn and get the teachings.  I have almost always been on my own, so that kind of helped in the sense that I can find things with ease.  But they definitely did help me get were i'm at.  I picked sfsu because I don't have to pay for cost like room and board, but I mainly picked it because my parents thought it was a good option.  And I thank them for it because It definitely was. Parents help a lot because they give you kind of a road map and something to be.  If your parents didn't do that you will definitely have a harder time.  What also helps me is my origin,  I try to push for this because I want to show that everything is possible. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2327,"I have always had a great support system growing up and the support became even stronger once the pandemic started. From my parents, grandparents, uncles, aunties, and friends make sure to keep me in check and on the right path in and out of school. There are times I forget where Im learning through a pandemic but I know that I'm not at my best, but I'm doing the best I can. When I forgot to tell myself, they remind me that no matter how hard it was on me, I know that today was not a waste. I may not have made much progress but I still managed to show up and did your best. And that I need to give myself credit for surviving the day. Especially my parents, they make sure I’m going out, eating, and allowing us as a family to travel. This helps me feel “normal” and not cooped up in the house all day staring into a computer screen. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,1501,"This has been a very tough school year for me. Covid has made everything harder and has added stress on my family and their support. I have also lost my home due to a fire and had to evacuate. Whiling living in my car for a few weeks with my daughter before getting a place to live at, I knew I would not give up on school and continue to push myself as I was taught at such a young age. I realized that the way my parents influenced me has helped me overcome many negative school situations and has kept me striving. I also have kept going to show my daughter that all I do is to give her a better life than one I’ve been having. Also the school community has done a lot of possible things to help us students stay focused and had given us potions form counseling and much more help worth classes. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2340,"How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""I personally won't be here, I wait and wait for an opportunity to go to university until 17 years later finally I'm here. The path was hard there were times in with I just wanted to give up but fiends and teacher were always there for  me whenever I need it the most "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2323,"Since I am the first person of my family to go to college, and I am the oldest out of parent's four children, there is a lot of firsts that I have broken. The first First was when I graduated High School, another First was when I attended community college, and then when I attended a university is another first. I have no choice but to be the first, but with that comes ambition, motivation, and hard-working attitude that will never give up, and always strive to succeed. My parents always support me, and wish for my best, and always promoted my education. Without them, I do not know how far I'd be, but I know with their help, I can reach beyond the stars of this galaxy."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2338,"My family has taught me a lot outside of academia that helps me in college. They’ve taught me how to support myself and support my peers by relying on the resources around us. I’ve always been taught that if you want something, you have to go out and fight for it and that mentality has helped me thrive in college. College for a lot of kids can be a wake up call, teachers aren’t gonna beg you to come to class or force you to do your work so it’s a lot of self accountability. Because I’ve been raised to be so self efficient that independent factor of learning in college was an easy and exciting transition for me. My family has also been very big on family capital and having a network of people to surround you. This is a really important college because as you move through harder classes you meet new people and rely on your peers to motivate you, support you, and catch you up if you miss anything in class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,566,"I grew up in East Side San Jose in what most people refer to as the ghetto part of San Jose. I attended an elementary school which was less than a five minute drive from my house. A lot of kids who attended this elementary school were also from around the area so we all looked like each other. I remember my friends and I always talked about how we wanted to grow up and have good jobs so that we could help our parents. At the time it was normal talk because it was the struggles that out parents faced that we wanted to be able to fix. Many of us had to mature and grow up faster than our peers because we had siblings that we needed to take care of while our parents were at work. But I am thankful for those values that I was taught because I now carry those with me every where I go. Sure a kid shouldn't need to carry all these responsibilities at such a young age but I think it builds character and it really sets you up for the real world. So now that I am in college and live on my own, I feel like I am prepared and am able to face many of challenges that are thrown my way. In the end I did go to college to be able to become something and be able to give back to my parents for everything they have done for me. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2343,"Both my parents didn't go to college so navigating this own my own more or less has reminded me that no one will truly have you like you have you and not to rely on anyone. My grandparents have surrounded me with support and have always reminded me they will help me whenever I ask. Fellow college students have always been really supportive and I know a few friends who wouldn't have made it this far without the support of community. In times such as these community is so important as sometimes governments can fail people as we are currently seeing in other countries. The values of perseverance have helped me get through college as well as I have been working since I was 16 to pay for bills while attending school. Communities through school have helped everyone really stay on track, I know I've had facetime study dates with friends in order to stay productive in chaotic home lives. Navigating through college is difficult and always comes with growth leading to maturity. The skills I have learned from college I will always be thankful for because it has caused me to be more analytical of daily life as well and make better choices due to critical thinking. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2331,"My family has always supported me in everything I have done. Education is very important--various teachers in our family, too. They have always given me space and emotional backing when I am depressed or having problems. I am older with three children and they have all encouraged me when I thought about going back to school. Without my wife I don't know where I would be today but it would be a very different (and poorer) place.Teachers (including Dilpreet) have always been available and helpful--it's fantastic. And other students have been great, even remotely--we have found ways to connect."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2335,"Reflective Journaling #5	The values of my family have helped me navigate through college in so many ways, and I am so grateful for that. First off, my parents are my biggest supporters along with my siblings and this alone is more than I could ask for. They are always supportive in whatever I do and choose to pursue in my college path. I know that no matter what I do in college, whether that be changing my major, choose to go to a different university, my family will always have my back and be right behind me. I come from a culture that is very big on family, my background is Samoan, and as a pacific islander we have utilized and cultivated a lot of skillful thinking/ strategies back on the islands which also really helps in college. Being able to preserve and have that skillful/ critical and open minded mindset is key when learning overall. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2332,"My family has always been hardworking and anything below that does not sit right with any of them for me to fail college. They have pushed me hard in order to get through college and they are one of my biggest supporters when it comes to school. If I do need help, they are the first ones I go to in order to get through a slump I am having during school whether it be a test or even just homework."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2336,"The values of my family helped me navigate through college because they have taught me discipline, perseverance, dedication and passion in my everyday life. They always tell me to follow my dreams and to keep working hard no matter the obstacle I am faced with. Life can be challenging and sometimes you need the guidance of your family to make the right choice, especially in college. I am the way I am because of my family and I am grateful to have a family that supports my decisions and my future career. "
