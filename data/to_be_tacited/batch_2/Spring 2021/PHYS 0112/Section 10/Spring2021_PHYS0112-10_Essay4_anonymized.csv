2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,672,"The resources that I have to support me are: My peers: I feel comfortable asking any questions I have about topics I'm stuck on, help out on homework or lab. Being able to communicate and address any questions with my lab group or students in the course has been able to work out any confusions I have.Tutoring Centers: Although I haven't jumped on this opportunity, I am aware that this is a resource that I can utilize when I have trouble with topics that need a bit more time and work. I've only used the tutoring so far for subjects like maths and chemistry. My professor/LA's: I always appreciate and admire the help of my professor for my parent course and lab because they both are very patient and aware that this is a challenging course. I've emailed my professor many times for help with homework, but I feel confident in presenting my difficulties and not handling intimidated. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2333,Usually when we're back on campus when I think about the resources that I have to support me I usually go to the library student resources the counselors and all of that but now being in a pandemic it's been a bit more difficult. But personally I feel like the resources that I have that support me is probably my family. Mainly because they're the ones that are going going through most of the same things as me since I have a sister in college and everything she understands and also my friends just because we're all having are like separation anxiety and miss being around one another so knowing that I have other people in my corner going through it I feel or resources to me. And even not just them I do have certain teachers that will always offer to help us with class and artist there if we need anything whether it's like an extension or just some help understanding things so I feel like they are also a resource that I used to support me and help me in school.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2326,My main resources who I can count on to support me are fellow classmates and my own friends. Having group chats are essential because it allows for all of us to collaborate and discuss our own perspectives which makes me look at the problems differently. My own friends are there to support me and guide me which makes me feel good when I am feeling stressed because they always know how to make my day. I also have the resources online like YouTube that I rely on because when I don't get the lesson being taught in class I go there to learn as well. I have learned that when I am taught something in different ways and with different people I grasp the material more. My overall learning and experience through online classes has defiantly made me need more resources to support me but they have not failed me as I have found myself with ease. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,566,"I think that I have an abundance of resources to support me. It is just that I do not always seek these resources to help support me for various reasons. I know that at work I have access to resources that are beneficial to my academics and also support groups that are available if I ever need someone to help me in my mental health. I also have at home support as my family is very helpful in providing important information and opportunities that they may have heard from from their own colleagues or friends. I also know that I have resources at school such as tutoring, mentoring, advising, etc. These resources are usually fairly easy to access but I do not always take advantage of them, even though I pay for them. I think having access to resources is important because there is usually always something or someone who can help and/or understands the situation so they can help guide one in the right direction."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2323,"There are many resources to support me through this course, and through other courses. To be specific, and to be accurate to this physics course, I have many forms of resources, person-to-person, study guides, videos, and even online resources. For the person-to-person resource, I specifically mean, the zoom meetings, where I can talk to the professor or instructor about specific concerns and questions I may have about the course, and get accurate feedback and my questions answered, right there and then. There are also, the aspect of emails, and tutoring sessions for the person-to-person aspect of resources, where I can get further help, on very specific questions, and have an in-depth explanation, more than one would in a normal zoom meeting. For the study guides, aspect, I mean the notes, powerpoints, and other written information that the professor provides. The videos I am referring to are the recorded lectures, and office hours. For the online resources, I am specifically referring to Youtube, Khan academy and other great free tools to help me better understand the material. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2331,"I have my family and friends, as well as all the helpful people at SFSU. Last year I also depended very much for medical support from Kaiser (surgeries etc)I depend on my wife and children so much. I would be in bad shape if not for them. They show much love."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2340,"I very new when it comes to resources, I know I have teachers and mentors that can help me in my success. I have some good friends, my family even though they are far away they really  support me. I know there is also support centers but I haven't even be in the school since I just started school right before the pandemic. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2330,"The resources that I have to support me in my learning are having torturing and also office hours. I feel like going to office hours has really help me with understanding teh concept better. Also going to torturing has helped me in the past. But because of the pandemic, it's been really hard to go touring. I prefer going to office hours because it has helped me finish work that I didn't understand. Other resources that I have to support my mental health are my music and family. Especially with everything that is going on in the world. It's really hard to process everything. Especially going to school and work at the same time, and being careful of getting covid-19. I like to go walk in the park listening to some music. I also like talking to my sister because it distracts me from things in my mind. I feel like I have a lot of resources to support my learning and my mental health. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2336,"Some resources I have to support me are my family, friends, professors, colleagues and SF. I have been using these resources lately because I have been stressed with test and what is happening in the world. I have been focusing in my classes to finish these semester strong and to continue to study hard for next semester. To release some stress I watch movies or walk my dog which helps me distract myself from the world. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2324,"I'd like to say that I have a decent support system with all the people I have surrounded myself with all throughout my life and time in school. Obviously, I have my parents who I would like to say have wanted to support me through all the things I decide to do in life whether that be my career choice all the way down to the clothing I wear. Apart from them I have my cousins who have been there for me when I have been through though time in my relationships and have even come over to help me with assignments I just could not get through. My brother who is always there to help in life and annoy me when I am having a bad day. Finally I would say work is a big resource for me. With it being my escape from being at home when things aren't so good or just to get my mind off of school during finals. I'm glad to know that no matter where I am in life I will always have someone to fall back on for support."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2337,"I know I have teachers and friends that can support me.  Through this pandemic it has been very hard on everybody but we have to use the resources we need to our fullest ability.  Teachers help so much and are very understanding due to the situations we are in.  We cant be afraid to speak up because if not we won't do well in there course. Only this will make us succeed, honestly I know we have only each other and we have to continually push.  But if you don't understand something or need that extra help just reach out to someone i'm sure it will work.  Another extremely helpful resource is metro, they helped me with all my classes and made the courses easier.  One on one meetings really help even though we aren't in person. I can go to tutors but honestly that wouldn't do much to their expense or because they are mostly all online.  This year has definitely been hard but using all these resources have diffidently lifted some weight from my back. Asking for help, questions or even just a talk with the teacher is vital.  I remember asking you for help and you were very understanding. This is what we need to do, ask for help!!!!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2328,"My main source of support and constant motivation is my friends, especially my best friends. I can confidently say that I wouldn't be where I am now without them. They're my entire world and I am forever grateful for them. Other things that support me and enable me to study and be a good student are my laptop, stable Wi-Fi, etc. There are many distinct types of support; financial support, emotional support, physical support etc. Different types of people tend to provide different types of support. For example, the people who love you provide you with unconditional support. Not everyone is fortunate enough to have support, that's why I'm grateful for the support and love that I receive from others :)"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2335,"Reflective Journaling #4	There are so many resources that we have to use. The most convenient resource is the help of our professor and our classmates. Other than that, there are various resources outside of class like, office hours, tutoring, study sessions, and so much more. These are all very useful and helpful in this class. My favorite resource has to be from my professor and my classmates. Since we only meet once a week, I make sure I come to class every Friday so that I can get as much information and discussion in while I can, because I am a very busy student and why wouldn't we use our class time for that? The resources that we can reach out to are abundant here at SF state. The STEM department of our school also offers a lot of opportunities to seek help in whatever STEM class we are taking which is great. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2338,"The resources I have to support me include a mixture of family, friends, and academic programs. Even though I’m a first generation and my family doesn’t have much experience with college, they are always present and attentive to my mental stability. They constantly remind me to take time for myself, plan things to look forward too, and motivate me to keep showing up every day. I’d consider this an extremely valuable resource because mental health isn’t necessarily a topic taught in school, so having a supportive and uplifting family is amazing. I’d also consider my friends a really good resource. We’re all taking in this college experience one day at a time, and having them to share experiences, relate too, and be stressed out with truly makes me feel supported and not so alone. As for academic programs like metro, tutoring, or advisors I get a lot of academic support. For the times where I’m not understanding, in the make of my mind I know I have those programs to help work through the challenges with me. Overall I definitely feel like I have a solid circle of support."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,1501,"Jennyfer VasquezPhysics labApril 19, 2021 Reflective journal # 4 I think this semester has been a really rough one for me. I have been going through a lot during this school year. Being a single parent doesn’t help the cause either. I believe that Covid really proved who was there and what recourses we had available due to our needs. School wise I think I relay a lot on lectures and recordings.  For most of my classes I have tried to attend office hours when help is needed. Time isn’t always on my side. Its’ very hard for me to do online work, be a teacher to my daughter and work full time in order to pay sky high rent in Marin. So outside of school I don’t really have a lot of resources available to help me. In my particular situation, I have to hold my elf accountable to do and finish all. I wish I had a bit more help in order for me to pass all my classes with good grades.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2332,"Some resources I have to support me are my family, friends, and the professors that I have met at SFSU. These resources help me out due to the fact that they all help me stay in focus and remind of what is at stake. My family and friends support me well due to the fact that they have been with me the whole way and help me achieve my goals even though they may be extreme. My professors help me and support me with the resources they have provided me in order to succeed."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2339,"The resources I have that support me are some group chats for all of my classes. Though I have barely connected with most of the students, they are always supportive and helpful with school. Regarding my health and wellbeing I have my family and my partner. They always make sure that I don't overwork myself and that I take care of my body and mind before anything else. It is easy for me to just work without eating or even drinking water, but I have these people to remind me to be cautious of my health. I feel like though I have not used it often, I have my advisors support if and when I need it. Sometimes I can be confused on what my next step should be and meeting with my advisor helps reduce my stress. My advisor has also helped me understand what it is that I need to get done and has provided ways in order to make it easier for me to succeed. Overall, I have good people/ resources that support my journey and make sure that I am happy and healthy. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2327,"The resources I have t support come in to my life in different ways. My #1 support system are my parents. Its cliche to say they have been there from day 1 which is true but they have shown their support 110% than I could ask for. They are there for me through the ups and downs of my life and have always taught me how to learn from my mistakes and how to celebrate my success'. Another resource to help support me is my friends. They help me make life decisions and help me become a better student by helping me think out loud, I can go to them to ask questions, and elaborate on things. Lastly a resource that helps support me is technology. Im on my phone and computer probably every hour and this is where I read affirmations to help with my mental state, I read news articles and watch youtube videos to help me with homework, and I stay up to date with the world. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2329,"The resources I have to support me at the moment is just my family and friends. I feel very comfortable talking to my boyfriend about how I feel and when I get stressed. Sometime if I do not want to talk to him about those things knowing he has other issues going on in his life, I tend to talk to my best friends since I know they can give me good advice and not make me feel judged when I express my feelings. They all also remind me that I am not alone even if I ever feel like I am and that they will always be there for me. Another person I feel that supports me is my mom because she has given me a lot of advice in life and she has always done what is best for me even though sometimes at the moment I may not feel that same way. The last resource I know that is available for me is the counseling that the school has for all its students. I know that I am going to be welcomed whenever I decide to go to get help with anything academically or even on a more personal level. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2342,"Internet is a good resource for me during my learning. When I don't understand something, I can check it on the internet, then I can get the answer. This save me a lot of time, I don't need to bother other people and I can solve the problem by myself. "
