2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2340,I want the lab to reinforce what I had heard in class. sometimes thinks stick better on may head when i have a visual view. the computer simulations definitely had helped me so far and on many cases sow me that my expectation were totally wrong.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,1501,"Jennyfer Vasquez.What is my goal? That is a very important question to me. You see, I come from a very poor family. My parents came to the United States in order for me to have a better life. And the best education possible (I was one at the time) Ever since, I have been obsessed with helping out those who are in need and those who may not be able to afford medical assistance. Ever since I was set on becoming a nurse or physician. To become someone in the medical field. I would love to have my own practice some day and travel to help families in need. Specially children who need help. So as my time at SFSU whines down, this class is helping me get one step closer to graduating. Not only that but this class also helps me use my brain and think out the box a lot more. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,705,My main short term goals are to get good grades this semester and eat healthier. It has been tough staying motivated and focused while taking classes online but there is still time to catch up to my lectures. It is easy to get during a zoom call and some of my professors are not good speakers. Another distraction is my aunt's saint dane puppy and every once in awhile I have to run out of my room to see what its chewing on. I'm lucky that I have a gym close to me that won't close because I'm living in a small town until san Francisco loses some of its restrictions but I have still been eating unhealthy and at my age(26) I can't eat as unhealthy as I used to when I was in my early 20s. I'm hoping that I can catch up to all my chemistry lecture before the end of next week and then continue to stay motivated.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2330,"My goal is to extend my knowledge more about physics. I don't know much about the subject, the only class I have taken was in High school I was scared to take physics because I've heard it's a hard subject. Being in this class has made me realize that It takes practice and study. This class has made it easy to understand the concept a lot better. And what is helping me a lot is going to office hours. It takes me time to understand the concept, and I'm also visual learning. So going to office hours had made me ask questions to the instructor about things that I'm confused about. Also, the labs have helped a lot by practicing the concept better. If I continue doing this thing I believe that I would succeed in this class. I also have to finish all of my work so I can achieve my goal. So the class is helping me achieve my goal for physics. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2332,"My goals for this semester are to finish with good grades as well as try and get as many classes done for my minor. This class actually helps me a lot due to the fact that it requires a lot of time and focus for me to finish all of the work needed in order to succeed. Without the time and effort I put in, I would not be able to finish any work and have good grades. This class also helps me outside out the classroom. I have a goal to better my body and put on some weight. That being said, this class helps me with motivation. When I finish my work I feel very motivated to go do other activities and working out is one of them. I love that things in class can help me outside of the classroom as well. I hope that there will be more that can help me inside and outside of the classroom."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2339,"My goals are to graduate and becoming a veterinarian. That is my idea of success. This career pathway is what I see myself not only being happy, but also successful. I love animals and I would love to help them. I understand that the job would come with the downsides of being around animals, I get particularly upset around dog deaths as it is something that I hate to think about, however I am working towards the great parts of the job. The parts in which I am able to help the animal and the owner. I hope to one day achieve enough credit to be well known in helping my community. I also hope to open an animal shelter that would be connected. Not only would I be able to help animals with families, but I would also be able to help animals find proper families. This class is a pathway towards my graduation in my major. It is helping me inch closer to my goal."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2341,My goals in life right now are to first get a better job than the one I have now because I'm really starting to dislike it. It was a fine job at first but I'm getting tired of the people we deal with sometimes and management is shit. My other goals are to be able to pass all the classes that are required of me and to graduate SFSU with a bachelor's degree in Biology. This class is helping me do that because it's one of the requirements to be able to get my degree.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2328,"My main goal is to attend medical school and hopefully become a surgeon. I am currently getting my Bachelor's degree in Biology concentration in physiology, and I am considering this to be my pre-med. Thus, this class will help me get my Bachelor's degree which is a the first step in my journey towards becoming a surgeon. It is my goal because I have a really strong passion towards Biology, not only that but also I want a career that will allow me to help people because I love helping others. So, combining these two things about myself, I've chosen to peruse the career of becoming a surgeon :)"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2324,"My ultimate goal in life is to one day have my clinic to do consultations and treat people who suffer from any and all skins conditions from acne issues all the way up to burn victim. This career choice stemmed from my previous constant struggle with acne. Knowing what it felt like  not knowing how to treat acne in a way that was effective and easy to understand was unbearably horrible. Therefore, even though I know the easiest answer would be to just say that I am taking this class because it is a required course; I want to believe that I am taking this because it will help me better understand other fields of science. Consequently causing me to succeed in my career leading to better treat my patients. Those are my goals for this class, even though I know this is just another obstacle on my journey to medical school I know this class will better prepare my future as a medical professional. Plus I can boast saying I understand Physics."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2336,My goal is to understand better the concepts of position and velocity and how the motion is affected by the force of an object exerted to another object. I plan to achieve these goals by drawing a diagram because I understand more visually than if I am reading something. I will revised my notes to understand better the material and maybe do some practices 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2333,In the long run I truly hope to go into the medical field specifically to become a plastic surgeon originally I wanted to become an OB/GYN but I just felt like something wanted to change down the line. And in my opinion I think this class will help me to have goals because it helps to teach me about not just the simple things like forces and direction it helps me understand the math behind science self in a way. Granted this class is also a requirement for my major but it’s not just something I’m taking to get out the way it’s something that truly does interest me and I feel like it could help me widen my options in future professions. And even what am I knowledge of science is all just because being a biology major doesn’t mean you just know biology and chemistry there a different aspects that I need to know that this class will definitely help me learn.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2335,"Reflective Journaling #2	My main goals in this class are to get an effective learning experience, work out problems in class and in my groups, achieve a passing grade (striving for an A), and to have fun. As this is my first year taking a physics class and lab, I was very excited and nervous to see what physics is all about. Coming into this class I did have a few thoughts on energy, motion, and Newton’s law of motion, which I have always been curious about. As I have been working in groups these past few weeks I have noticed how similar my mindset and thoughts about physics were to my classmates, which made me more comfortable in this class. 	I think that being able to relate to my classmates definitely helps me achieve my goals and allows me to work in a manner where we can all be on the same base. I also think that coming together as a class throughout the labs helps a lot in identifying the material and going into depth on each problem. This also allows me to see what I am doing wrong and need to fix or if I am doing the lab correctly. I find it very important to have class discussions every lab because if there is ever a question which I have in almost every lab, it can be answered when we all meet together which saves time as well so that I can move onto the next problem. You are also very approachable in class which is very helpful especially since this is a lab and everything we do will need assistance in solving or just useful feedback. The labs are very straight forward which helps me to stay organized in completing them and thoroughly reading each problem. So far this class has been great, being able to do a lab online is not easy at all but with the help of my classmates and you, labs have been going pretty well. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2327,"My goal in life is to be ultimately happy. As I am growing I always try to stay positive, grateful, mindful, and seeing my challenges/struggles as opportunities to grow. But the goals everyone wants to hear is what I want to be when I grow up. My career goal is to become a surgeon/doctor but if that doesn’t work out, I would love to be a physical therapist or anything in the medical field. Since I was a kid, I always had family members as nurses and they would be the people I looked up to. I always wanted to help others and had many trips to the hospital due to sports which very influenced me. How is the class helping me achieve my goals? Physics 112 is helping me reach my goals by making me strive to do better by interacting with new people (getting out of comfort zone), learning new topics, this class allows me to continue my journey as a biology major, and I get to be thankful for the little things like I have the opportunity to take this class and have the tools to help me have a better education."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2337,My goals are to learn about physics in this class.  This class gives me the opportunity to learn because if I am struggling I have my peers to help me out.  This class helps me achieve my goals because it really makes me learn.  Working in breakout rooms makes us collaborate and discuss problems and issues we have.  I also get to talk to other people which is nice because all my classes are basically lecture classes.  Talking to people and hearing different point of views is very helpful and is what makes me learn more and more in this class. Especially because we don't get to talk to others due to the pandemic.  Labs for me make school better because I am more of a social person and talking to people helps.  Another thing that helps is that I learn new things that  I might have not seen before in my other class.  Which is beneficial because if my teacher were to teach it again I already know what to do. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2338,"My goals are to be happy, successful, and hopefully one day work with animals. I don’t have an exact plan for my career but I know if it’s something i love, it’ll never feel like work and that’s also a goal for me. I just want to love what I’m doing and I’m not afraid of hard work to get there. This class is definitely pushing me in the right direction. It’s moving me one step closer to having a zoology or biology degree. Despite the difficulty that comes with taking physics, I know it’ll teach me valuable skills that will one day help be a better zoologist or biologist. This class really pushes me out of my comfort zone, which isn’t great in the moment, but growth doesn’t happen when you’re comfortable. My main goal is to really help others whether it’s animals or people, and I look forward to challenging my mind and thinking in the process. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2326,One of my goals that I really want to make come true is becoming an Obstetrician. For as long as I can remember I have always loved babies and working with them has always been a dream. Both my sister and mother are nurses and my father happens to be a kidney failure patient and so the medical field has always been around me. To achieve this goal Physics is a prerequisite and so I do need this class. Right now it is what is getting me closer to my next steps. After graduating SFSU May 2023 I will have received my BS in Biology with a concentration in Physiology so then I can attend med school. I am excited for what is to come and just be in a career where I am going to love my job. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,672,"One of my goals in this course is to try to be sure that I’m putting in the effort to not only attain a desirable grade but to attain new knowledge that comes with it. This class helps me achieve this goals by allowing me to embrace the struggles with the course, not allowing myself to feel bad at the fact I may not know a lot cause this is my first ever physics course. But i’ve been someone who has been hard on myself if I can’t get the grade I want or can’t do it right but I’m going to continue reaching out for help when I need it and doing what I can to not give up. It’s been a hard few days to feel motivated and attain a goal of trying to still push to understand this course; i’ve slipped a few times but I’m trying to still have a grip and understand this course to the best of my ability and not be as hard on myself for not reaching a desired point of knowledge/ability."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2323,"My goal is to build a better critical mind and to be able to tackle more challenging and abstract questions. This class is extremely useful in achieving that goal, and that is for many reasons. One of the many reasons why it is useful is because through observation of the labs, I am able to collect my own data and use that data to analyze and answer questions that directly apply to the observations I took. Not to mention, whenever one does math, and applies accurate formulas to the right situations, it builds a better critical mind. Another reason why this class is extremely useful is that it helps me get more accustomed with working with others, and build upon my science community. That is extremely useful, especially in science, where all works are built upon one another. In addition to that, I am hopeful that I can accomplish these goals, and strive to better my education, and look at life differently, in terms of the wonders, it provides."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,566,"My goals are to be successful. I feel like that’s what most people want as their goals, because it only makes sense. I work for everything that I have and am very determined when it comes to things that I want/need for myself. I consider myself to be very independent so everything that I work for or everything that I achieve, I hope to enjoy it and indulge in it when I have it. But, I also want to make a difference in women’s lives. I want to educate women and teen girls about the woman’s body, especially people of color because I feel like a lot of the time our parents do not want to have those conversations with us. Plus I want to be that woman of color myself that these women look up to for advice and to trust. I think this class will help me achieve this because it is part of the process of my being able to receive my degree in Biology."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2331,"Besides getting through my major, I am retaking classes where I didn't finish years ago. l feel that being comfortable with structures and physical concepts has always been important to me. Geometry is the basis of all things. My longer goal of working with marine biology is going to be helped by knowing not just biology but very much structures i want create for the ocean, growing macroalgae, etc.  "
