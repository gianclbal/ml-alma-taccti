Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2323,"I am here for many reasons; I enjoy learning and expanding my educational career. Physics has always been interesting to me, and I always watch videos about various topics in science on YouTube and can get lost in that rabbit hole for days to come. I am here, as like many, this is a requirement for my degree and major, and a prerequisite for other core classes. I am in this Friday lab because it fit with my schedule and I am enjoying this lab a lot so far, due to the down-to-Earth instructor and the classmates that are helpful. Additional thoughts on why I am here, I am here to make my parents, my siblings, and friends proud, but more importantly what I want to make myself proud and become a medical doctor. I want to achieve an A in this course, but more importantly I want to learn a lot more about the world around me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,672,"For me, I was an undeclared major starting out at San Francisco State. I didn't have any inherent desire or a passion that caught onto me, so i decided to wait until I took some GE courses and power through any exciting classes that sparked an interest. After I reached my second-year and almost ran out of time to explore (as I finished up all of my GE's), I decided to take Biology 100 and 101 to trial run like, ""Hey, I kind of always wanted to see how biology worked."" So after having memorable teachers and enjoying the experience overall, even though i had fears about feeling intimidated by the environment as a whole. I just wanted to pursue a degree in Biology, specifically physiology. I'm not sure which avenues I can confidently say I want to take with my degrees, such as medical school or just lab work. Seeing this course, this is my first ever Physics class, and I am here because even though this a requirement, I know this a foreign topic for myself, and I want to expand my knowledge about things that intimidate me. Even if I don't confidently understand, I want to struggle and ask many questions until I reach that satisfactory feeling of knowing that I got through this hurdle even when not confidently getting it right. Even though I want to achieve a satisfactory grade, I want to work hard to make the grade worth it and reflect my effort. I also want to make my family proud of my endeavors, especially if I decide to become a doctor. I know I doubt myself, but I know I can get there and worthy of achieving what I dream and wish for. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,1501,"Jennyfer Vasquez Physics 112Feb 12, 2021                                                                 Why am I here ?This is actually a really really good question, Currently I am doing zoom meetings and class schedules from out of town, And its a bit hard to do so with not so great internet. It does keeps my brain working. I stay asking myself and thinking for the real true reason why one must be in any class. I Have taken the lecture class Physics 111 the semester before summer classes. I managed to do well but was never accepted back into a lab section because classes were way too full each semester. This course along with others are actually really important for me I take, This class is a designated class for my specific major. I am here to fulfill my degree requirements but I am also here to learn how and why certain things work I am eager to learn even though physics is not my strongest object.   "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2324,"If I am going to be completely honest I am here tp get to finally understand physics in it entirety, or least to the extent where I can understand the basics. Seeing as how this class is seemingly required for my major I took it as an opportunity to extend my current understanding of this field of science. Though I consider this more a requirement for my schooling than something I would use in day tp day living; I would still like to think I will end up enjoying this class and utilizing it to further my success in long journey into the medical field. Even though I first understood this question as ""why am I in this class"", I would additionally like to interpret it as a question for my involvement in my major. I joined this school and more so my major to help people in the future with any and all their dermatologic issues seeing as I struggled with it in my life, I see it only necessary for me to be able to help those who would one day be in a similar situation."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2325,"I am taking this class because it is a requirement for my degree in cellular molecular biology. However, I am at SFSU because my husband is attending SFSU as a graduate student. Since him attending required our family to relocate it was easier to transfer schools versus one of us having to do a three-hour commute one way. I am attending college in general since I have a small child and want to give him more opportunities in life by having a financial stable home with educated parents. I think education is very important as neither of my parents had that and we struggled my entire childhood. Therefore, I want to show my son that even though it’s difficult and circumstances aren’t if you keep pushing through the hardships you can achieve your goals no matter the setbacks."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2326,"I am here in class today to start the first week of lab to complete the prerequisite of Physics for my major. Although physics has always been a tough subject, I am ready to study hard and learn more about why physics is useful. I know it is a concept all around us and so I know it will be beneficial to understand. I couldn't be more thankful to have been able to wake up this morning and get a new start to a new day. I also know that I have a purpose here in the world and so I will take this opportunity to succeed. It has always been a dream of mine to be a medical doctor and I will succeed. All my dreams will come to life as long as I work hard for it. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2327,"Why am I here? I am here taking physics 112 to finish my pre-requisites as a pre-biology major, but most importantly to have a better understanding on the many topics of physics. I hope to learn much as possible even during online learning and hopefully this class will help me be prepared for the next course. I also hope to achieve my social skills behind zoom. I believe it is important to start making connections early with my peers and hopefully making friends. I am nervous since this will be my first physics lab ever taken so I have no idea what to expect for classes and homework assignments. I will do my best to ask questions, go to office hours, and make study groups. I will try not to procrastinate on any work for this class and others and do my best to achieve anything I put my mind to. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2328,"Well, it’s a long story :) I was actually born in the United States but then my parents decided to move to Jordan when I was just a little baby, maybe 2 months or so. I lived my entire life in Jordan, I made memories, have amazing friends, everything I ever learnt, or experienced was in Jordan. Recently however, we moved back to the Unites States in September because universities here are lowkey better than they are over there. So, we basically moved across seas, literally left everything, hopped on a plane, and just moved. And we did that for the sole purpose of attending university. Thus, I’m here for my education, but not only that, I’m also here for a fresh start and meeting new people as I love meeting new people. I miss everything and everyone back home so much, my best-friend is over there so it’s been a bit hard. And for that reason, I ask myself everyday ‘Why am I here?’ But then I remember, I remember that I want to fulfill my dream of becoming a surgeon, and that is why I am here."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2329,"The reason that I am here is because I want to be able to achieve my goal of becoming a doctor, more specifically a pediatrician. Becoming a doctor has always interested me a lot and science is just very cool and interesting in my opinion. I decided to come to San Francisco State to be able to get my pre-med major in an environment that I know and love. I decided to stay home for college because I really do love the energy that San Francisco has and it was the most affordable option for me and my parents besides taking two years at city college. Once I'm able to become a doctor, I want to be able to help my parents and giving them things that they deserve like a house and just for them to not worry about still working. I hope to be able to go to a great medical school after graduating from here to reach my goals successfully."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2330,"The reason why I’m here is that I want to become a veterinarian when I graduate college. I’m in physics because the class is one of the requirements for my major. I’m low-key scared of physics because everyone I know has said that it’s hard. Ever since I was little I always loved animals. I knew that I wanted to become a veterinarian. I came to SF because I was born and raised here, and I didn’t want to go far for college. And I also my sister goes to Sf state and she says it’s a good college. I’m excited to take physics this semester because I love to learn science, and physics is a class that I don’t know a lot about. I want to learn more about the concept of physics. The only physics class that I have taken was my freshman year of high school. I am happy to be in this class, so I can expand my knowledge. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2331,"I have returned to school after many years to complete my degree. I am married with adult children, but am trying to know more about Marine Biology--to do something in the area of ocean acidification. I have taken physics classes before but need to refresh and complete my sequence. While everything is a lot of work, it all seems worth it right now. I think everyone teaching at SFSU has been great and very helpful."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2332,I believe I am here for a good purpose. I am here to finish school and get my degree in order to pursue a job in kinesiology. I am here because I got here by working hard and succeeding in the path that I chose. I believe that my purpose is to be who I am regardless of any hate that I receive and that I should go on with my life without the negativity in my life as well. I am here because I want to further my knowledge in physics and gain a better understanding of how things work in physics.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2333,"Honestly sometimes I do not even know why I am here just because everyone usually has a specific motivation like being the first student in their family in college so it can be hard to think of a reason. However personally I think I am here for myself. I want prove that not only can I finish college with good grades, I can achieve my profession dreams in a long run and eventually m life goals. So if I ask myself the question on why I am here again it is truly to make myself proud alongside my mother and sister."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2334,"I think about this question a lot and I’m still trying to find the answer or something close to it. I don’t think there’s a reason why any of us are here and I think it’s beautiful what the universe has created. Our biology has taken a lot of time to evolve and the result is intelligence beyond our own understanding. I don’t think we realize the power our minds hold and we’re always limiting our greatest potential. Anyways, I would like to think there’s no reason why we’re here because I don’t think everything has to have a meaning. On a surface level, I’m here in this class solely because it’s required for my GE. I want to like physics, but it’s not really my thing. I’m here at SFSU because I’m hoping I can gain life experience, knowledge, connections, and a pathway to success. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2335,"Reflective Journaling #1 	Why am I here? Well, if I must say I love biology and as a part of my degree pathway this course is a requirement to take. I’m here because I want to further my education and expand my knowledge on the many different aspects of biology. While physics is a completely different concept than bio, I find it important to my learning of science overall. I want to go into nursing after I get my B.S. in biology, so I am here to take this course as a part of my academic journey, to learn more, and make me and my family proud at the end. I know that through the study of physics I will gain a good understanding of motion, energy, and matter which are relevant to everyday exercise or activities. Physics is quite an interesting field to study and learn about and I am glad I am here to expand my knowledge of it. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2336,I am here to learn about how things work and being my first time taking physics it is a little but overwhelming because I don't know what to expect but I am excited to learn and have fun exploring concepts that we see but we never think about. I know that this class could be challenging but I will work hard and try to understand better because I am always up for a challenge. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,705,"I decided to take courses at San Francisco state university because I wanted to challenge myself and transfer to u.c. Davis for veterinarian school. I still want to but over the past few semesters seeing that I struggle with math I've lost some motivation but I am still trying and I'm not doing bad but I need to spend more time on my classes if I want to get through organic chemistry, bio-chemistry and other hard classes required for my major. I want to become a vet because I like animals and I want to challenge myself and earn a doctorate. I always wanted to become a vet but when I turned 18 and I was checking out colleges I decided to join the military. I spent 6 years in the navy and even though my college is now paid for and I don't have to work I've fallen behind on my education and find myself struggling on some easy courses due to lack of motivation because when I struggle and know the classes aren't too hard it bothers me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2337,"I am here because I need this course in order to fulfill my major requirements.  I am also here to learn and gain new knowledge.  These courses will help me hopefully in the future to become a better and smarter person.  I am here because I also want to make my family proud, I am here because I want to help people in the future.  I want to either be a physical therapist or a doctor so its great to understand this. I am very lost in life especially with this pandemic and everything going on, but I am here to gain purpose.  To do something especially because their is nothing going on.  Being 18 years old as a college student with nothing going on is very challenging.  Especially because I feel like I’m getting robbed of my years.  But this is something out of my control and something that possibly other people are experiencing far more worse. I hope to gain an understanding of physics and other things.  But I am here to learn about myself and what I want in life."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,566,"Reflective JournalingWhy am I here? I think for a lot of reasons. I think this depends in what sense we are speaking because I can ask myself this in the form of life or the form of school. I’ll start with the form of school which will eventually lead into the reasons revolving around life. I am here in school because I hope to have a better future for myself and those close to me. I hope to give back to those who gave to me and supported me during this part of my life. I hope that all the work I have put forth and will put forth, will land me a career in something I genuinely enjoy doing. I think that is the more important thing for me because I do not want work to necessarily feel like work. I want it to be something I look forward to rather than dread. I also think that in whatever it is that I do, I hope to make a difference. Whether that be in an individual's life or a bunch of peoples lives."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2338,"I’m here at San Francisco State University to simply better myself and better my future. I’m here in physics because one day I want to work with animals, maybe as a veterinarian or maybe as a zoologist. I don’t have an exact plan for what I want to be when I grow up, but I know I’m here to be something great and do something that's bigger than me, with animals or with people. I’m here on earth striving for success in my education, in my relationships, and for my family. I’m here to live, learn, grow, experience, and enjoy. My mom has always taught me to work hard now so I don’t have to later, so I put all my effort into everything I do. Even when I struggle, I’ll do whatever's in my power to conquer that challenge. I just want to expand my mind and push myself out of my comfort zone educationally and in the world. I’m here to mess up, I’m here to feel, and I’m here to evolve."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2339,"""Why am I here?""I am in this physics class, because I was to pursue becoming a veterinarian and in order to do that, I must get an undergraduate degree in a science field. I am currently a chemistry major, because regardless of taking all of the possible biology classes I could take in High School, I was more intrigued with the required chemistry course. Not only do I find chemistry more intriguing, but I figured that if in 4 years, had I lost my interest in a veterinarian career, I would still have chemistry to fall back on. I enjoy doing science experiments and I feel that chemistry is a great alternate choice. Having experienced and visited many biochemistry facilities in the San Diego area during high school, I have been keen to looking at biochemistry has a different option for myself. I am also going to college, because my brother was not interested in taking the college pathway and my parents always wanted me to attend. Though I am not extremely happy about school and the idea of school, I am still happy with my decision to attend and continue broadening my knowledge on different subjects. I can only hope that college will help me build lifelong connections. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,10,2340,Why am I here?Thats a great question every time someone asks me it makes me feel like it's a joke about my age and still in school. But the reality is that I love school and i have always wish about going to university. My path has been very very long and finally after 16 years I'm here. I want to learn new things and help as much people as I can in my life.
