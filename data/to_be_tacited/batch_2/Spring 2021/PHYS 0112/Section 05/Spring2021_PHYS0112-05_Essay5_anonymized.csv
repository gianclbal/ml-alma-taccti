2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2216,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""I have always beein raised in a hispanic household where spanish was part of me, and how having parents of only understand spnish impact me. My classes were all in spanish up till highschool. In highschool I had to translate every material from spanish to english in my head for me to understand the subject a little more than others. As highschool passed by like a breeze the struggles of being a female and a hispanic was a weight on my shoulders because I was put on a pedastol from my family and already be expected to know who I exactly want to be since I came out of the womb. My family has always been a value and the reason I am here in college but I believe one of the imporant ones is me. I am my own value because I see mysel in the mirror and realize I am one of many similar stories that are only trying to leave a stereotype of some kind. I am wanting to be seen as a college student who aspires to be a doctor or something else in the futue whatever is on hold for me. My community is a big value. I grep up in the same community for 19 years and see little change.  I had help from programs and professors but it was their true passio and them actually believing is what got me through college. A student can tell when their professor really believes in their students success. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,1857,"My family has always told me to have faith and to never give up. Their words have been helpful to me, they are the once I think about first before anything else. Their encouraging words have given me courage to do something and to not be afraid to make mistakes, to make mistakes but to learn from it, to gain experience from it. Their views has come a long way and these are the words I think about everyday. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2223,"A lot of people in my life has helped navigate me through my experience in college. I would say my family is big supporter in my education. My parents are the ones who encouraged me to go to college and they helped co-sign my loans. My older sister is also a huge supporter, she's been through undergrad before and knows some tips and tricks to help get me through. I would also say peers who I've networked with through work like co workers and bosses have always supported my education and understood the struggle you go through.  They're very open minded when it comes to going to school full time while working a job. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2225,"I feel that the values of my grandparents have shaped me through my life. My father's parents grew up in the depression and I felt that they instilled what they learned from that experience into me. Growing up, my dad's father was the only person who pushed me to do what I wanted to do. He used to tell me that could do anything if I really wanted to. He constantly asked me what I wanted to do and told me I can do better. Throughout college I am always reminded of what I told him and what he told me. He was a person that I looked up to and respected because he was so wise. I wish I could talk to him today because I have so much to ask. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2232,"My parents and siblings’ successes and struggles is what drives me to keep working hard. Using them as motivation, because they have created businesses and jobs for others. They have supported me and encouraged me to keep going and finish strong. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2222,"When I was child I did not always have the chance to be surrounded with my family all the time. I was taught at a very young age to learn for yourself and to only rely on yourself. I think going unto college the transition was really easy for me because I have already experienced living alone and taking care of myself without any assistance or anyone to teach me. I think that by growing this way college has been easier because I never felt lost or confused. I am able to be really sure of myself of the things I chose to do without faltering to anyone’s opinion and holding myself responsible. I think I am really good at working through stressful times too and being able to compose myself when needed. I feel as if I did not grow up this way, I would have a hard time adjusting to college since I would be so used to my parents doing everything and I would hate that."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2227,"The values in my community and family have given me the drive to want to be successful no matter what it was. For example, I currently am a small business owner and they push me to exceed in the best way possible. Next, my family values knowledge so I’ve appreciate the knowledge I’ve obtain because I will be able to use that knowledge for my career and to inform and help others.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2219,"The main reason I am going to college is because of the community I have around me. I always wanted to be able to support and pay back what my parents did from when they raised me. Furthermore, the research lab that I am in has played such a huge impact on my journey in college right now. I can come to them for any kind of support whether it be career, emotional, or mental. They constantly support me during my journey and celebrate my achievements no matter how small they may be. Also, having the support of many around me has made it easier for me to push on despite the pandemic and everything. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2215,"I think the values that I grew up on helped me become who i am today but also were strengthened or changed when i did my undergrad. I learned a lot about myself in those times and being away from my main support system its made me completely independent. ive always been taught to set my mind towards something and make those steps to accomplish those goals. ands thats especially come from immigrant parents, their hard work ethics were instilled in me at a very young age. and at that young age, so early on ive had a different perspective on what it meant to go to college and have a degree. education is so important to them but also maintaining that same level of strength after getting an education. the difference is i value hard work and i value failure at the same level. in my community's eyes failure is never something you should get close to, to them it means you did something wrong but to me ive learned much more out of those scenarios then all the times i did well. its taught me how those things affect my mental health and the ways to grapple with those ideas. they have definitely changed but i appreciate them for starting me on a path of success"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2224,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college because I have had endless support from my family and close friends. When I am feeling down or unmotivated, they make sure I am okay and help me find my way back up. They also help by being so supportive in every decision that I make. Even if sometimes they don't agree with my decisions, they will make it so that I still feel their support despite going against what they may believe is right. Overall, the values that my family and friends have help me remain focused and less stressed. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2226,"I think I am hardworking and dedicated because of my family, they have shown me to be that way by seeing how dedicated and hardworking they are. Also, my mom always told me about how her grandmother told her it was important to go to school and she would tell me the same, so that caused me to put importance into my schooling and that has helped me because when I am struggling and I feel like giving up I think about how important school is and that motivates me. Another thing that made me realize the importance of schooling is seeing how not having schooling has affected some people in my family. Another value from my family that has helped me is accepting what I can't do or that sometimes I will fail. This has helped me because I am the kind of person who likes to get things right, and when I don't it bothers me but this value has helped me to see that failure is okay because you can learn from it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2214,"Growing up, my family has always placed a lot of value on the importance of education and higher education. Throughout my college journey although it has not been as linear as I originally expected, my family has been my biggest supporters, motivators, and advisors in navigating my college experience. Also, as a student who is new to SFSU although I have junior standing, I have really appreciated all the advisors and professors that continually provide support and guidance not only through navigating being a college student, but through this pandemic and with everything being online. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2213,"I’ve come to a realization that the only people that I keep around me are people that support me and people that I want to support. Whether it’s friends, family, or colleagues. This is important for me because if I want to be successful and move on in life I need to have people that are supportive towards my goals and vice versa. This has helped navigate me through my college experience to help me find what my true goals are in life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2217,"I think the values that have helped me navigate through college are a little bit of both my family's and community. First, with my family with their support and constantly reminding me that knowledge is power and having knowledge is better than having all the money in the world. As in my community, I live in a small city in the Central Valley and being more involved with my community it has helped me push to finish college because I want to be able to come back and take all the knowledge I have and help better peoples lives and their environments. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2228,"Getting into  a good college was really important to me and my family when i was younger. when i was just 16 i didnt know anything about college and i didnt have a single clue that how colleges work but my high school and my family helped me to go through it and they teach how things work in college. before that i thought i have to be a genius to get in a good one and college looked really scary and hard to me,  but i figure out that i just have to work hard and think about the goals that have in my life and that. my family really helped me to figure out things and navigate my path to college especially my brother who also went to SfSU and he graduated last year. finally i want to say that other people can help especially the staff to figure out things."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,1266,"My values of my family helped me navigate through college has motivated my passion to finish my education. My family's continuous encouragement and emphasis on finishing school has always pushed me to provide a better future for my family. Growing up and seeing my parent's daily struggle to provide me and my siblings everything we need and giving us things we want has been my main motivator. I want my parents to retire with ease that they have done their part and reassurance that I'll be okay on my own. I don't want them to have any worries and live the rest of their life doing things for themselves. By finishing my education, I have dreams of giving back to my parents everything they worked so hard to achieve. Especially knowing that they bent forwards and backwards just to give me a proper education I don't want to waste all their years of struggle and not finish. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2229,"i'm a first generation college student so a lot of my family members look up to me and expect me to excel in my studies because of the fact i was born and raised here. i've been given way more opportunities than they have. a lot of my family members didn't receive a proper education back in their homeland, so the fact that i am getting one brings them pride. they're constantly pushing me to do my hardest and work towards my goals. they also focus more on the fact that i should get a job that pays well over a job that i'm passionate about. it's definitely stressful for me to be hearing things like that--especially considering the fact that i'm not 100% what i want to do with my life yet--but i can see where they're coming from. they want me to have a good future and not have to live my whole life struggling."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2231,"My family continues to support me by giving me words of encouragement in times when I'm not feeling great about the semester. They also help support me financially with my schoolwork which I'm grateful for. My family values hard work, so I just need to continue to work hard, so that one day all of this will pay off and I can pay back my family. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,686,"My family instilled in me determination, honesty, respect and open mindedness. These values have helped me in navigating through college by being determined to reach my goal of becoming a doctor. Determination has helped me tremendously not only throughout college but throughout my academic career because if I set my mind to something, I do the best I can to make it happen. Honesty is the best value to have as a student because no professor wants a student who is dishonest about their work and cheats. Having respect has helped me make many friends and connections through networking. When I give respect to others, I in turn gain respect. By being open minded, you get to see different perspectives. This helps in college because college students are so diverse and understanding their point of view helps with making connections. All in all, my values of determination, respect, open mindedness and honesty has shaped me into becoming the best student I could be."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,669,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college by teaching me to always try my best. My parents taught me to never settle for less and give 100% of myself into the work I do. This has shown me to be tough on myself when it is necessary and to pull through any situation no matter how difficult it may be. These values are not only from my family but is something that is praised in Mexican culture, which I am very proud of."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2218,"My values of my family have helped me navigate through college because they taught me to be resilient, persistent, and never give up. Even when things get tough I have to keep going. This school year has been the most challenging year for me mentally and emotionally. Giving up sounds like the easy thing to do would take some stress off of me for a second, but pushing through and still trying my best is what is going to help me in the long run. Giving up on school is giving up on my dreams. I've made it this far and I am way to invested in my future to give up. Being a first generation college student already puts a lot of pressure on me to make it. I want to make it not only for me, but for my family. My parents worked so hard to give me a plush life, I need to pay them back. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2212,My family is super supportive and always encouraging me to do good and succeed in my classes. They also help me out because due to Covid we aren't getting the normal college experience so they try to help keep me motivated and just to see things on the more positive side. Also being that I am the last of my siblings to go to college my brothers often offer advice and tips to help me on my path through college and to keep me from getting overwhelmed and burnt out. My parents wanted all of us (their kids) to go to college so they supported all of us financially to make sure we at least got out four years in. They also helped guide me and make sure I'm choosing a path I truly want to pursue and will love and not just something because I think it will be a good job. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2220,My values of my family have helped me navigate through college because they help my drive. I am a first get college student so I don't get a lot of help navigating things a lot because no one has gone through any of this and it was hard to get the hang of it at first. So the way they help me navigate is encouraging me to keep pushing through and find a way to navigate through everything.
