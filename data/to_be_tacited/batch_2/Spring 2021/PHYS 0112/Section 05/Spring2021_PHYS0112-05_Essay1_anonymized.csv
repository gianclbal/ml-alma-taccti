Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2212,"I am taking this course because it is one of the requirements for my major. However I would have liked to take this class regardless because in high school I got to take honors physics only for one semester my senior year, so I wanted to get a better understanding and gain higher knowledge regarding the subject. I'm hoping that taking the class now will help me to actually understand what is happening and how to navigate my way through physics as when I took it in high school I struggled understanding because of the way it was taught to me. Aside from physics the reason I chose to attend San Francisco state is because I wanted to venture away from home but not somewhere not too far. I also wanted to stay in California and I already live in LA so I wanted to experience the Bay and see the difference between the two. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2213,"Why am I here? I'm here to show everyone who I am and what I'm capable of. I'm here to set an example as a person of the LGBT community representing Mexican Americans, anyone can follow their calling if you work hard for it. I care about the future and hope for the best, the world is evolving, and I want to be a part of it. I'm here to contribute to new discoveries and ideas. I'm here because I'm curious how everything functions. The future is advancing and if there aren't people that are curious about how the world works then there wouldn't be a future to look forward to. I’m here because I want to be a scientist, I’m not to sure which field I want to follow yet, but I hear astronomy calling to me. Although it intimidates me to think about what career choices I will have if I follow this path. I’m here because I know I want to do scientific research and contribute to new discoveries."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2214,I am here at SFSU to further my education and hopefully graduate with a Bachelor's in Kinesiology. I am pursuing a degree in order to be another step closer to my goal of becoming a physical therapist or clinical exercise physiologist one day. I hope that I will learn more about things that may help me in my future throughout these required courses for my major and be able to utilize them in the real world.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,1857,"I am here in this class to learn. My family are immigrants, my parents came to the United States to find a better future and a better life for themselves and their family. Being the first in my family to go to college is hard and challenging because I do not have someone to lead or show me the way. Having to learn everything by myself is hard and having to rely on no one but myself is challenging but that doesn't stop me from doing my best. I know that in life, you come across some obstacles but I do not think that those failures should describe a person but instead I believe that the more mistakes you make the more you learn and grow from it. Because doing my best is what matters and in this class I am going to do my best to learn and that is why I am here. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2215,"I am in this class because its a prerequisite for the pre-med/pre-pa route. I always here from students as to why we need physics for the health care field and Ive wondered that too until I got to some sort of answer for myself. For example it can be as simple as explaining blood pressure, its how much pressure is pumping through the wall at the unit given mm Hg. Another example is physics behind the cardiovascular system. There are much more examples. So I hope to use what I learn in this class and transfer it into other classes. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2216,"Why am I here?	The question has been imprinted in my mind wondering the true purpose of my existence. If a stranger asked me I would say; to follow my dream and find my definition of happiness. But in reality what is my happiness? What are the reasons for my joy and  success? If a friend or family member asks why am I here..I would reply with; I want to make my family proud and be able to make their dreams come true through my goals. If I ask this for myself; I would say I am here because I am finding my purpose in this called life. I am here to find my passion, enjoy life, learn more about myself. I am here to help others and be a part of a change. I would like to walk in the halls wearing my white coat being called Doctor Osorio while being surrounded by a group of people, wanting to volunteer with me in rural areas. Why am I here? This is why I am here, to make use of my name so when I leave this earth I remembered with humbleness and there is no excuse for what you can do today for tomorrow."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2217,I am here taking this class because its a requirement for my major. But honestly I'm glad it is because the last time I took physics was in high school so that's been quite a while. So I'm excited to take this class and learn about physics ! :) 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2218,I am at SF State because it can get me to the places I need to be in life. I am in this class because I needed to because of my other physics class. This is also a class that I need to take in order to graduate. I'm not the biggest fan of physics but I am trying and keeping an open mind because I know it will help me in the long run. Because my major is biology I know that this class will be very helpful and is very important. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2219,"I often have to remind myself why am I here at San Francisco State University. Is it because it was expected of me to go into college? Was it because I really wanted to go to college? Well, for me college was kind of the expected path that I was to take and I accepted it. I am a first-generation college student but I have an older sister who went on before me at SFSU with a similar major. When I was still in high school she would often push me to take certain classes and make sure I am doing what is needed and even more to be In a better position for when I enter college. I guess a big part of why I am here is because I do not want my older sister's struggles and advice to just go to waste. It is as if I owe her a little bit. Furthermore, I eventually found something I really love doing, research. I ended up joining a research lab and fell in love with the world of scientific research and working in the lab. The work I am currently doing is helping out communities of color and that is something I always wanted to be able to do. This newfound passion also answers the question of why am I here. Overall, I can just say that I am here because I want to make my family proud, change the community I am in, and doing the best I can."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2220,I am here because I need this class for my biology major. I am also here because I think physics is an interesting subject that I have not had the chance to study since my senior year of high school. I am here as a biology major because I have always wanted to study biology even when I was little for no apparent reason. Over the years I have found many little reasons as to why but overall I am still looking for the main purpose.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2221,"To answer ""why am I here?"", specifically I think about the courses I am taking. My major is BioChem were I chose to focus on Chem and Physics. Focusing on chem and physics is something I really believe will help me for my future career, forensics. Now branching off to forensics and why am I going into forensics, I would like to say it is something that I have been interested in since I was little. My mom and aunt used to always watch crime science shows like CSI, Law & Order, Dexter, NCIS, Bones, and so much more; because it was always on the TV, I developed an interest in the show in which I found a passion for forensics. To answer this question as to why I am at SFSU, I had a drive to get into a good school that I know I would enjoy, course and environment wise. Now that I am enrolled with hopes of finishing school, this would make me a first-generation student (my mom and dad had little college but never finished, and my sister is in 8th grade), and in my family, the second one to complete college. To me, I feel like I have weights on my shoulders because of this, but it only allows me to use it as a drive to finish, and do my best. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2222,I am here in this class because I want to be able to graduate next year. I am hoping to achieve my dream of becoming a CLS or maybe a nurse one day. My goal is to help others and live a selfless life to a certain extent. I want to be successful and I want to live long enough to support my family and take care of what I need to do. I would like to achieve these things in my life at some point and taking this class is a stepping stone to get where I need to be. I do not really want anything more than just to stay on track and get where I want to be. Living a happy stable life is the dream.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2223,"I’m here in Physics because it is a requirement in order to graduate with a Bachelor’s Degree in Biology. I came to SF state, because I wanted to go to college and get a degree. At first I didn’t 100% know what I wanted to do. I just knew I love science and was good at school. Today, my plan is to pursue the medical field and it all starts with me finishing my prerequisites, including Physics. I’m not just taking Physics because I have to, I genuinely love science and I love expanding my knowledge on how life functions/ came to be. I’ve studied Biology, Chemistry, Math, etc but never Physics. So, I’m pretty excited to see how I will do in this class. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,686,"“Why am I here?” I’m here to fulfill my major requirement for Physics 1. As I am a biology major concentrating in physiology, my major requires me to take two semesters of physics, two semesters of chemistry, two semesters of biology, etc. I also plan on going to medical school in the future so it’s important for me to do well in physics because the MCAT tests us on all types of sciences. I hope to become a physician in the future because I want to be able to bring more diversity in the field and help low income communities get the help they need to live a healthy life. Therefore, by being a biology major and taking all these science classes, it will help me later on when I’m in medical school."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2224,"Why am I here:I am in this physics class because it is a requirement for my major but it is also a requirement to get into med school. However, I am still very interested in the subject itself. I remember my very first interaction with physics was watching a movie (I have been looking for the movie for years but I can’t seem to find the name of it or it anywhere). In this movie this girl was able to calculate the physics behind everything and anticipate the next move. That made me really interested in physics. In addition to that, I really just enjoy learning. Being in the middle of a pandemic has definitely taken a toll on my way of learning and how easily I catch onto things. I am a very hands on learner and if I am not in an actual classroom I don’t feel as motivated but I am still trying my best and pushing myself to stay on task and continue learning."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,1266,"Why am I here? I'm here because I want to finish my education and get a degree in Occupational Therapy. I want to be able to live a ""comfortable"" life so I can provide for not only my future family but also to give back to my parents. I want to make my parents proud of my accomplishments and so that even if they go away, they don't have to worry about me and my siblings anymore. I want all my parents hard work and sacrifices all pay off in the end, so I have to try twice as hard. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2225,I believe that each of us has a purpose but I do not believe it is solely for our own benefit. I think each person is here to benefit or back track each other. Everyday a complete stranger can change the course of your life for better or for worse. So I believe this course is another window or gateway to get where I want to be.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2226,"I was always pretty good at school, and I always knew I wanted to go to college. I also knew that college was necessary for advancing my career options. I discovered my love for biology at the beginning of high school. I thought about a lot of different careers that I could go into. Then I found something that seemed perfect for me. I found out about the CLS program at SFSU and I decided I wanted to be a clinical lab scientist. I thought about going to a community college and then transferring to SFSU, but I decided it would be better to go to SFSU for the whole four years it would take me to get a BS in Biology. Phys 111/112 is a requirement for my degree, but that doesn't mean that I wouldn't take it if it weren't required. I love biology, but I also just really love science, including physics. Funnily enough, the reason I took Phys 111/112 this semester and not in another semester was that when I was looking for a Bio class I couldn't find the one I needed so decided to take Phys 111/112 this semester."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2227,"Growing up I have always been a curious kid. I used to irritate my mom with “why” questions. At the age of 4 or 5 I decided that I wanted to be a doctor. How did I know exactly? My pediatrician Dr.Yee was one of the first people to expose me to the beauty of being able to help people when they are sick. As a kid I was always wanting to help people feel better especially when my mom or dad were sick. As I got older and was introduced to science I noticed that I excelled in that subject over any other subject we learned in school. Throughout elementary and middle school I was heavily involved in STEM programs. Outside of academics I am lucky enough to have family members around me who are in the career field that I want to be in which includes; my uncle, aunt, cousin, my sister’s best friend, and my grandmother. Being around such resilient black men and women in the STEM or medical field influenced the specialty (which changed so many times) I want to go into, which is obstetrics and gynecology. Overall my science story, until now, was very straightforward and determined since the beginning. I am excited to see and experience how the rest plays out."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2228,"Why im here?     Everything in our world happen for a reason and for knowing that reason science is the best way to understand. Since when I was a kid I was really interested in science and nature, because of my parents, and I learned so many things because they are both doctors and they really inspired me to think more about the reasons that causing everything in our environment. Im majoring in biochemistry and chemistry is one of my favorite topics of science, also I like other major of science too like; physics, biology and astronomy. In my idea physics is so interesting, some people say that it’s too hard to understand but in my opinion if I try to understand things that happening in front of me I will understand physics, because physics is real and its happening right now everywhere in the world even far away in the space and its not like other classes that you learn something in it but you never see or hear anything about it in your life. so there are few reasons that I’m in this class, the first one is because I really like to learn and I know im going to use my knowledge about physics in future and the second reason is I need this class to get my degree."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2229,"i haven't set my mind on a certain career, but i know i want to work in the medical field. i'm currently working towards becoming a pediatrician. i love kids and i tend to get along super well with them (i might have to thank my large number of nephews and nieces for that). i decided to major in biology because i felt like getting a biology degree would set me towards my goal. and if i ever decide on a job that's not a pediatrician, that's okay because there's other jobs in the medical field that i can explore. part of the major requirements for biology is this physics lab. ironically for someone who wants to work in the medical field, science hasn't really been my strong suit. i've never taken a physics course before this class, so i'm quite anxious about how i'm going to perform. i think this class alongside the lecture will open me up to new ideas and perspectives though, and that i am excited for."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2230,"Alicia Cortez   PHYS 112   Andrew Sturner   3 February, 2021   Reflective Journal 1   Why am I here? I am here because I need this class to graduate. I am also here to learn   more about one of the “Grandfather Sciences” since I am a STEM major that could be going into   the engineering field. I am here because the person that oversees my scholarship and knows   what I want in my future told my advisor to include this class in my two year Ed plan. I am also   here because I was supposed to take Chem 215 but ended up needing to take Chem 115   because I was one percentage away from moving onto the next class. There is not much of a   passion that I have for Physics just yet, but I am sure that if the professor keeps being   passionate about it, I will too because that is usually what happens."

2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2231,I'm taking this class mostly because it a requirement for my major. I'm majoring in Biology with a concentration in physiology. I always wanted to help people and I was always interested in human anatomy which is why I hope to go into the medical field and become a Physician's Assistant. I've always been intrigued with the subject of physics. I wanted to take it in high school but there was a common understanding among the students that our physics teacher wasn’t that great at teaching the subject and student would avoid taking her class in fear of ruining their GPA. I didn't take the warning seriously so I took her class for 3 weeks. She indeed was not good at teaching physics so I dropped her class and switched to AP environmental science. I'm excited to actually learn about physics this semester and hopefully I will get a good grade in this class. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2232,"I am here to fulfill a pre-requisite course for Biomechanics which I plan on taking this summer. However, I am just excited to gain knowledge in physics. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,1695,"The reason I am taking this class is because it is needed for my major.  This is my first semester at San Francisco State where I will be studying biology. Biology has always intrigued me and after switch from multiple majors, I decided to follow my gut and trust that I will enjoy studying the subject.  I feel that there is no meaning ones life when they don't feel like learning as much as they can and constantly try to be the best they can."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2233,"I think it is very important to be able to question why we are here and I believe my presence goes for the collective to exist to be able to create an impact as well as interact ideas and evolve as a whole human race. I also know that I am connect to source and my spirit is aligned to relate various concepts, as well as capacity to understand many situations. As an Aries, I also believe in leadership as a main quality and aspire to inspire before we expire, as well as nurture and influence nature/natural intake as an approaching year vegan and puppy-owner. With that said, I hope to be able to travel in the very near future to be able to expand my knowledge and journey. I feel and discovered with this covid situation that we are here to make differences that we have accustomed to indoctrine and reach independence which to me is a home-owner, garden supply, family oriented provider and ever-lasting student mindset."
