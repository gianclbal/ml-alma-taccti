2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2223,"The resources that I have to support me are my major's department, Biology, like all of the advisors. I've received great tips from Biology faculty members. Another resource I go to so the internet. I like to do my own research and figure things out for myself via what others have to say on the internet. I will also go to fellow peers that are in the same boat as me and ask them for tips and advice or any friends in general that go to SFSU. I also have my professors as a resource if I ever need any help or advice. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,686,"The resources that I have to support me are my family, friends, professors, and google. My family and friends have always been my main supporters. They have motivated me by giving me reassuring affirmations such as, 'you can do it', 'push through', 'you can always do better next time', etc. My professors support me by extending work, holding office hours, holding exam review sessions, etc. These things have helped me understand the material better and enough time to hand in work. Finally, google has been a lot of help because everything I am curious about is at the end of my fingertips. If I'm ever confused about a topic I can watch a youtube video where the material is explained in a different way or if I am not sure about something I can google it. All in all, these resources have helped me tremendously in staying motivated and answering clarifying questions."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2226,"I think one of the biggest things that I have that supports me is my family. A lot of people don't have any type of support from their family and even though they find a way to succeed they have to deal with a lot more obstacles because they don't have that support. My family supports me in so many ways, they make it easier for me to concentrate on what I need to do for school instead of having to worry about other problems. Sometimes I don't even realize they are helping me because I have been lucky enough that I never have had to live without their support, but I know that if I didn't have their support succeeding would be a lot harder. They do a lot of little things that add up and help me a lot. Another resource that I have to support me is the professors, trying to do assignments or learn without their help would be a lot harder. Another resource I have is the other students because if I am confused or just want to clarify something I can ask them to help me with that."

I also have my family as resources for more professional things such as recommendation letters and help as well.

2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2217,"The resources I have that support me are my family, for instance, my parents or older brothers are there to try to make my life as a college student during the pandemic more at ease. Since it is pretty frustrating to be sitting on my desk 24/7. Even buy just buying a comfy office chair is so helpful. But other resources that as helped are the EOP advisors they have helped me to be able to stay on track and see my fruits from where I started and where I am now. So that has definitely helped :) "

I also have a loving boyfriend and family that'll motivate me to do better and push me no matter what. I have a sister that graduated from SF State a couple years ago so she understands what stuff could help me and how to access them. I also know that there are a lot of resources available on this campus regarding classes, graduating on time and as well as financial assistance. I understand that I have these resources in my disposal. It's just my willingness to ask for help that stops me from doing so. Sometimes I feel like I could do stuff on my own like learn material from a certain class. However, I feel like I'm breaking out of that habit which is actually helping me a lot than just suffering in silence."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,1857,"Nowadays there are many resources that are available to us and the thing that matters is that we take the initiative in using those resources. We need to utilize the resources to its full potential. We are able to gain knowledge through YouTube and many other websites who are providing us with information and explaining topics to us.

Resources from school that can help with my mental health, or food if I am eligible for it and also any difficulties I have with the economy or transportation. Also counceling is a good outreach whenever I need a time to just let evrything out which I usually do to my friends rather than a councilor. Those support me and have supported me through my highshcool years and help became one percent less of stress that I do not had to worry about for a certain time period. In college it is different, there are several resources since now it is ""adulthood"" well there are more responsibilities and it is more handful the older you get. Resources that support me can be programs that are tutors helping other students who have trouble understanding a topic or a subject of a class. It is having several plaes to go when not understand the topic. I still have difficulty asking for help since I tend to think that the others might think I am dumb or they feel annoyed that I don't know certain things and I start to feel embarrassed. "

I also have some other students numbers and I could text them too, if I have a questions or problem that I need help with. I can also email my academic advisor when I have questions, especially when a teacher doesn't get back to me. I have also signed up for tutoring which is another great help, when I have a tougher question. I find having a tutor really important because they are also students and they have already been through this, so they can relate and help you out. I also have family members that are either in college or have already graduated, so I could also ask them for help. Sometimes this is more comfortable for me because I already know them and I won't get nervous to ask them a bunch of questions. Other resources that do not involve talking to anyone is the ilearn page. On this page I can find previously recorded lectures as well as slides or docs that may answer my question and help me out. "

In school I have my professors that support me whenever I need that extra support and its always good to know that they are able to provide that for me in whatever capacity they can. In life with the dealings of mental health, I not only have my friends but the resources of the professionals within that area. Sometime need help with stuff going on in life you have friends and family but I am the type of person to never want to burden them too much.

2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2228,"for this reflection i would say that there are couple main sources that support me in my life. the first important one is my parent. they supported me since when i was just a baby and i couldn' be here if it wasn’t because of them and they always tired to help me keeping me to move forward and actually they helped a lot to inspire me to be something in my life, because they are both doctors it really helped me to motivate myself about my future. the second important source that supports me is the school that i go to. they support me with providing good teachers, good equipments for studying and with telling me what to do to be successful in future, and i think without the school having a nice future is kind of hard so every one need this kind of support in their life, but sadly people have to pay a lot to have this and not everyone can have it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2213,"Online school may seem difficult for some people but there are tons of resources that can help us succeed. For instance, if I feel that I'm having trouble learning something in class I can always stop by my professors open office hours to ask a question. Also, during class when I'm working on a group assignment I can always ask my peers for better clarification or help, its always useful to ask for help instead of being stuck on a problem and giving up. the university also provides resources to help students succeed such as the Student Enrichment office. So if I'm having trouble I can use one of these resources or I can go to my academic advisor. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2214,"Academically, the resources available that I have found to be the most helpful when I need support is  SFSU tutoring and professor office hours.

2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2222,"The resources I guess I have to support me school wise is my professors, classmates, and office hours. I also have school counselors that could help me with my class schedules and such. I also take notes and the lectures are recorded, so it is nice to be able to go back and look on whatever information I missed or need to relearn. I also have the slides form lecture, so it is easier to look at it if my notes get messy. However, on a personal level I would like to say I have myself and my dog. I also have my family if I need it as well. I am not too close with people because I prefer relying on myself and not others. I find that it's better to learn to support yourself before relying on others who may not know how to support themselves either as well."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2221,"Personally, I see my friends and family as a support system. Although, I am aware that I have outside resources that I can reach out to when in need. Resources accessible through both the school and in my town. I think not only having a support system accessible is important, but always knowing that the support system is there is just as important. There are so many resources for so many different situations that are easily accessible which is so cool to me. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2231,My family helps supports me with encouragement and my friends help support me by listening to me rant or help me figure out certain problems that I'm in.

2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2224,"I know that the school offers a lot of resources fro mental health and general health but I have honestly never really felt supported in that sense. however I know that I have my friends and family to rely on. I honestly have about 5 friends I can truly count on with anything going on in my life and while that is not a lot, I feel full and content with the people in my life. I know quality over quantity sounds cliche but that's the case in this situation. I feel an endless amount of support and love from the few people in my life. I know that I can genuinely rely on them to help me when I am feeling upset, they constantly check up on me, and make me feel valued. I can go to these people for academic help and just to have a shoulder to cry on. I count them as a major resource in my life along with my family. "
