2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,669,"My goals are to pass all of my classes with good grades, graduate college in four year with a major in Microbiology, get some lab experience, and get into a Clinical Laboratory Sciences program. After this I would like to hopefully get my license as a Clinical Laboratory Scientist and work in a lab within a hospital like UCSF. Once I start my career, I hope to possibly work my way up to specialize in a specific field like Toxicology. This class is helping me achieve these goals by allowing me to explore other fields of science besides Biology which also fulfilling the requirements of my major. I will be able to use what I learn from this class and apply it to the real world as well, which could be very valuable in the long run."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,1266,"My goal is to become an Occupational Therapist in the future and this class is one of the many pre-requisites in the kinesiology program at SFSU. I'm not yet in the kinesiology program at SFSU but I'm aiming to get into the program by Fall 2021 hopefully. This is also my second time taking physics because it was very difficult to understand especially during these times where I'm at home with no motivation to learn that's why this semester my goal is to get a 4.0 or higher than a 3.5 GPA. After last semester, I realized not only was I wasting money but I also wasted time because I need at least 60 units to get into the program which I don't have yet. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2226,"I guess some of the goals that I have that this class is helping me with is my goal to be a clinical lab scientist. Another goal that this class is helping me with is getting a bachelor's degree in Biology because this class is a requirement for that degree. I also think that this class is helping me in my goal to learn more about science. This class is also helping me to think like a scientist and that helps with my goal to learn how to be a good scientist so that I do well in my career as a scientist. I think this class is also helping me achieve my goal to be more knowledgeable about how the world around me works. I also have a goal to understand the physics taught in this class, because I have to take other physics classes and I have to know physics to be able to be a good scientist, so this class is helping me learn about physics and that is helping me achieve that goal."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2225,"As of now my goals are to finish school and possibly move on to earn a license to work somewhere in a laboratory. My experience in college has also allowed myself to be more welcoming to others that are different or are out of the ""norm"". This class will allow me to graduate and hopefully will improve my critical thinking skills. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2233,"My current long-term goals is approaching my nearing graduation as well as my aligning my spirit physically, mentally and emotionally self-fulfilling. This class will aid success and achievement toward my goals as a motive along with being able to connect the concepts and physics lessons into everyday life happenings that intrigue and engage the learning and overall deeper understanding of physics, as well as the law of the universe and the prime operation of vibrational frequency classified by Albert Einstein. With physics being my greatest struggle through college, I am inspired to learn and earn. The Laws of motion imply that we may not exist to another object unless we interact with/apply force or reaction which is also relevant to the application of life and energy. It is important to give energy and attention towards efforts and results we want to see more of, and this is also perceived as the Law of Attraction. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2220,"My goals are to graduate within the next couple of years. My graduation date is supposed to be 2022 but I'm not sure if I can make it with all of the classes I still have to take. Another goal is to figure out what I want to do, a concentration in biology more specifically. This class is helping me achieve my goals by first, being a prerequisite to other classes I need for my major and second, exposing me to different topics and people that can further my decisions toward my major."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2212,My goals are to graduate with a degree in Biology with a concentration in Physiology and then go onto Med school. This class is contributing to that longterm goal because it is helping me with requirements necessary to obtain this specific degree. This class is also helping me achieve that goal just in the sense that it is providing me with more knowledge that may someday be useful in my future career path. Another short term goal I had was just to be able to understand physics with a better sense than I did previously when taking  physics course in high school. So far although its only been a couple of weeks I already understand better than I did in high school just from taking this course. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2224,My goals are to be able to correctly manage my time and always keep myself busy. I am currently finishing my phlebotomy program and I just went through my biggest sale this year fo ray small business. I made over 500 chocolate covered strawberries this weekend and over 40 flower arrangements as well. A lot of what I had to do beforehand on my part was be able to plan out my schedule ahead. I did all my assignments super early in the week and pushed myself not to procrastinate. Procrastination has never really been a huge issue for me but I want to get into the habit of finishing my assignments early to just get them out of the way and have more time to either work or take more orders. I just started an externship so working on this goal right now is gonna benefit me a lot. This class is helping me since we are still getting pushed to do our work and we are learning things in lab too. This helps me want to stay more motivated to do my assignments while the content is fresh in my head and finish my labs in class in case I run into any questions or need help. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2228,"when i was just a kid my goal was to be someone important with so much recpect but now that im older i just want to be somone to be able to help other people and i feel like i dont need respect anymore because helping people making me happy. helping people can be done in few ways like making a house , making a school, curing a deadly disease, or just giving people money. money can be helpfull but not for a long time because people will spend things that they dont need. my goal for my life is to be a good doctor and help people who cant afford and im not talking about doing that in america im talking about the whole , and this class helping me to get my knowledge better and i want to get my degree soon as possible."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2231,"My goal is to graduate with a bachelor’s degree in Biology with a concentration in physiology and hopefully get into a PA program. This class is helping me achieve that goal by fulfilling a requirement I need to obtain my degree. I've never taken a physic's class before and I thought I would be extremely lost, but I'm actually not as lost as I thought I'd be. Hopefully as I continue to take this course I will continue to understand the topics."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2223,"My goals are to be successful in my undergrad and to constantly build my knowledge on science, specifically in human biology. I also want to gain more experience in health care as I continue my studies at San Francisco State. This class will help me achieve these goals by expanding my knowledge on science and bringing me one step closer to graduation and my Bachelor's degree. This class will definitely challenge me in a critical thinking aspect, which is something I want to work on the most. So, I am expecting to struggle a little bit in this class but learn a lot from it in the end. I have also noticed this lab and the students in it are very fast paced, so I will definitely be able to learn how to work in a fast paced environment, which can be beneficial for my field. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2216,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""My general goal is to be able to earn the title “Doctor” and be able to help low income communities that dont have enough resources and aren’t able to receive the basic necessities we as humans should all have. My small goals are being able to maintain the motivation of studying since life has been getting difficult. My other goal is hopefully to try to understand physics more since I have always had difficulty with physics in general. This class will help me achieve the last goal by the professor being patient with me since I am a visual learner and when things are being repeated in a wordy way I tend to get confused. It has to be repeated to me more than once for me to get the gist of the topic. It will be helpful if some questions from the lab are being reviewed during class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2234,"Name: Eric Wang 920750750  My goal is very simple and straight forward, just want to pass this course so that I can catch up with my progress.  At first, I took PHYS 222 at the beginning of this semester; but soon I found that I forgot lots of knowledge that I learned from high school, so I talked to my professor Dr. Tennant. So she suggested I took PHYS 111 for reviewing and then PHYS 121 then PHYS 222 so that I can catch PHYS 222. At first, when I joined PHYS 111 I didn’t know that in order to pass 111 I have to choose a lab with it; not until professor Sturnner noticed me. Thanks to professor Sturnner’s remind again or I can’t imagine how I will regret at the end of this semester that because I didn’t choose lab so I have to take PHYS 111 again."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2222,"My goals in life are to become someone I can be proud of and someone that can support themselves financially and emotionally. Currently I am in an early twenties life crisis and decided to change my major my senior year of college because I decided I would not be good enough to be a nurse, even though it had been my life dream. I have applied to nursing school and I am hoping that I get in and do not have to do my backup career plan. I am currently doing my backup plan right now as I wait for a response from the nursing school of my dream. However, I am happy with my backup plan because I get to see what other things I could be good at potentially. Physics is something that is definity new to me and I see that I definitely would not be a good physics major. Though, I will keep trying to master it, but it does not come as natural to me as other subjects, which is really frustrating to me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2215,"My goal for the future is to finish this post-bacc im doing this year and continue working as a EMT so I can within a few years I can apply to physicians assistant school. And this class is helping me fulfill those requirements needed to get into the schools but also its a great opportunity to learn about how this subject will be applied in medicine, and thats something that would be really cool to see how its integrated beyond the basic how x-rays work with their electromagnetic waves and such. I know physics plays a much larger role in medicine."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2214,"My goals as far as my education goes, are to pass all of my classes with good grades and be able to graduate within the next year. This class is helping me to achieve these goals because it is a prerequisite I need to take in order to graduate for my major. Although I currently am having a hard time understanding physics, I am trying my best to study on my own as well as use resources available in order to be successful in the course and in working towards my goals."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2219,"My long life goal is to become a research leader in the field of stress biology or cancer biology while specifically working in communities of color. However, my present goal right now is to just finish this online semester the best that I can. It is a weird and tough situation so all I can do is adjust and adapt the best that I can to continue my academic journey. Furthermore, I want to be able to manage my time a bit better so I can at least provide myself with some free time at the end of the day instead of constantly working on homework assignments till I finish. Last semester really killed me since I did not have much time for myself and that resulted in me being consistently burned out with my mental state not doing so hot. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,686,"My goals for the future are to graduate from San Francisco State University with a bachelors in Biology concentration in Physiology and go to medical school and become a physician. I want to become a doctor in the future because I want to bring more diversity in the field and help underserved communities. Such as undocumented communities, low income communities, etc. Helping these communities are important to me because as I come from a low income family I see how hard it is for members of my community to pay for hospital bills or take care of their health. In addition, I want to be able to help decrease health issues that are common in low income communities for instance, food disparities. This class is helping me achieve these goals because physics teaches us how the world works. Topics such as acceleration, displacement, energy, etc. are important to learn. All in all, in order to become a physician, classes such as physics, biology, chemistry, etc can help me reach my goal."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2227,I have many goals. Two of them are to graduate and go to medical school. I’ve been wanting to go to medical school and be a doctor for as long as I can remember. My other goal is to do some type of research in relation to health disparities in the Black community especially Black women. My other goal is to open my own practice or practices in low income communities or in communities/cities with a large population of people of color to provide health service to those who are unable to obtain it. The class is helping me achieve my goals because it’s a prerequisite for my major and a subject that I will be tested on the MCAT so I can get in medical school.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2229,"my goal is to work in the medical field, specifically as a pediatrician. i feel like i work well with children as i have tons of nephews and nieces which has grown my love for kids. this physics course is a requirement for my biology major. i'm currently a second-year majoring in biology with a concentration in physiology. i decided on that major because i thought it'd help me learn more about the human body, internal organs, and the way our body functions. learning about those topics can really help me out if i do become a pediatrician in the future. physics is a really neat class for a biology major like myself because it teaches you things that you can actually apply out in the real world. we are affected by motion and gravity and force. all these physics related things come in to play in our every day lives. i think it's fascinating to be learning more about our environment and the way our world functions around us."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2213,"This class is helping me achieve my goals by giving me a better understanding of the study of physics. Physics is something that you experience in your everyday life such as walking up or downhill, accelerating when you’re driving. Breaking down physics and its components will help me in the future for when I decide what career I want to follow. Also, it’s interesting to learn this subject and see how everything falls to place. Science and technology intertwined with each other and if it wasn't for one or the other then we wouldn’t have come along far in the future. Physics has become a substantial driver of science and technological progress; physics has permitted the application of mathematics to practical problems and has led to engineering breakthrough that has improved our society in many aspects. So whichever path I take I hope to take the knowledge from this class and use it in everyday life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,1695,Biology has always been a subject that's intrigued me. One of my goals is to open a brewery up where I can mix my knowledge in microbiology with brewing science.  Both are very similar and I hope to pursue that goal eventually.  This class helps me get just one step closer to completing my major and understanding the world through a different lens.  I hope to learn as much as I can from this class while still enjoying the content.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2217,My goal for this class to pass the class with a good grade. As well in general with my other classes as well. What has been helping me is my printer. I think that Printing the worksheets and powerpoints have helped me follow along with the class's lectures or lab. Because since we are not physically in class it's nice to have a physical paper from class to follow along and not get me distracted from other things. I think what is really helping me is waking up early and getting somewhat ready to feel good and not be lazy. and since I wake up early and do everything I need to do. It helps me fall asleep faster. So that's really nice! :) I'm still learning new ways as to how to achieve my goals. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2218,I want to graduate in four years with my b.s in biology. Then I want to continue to medical school to become a plastic surgeon. I have wanted to be a plastic surgeon since I was a little girl. It was just something that always interested me. I know that this will not be easy but I am ready to work for it. This class is helping me achieve my goals because I will need this knowledge for future classes but also because it is mandatory that I complete these classes. When I graduate I will be first generation to graduate from college. I want this for myself and for my family. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2221,"My short-term goal currently is to try to stay on top of my school work while keeping my hours at work the same. Meaning, I want to be on top of my school work without having to have people cover my shifts because I am falling behind. This is one thing I believe will help allow me to feel very productive with myself. My long-term goal is to become a Forensic Scientist. This class is actually very important to my goal because physics plays a huge role in the logistics of forensics. I have even considered branching off into a ballistics specialist too, in which the main focus is forensics. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,1721,"My goals at this point is just being able to complete as many labs as I can. It's really hard to keep up with labs since the lab reports are so long and I have to print out every single one because for some reason my desktop won't allow me to download and edit the lab reports. So it takes me longer to finish the lab reports more than it should have. I have multiple printed lab reports uncompleted and I'm just trying my very best to finish them all or at least complete as much as I can so I can simply get some grade for it because turning in unfinished work is better than not turning in anything. I am in physics GroupMe study group chat but whenever I ask a question and reach out for help most of the time nobody answers me. In addition, I'm pretty stubborn and absolutely dread asking others for help because it makes me feel unintelligent at times since I feel like I should be able to understand or comprehend what I just learned but when I get over that: the teacher (you) is so helpful and really tries to help me understand the material involved in every lab. If one explanation doesn't quite make since to me then he'll try to make another one to see if that is more understandable and helpful than the first."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2230,"My goals are to graduate in four years with a Bachelor's of Sciences degree in Biology (Physiology). This class is helping me better understand science and fulfilling my prerequisites or general education. In my two year ed-plan that I made with my advisor, my scholarship advisor sent classes I need to take which is this class and the second part of physics. I am excited but also scared because this class has been a challenge for me. I hope to pass this class with at least a C+, but hopefully a B. And I am sure I can get that because Professor Sturner has been doing a really good job. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,1857,"One of my goals include getting though college and graduating with a degree. I am doing my best in order to be a step closer to my goals everyday. I am looking to improve myself everyday. My goal is to be happy and do whatever that makes me happy for the rest of my life. This class is a class where I am constantly learning a wide variety of everyday experiences. Where I am taking a real world example and solving it, makes me think constantly. "
