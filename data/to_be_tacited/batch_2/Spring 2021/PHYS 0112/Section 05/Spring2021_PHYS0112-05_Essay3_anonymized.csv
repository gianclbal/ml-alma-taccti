2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,669,"When life gets challenging for me I tend to do two things. One of the things I do is isolate myself. It might sound a little contradictory to what people usually recommend but I like to be alone sometimes. Being able to process what is going on, to think about that particular point in my life and to take it all in without any social pressures or people talking to me. Sometimes what people say can only make a situation worse, which is why having time to oneself can work for many people. Usually I'll listen to music or watch television shows when I'm alone. If this seems to not work for me, I do the opposite. I surround myself with love by keeping myself busy with friends, family, coworkers, whoever is there for me and can take the time to listen. Sometimes even playing a video game with someone can be more than enough to not feel alone. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,1695,"When life gets challenging, I like to think about how I'm not alone in my struggle and that I know I have the potential to do well if I put my mind to my work.  I also like to take a break and get back to it when something gets very challenging."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2226,"I do a lot of different things. Mostly I try to distract myself from whatever it is I'm dealing with. I do a lot of different things to distract myself. I listen to music, watch a movie, or watch a show. Sometimes, mostly before covid, I would go out with my family to refresh and distract myself. Also, some stuff I do is that I do breathing exercises, drum my fingers against a surface, or lay down for a bit to calm down. Another thing I do is that I try and work through things in my head so that I can see that my situation could be worse, that I have a lot to be glad about, that things will get better, that what is happening at the moment will pass, and that in the grand scheme of thing it won't matter as much as it feels like it matters."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2220,"When life gets challenging I try to not stress over the things I can't control and try to figure out what I can control. I try to take as many breaks as possible while still trying to do the things I need to get done. I take my mind off of things by doing things that help me relax such as painting, playing video games, or watching a movie. I also try to reach out to people that are close to me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2218,"When life gets challenging I break down. I completely frazzle myself and I get nothing done. I freak out about how much I have going on and end up making my situation worse. I run away from my problems because I don't want to deal with them. I should try and better myself on this because I am always going to have something challenging going on, but running away from it is not going to solve anything. I hate dealing with things and would much rather just never talk about it and move on. It has nothing to do with shutting everyone else out or cutting everyone off, I just prefer dealing with things on my own. Once you tell other people about what you're going through, they feel like their opinion mattes and you should listen to them. I feel like whatever way someone deals with their challenges is best for them, if it is a healthy way of working through it. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,1721,"When life gets challenging, I just try to remind myself that everything will be okay and everything works out in time. It really does help having a support group that I know will always have my back because it's an absolutely amazing feeling to know that people genuinely care about you. Especially when they truly understand what you're going through and just overall listen. I feel like having a small break helps in a sense to clear your mind and think about what is troubling you and figuring out ways to overcome can be very helpful and essential at times. Most of the times I try to work on myself to help my motivation and willingness to deal with whatever is troubling me because before I would have this tendency to ""run away"" from my problems and keep my emotions and feelings to myself because I felt like the problem itself shouldn't have bothered me to a great amount in the first place. So conditioning myself to stop doing that and actually work out a solution to whatever problem I'm dealing with and teach myself that my feelings are valid and deserve to be shared and heard has helped me astronomically.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2228,"for this assignment i would say when my life gets challenging i start with a mediating, because meditation makes me to think about the ways and solutions to solve my problem. if i couldn’t find a way for my problems i go to internet and i read articles about my problem and i see there are so many other people with the same problem that i have and i dont feel alone anymore and that really help me to manage my emotions to solve things. at the end if i couldn’t do anything i ask my family and friends to help me, but im really not good at asking people for help. i dont know why but i always want to help people, not to ask for help because i think people have more  problems than me and they dont have time to help me and i know this is wrong and i have to start asking people for help."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2216,"What do I do when life gets challenging?Simple. I tend to get stress and feel overwhelmed. I have been in a very stressful place for awhile now and it has made it challenging to focus in class and try to do hw correctly. It is difficult trying to excel in life when your personal life is just filled with various difficulties and nothing of a ray of sunshine can motivate you. What helps me when life is getting challenging is listen to music and write my emotions, in a notebook.  It helps pouring my emotions in a piece of paper and then just ripping it and throwing it away as a way of letting go of that negative energy. I also listen to music when I can't put my emotions into words I find a song that perfectly describes what I feel. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2215,"ooooo okay this is a tough question because I deal with anxiety on a daily basis since I was a teen/pre-teen and the root of those thoughts stem from how life can be so challenging. Within that its also creating more stresses for things that can seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things but to me and how my brain processes is it overworks. With that said when youve delt with something so long you begin to find ways to manage those things. Id like to say i take a step back and look at the problems that I can work towards fixing. the simple tasks that need to get done I can at least myself and my anxieties that I can fix those things first and then move on to the bigger more challenging things. Another way is just to create options for myself, a plan a,b,c,d,e,f.... the entire alphabet but its just a way of knowing for my own sake that if the first plan didnt work out for that problem then i can move onto plan b and so on.... thats the productive anxious person in me, but realistically i have days where i completely shut down and thats the more honest day to day type feeling for me. it just depends..."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2222,"When life gets challenging I go through three different steps. I first overthink, then I have an anxiety attack, and then I make a plan to get over it. However, I have been and I am still going through a lot of things currently. I have gotten a little more numb to the obstacles life gives. It sounds very negative, but it is not. I think life is very difficult and that is the point to some extent. Life really teaches someone to be selfless and just adjust. I am really bad with change, but I think you can not really enjoy life and its’ true beauty without change. So I guess to put it in simpler terms, when life gets tough I make myself tougher and I try to adjust to the best of my capability. I change my mind set and refuse to give up and let it take full control over me. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2232,I thank God for all the blessings he bestowed upon me. That he is guiding me every single day to spread his word and HEAL the WORLD. I try to stay focused on the goal intended and remember to enjoy the journey to the destination.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,1266,"When life gets challenging, I tend to stress myself a little bit. But something that I learned is to trust the process and try no to think about all the negative outcomes because it'll only make things worse. Staying positive has been my number 1 goal right now while also advocating about things that I can like on social media or speaking out when something happens in person. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2225,"When life gets challenging I feel that you should not give up. If you can cause a change that will make your and others lives better than I feel that you can cause a change to do that. I feel that if you give up, then you will remember that choice for the rest of your life. Especially if that challenge could have made your life better and could have made a significant difference.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,686,"When life gets challenging or when I'm too stressed out, the best way I relieve that stress is by crying or talking about it with someone. After crying to talking about my pent up stress, I destress by doing multiple things. Such as listening to my favorite songs/ artists to calm me down, watching funny videos on youtube or watching movies/ tv shows, and having a spa night where I put a face mask on and do my skincare routine. My favorite artists that I listen to are Ariana Grande, Khalid, BTS, Halsey, etc. Funny movies/ tv shows that I watch are Community, Grey's Anatomy, Mean Girls, etc. By doing all these things after a challenging day in my life, I feel more calm and ready to take on another day."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2231,"Honestly, when life gets challenging I try to say strong and handle the situation the best I can but I usually just end up stressing and overthinking which then results in me crying about it. Then I realize I need to just take a break of some sort. During the break, I'll listen to music or watch an episode of a show that I like. Just something to take my mind off the situation. After that I usually come back to the problem and try to figure it out."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2219,"When life gets really challenging, I sometimes tend to shut down for a bit. But, when I do shut down, I often use this time to also reflect on what I can do to overcome this challenge. I do not like really being down in the dumps worrying about it so I want to get past it as fast as I can. I will literally flip the switch and not be intimidated by the challenge. If one thing does not work, then I move on to the next. If I eventually cannot do it on my own, then I would seek help. It is okay to ask for help when you need it. But to be honest, it really depends on what kind of challenge it is. There is a huge difference in actions I will take in a personal challenge versus an academic challenge. But in the end, I always want to push forward and keep growing."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2221,"This question used to be something I used to never be able to answer. Coping was something that was tough to do for many years of my life. Personally, I find it really difficult to call someone and tell them that life is getting challenging or go to someone and tell them face to face. But now I can say that when life gets challenging, I like to write how I feel on pen and paper and share it with others that I know support me. I also like to take a step back and remind myself of why I am doing what I am doing, and how getting past the challenge will only put myself closer to my goal. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2224,"Personally, I have a tendency to hold everything inside. I get anxious and it get's to a point where if it's too much to handle, I just breakdown. I know it isn't the healthiest coping mechanism or strategy but it's something I do without realizing it. I also just tend to overwork myself. I try to make myself busy just to escape my thoughts so I don't find myself overthinking or stressing out. My last resort is honestly baking. HAHA. I bake to destress and I'll give it away to my family and friends. When the gyms were open indoors I would go workout but they're barely opening again so I've found other ways to cope with stress. Life has been stressful for the last year and now it's just normal to be stressed and I've mostly adapted. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2223,"When time gets challenging, which in this past year seems to be all the time, I try my best to control my thoughts and practice my breathing. When I'm stuck in a situation, I always think I'll feel better by finding a solution. So, I always think through my problems and find a silver lining and find ways to make it better. I also know talking to others is a good outlet and taking days off to rest the mind and body. I think it's okay to take a day off of school and work to just stay in bed and watch TV and eat food and just relax. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2229,"when life gets challenging, i tend to go to my friends for support. talking to them really eases me and calms my nerves. i also try to distract myself by watching funny videos and movies or listening to some good music. there are times where i just let myself feel the negative emotions i'm feeling as well. i've learned over time that bottling things up isn't good for me and that usually it'll lead to a mental breakdown in the end. i believe that your emotions and feelings are valid and that it's okay to just ride through them if need be. p.s: thank you for your acknowledgement of the recent asian hate crimes that have been happening recently! i feel like it's such an important topic to talk about, considering how many there have been since covid-19 hit us. being an asian american, it hurts to see people in my community being terrorized and hurt for no reason. my family is more afraid than ever to leave the house on their own in fear that they will be the next target. i really appreciate all your kind words and everything you had to say. <3"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2217,"What I do when life gets challenging, I beat myself up because I wish I always think of the things I could’ve done differently. But at the end of the day, I pick myself up and just move on. At the moment it might suck and whatnot, but I try to make that challenge temporary not permanent because it will destroy me if I keep that with me. But it as well just depends on the situation like there are some times where I want to run to my parents and just hearing them say that everything will be fine eases the challenges I face. But other than that I try to push and move on not only for me but to give an example to my little girl cousins because I’ve noticed that over every little thing they feel like the world is going to end and just give up and beat themselves up. So that’s what I pretty much do when life gets challenging. But after these, I'm ready for what is to come or somewhat prepared. Or maybe not even prepared for the future challenges I will face. But it will all be a learning lesson."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2212,When life gets challenging I usually try to take a break from reality because I tend to get overwhelmed and stressed so I just go on my phone and watch YouTube videos or TikToks. I also really like to listen to music when life gets hard. I feel like music is an escape for me and its a great way to get rid of my emotions. I usually try to distract myself by hanging out with my friends and doing something that takes my mind away from the problem. Then eventually I face the problem at hand and try to figure out how I can solve it. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2214,"When life gets challenging there are a few things I usually do. One of the first things I do is step away from social media because sometimes I find that I become more overwhelmed depending on the situation when I am constantly on it. Another thing that I do is make time to practice self care and try my best to relax a little, by watching movies or tv, listening to music, etc. so that I may later be able to face whatever issue or problem that I am having with a clear mind."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,1857,"In life, there are many problems and in order to lead a good life we have to learn how to tackle that problem and how to solve that problem. I have had my share of challenges weather it be small or big, but what I have learned from those challenges it that no challenge is too big because there is always a way out, a way to go through the challenges. When I am struggling with my homework or work, I just make sure to try my best and in case I couldn't do well, I would try again and again until I finally succeed. I have learned to not give and learn from the past mistakes, as our mistakes can be a big asset in our life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,2227,"Life for me lately has been challenging. The things that I have been doing include working out, sleeping, listening to music, watch Tiktoks or YouTube videos. Working out gives me a moment to work on my health and my self confidence. This pandemic has put a strain on my self esteem and how I view myself in comparison to other people. I also have been using sleep as a way to detach myself from reality and it allows me to get a break and rest. Listening to music allows to detach from reality, just like sleeping, and it gives me some peace. Lastly watching videos on TikTok and YouTube allows me to get a laugh in which is very much needed. Overall life has been more difficult this semester than others due to personal and academic factors but pushing through it and doing the best that I can is all I can do. Also I have so much to look forward to and being able to get this semester over with and start all over in a new semester is something that I am excited because this semester not good for me academically (so far). "
