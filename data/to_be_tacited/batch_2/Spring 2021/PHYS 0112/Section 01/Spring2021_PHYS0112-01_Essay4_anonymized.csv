2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2148,"I have a few resources that I feel support me. For starters whenever I feel that I am stressed out about something I just take a break or go for a walk around the block or a drive around the city just to get my mind off things. When it comes to physics I have my notes that I use to study and a couple of websites I stumble across whenever I see something that seems to help me out in any way possible. If that does not work I have a couple of friends who like physics and have taken the physics course before me, plus they are better at it than I am so I hit them up on my phone and let them know if they have any time to be able to help me out for a bit just so that I get a better understanding of what i is that I am doing."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1251,"“What resources do I have to support me?”	I have a variety of resources to support me throughout the semester. One of the resources I can rely on are my parents. They have always supported me in any way possible, especially in my education. I'm happy that I can ask them for help for anything at any time. Another resource I have are my friends. Having my close friends is really important since they understand the struggles and things I also go through whether it is in school or personal things. They have always been there when I needed them so I can rely on them. I've met my closest 2 friends back in highschool and currently one is also attending SF state which is really nice since I will be able to see her more often on campus hopefully if we go back in the fall. There are many other resources I can think of but one that will always be there to support my education is the resource center, and counseling at sf state and professors as well."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2135,"With what has happened in the family-- losing one of the coolest aunties to ever exist, connection cut because of stupid rumors in the family (and you’re just the messenger). Sometimes I want to take the ""Ate""* title and chuck it out the window. I was in a rush to heal. I just kept spacing and not wanting to do work. I thought I can emotionally recover on my own and to make this some Kanye loves Kanye type of journal.   But the little bros are adults now. I forget a lot of support and the confidence boost are from the LITTLE brothers since day one. I forget I have friends that can help me with schoolwork and only a text away- and what are the chances of becoming good friends with a coworker because we have the same organic chemistry teacher (and actually studies efficiently?). I have a good support system- I just have this toxic habit of over thinking and going after tasks that I know will drive me to the ground. But the life moves on, and this goober just needed to be reminded “beating yourself up is not gangster at all”.  Ew, emotions. (jk) * ""Ate"" means big sister in filipino culture and carries the traditions and values to teach her siblings AND cousins because cousins are considered your siblings too. jokingly called the ""other mother"". I love my family, I just like to talk crap haha"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2151,"Socially, I have resources like my girlfriend, friends, and family. Monetarily, I have a scholarship, the school has lots of resources I can use for housing/food/healthcare, etc. Overall, I am very fortunate to have access to so many resources. It is nice to know that if something happens to my current situation I will have some sort of support. In addition, I feel very lucky to have the resources our school offers. It seems like there aren't many schools who have faculty/administration that care so much. Currently, I am taking a course at a different college, while also taking some at SFSU. I have been comparing how they have handled the recent events over the last year, SFSU is constantly sending out update emails, emails to help us, reaching out, etc. Meanwhile, my other school just sent out an email last week, that we very short and confusing. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2146,"Fatima Santos PHYS 112April 13, 2021Going to school at SF State made me realize that I have various resources to help me succeed in life and in class. If I feel down or anything I know I can contact one of the counselors at State and they can help, having advisors really helps keep me on track in order to graduate on time and to take all the classes needed for my degree, and having SCI courses offered with science and math helps with the material in class. I also have my family and they support me no matter what and I think this is the most important resource of all is having a strong group of people just be there for you and support every decision you make. I do also have my pets and as crazy as it sounds they are also important through the emotional support they give me. Whenever I feel down I know that my pets will cuddle with me until I feel calm and happy once again and I know to cheer me up they’ll give me lots of kisses. I think my overall most important resource I have to support me is my mom and she knows that whenever and wherever I am she’ll support me no matter what."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2149,"The resources around me usually include some online friends as of lately. Because life has taken a few recent turns, I've had more people to talk to about what's happening with my schoolwork and other priorities. Lately in terms of my school work they have really helped become less stressed about it and focus on finishing what I have to do for this semester. But I can't lie, sometimes my schoolwork does get the best of me leaving me feeling like I'm barely getting through and not understanding the material sometimes. Some other resources that I have around me is my own space to focus and relax at the same time. Ever since the pandemic, I've gotten really accustomed to being in my room. Sometimes this worries me though, as I fear that I'm not properly socializing myself like I normally would. This includes making friends that I meet at school or even just having a face to face conversation."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2150,"Some of the resources that I aver to support me is the internet and professor's during class times. I often don't have enough time to actually go to study hours or office hours. I usually end up having to email all of my professors and hope to get back a reply in time. Otherwise, it really sucks. It hard to work full time and go to school full time but I manage it somehow. I was actually able to use a lot more campus offered resources before covid, so when were only able to do everything online. It became much harder to take advantage of study spaces and actually make time to be on campus all day for online lectures. Hopefully, when can get back to online lectures sometime soon. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2137,"Throughout my life, I've had many sources of support. But I would say my parents are my main source of support because they never stopped showing me their support. They've always helped me get what I need to keep the train moving. This is very important because it allows to minimize the stress. Some people may say that getting so much help from your parents could be bad because you don't learn how to be independent, but for me, I feel like it pushes me even more because I feel like I owe them so much. I work harder so that I can repay them someday when I can finally support myself and others. My parents aren't my only sources of support. I also get so much support from my friends who constantly push me to stay on track. We don't allow each other to fall behind. I feel like I have a debt to owe to all these people for all their loyalty and support. They are the reason why I'm still here."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2134,"My professors are my main resource because they are professionals in their fields. When I have difficulty with the material I look up videos or sample problems that could help me. If I still have trouble, I email my professors or attend their office hours. Sometimes it can be intimidating asking a question in front of the class but having access to one on one help is very useful. Looking up videos and examples help me to see how certain formulas were used or how they were rearranged to find what they needed. I can walk through my own problem and approach it the way that they did using the formulas. Having study groups or peers to work with is also supportive when I can’t attend office hours, have a quick question, or need clarification. I think that one positive thing about virtual learning is that it is a lot easier to attend office hours or ask for help. I don’t live in SF and sometimes I am not on campus the days my professor has office hours. However virtually I can attend any day or take my break at work to log on and ask the questions I have."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2144,The resources I have to support me are the online tutoring place or having the internet to try and help me. I could also go to office hours to receive help from not only the lab instructor but my teacher also. I can always try to get help from the group chats that the physics class has started since everyone seems to be helpful in there. My peers seem to be a good place to go to especially if I am needing help. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,681,"Come to think of it, I do have quite a few resources to support me. I have the internet at my disposal which is arguably one of the most valuable tools out there. I'm also privileged to have a computer and a phone that can access the internet. I'm blessed to have supportive parents that provide me with the funds to go attend university and put a roof over my head. I also have a ton of resources provided to me by the university that I could take advantage of at any point in time. I would also say that the professors are a resource that we can use to help guide us through whatever class it may be. I think that sometimes people take for granted what they have right in front of them that a lot of the population doesn't have. It's important that we take a few steps back to reflect on the resources that are available to us to realize how good we have it in life.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1593,"What sources do I have to support me? I have my family, friends, and boyfriend that support me. Even though they aren't really good on showing affection and showing emotions, they show their support by asking about my classes, school and friends from school. They cannot wait for me to become a doctor, and I am trying my best not to disappoint them. When my imposter syndrome comes up, I find myself second guessing myself and thinking that I am not good enough. Some resources that have helped with my imposter syndrome, and those are books, podcasts and running. I use to run last summer but because I live in the Central Valley and the sun is literally dangerous, running has been such a drag. Watching Naruto also helps calm down a lot of my anxiety and self sabotage. I also paint for fun. By the end of this summer, I hope to have painted mini canvases of all the characters from Naruto and other anime that I watch. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2152,"I alway have my mom and my dad. If i ever have car trouble or problems they encourage me to call them no matter the time. We argue like freaking politicians, but I can tell that they love me like I am their whole world. When i moved to college my parents kept my room untouched for a whole year because they were really hoping i would visit or change my mind and want to go to a school out here in southern california. I would send them photos of the lab coats I had to wear and my route to school from my new home, and they would be so happy for me. I draw too, it's my minor, and since I was young my parents always encouraged me  to continue drawing because they genuinely enjoyed my work. My friends were there for me at times my parents weren't. Like when I came out to them I felt isolated for a few months in my own home. But regardless my friends gave me endless support, they gave me useful websites and tips. Sometimes when i struggle with math or chemistry I hit up my friends in Ucla and they are more than happy to explain to me the concept and walking me through on how to solve each step (when they have some free time of course )"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2141,"To me, this question has multiple potential answers. For studying, I have different resources to work on the assignments, projects, researches, and so on. I usually go on Youtube to watch tutorials for solving problems and further explanations. I am a visual learner so I can study quite quickly from those videos on youtube. One of my favorite channels is The Organic Chemistry, the instructor makes Math and Science more clear somehow though there has never been his face reveal. Thanks to his channel, I passed Calculus 2 last summer. The other way to make learning better that I have found helpful to make friends in class and do study groups. But it also depends, I can’t get to know new people easily all the time. For my mental health, crying and sleeping support me, I would say. Also, I do video calls with my family and best friends to chat and they give me positive energy and motivation. For my physical health, I am the only one who can do the most support by going to the gym and giving nutrient fuels to my body. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2147,"There are a lot of resources that are at my disposal. I have friends who have taken the course and who are willing to help me succeed when I do not understand how to do a certain problem. I have friends now in this course who I can go to and ask for help when the times are tough. Another resource is the walker textbook, the book has all the perfect ways that the equations in any problem are supposed to be used. The biggest resource that I have is the internet. The internet is the ultimate resource. This is because the internet is just flowing with information, there is so much I can look up on the subject of physics. I can look at youtube for videos on how to solve a certain problem or go to old videos on past lessons for the ways to solve the answers. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2142,"One of the resources that I know that I have for sure that can support me is my professors. I know that I can just email them and ask them for help if if is needed. They have told their students that if help is needed on anything, we can just contact them. Whether is it a academic problem or a somewhat of a personal problem. Another resource that I have that can support me is my classmates / class group chat, if there's a simple question about class, the classmates in the group chat can help answer for you so you do not need to write an email to your professor and have to wait for a response. When knowing that all things can not really go well, I can always ask my parents on what to do next or just reach out to a school staff member which is available on the school website. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2153,"Most of the resources I have been using to understand the material better come from the internet such as more videos to understand every topic and examples. Also, the simulations provided in this lab class were such a great help because I feel like without them we would not have been able to understand the labs or it would just have been more difficult to grasp the concepts. I also signed up for the physics Sci class and that really helped along the way with every topic we discussed in lecture so that was extra help. Not even a scholarly support but more of a family support since sometimes I felt like it was too much to handle since I am taking 19 units this semester and so I had my family to lift me up when I needed it the most as well as my friends who I know I can count on to cheer me up. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2132,"Honestly, I feel very lucky when it comes to my resources that support me. I have an amazing wife that absolutely always pushes me to be the best version of myself. She is my confidant, my rock, and most importantly someone who doesn't shy away from telling me when I am dead wrong. She is someone I can always turn to when I am at my lowest. She is also going through school right alongside me, and so we kind of build knowledge of each other as well, always adding to the wealth of knowledge we are gathering. I would not have gotten past calculus I without her, and she is helping me learn calc II better than my professor is teaching me. Perhaps she should receive part of my tuition?Another resource I can turn to is my friends. I am very blessed to have a few really good friends. (quality over quantity) I am in my mid 30's now and so I have just, over the years, trimmed the fat, and have a very close-knit group of friends I consider family. They are there for me whenever I need them and help me get through life. They help me vent about school and let me talk through my ideas which let me fine-tune my thinking. They add very useful feedback based on their own life challenges and help me grow on my understanding of certain materials. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2139,"Ilearn always has all the slides and homework that I can review when I need. I can always look back on the homework assignments that I have already done. If I need help with a math concept or something like that I can always find a youtube video that helps me out. Of course, I can email my professor or go to office hours."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2140,"The best thing about a university is the library. Because the university has plenty of time and freedom, most students are self-study, and the collection of books in the library is very helpful for self-study. If you want to solve learning difficulties, you can read related professional books. If you want to increase your cultural accomplishment, you can read prose and novels. In short, the knowledge in the library is worth your time to read.The laboratory is a good place for students to turn book knowledge into hands-on ability. After all, it is better to operate on paper. Skilled operation of the machine will make you attract the attention of the company when you work in the future."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1409,"The resources I have to support me academically currently, are the teachers themselves. I took it upon myself to take on many units which have been overwhelming in homework assignments. Despite of the workload, my teachers have been comprehensive in allowing me to turn in work which allows me to really dive into the assignments and do my best job to assess, learn, and complete the assignment. This really does help students because sometimes we are defined by our means of turning things in, instead of what we learned, and it does not reflect what we actually know and discovered. The teacher can also guide you to resources you were not familiar with if you have a situation at home. Thank God I have the support of my teachers this semester do to better for myself and thank God for being my support in everything."
