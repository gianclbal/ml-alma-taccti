2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2142,"So far, the values that I have obtained over the years have helped me a lot through college because it allowed me to make relatively good choices. Those values also helped me through school work too. Some of the school work required more than just knowledge learned from class but also require you to use personal experience to help you answer those questions. Knowing what I like and dislikes can help me determine which classes to take and if this get too stress, I should take time off and enjoy myself for a little bit. The values I have allows me to make judgments based on what is right for me and what I enjoy doing. One of my values are my family, if I am struggling with something, I know that they are there to support my back when I needed it. the values i have will also determine and change my future path in college."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2153,"I grew in Guatemala so a lot of the values I carry with me come from old style family members. Discipline, respect, and humility have helped me a lot during my journey through college. To have responsibility is another one I truly appreciate and it comes from my grandpa who always told me that I need to finish things that I start and always stick to my goals in life because the life of a man is difficult in this world. To take care of myself when needed and take a break when necessary. That sometimes life can feel too much but always know that everything will be okay and that it is okay if it is not. To move past things in life means change and change is good when it benefits me and my community as well as the people out of it. To not be selfish and to care and treat others with respect because at the end of the day I should treat people how I want to be truly treated, with dignity and in humane ways. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2141,"On both sides of my parents, I am the only person studying abroad in the US who has become a huge pride to my family. To get accepted to a university in America, was such a challenge to me, also my parents because there were plentiful processes of paperwork and documents to be done. Born and raised in Vietnam, and I’m always proud to tell people where I originally come from. I’m lucky that my parents have had guided me to modern education by sending me to bilingual schools since I was a little kid so that I could approach the English language as soon as possible. Although I’m currently living and studying in the US, I always miss my family, authentic Vietnamese food back home. Many people seem very surprised when they know my origin then compliment my English speaking skills, thanks to my parents for investing in me at their best. No matter where I go later, I will never forget my roots."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2152,"Moving back in with my parents has been very difficult, since covid I ended a three year relationship, I had to move back in with my parents, buy my own laptop and work the same job as a teenager. All this set me back but only mentally, I didn't feel comfortable anymore but I continued with school because I don't know how else I would have kept busy. My family helped me because we all go to this place called ""New"" they help first generation families apply for college and financial aid . If it wasn't for my parents and family  having very little education I don't think I would push myself. I am the first family member in the united states to attend a university , and though this isn't San Francisco University I am so proud of myself. My child self would burst into tears from proudness to know that I tried hard in highschool and it was me who the opportunity no one else was given in my family. I know I failed physics this semester and It's my first time failing, it scares me but i know it will ready me for the future, when thing get extremely pressured don't crack but rather bend with it"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1251,"The values of my family has helped me navigate through college by the hard work we put in to get to where we want to be in life. My family has always helped me out through all my years in school since kinder all the way until college. They have always supported me in my decisions and what I want to pursue. They have taught me many things throughout the years that in order to achieve what you want you need to put in the effort and hard work. College is an important step in pursuing my career and my family has given me the opportunity to attend college in the career I want and I'm thankful for that, without them I wouldn't be in college. They taught me that hard work pays off at the end and if I work hard enough I will see the difference in what I can make for a living with a career and how my life can change."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2146,"Fatima Santos PHYS 112May 4, 2021My family has always been there for me and they have really helped me navigate through college with their advice. My family is usually very outgoing and isn’t afraid to speak their mind or to ask for help. When I was at my lowest point earlier this semester, they were there for me and made sure I didn’t give up or break down. My mom and sister in particular have been there for me 24/7 no matter what they have always made sure I am okay and remind me that I am not alone. They remind me that family is always there no matter what obstacle I have to face, I am never alone dealing with anything. They have definitely helped me come out of my comfort zone and ask for help when I need it and they have taught me to be very outgoing and meet new people and make friends, whether it’s through a screen or in person. This has definitely helped me during break-out rooms in most of my classes as I am usually the one to start the conversations in order for others not to feel shy. Overall, I have to thank my family and the values they’ve taught me for helping me throughout my college journey so far."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2133,"My family's value of hard work has guided me through college. I can say the same for my community. I think the Latinx community is very hardworking, for example, my parents, aunts, and uncles. I see how much they have sacrificed for their families and how hard they have worked to get everything they own. It always blows my mind that many Latinx families moved to America without anything and more often than not could barely speak English. But I look around at the community I see people who own houses, run their own businesses, and more. All these may seem like small things but to them, it's a great accomplishment. Because most likely they came to this country with nothing and were able to achieve great things through hard work and dedication. Therefore stories like this have motivated me to work hard and achieve even bigger goals through education. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1409,"Being a Latina, culture is the values your parent gives you and the shared ideology within the family. My mother came from poverty and a time when, the girls in her ranch, did not go to school but stayed home to take care of the brother and sisters. My mother would go to school in secrecy. If her mother found out, she would be punished. These were the stories my mother would share of her tough childhood. If her objective was to teach gratitude and hard work, it was through the comparison of different generations and challenges of the past. My small family of one parent was the main source that helped me navigate to where I am. If my situation were more different, maybe I would have started earlier. If I had a stronger community maybe that would have given me a better experience. I never knew how much a college could help their students until I came to SFSU. I do not just feel like a paycheck, but I do honestly feel all the teachers care about their students and want them to succeed. It is different for me and scary at the same time. To asks for help and be helped is different. I do not know if it all the hard work I am putting into things, but I could not have done it without the teachers that are helping me and my mother for supporting my journey."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2144,The values of my family have helped me navigate through college because I am a first-generation going to college. Having this opportunity makes me not give up school for granted especially since I am graduating debt-free. Having this privilege helps me want to work harder and do the best I can do for my mom. My family values a lot of hard work and trying to always work better to have a better life. So that is very much instilled into me and I always want to make sure I am giving my full effort into something even though it doesn't benefit me at the moment. One of my older cousins is a prime example of living the American Dream since she is also an immigrant who came here by boat but is now living a successful life because she worked hard in school to get her to where she is now.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1504,"My family is a big part of why I chose to go to college especially SFSU. I originally wanted to leave California and move to the east coast after high school, but my parents have a bunch of health issues so I moved somewhere that was the same distance between them. I think I wouldn’t have joined the BSU without them either because both my parents were in BSU when they went to college and said it was helpful to them and I agree. My major is nothing like anyone in my family, everyone is a lawyer/cop or works with children and I always wanted to be in the medical field. So I am going to school for Physiology and no one in my family even remembers science. My parents remember that they want me to go to grad school though. Everyone is supportive of my career choice, they just can’t wait to see me succeed."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2143,"My family, specific my parent, are my main motor through my college pathway. They teach me since early age that everything great in life comes to you if you work hard. I can tell that they are my N1 fans even when I doubt myself. They are right by my side to make my realize that I can do it. I think is unvalued the motivation provided from the people next to you. Even when I took the decision to move out my native country and start an adventure in a new country one. They stay by my side on the distance. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2147,"The values of what my family has instilled in me have really helped me in my academic career. The main value is that hard work always outweighs talent. In anything I do as long as I am putting out the best, that I can do in that field I know I will come out on top with the results that I want. This has made me who I am and I really try and pursue anything that I want in life. Most of the time I try to keep myself motivated so that I can keep up the multitudes of work that I have to complete. This helps me stay focused and have a clear and straight mind on the main things that are ahead of me. My family has always been supportive and we are all supportive of each other and are not afraid to take criticism which is another value because critiscism is not bad it is just another tool to help out in life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2150,"I would like to think that my family and community has helped me navigate through college because of positive reasons. But sometimes, I feel like people are also just like college is a necessity, so for me, by not doing college it was almost taboo. Although, a lot of the time I feel like I am still here because I have already put so much time into college. That it's pointless to drop out. I am also a Junior, so I think I am just about reaching burnout. Personally, I do value education, but I don't value how expensive it all is. i know it the long run I will be proud of myself and hopefully picking up my career at some point and time, but right now I don't really feel a lot of that. Doing all of this online learning hasn't been helping much either. Most of the time I feel like there is no straight forward sense of direction online and everyone's schedules are everywhere so it's hard to find the time for office hours. Hopefully, I will pass all of my classes. Especially, physics with a C, I have been trying really hard in that lecture. I just want to leave this semester behind, pass the classes and move onto my next ones. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2134,"The values of my community and family have helped me navigate through college by showing me the hard work that I need to put in, in order to get what I want. I’ve been taught that nothing comes easy and that you can’t just expect things to be done for you. This value has helped in college by knowing that I need to make time to go to class, ask questions, attend office hours, make time for studying and homework, and be willing to put in effort. I can’t expect to get a good grade just by showing up to class, I need to put in the work and ask for help from my peers and professors when I need it. It’s been a lot harder over the past year to stay motivated and keep working towards my educational goals. Remembering that I am almost done and have put in so much effort already helps to find new motivation in order to keep working hard. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,681,"I come from a family where all of my older siblings have received a college education from UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz and Pepperdine University. Not to mention, both my parents that have college degrees under their belt as well from UC San Francisco and UC Santa Cruz. I think it is safe to say that my family values education. Now the torch is sort of passed to my younger brothers and myself to finish our college education. The area that I come from, that being Aptos, California, produces many college graduates and the high school that I attended was fairly competitive. You could say that growing up in a community where going to college was the norm influenced my goals quite a bit. In my family and in the community I was raised in, going to college was a given, no question. Being an athlete, I have this competitive spirit to want to achieve what others in my family and in the community have achieved, this has motivated me on my journey so far. Long story short, being raised in an educated community and by an educated family, and having this internal drive to succeed has helped me navigate through college."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2135,"My values are Family and wisdom. I love hanging out with my family because you can just be yourself, and the wisdom from my elders reminds me we are all human at the end of the day. One day, I too will become an elder and hope to  pass the same wisdom down along with an archive of the hand written notes I made from my college years. Simply put, my values are family and appreciating education. My values are always “merit over pedigree”. Thankfully, my mom didn't force me to be a nurse or join the military like some of my auntie and uncles. My parents could only finish highschool when they moved from Philippines. Of course my dad came from a wealthy family (kind of spoiled in my opinion) and my mom came from a family with 13 siblings with not much but a goat farm and cute little restaurant made from their garage. I take pride in hard work because of the stories from my grandparents-- but realistically you will only work hard if you love something. Am I right? “Heart work is Hard work”"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2139,"My family really help me a lot through college. Most importantly, my sister goes to the same school, so she helps me keep up-to-date whenever I need to do something like register for classes or pay my tuition. Counselors aren't very helpful when it comes to stuff like that so she helps a lot. It is very confusing to navigate college and their websites because none of them are easy to use, but the friends that I've made in college have helped me do that. Other than that, no one else really helps me do anything, other than maybe one or two study groups for various classes. It is really tough to go through college without any help, especially since there really isn't anyone who helps you navigate through college who actually works for the school. I kind of just do whatever the school emails me and tells me to do. It's hard, but I'll get by just fine. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2132,"My family values have always been built on the belief that is hard work. My dad used to preach that not everyone is built the same, some people are taller, shorter stronger weaker etc. but the one thing we can all control is the amount of work we put into our craft. That is a person who works hardest or smartest can often times beat the person who is just simply born talented. Take me for example, I am a short 5'4 dude, and when I was in the Army, I hung with the tallest toughest guys around, and in some cases I out-ranked them because I was willing to put the work in. I carry this mentality in college. Some materials and classes might be tough (cough cough calculus) but I know if I keep putting the work in when I study, do homework, office hours, eventually, I will find a way to pass it. (Although calculus single-handedly almost ruined my process) I think J.F.K once said something like this, ""we do things not because they are easy but because they are hard"", and then we landed on the moon. Anything is possible with hard work. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2149,"The values of my family have helped me through college because they have always kept me focused on what my end goal is no matter how hard what I might be doing might be. This also inspires me not to give up and keep working as hard a I can with as much as I can understand about my field of interest. In my life, my family has been through some pretty turbulent times when it comes to finances. Part of this has taught me that I never want to have to deal with anything like that for my future and neither does my family. As a child we lived in many neighborhoods, particularly in San Francisco, that made us wonder why life was the way it was presented to us. After finally being able to be financially stress free, everyone's attitudes changed and it was the greatest opportunity to reach my goals I'd ever had."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2140,"A good value of family can also use its social capital to promote my development. A cohesive social network of individuals with a good family education can socialize students in the hope that they will also achieve high levels of academic achievement. It can also spread cultural capital by educating children about specific behaviors, speech methods, and cultural references recognized by educated and professional elites."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2151,"I guess the only values that I can think of are to work hard and try to be the best at whatever you're doing. I can't really think of anything else, I think they have a lot of values that I don't agree with and I am constantly having to go through my now young adult life facing situations which are causing me to create my own values, question my values, etc. I think a good example of this is trying to figure out where I stand on taking classes and work load etc. My parents would have been like nothing matters except going to school making money, and taking your classes as fast and as. many as you can. Enjoyment, relaxation, and pleasure was never valued, so something I have had to learn is to not overwork yourself and actually enjoy the classes you're taking. I think this also applies in life, the only definite finish point is dying, so there's really no reason to rush through everything. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2137,"my family has always said that school is very important. I should always make an effort to making my life better an easier. My father was the first person to graduate from a university. Since I was young, he made it clear to me and my siblings that we must go to school and make it to college. I can't speak for my siblings, but for me, knowing that my dad would be disappointed if I didnt complete college has always lingered in the back of my mind. This has caused me to feel pressure and has motivated me to complete skill. "
