2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2148,"My goal at least for this class is to have a basic understanding of how physics works out in the real world because after learning a few concepts of physics I began to see things differently. What I mean by that is every time I do something such as throw a ball, drive a car, or see a car in motion, or just go out for a walk. There's a lot of things that go on in my head when doing those things. For example, when I throw a ball, it is not as simple as just throwing a ball and hoping for it to go where you want it to go. From what I learned, it is much more than that, when I throw a ball there are a lot of things that go into it. Things like how much force do I need to throw the ball, what angle I need to throw the ball for it to land where I want it to, is there any drag from the wind, if I am throwing the ball to someone are they running at a constant velocity or are they standing still, etc. These are the sort of things that I have been thinking about ever since taking physics."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1251,"Reflective Journaling #2     My goal is to major in Biology with a concentration in Physiology. With this my other goal is to apply for Med-school and work in the field of Pediatrics. My goal this semester is to pass my classes not only physics but all my classes so that I can keep being on track with my graduation, and plan to graduate in about 2-3 more years depending on my requirements and grades. Taking this class not only will it help me succeed more in the science field but also help me improve and love the field of science more. The science field is really interesting and fascinating for me because I get to learn more about the world, environment, learn about new discoveries in science and who we are and what we can bring to the world as scientists.  Another path I would also consider as my goal if i wouldn't go to Med-school would be doing research working in the field of Marine Biology and discovering new things beneath our ocean that haven't yet been discovered."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2150,"My goals are to pass physics with a good mental understanding of what physics is. I am also challenging myself by not doing credit no credit. I want to really challenge myself, because I have never really liked physics. I have always found it pointless in consideration of my career goals. I want to become a doctor, so being in something that has nothing to do with physics really gets to me. I am here because it's what I need for my degree. It's only interesting when I really understand it. With that being said, the lecture part of this course doesn't really do anything for me. I learn a lot more in this lab portion. To add on, being in this lab really allows me to achieve my goal of a bachelors in science. I often have a difficulty of understanding the questions in my physics lecture because everything is online. Online physics is really hard and I hate Pearson. What I am taught in the lecture vs. what is taught in the textbook is like black and white. I really hate that. There is no middle ground. I wish that my lecture teacher would just make worksheets for us to do and submit pdfs, instead of a online hw site telling me I am wrong with no feedback. It is really unfortunate that the site doesn't help students at all. I realy just hate online Physics, it's not beneficial or an enriched learning environment. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2141,"Goals? To be honest, I have got several goals that I wish I could accomplish as soon as possible. One of my biggest goals is to get graduated from SFSU and then apply for a dental school in the next few years. As far as I have entered college, I got tons of mixed feelings such as exciting, exhausting, overwhelming, etc. I am aware that in order to get a university degree, the journey can not always be that easy. Physics is one of the prerequisites that I have to take to fulfill the GE requirement. The physics lab class is included in the course with the lecture for full credits. If I pass both lecture and lab classes, I will get one step closer to get the credits that benefit my GPA for my future diploma. I prefer having lab class in person, with more human interaction since I do not really understand much only through doing online school. I can’t wait till we all can be back to in-person classes."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2142,My goals for this class is just basically passing it with a relatively good grade. My major required this class so this is why i am taking this class. One of my long terms goals is to graduate college on time and make sure that I finish all my classes on time. This class is helping me achieve these goals by giving me a better understanding of what I am currently learning about or what I am going to learn in a little bit in my physics class. I have never taken physics in my high school career and I am not really a fan of physics because I think that it is hard so this class just provides me with extra support to the topics I am learning. This class is also allowing me to put what I have learn in class to actual situations that might occur in my daily life.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2147,My goals are to become more proactive in doing assignments rather than doing them last minute. This class is helping me because I have to do the labs before Friday rather than the night before. I also want to further my understanding of physics and see the real-life applications that physics has for me. With last week's lab it helped in that I was able to calculate velocity over a certain time given position and time. In my life that can be really useful when I am going on runs and trying to compare my times on certain parts of the course compared to previous attempts. This all becomes useful so that I can see if I am running faster or not and hopefully see a trend line going up that I am. This class is also helping me interpret data so that when I see tables outside of this class I will be able to see data given to me and be able to read the information and come to a conclusion that is accurate. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2151,"My goal is to become a doctor and earn my PhD in Biology. Physics is just a prerequisite to get my bachelors in biology, but I think understanding it will defiantly benefit me in understanding how organisms/objects move and such. I also think it is important to my goals that I take this class because then I won't have tunnel vision about sciences, I will be able to not only understand biology but also have a general understanding of physics. I think this class also fulfills my goals of challenging myself because it already seems to be somewhat difficult, and I like doing things that make me think. I also think physics is really interesting and I have a lot of questions that will only be answered through having knowledge of physics, so maybe after I take Phys111 and Phys121 Ill find it so interesting that I could add it as a minor or even change my major. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2132,"My goal is to graduate from SF with a bachelor's in Biochemistry and get into the biotech industry I hope to join a research team along the way.   I know physics is part of my road map to graduation thus I need to take the class/lab, but I hope that I carry things I learn from my physics onwards with me to my other classes. A lot of the formulas and concepts we talk about relate to things in chemistry. Physics will further help me understand the world around me, and how/why things work the way they do. If I can better grasp those things, then maybe I can apply those understandings to biology or chemistry that will spring up new ideas and understandings of the world around us. I remember someone teaching me one time that, “being smart isn’t just surpassing in one subject, rather, it’s a combination of life knowledge.”   Taking all these physics is just another piece in order to achieve my goal."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2133,"For a long time, my goal was to get into nursing school. When I didn't get into the program I decided to get my BS in Biology and figure it out from there. I guess my new goal is to do as well as possible in undergrad and get a great GPA. In community college, my GPA wasn't the best. Actually one of the classes that brought my GPA down was physics. So taking it now is like a second chance and I want to get an A. I feel like I understand the material much better, and I know how to study for a class like this. Honestly the first time I took physics I didn't understand that practice problem are super important. I thought I could learn it all in the lecture. And I thought I was learning everything but when it came to a test I really didn't know anything. Now when I am reading the textbook I do the practice problems in the book to really solidify what I read and put it into practice. It really helps because then in a lecture I understand better and then I can do the homework and the questions are similar to book problems. So I can always go back and see examples. I guess my new goal is to get graduate within the next 2 years with a great GPA, and then hopefully apply to a master's in nursing program or medical school. I like to keep my options open. My goal is to work as hard as possible in school. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1593,"What are my goals?To be honest with myself, my goals for this new year are to take better care of myself and my mental health. I feel as if I have burned myself out completely with school and have honestly lost all motivation to finish because of COVID-19. But I believe in myself enough to realize my worth and know that I can finish school, if I just take care of myself first. I have never really taken my mental health all that seriously until coronavirus hit the United States last year. I saw how big of toll this disease took on people’s lives. Besides taking care of myself and my mental health, another one of my goals this year is to be more healthy with my meals and body, lose a little weight and of course, finish school with the best grades I could possibly achieve this year. I think that physics is hard and really confusing sometimes but I can do it. I hope to see whether or not this is something I end up actually doing. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1409,"What are my goals?Pass this classComplete this semester successfullyGet a part-time/ jobPay debtThis class is going to help me achieve my first goal. Because I have taken this course already and need to cross it out of my list. This course ties into my second goal, which is to complete this semester successfully. In order for me to accomplish my second goal, I need to pass this course. My other two goals do not have an associate with my first two goals and it has to do with my economic life and the pandemic situation. I suppose another one I should goal I should mention is being able to accomplish all of my goals during this semester, will probably not happen but the first two are in my control."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2153,"I have always had a curiosity for the Earth and how it all worked be it its systems, climate, and nature. That is why I am majoring in Earth Sciences with an emphasis in oceans, weather, and climate. My goal is to be able to graduate and hopefully do research on the reconstruction of past climate to understand our future climate, as well as taking into account the changes that are happening now due to the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere. After getting a job, I also would like to get my masters degree since I will need it to be able to do, hopefully, research on my own and because it will bring me more opportunities in the job field. I am also open to other job opportunities that have to do with the Earth and nature. This class will help me with critical thinking skills, how certain things in real life work, and to problem solve when faced with a bump on the road. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2140,"My goal is help athlete become stronger, faster, smarter. In order to do that, I need physics knowlege to back me up. When it comes to what we do in training, force is the weight of an object and the velocity and the rate at which it is moved. Both force and velocity are of equal importance when it comes to training. In the equation for power, force and velocity have an inverse relationship, meaning as load (force) goes up, velocity goes down, and vice versa. Our goal in training is to train where both force and velocity are optimized, or in other words, make our athletes more powerful."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,681,"Short term goals of mine would include getting through the semester with solid grades. If we're talking long term it would be to finish my bachelors in biology here at San Francisco State. In order to obtain that goal I must get through these two semesters of physics starting with this one. That is one way that this class is helping me achieve my goals. Later down the line I mean who knows, I might just need physics for a future graduate school class or something of the sort and by taking this class it will have prepared me for that moment to come. That is another way this class will help me achieve my goals. So as it stands right now, my purpose is to learn physics the best I can in order to make my long term goals a reality. I suppose another goal of mine would be to learn as much as I can throughout my life, and even if physics isn't my favorite subject learning general physics would fulfill that goal of wanting to collect all this knowledge."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2139,"My main goal is to graduate from college with a degree in biochemistry, and in order to do that, I need to pass this class. I have had bad experiences with physics classes in the past and haven't learned much from them, but I want to change that. In this class, I want to finish all of my lab assignments on time and have them all be accurate. In the physics lecture class, I want to finish all work and homework on time so I don't have to worry about it as much. I mostly just would like to remove the stress from this class and hope to do that by paying more and more attention every day and trying to really fully understand the material instead of just submitting assignments. I am also taking another semester of physics in the summer, so this class will help me be prepared for that so I don't enter that class with no basic knowledge of physics."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2144,My goal this semester is to be able to keep up on all my work.  This class is helping me achieve these goals because I am behind in physics right now so I am playing the catch-up game.  The catch-up game is making me want to be able to finish everything since I am want to be able to be caught up with all of my work.  I feel right now that I am not understanding physics as well as I thought I did so it is pretty discouraging when I am trying to get my work done.  I just feel like since I am not caught up in this class I can keep putting it off to procrastinate but I am afraid that I am going to keep putting it off and be really behind.  So this class right now is helping me with the goal of trying to get everything done and try to understand the labs that are also being done.  
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2137,"My goals is to learn how to do things on my computer. I want to work on my computer skills and work with things I hardly ever use. I feel like this could really benefit me for the future. What I like so far is that I've been working on my lab on my computer. Before this class, I never had to download the worksheets and fill them out on my computer. It may be very little but I think I can use these skills in the future. We have also been using some simulators which I think is very useful because it helps explain the concept very well. You can see how things work in different scenarios and whats even better is that I can revisit this online simulator outside of class. I've already used it to help me understand acceleration vs time graphs. This way of learning has helped me understand concepts better than in person."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2146,"Fatima Santos PHYS 112February 16, 2021My goals in life are to graduate and keep my studies going in order to become a successful Veterinarian. This has always been a dream of mine for as long as I could remember. As a kid, I was always very into animals, and learning about them fascinated me a lot. I would spend a lot of my time with my dad watching the discovery channel episodes on different reptiles or wildlife and just remember realizing I really wanted to become a Veterinarian. I used to enjoy going to zoos as a kid to look at the animal and touch some of them, now I don’t support zoo’s I do think it’s horrible to keep animals trapped in a cage to please an audience. This class is helping me achieve my goal because through taking this class I am one step closer to my dream job. Taking physics is hard honestly but I know after taking this class it will all be worth it and I will be able to help all types of animals. Once I become a veterinarian, I want to be able to help all animals whether they are dogs, horses, lizards, etc. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2143,"My medium-term goal is getting my kinesiology bachelor. Moreover, one of the class requirement is Physic 111 / 112, so my short-term goal is pass with an A grade for physic class. Physic is helping me to achieve my goal because I am covering my requirement. Along the way I am learning interesting topics. for example, one of the mastering physics prerequisite course was linear and angular velocity. The basic concepts stay in my brain and for my surprise last week in Anatomical Kinesiology one of the topic was linear and angular movements. My previous knowledge in physic linear and angular velocity helps me to understand faster and easy the new knowledge. There are important concepts in physic that apply for the everyday life. We will ever underestimate the impact new knowledge can have over you. The history shows how everything is connected and how much we have no discovered yet."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2136,"My ultimate goal is to be able to graduate from san Francisco state with my bachelor's in biology. However, due to a good amount of lack of motivation, my goal now is to get through this semester. To be completely honest, the classes that actually have a set time to meet on a zoom call are what is keeping me together. Being able to learn at the same time with the professor in front of me makes a much bigger impact than asynchronous courses. Not to mention, this class accepting late work is a huge bonus since I’m very overwhelmed with my life at the moment. I also enjoy that Vernon is kind and not patronizing when explaining new topics or clearing up some information. Overall, I think this class has made a good environment for me to learn in and it makes me feel hopeful for my ultimate goals."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2135,"The field I am trying to get into involves a lot of critical and analytical thinking. To be a better thinker is to keep practicing, and that means doing your homework and actually sitting down and quizzing yourself to see what you have mastered. Memorizing everything you've learned is nearly impossible but the goal is to try and understand the subject and connect it to other subjects. This class is helping me by having group mates that actually help each other during the lab. Also, with Vernon being very generous about deadlines, I am able to ground myself again. 12 units and working two jobs was a terrible idea.  In the long run, physics is not useless (as much as I shake my fist in the air on the subject)- physics is the most basic science which explains objects and their motion. Without it, how do we understand the motion of atoms which lead to the present of technology and medicine?"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2149,"I understand that on a larger scale, my goals in this class are placed there to bring me to greater things, new opportunities, and especially a greater understand of the infinite universe that lies ahead of me. Some of these goals include cliche things that anyone might say in order to keep their grades up such as staying up to date on assignments, preparing for exams, and making sure not to skip any days of class. And these goals I will definitely try to keep up but I’d like to ensure myself that I have a purpose here before just placing blind effort into my work. Some of my other goals include stay interested in the class and excited about learning a huge unseen part of the mechanics of the things around me. Checking my work and constantly engaging with my group members and the lab will remind me of the work that needs to be done."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2134,"A goal of mine is to be better at time management in order to be able to be more efficient and use my time wisely. I don’t think that I procrastinate too much but I find myself starting to do work and then stopping because there is a lot of work to get done or I don’t know how to do it. I want to be able to understand the material and get things done quicker in order to have more time to do things I enjoy. This class is helping me achieve this by having flexible deadlines with the labs. Last week's lab was a little difficult for me, and I’m still working on it but having a flexible deadline helps me take my time to really understand the material. I’m trying not to turn in random work but actually take the time to understand the material and concepts. In the end, I have to hold myself accountable if I start to slack off because then labs will just accumulate. This helps me work to integrate extra time during my week to really grasp the material and learn how to manage my time more efficiently. "
