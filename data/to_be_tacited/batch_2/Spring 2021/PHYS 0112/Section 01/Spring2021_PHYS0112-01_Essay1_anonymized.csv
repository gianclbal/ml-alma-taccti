Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2132,"Kristian Culla 2/2/21     Reflective Journaling #1        The most obvious reason is that physics and physics lab is part of my road map to graduating with a Biochem degree. I do not just see it as a requirement however, I like to view the subject as another great subject that is the package of biochemistry. I love to take something from all my classes and bring it with me to use in future classes, and I think, know, physics will have a lot of ideas and theorems that will help me understand chemistry and the world so much better.              Another reason is redemption for how badly I failed at this subject in high school, so many moons ago. I was a pretty poor student and put hanging out over learning and got the grades I deserved. The sad part is, I really enjoy the subject of physics, and understanding the world around me. I’m usually thinking in my head, “how stuff works” and I hope this class will help me answer some of those questions."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2133,"Hello,I am in this physics lab because yes it is a requirement for my major. However, on a deeper level, I'm here to prove to myself that I can pass this class. Before transferring to SFSU I took physics lecture and lab at a community college. It was a very bad experience, I felt like I wasn't smart enough, did terribly bad in the class, and ended up withdrawing. I feel like at the time it was a mix of things that affected my performance in the class. I didn't know how to study, didn't put much effort, was distracted, left everything for the last minute. The teacher also was terrible and he made everyone feel like they were stupid. So I'm here to prove that I can pass the class but not just that do well in the class and actually understand what is being thought. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2134,"I am mainly here because my major requires this class, but I really enjoy learning about astronomy and I feel like this class will introduce me to some basic physics that can be applied to astronomy. I have never taken a physics course so some of the topics are really new to me and some I’ve heard of in other classes but don’t know too much about them. I think it’s fun to have hobbies that relate to classes you need to take because it’s nice to learn new material and be able to apply it outside of the classroom. Physics is also happening all the time in our daily lives and it’s cool to know the science behind why something is happening. I also have an interest in learning about light and the components it consists of. I hope to be able to learn things that will be useful in the future and in my day to day activities. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2135,"Reflection journal: Why am I here                           My old math Professor from skyline said ""The brain is different from your body, you go to the gym working on a piece of equipment that is specifically built to strengthen that limb. You don't wake up one day going 'ok I'm going to hold my backpack out with one arm the whole day because I do it at the gym...' -no that's weird, people will look at you weird. It's the same with math (or any subject) you're exercising that part of the brain."" You make time to go to the gym to ""strengthen"" parts of your body, and to be a better thinker, you have to make time to do homework.  Originally I said, “I am here in this class, because it is a requirement for my major” but I felt like there should be more to it. Pondered for a good few minutes, as well procrastinated, I came up with “Friendly reminder to myself: I am here because I am majoring in the STEM field and all subjects are pieces of the puzzle.”"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2136,"I decided to take physics 111 because it is one of the classes I need to complete in my major but that doesn’t mean I am not excited for this class. After having an interesting physics class in high school (with a man in the middle of getting his teaching license), the urge to actually learn different physics topics grew. I know the information I was learning was just the tip of the iceberg but it was still so interesting. I’m looking forward to be able to understand why certain things are the way they are. I am very happy that I get to complete this course in a synchronous course and have discussions instead of never meeting and watching pre-recorded videos."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2137,"I feel like I have a few reasons why I'm here so I'll list them all. Reason one of why I'm here is because I've always had an interest in science. I find it very fascinating to understand how complex things work and why they work that way. I've never really been a physics person, but whenever I've had a physics class, there's always something that catches me by surprise. Another reason why I'm here is because I have a lot of hope for the future and I'm trying to give it my best go in this game called life. My last reason is the people I love. I have many people supporting me and what I want to do. There's always this thought sitting in the back of my head saying not to let them down. It is a huge motivation because when I feel like I'm slowing down, I continue to move forward because of them."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1504,"I'd like to think I'm here to add something positive to the world or at least the world of the people around me. I really enjoy helping people and being in a team so I think anything, where I could support someone, gives both of us value. I also have a weird feeling I am going to make a huge contribution to music to someone in my life, it's a feeling I've always had and I got pretty high up in the music scene as a teen, but I choose politics instead. I guess we'll have to wait and see."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2138,"Alexza SandovalPhys 1121/2/31Reflective Journaling #1Why am I here? Growing up I have always liked the idea of being a vet, or just doing anything that has to do with helping animals. So I decided to major in bio. As in why I chose to take physics it's because I took this class in high school and the teacher I had wasn't the best. so even though I did pass the class I didn't really learn anything nor anything from the class really stuck with me. So I thought taking the class would be like a refresher and hopefully help me really understand all the concepts of physics. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2139,"I am here because I am always up for a new challenge. In my previous physics course, I was taught by a teacher who knew a lot about physics, but nothing about teaching. This caused me to significantly struggle in the class and in turn, hate the subject. Now, I am ready to take it again because I feel as though I can learn a lot from this class. I am also here because this class serves as a barrier between me and my future goals. This class is a requirement on my biochemistry major, so I must succeed in order to graduate in the future. I don't really like physics as a subject but I am always open to new experiences when it comes to education, and I feel that I can do well. I want to show that I can do well in this class because that would prove to myself that I can do well in any course I take."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2140,"""Why am I here?""I'm here, in this class because PHYS112 It's my compulsory course. To be honest, I'm pretty bad at math and science, but kinesiology is my passion to study. In order to study kinesiology courses and for my future career, I have to learn and pass those math and science classes including PHYS112. However, I'm still interested in science and physic. It's really helpful for my future career. Physics helps me to understand the world around me, and satisfy my curiosity. Studying physics also develops my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. I feel good when I learn something new in every section."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2141,"Physics is one of the hardest subjects that I have learned. It’s cool to get to know things surrounding us though it’s complicated. I studied Phhysics in highschool but never got high grades, C at most. This subject consists of mathematics which is also my enemy. I signed up for Biology as my major and Physics is included in the requirement to meet the prerequisites, so that’s why I am taking it. Luckily, I have gotten nice, friendly lecture and lab instructors in PHYS 111 section so I am hoping to understand and get the ideas and practices of physics. After joining this class, I think I’m here not only to get credits to fullfill the requirement but also to get myself physics knowledge and comprehension. I did not have any good impressions of studying physics in highschool but I think that I could change my mind after taking physics class in college. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2142,"I am here in this class because I genuinely love science and learning about the different type of science is the way to show my love for the subject. Even my strongest suit is not in physics but more in biology, I will still try my best to pass the class in physics. Another reason to why I am here in this class is because it is required for me to take this class for a major. Being a biology major student, I am not very good at physics especially combining math with science together. I did not take physics during high school so taking this class will help me to have a better understanding of physic and how things really work. I am not really interested in physics but i am hoping that this class will change that for me and help me learn how to love physics as much as I love biology."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2143,"Why am I here? I am taking this class because it is a requirement for my major. In general, I am not the greatest fan of mathematics.  I will not die because of a calculus class, but if it were elective, I probably would not take the course. If I think beyond, physics is something that accompanies us on a daily basis.  Since last week I have refreshed my knowledge in physics with the ALEKS course.  Topics such as metric units and percentages are helpful in everyday activities such as when I go to the supermarket, or I want to leave a tip in a restaurant. Physics helps us to communicate better and in a universal language, but it requires being very careful with small details."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2144,"I am here today to pass this class and learn some things.  I have never really taken physics so I don't really have much of an understanding of what the whole class is about.  This class is just one of my lower-division requirements so that is more of why I am here and have managed to avoid physics this entire time.  I don't have much of a connection to why I am here more than I need this class to pass it.  My purpose, in general, is to be able to pass everything and graduate on time this May.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2145,"I am here taking Physics as a requirement for my major, Kinesiology. I think it would be advantage for me to learn physics because of how it correlates well with the knowledge of movement. I want to continue pursuing Kinesiology in hopes of creating my own sports rehab clinic. I've been into several physical therapists' clinics, and I consider them my second home. I've played multiple sports growing up, leading to me breaking a lot of bones and tearing a lot of my ligaments. The relationship I have with my therapists can't be beaten, and I just wish I can continue to help other people grow and love the sports they choose to play. Though this class can seem intimidating because of past reviews, but I'd like to believe that this is MY year, and that whatever comes my way, I can pull through and come up with an A in this class. All it takes is to believe in myself and spend time to actually study. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2146,"Fatima Santos  I am here because I want to become someone in life, I want to be a veterinarian. I am doing this for my mom who has made sure that the education I receive is great, who has worked late nights in order to see her daughter become something in life. I am here because my grandpa believed that I could do whatever I wanted because he always said I was a very determined woman, once I put my mind to something he knew I would follow through. I am taking physics as a requisite for my major but I am hoping that I learn as much as possible in this course. I do all of this for the most important people in my life and I hope that all their work, prayers, and faith they have in me really do pay off so that one day I can return the favor. I want to be able to provide not only for myself but for everyone that has become a very important person in my journey."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1379,"One reason why I am here is because I choose a career path that requires me to learn physics and it importance. I know this class will be useful and will help with my understand of why things work the way the work. I am also here because I am choosing too, which is something every college student needs to take into consideration. It is important to want to be in college because then you re taking your courses with joy and are not asking why am I taking this class and how is it important. We should have to be in college just because we are being pressured it should be solely because you want to. This course will be super helpful in my future with my career path. I also believe that I am here today in a college physics course to become something great and do something of myself and help others around me. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2147,"The main reason as to why I am here is to fulfill my prerequisites for my major. Although this may be the case I actually enjoy all branches of science because they just overall fascinate me. Physics may be my ""least favorite"" of the big three (being Biology, Chemistry, and Physics), but it does not mean that I do not care about it at all. I still want to further my understanding in the subject so I can have a better grasp on how to use the concepts and teachings of physics in my future career or every day life. I am most definitely excited to continue with this class and seeing how we are going to perform some of these labs that explain just ordinary things in our lives. Also, I am looking forward to working with people in the class on this subject and hopefully making some new friends here as well."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2148,"Why am I here? The reason I am here is that physics is a course I have to take in order to graduate here at San Francisco State University since it is a major requirement for me. In addition to that, I am a Bio major so my schedule consists of science-heavy sources such as biology, microbiology, chemistry, psychology, physiology, and of course physics. Not only that but back in high school I had a lot of fun in physics even though it got really difficult at certain times. I did manage to pull through and I do have some recollection of what I did in that class such as formulas for solving certain problems. However, I am fully aware that this is a college-level course and I am going to see things that will most likely be entirely new to me and take some time to get used to but I will do my best to get a good grade."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2149,"The reason I am here is to gain a greater understanding of the world in all of its different systems. As a scientist, I've always been curious as to why things are, and eventually I got tired of hearing a poorly thought out answer from people who have no defined answer to my questions. Because of this motivation, as a child, I became interested in the sciences and decided I would see how this world works for myself. Physics, in my perspective, is a large piece to that puzzle understanding how the world works around me. However, it is the one subject that I have probably avoided or have just not known too much about for quite a long time. Also, because of my interest in science I one day hope to make the world a better place with the rest of my generation's interests'. Physics, in my view, is another step toward reaching my goals and is a topic that has left me curious for years."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1409,"Greetings.My academic journey from last semester has brought me back to this course. Last semester I went through a lot of emotional things that really altered my life perception and how I was living it. I was not only bombarded by debt I could not pay, losing work, and new work I could not get due to the pandemic. My family was dividing due to political views and disagreements. The degradation of the relationship between my twin brother emotionally shattered me to pieces as every holiday was used to humiliate me and called me a conspiracy theorist because the media and celebrities define the opposition as that way which was biased and flawed in those prejudiced statements. My reality turned into a society of hate towards me and the fear of saying anything was a verbal attack on my conduct. I faced depression, anxiety, and distress. I did not want it to affect my academics, but I am an imperfect human. The results were that I did, in fact, pass my physics class with an A, but I was not able to submit my labs in time and that is how I failed this class, therefore, I am taking this lab again. I know this semester will be different because all the things I went through brought me closer to God and this is coming from a person who sort of was a scientific atheist. Last semester was a battle of the mind, the soul, and the reality that I lived in. In some subjects, I succeed and in others, I was not able to.Thank you."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2150,"I am here because this is a requirement for my major. Personally, if I had the choice to take this class I wouldn't. It's not because I don't like physics, it because I am very eager to start learning about things that are more of my interest. Like genetics and other biology courses. Another reason why I am here is because I want to graduate school with my bachelor's in biology. I am a first generation to go to college. It makes me very proud of myself for how far I have come. I also am continuing to push through because it matters a lot more to me on a sentimental level because of my brother's recent passing. He always was so proud of how far I have come and never missed any big event in my life. That's why I am doing this. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,681,"I am here at San Francisco State because I would like to further my education as I believe that knowledge is very important. Both of my parents, and all of my older siblings, have finished their respective degrees and this only motivates me more to continue to strive for greatness. Growing up in an educated household sort of instilled the idea in my that I'm going to college no matter what. Now more specifically, I'm in this physics class because it is one of the required classes I am to take if I want to fulfill the biology degree. However, that's not to say that I don't care at all for physics. I think it is important information to obtain, and I'm quite excited to learn general physics this semester. I remember taking it back in high school and having a good time in the class. Deciding to take it this semester was an easy choice for me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2151,"The main reason I am here is because this is a requirement for my major. However, I chose my major because I really enjoy stem and how it applies in our everyday lives. I am really looking forward to taking this class because I have no knowledge in Physics. Everyday I find myself asking questions about how life works, I can understand it pretty well from a biology or chemistry perspective but not a physics one. I want to know why things fall or move, how structures can stand up, how our cars move. I don't even know if those things can be answered through physics but I am looking forward to seeing what i'll be able to better understand by the end of the semester. I am a little bit nervous about this course because, like I said I have no prior understanding to physics so I have no idea what i'm getting myself into and how difficult it could be. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2152,"Why am I here? I have always been intimidated by physics, I have never taken a physics class before, not even in high school. I have always heard rumors that it's a very difficult concept to learn. I need to take physics in order to fill out some requirements for my major. So now that I have passed calculus I am able to  take your class. I am here to learn, I know mastering this subject will do wonders for my future work. Also I am taking chemistry right now and I can see how both subjects are like sisters stores, they share some basic ideas. I have heard that you deal with gravity in this class, again I have no idea what to expect but I hope I can pass this and it will be able to help me in biology class and chemistry class. I am looking forward to learning with you."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2153,"Hey Elder here, I guess I am in physics for a lot of reasons; first of all because I have always been interested to learn more about important subjects such as this, but overall to get over my fear of physics. I have always thought that physics was too hard for me to do, although I took it in high school and tried so hard to pass and at the end I did. My thinking is that if I put enough effort into it, I can learn and pass the class. I am also in the Earth Science department and learning about this subject will be important for my future career wherever I end up which hopefully is doing research out in nature because I love nature so much. I hope to connect with my classmates and get comfortable perhaps make friends along the way and be able to help each other out when working on the labs. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2154,"The reason that I am here is because I want to graduate with a BA in chemistry and I do not know what exactly I want to do with that in my life but hopefully something will spark my interest for the rest of the time that I am at San Francisco State until the time I graduate. I also remember the last time I took physics was in high school and I thought it was interesting because of the hands on experiments that we did. Although we obviously do not have the chance to do experiments in this lab, I believe that learning about physics is just as interesting and I hope to learn new things that will amaze me as much as the first time I took it. I feel like there is just so much physics that is happening around us and there's never a limit to what we learn about it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1251,"Reflective Journaling  #1: Why am I here?I'm here taking this course because I want to have a better understanding in the subject of physics and build on my knowledge of physics to improve my skills and in general I enjoy taking science classes. Currently I'm in pre-bio major, and taking physics will not only help me understand the world of science better but also because this class is a requirement for my major helping me get closer to my goal. I'm planning to major in biology with a minor in physiology. I also want to expand my learning in physics and learn more about the importance of physics in life. Even though I only took physics for one year in highschool I had a good experience overall with the class and really enjoyed all of the experiments I did involving gravity, light bulbs, building circuits, etc. Physics has been somewhat challenging in highschool I hope I will be able to push myself in order to succeed and pass this class."
