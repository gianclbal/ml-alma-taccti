2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2150,"When I am struggling, I often resort to having a complete reset for my mental health. I kind of just stop doing anything other than work for about a week. I wish I could just up and quit everything that I am doing, but life doesn't work that way. I just kind of did that last week but it defiantly never is enough. I just keep going until the semester is over and hope that it all works out for me. Right now, I feel really sick and exhausted. The time change isn't helping at all either. I have things I need to do to take care of my house, but even that seems like too much. It's all really exhausting. I used to go to therapy, but even that is a chore because I have to find the time to even sit down and talk. It's all just really hard sometimes."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,681,"When life gets challenging, and believe me it has been this past year or so, I buckle down and get down to business. As the saying goes, when the going gets tough the tough gets going. With the covid pandemic going on for a year now life has definitely changed and I've sort of been rolling with the punches. Hanging in there and getting my work done is how I've been dealing with everything. Adjusting to online classes and life during this pandemic was admittedly hard at first but after I developed a routine things started to become much easier for me. I think that taking things day by day is also key when dealing with rough patches. This can help clear my mind, I constantly remind myself not to worry about what's to come ahead in the future or what has happened in the recent past. Instead I tackle problems day by day, mostly in the moment when experiencing these sort of things, and grind it out to work out a solution to any life problem. Being a student athlete also helps with the fierce mindset that keeps me going instead of throwing in the towel. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2146,"Fatima Santos PHYS 112March 16, 2021When life gets challenging I like to ignore all social media by not paying attention to my phone, TV, or sometimes even my laptop. I do this because sometimes just looking at what someone posts or seeing that I have to reply to a lot of people stresses me out and it tends to make whatever situation I am in much more challenging. I tend to just lock myself in my room and take a couple of breaths as I get overwhelmed most of the time so breathing in certain patterns helps a lot. For example, when I feel overwhelmed I’ll breathe in and count eight seconds then hold it for another eight seconds and then let all my air out, and with that goes my stress and I usually feel very relaxed and centered afterward. Sometimes I’ll even meditate in my own room or even just pray and ask God to really help clear my mind and my heart. I’ve realized that most of the time having a breathing pattern and praying really help me when life gets challenging, both help clear my mind and I feel at peace."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2140,"Life is inherently full of challenges, and there is no straight path in life. What we need is to face it calmly and not complain about the difficulties and twists of life. When encountering unsatisfactory things, be more confident and determined, and less complain and shrink. In real life, complaints are not uncommon. Some people complain about the pressure of studying, some people complain that life is unsatisfactory, some people complain that their career is not going well, etc. There are various complaints. However, looking back and thinking about it carefully, what can we get from complaining? In fact, after complaining, people will not relax, but will make the mood worse. What we get is a bunch of helplessness and irritability after venting, and there is no change in life. There will be a lot of difficulties in life, which we cannot predict and cannot change, but we can adjust our mentality and treat them with a positive and optimistic attitude."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2153,"When life gets challenging I take time for myself. How life has been lately, it has really been challenging because I do not have that much social life and I really enjoyed spending time with my friends. I usually go for a drive and listen to music to clear my head. I also step away from social media since everything there seems unrealistic. I also spend time with my family who I barely see because they work a lot but we make time to have fun and clear our heads as well. I tell myself that life is one step at a time and that I am on my own path and that everyone's path is different. That, I have accomplished so much and I am capable of accomplishing much more. I reach out to my friends and talk to them about how I am feeling and they provide support, I am glad to have such supporting friends since not everyone has that. Just overall, grateful for what I have and what I do not have I do not stress about. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1593,"What do I do when life gets challenging?- Usually what I do when life gets challenging is cry and stress myself out even more. I am usually really good at knowing how to manage my time and workload, however, the pandemic has made it a lot harder. Since the pandemic, I have found that walking my dogs really helps take some of that stress away. I also like spending time with my friends and boyfriend, especially my boyfriend cause we have a Nintendo Switch together and play Super Mario 3-D and Party all day lol. Growing up, my dad would make his signature banana bread whenever my brothers and I had a bad day, so baking is another hobby I enjoy doing when I am stressed. I try my best to replicate my dad's bread, but I haven't managed to accomplish that yet lol. Naps are also very important because they help me recharge and they are really good after a good crying session. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2144,"What I do when life gets challenging is that I try to take things one step at a time. When I think about the multiple things I need to do, I form a list and then check off what I have done. Doing this holds me accountable for the things I was able to do today, and seeing the list get checked off really helps with motivation. I like to ask for help from peers to help and make sure that what I am doing is on the right path. If it isn't the right answer it is nice to learn from someone in the class who might be struggling at the same time also. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1409,"Something I have been learning to do is what to do when life gets challenging. I say this with experience, like I assume many have. Many people handle the challenges they face differently. And just like me, I was aware of the services that schools provide before challenges came, but when you grow up with the lack of these services, when you grow up, it is very hard to understand how those services will now help you as a student and as a person. You go around with pride that if you depend on these services you will look weak and if you seek help, when you are accustomed to not receiving much help, it breaks your core and you learn not to seek help. It is hard for students to depend on educational services when the system itself has a lot of students to care for and at the same time it is unrealistic to assume that they could handle the necessities of every student. I encourage students to seek help but at the same time, I myself have not seek help when I needed it and I do not know how to be humble enough to depend on those services. So, as you can see, it took me a long while to figure it out on my own. As cliche as it may sound, and many atheist my disapprove, it was not until I allowed God unto my heart that  I learned to depend on something bigger than me, and trust me, that is harder then seeking services. To depend on something you can not see, yet know that everything will work out brings so much more peace and satisfaction than one can imagine."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2137,"There has only been a few times where I can say life was really hard for me. My most recent example happened less than a couple years ago. It doesn't seem so bad but I feel like my spirit was crushed during that time. I failed my chemistry class during my second year of college. Even though I knew I could retake it and replace my grade, deep down inside I felt like I was wasting so much time. I was really disappointed in myself and felt hated myself for letting it happen. I constantly reminded myself why I even go to school. This helped me get back on track and regain motivation if I ever needed it. Sometimes, all it takes for me is to distract myself from what's giving me so much stress. Then I would hangout with some friends or play a bit of video games. We all need some sort of output in our lives and those two things are mine."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2151,"When life gets challenging I will either keep doing what i'm doing that's challenging, or save it for the next day. I usually change from keep working on this to stop when I start getting really irritated. I. feel like this has worked really well for me, especially now that we're online. Before, when I had breaks between my classes I would go to office hours, back to my dorm, go eat, go to the library, etc. No matter what it was though I was at least getting like 5 minutes of walking to another place which broke up my day. Now I sit at a dining room table all day so things feel like they get challenging much more quickly. When I decide what i'm doing needs to be done the next day, ill usually spend the rest of the day doing things I like, like taking a walk, playing a game, reading, or watching tv and then usually go to bed early. This allows me to wake up the next feeling a lot better about what was challenging. In addition, it helps to just revisit whatever I'm doing in a completely different mood/headspace the next day. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,1251,"Life could get challenging quicker than you think, whether it is school, work, or worries, and sometimes stressing too much over things. When life gets challenging for me I try to empty out my thoughts, empty out all the worries and stress of the things I worry about by having some time on my own by going on walks listening to music or just listening to music in general. Whenever I listen to music I feel like everything else that's happening around me blurs out and i'm able to just feel calm and empty out my emotions, mostly feeling empty of worries and frustrations when i'm listening to music. Another thing I do is go to my deck at night/day and receive air and mostly just look at the stars and the sky at night. I also talk with my friends about the things that's challenging me throughout the day or week, and they give me advice on anything I need help on and I find that really helpful and relieved that I have someone to help me throughout the day or week."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2147,"When things get tough there are different ways I approach situations. Sometimes they are good and sometimes they are bad. The good ways are that I take a step back and see what is going on so I can gather my thoughts and get a good handle on what it is I am dealing with. I also like to ask friends for help for if I absolutely cannot figure out what it is I need to do. Sometimes I do not know what to do and I just fold over which is not good but in the end, I always do my best to pull through, I will give it all and try to remotivate myself so that I can get back on track and finish my assignments or work that I am doing. If that does not work I go and take a moment to meditate or listen to some music to refocus myself on the task at hand. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2134,"When life gets challenging I tend to want to step back and find an easier way to approach things. Something that really helps me is writing to-do lists so that I can clearly see everything that needs to be done. I'll make one for everything school related like homework, upcoming exams, or any appointments I need to make or will be coming up. I'll make another list for everything in my personal life even if it's something as small as cleaning my room. This way I can cross off things as I go, and I can see that things are getting done and that eases my mind. I tend to stray away from doing any kind of work in my room, so when I get stressed and life gets challenging, I can always go there and my mind knows that it's time to relax. I'll call my friends and family, watch movies, listen to music, get ready for no reason, or do any kind of self care. I'll also walk to get some coffee so I can get out of the house to clear my mind and be able to come back and be productive with my to-do lists. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2152,"I try to always be opportunistic, I find the best thing I can do is talk to my mom or close friends. Before this year I would say drawing was my outlet but that has changed since I am now in advanced printmaking and I put off some of the work carving out my drawing because My hand is exhausted and I need to be able to lift things at work so I take it easy on that. I am really bad at managing time. For example I put off drawing because I have chemistry homework and I put off a forum post because I need to study for physics and then I have to call off work because I have an exam and I am scheduled at the same time. So now really I find myself just watching ""modern family' as a way to relax. However I've gotten to the point of the show where Alex has already completed her first year of college and it reminds me to get back to the laptop."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2139,"Usually, when life gets challenging, I rely mostly on my family and friends for advice on what to do. Most times, what I do is just push through it and hope that everything works out in the end. All I need to do is work hard and figure out exactly what I need to be doing. Mostly all I do is work through whatever challenges life throws my way and hope that everything works out in the end. I do not do much though, and I try not to think about it. I try not to stress too much about life's challenges but also, I try not to ignore them. All I do is keep moving on and eventually, things will go my way. I just need to not fall behind and keep doing whatever I was doing, all the while trying to solve the problem."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2148,"What do I do when life gets challenging? The first thing I do is find my space. And I do not mean being alone, when I mean finding my space when I am doing something like classwork or homework when I am with my friends, or maybe when I am alone. Finding my space changes depending on where I am at, who I am with, or what I am doing. For example, when I am in public I don't focus on everyone else I just stay in my lane, when I am with my friends I just keep that part of my life reserved because it is not something I want to talk about with anyone, and when I am alone I just get lost in my thoughts in order to figure out what it is I have to do just to be able to improve the situation I am currently in."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2149,"When life gets challenging, usually I try to embrace whatever I might be going through. Even though I know I'm on the path of improvement I always make sure to take the time, stop, and look at what challenges I might be facing and feel all the necessary emotions that comes with those challenges. When things get challenging feeling your pain and your worries is completely necessary to living a life where you know you have meaning and a purpose. I'm sure many people throughout the pandemic have driven themselves insane and its so weird how such a change can affect people's lives and mentality. But the best thing to do in order to maintain your sanity during this time is to think honestly about yourself and your situation. Recognizing what it is you need to do to start inching yourself to a better you or a better situation is only the start. And once you see yourself improving it will make you want to keep doing that or make you work harder. Being in this cycle and falling out has shown me that when you're struggling, its not pointless. Because when you're not struggling and you get lazy, that leaves all the room in your world for error."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2141,"I am sure to say that we all have had been through challenges and each of us has different ways to deal with difficulties. Although I’m a sophomore college student, I have already got some challenging points. It’s been not easy for anyone, including myself since the COVID hit. The pandemic got people’s plans changed a lot. I, myself doing unwell since the pandemic first happened, especially I’m living more than 7,000 miles far away from my family and basically I’m here on my own. My homesickness got increased and I fell into a depression that I totally neglected myself, not eating properly, not studying seriously, not taking care of my hygiene, and more. I was so lost. At my lowest times, I got my family and my friends to motivate me all the time though it’s only through video calls which means a lot to me. Actually, when life gets challenging, I want to spend my time alone to rethink, sometimes I cry, also rest up until my mind can get back to work. I have to say that sleeping is the best solution.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2135,"Ok since it's a casual journal. I learned something about myself. When life gets challenging I CANNOT ignore myself. When I'm stressed out, I space, I procrastinate. I also have this very toxic approach of: “I'm just going to distract myself from a frustrating task and choose to distract myself with another stressful project/assignment”. This year has been the most challenging, and you know what I did? I made time for myself, took the dogs on a hike (in months), sat there with a pretty view, and cried. BUT after that, I felt normal again especially when this lady asked if I were ok,--I just told her I hate how the universe is really testing me right now. Why didn't I tell myself its ok to relax a long time ago?  When life gets challenging, I must ground myself. I shouldnt carry all of my family's problems, they'll be ok. Refocus on what challenges I had set for myself. I have an amazing support system, but the biggest one is yourself."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2142,"Normally for me when life gets challenging, I’ll try to get myself to talk to someone if possible or just start to take things slowly and solve things one by one. I would also do things I enjoy doing to keep my mental health in a good condition while trying to solve the current challenge I am facing. If I absolutely needed help, I would ask someone for help. Normally I would just try to solve those issues myself and be independent. Sometimes, when the challenge is too difficult for me, I would just try to avoid it or try to stop myself from thinking about it. If I try to do that, that issue will always be in the back of my head and it will just slowly drag me down. That would usually lead to little breakdowns. This rarely happens but if that issue is the absolute worst, I would just avoid it completely and won’t even try to do anything."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,2132,"Over the years I have learned that I needed an outlet to blow off steam and escape the world a bit whenever life gets challenging. We are not robots or machines, and therefore can not run like it, our brains need time to destress and power off. That little bit of downtime is just the right amount of re-energizing my brain needs to tackle the next set of challenges. For me, I personally have a couple of outlets I turn to, to blow off steam. I have a motorcycle, that I love to ride on to go out on a break. I might sound like a classic cliche' when I say this, but they are not lying, when I'm on that bike, the world melts away and it is just me and the road. It gives me a chance to reflect on life and what I have to do to get things done. The reward of discovering new roads and adventures is the motivation to keep going through long and winding roads. Another thing I use to help me get by when life starts to get cluttered is to play some video games. For example, oftentimes, lectures are long and boring and can easily lead to me not paying attention. (Especially with online learning) I find that if i keep myself busy, say playing tetris online, or something like that, I can keep zoned in on the lecture. "
