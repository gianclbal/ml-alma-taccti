2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2207,"My goals for this semester include being on the Dean’s list for academics this semester and maintaining a 3.5GPA or above.  I have that goal because I want to do better academically in college for the rest of the time, I’m here at SFSU.  In high school I used to be a solid A/B student and had a bunch of extra curriculars.  However, I didn’t really challenge myself academically or feel extra proud of my academic career.  So, I want to be able to be proud of the extra curriculars that I attend while also giving my academics more effort and focus.  In addition to ‘needing’ to have above good grades to apply and be within my heavily impacted major (kinesiology).  Overall, being on the academics Dean list is something I want to do and look forward to challenging myself to.  Combined with moving closer to graduating with my bachelor’s degree as well as moving closer to being accepted within my major department.  In addition to being able to develop my professional life as I can during the rest of this pandemic.  Taking this class will help me achieve these goals because this class specifically will allow me to solidify my understanding or any questions, I have for my PHYS 111 lecture.  Combined with being able to apply a real-life application of what I’m learning in this class and what I understand.  In addition to being one of the requirements I need to apply to my major and is one of the recommended courses I take before being within the major.   "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,622,"My goals for the next 5 years is to complete my bachelors degree and pursue a higher education degree. I hope to attend a masters program after I graduate from San Francisco State. I would like to pursue a masters degree in public health, so I would be able to obtain a career in hospital administration. The overall goal with my career is to be able to help people who are less fortunate, and I know that with that career, I will be able to. This class is helping me come closer to my goals by teaching me about physics, a subject I need to know about to earn my degree. Although my end goal is to get a masters in Public Health I first need to focus on obtaining my bachelors degree in Biology with a concentration in physiology. This course specifically helps with that by supplying me with information that I need to succeed."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2199,"My goals are to become a professional soccer player and have a long playing career. I want to get my Bachelor's degree in Kinesiology, possibly double major in something else. I know both of these goals can happen for sure. If I keep putting the in the time and hard work to make sure I stay on track, they will happen. This class helps me achieve these goals, because Physics a key element of Kinesiology. Kinematics and biomechanics are a huge discipline in Kinesiology that has so much to do with the way we move and can create force. I love learning about that because something I want to do after I'm done playing, as well as being done with school, is be a professional coach or professional trainer. So learning about Physics and being able to be hands on with certain experiments, will help me grow my understanding majorly. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2197,"I have many goals in life that I want to achieve. Even though some may be small goals I still would love to achieve those goals. This class helps me receive my bachelors goals, getting my bachelors has always been a personal goal of mine. Taking this class will allow me to get a step closer on getting my bachelors and accomplishing a goal in my life that I would never forget. College is like one journey of many to come for me. I would like to do many things in life. From starting a business to having a job in the medical field as well. I feel like everything will come slowly, even through all the bumps on the road. Another big goal that I want to accomplish is actually gaining knowledge in college that I would be able to use in my future. With this I want to help as many people as I can. I also want to go to a foreign country in the future and stay there for a couple months to help out. I feel like this is a goal that I am very looking forward to accomplishing. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2209,Honestly I don't feel like I have any goals for this class mainly because I am taking this class to fulfill a major requirement. As I keep on thinking about it this class will probably be helpful in the long run. I believe this class is making me think more about how lessons from class can be applied to the real world. The basic understanding of physics will just be valuable knowledge to have learned. I keep on learning how much physics is present in the real world even if I don't think of it every day. It's like how everyone says that we need to know how to do math and read because life evolves around it. I might not think of everything as a physicist but I will at least have some knowledge of how real life examples relate to physics. I guess my goal is just to learn as much basic physics I can in the time I am in this class and maybe get a little more interested in it. Since this isn't my area of interest.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2201,"I have some many goals. My main goal is to became a Veterinarian. I've always loved animals. I grew up in my families farm so I was always around animals. After becoming a Vet I would like to travel to Africa and help heal wild animals. I would like to then get married have a farm of my own with main cows, horses, goats, chickens, dogs, ducks, and many more. I would then like to have a beautiful family of my own. I love big families because I have a huge family so I would like to have at least have 5 kids. Then I would like to help my parents with their expenses. They have done so much for me I would to pay them back as a way of thanking them for everything they have done for me . I would also want a small animal clinic of my own. Its a lot of big dreams but air just need to work hard and never give up."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2206,"In the beginning of my college journey I had no idea in what career I wanted to pursue. I had always enjoyed biology during high school so I knew that I wanted to be involved in that field. I then met some classmates that got me involved with nursing students and pre-PA students. It sparked my interest and I decided I wanted to become a PA. The ultimate goal after my undergrad is to attend PA school and work in the neonatal department. Later in life, I would want to start a free clinic with other PAs and doctors in order to help underserved communities. This class ultimately helps me not only because it is a requirement for my degree, but the worlds revolves around physics. It is everywhere that you look. In the medical field fluid mechanics is greatly involved. Physics have also had a large impact in the technologies used in medicine such as ventilators, x-rays, and CT-scans."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2203,"So far, I find physics challenging and fun. Being able to balance physics with my other classes is a challenge because I want to make sure I make enough time for myself to study and absorb the material. I really appreciate lab lectures because it helps me re-visit the material I learned in lecture. I want to try my hardest because this is my last semester at SFSU, and I want to keep my GPA up, therefore I am focused to stay on top of homework and studying. In the post-knowledge checks, the real-life example of the weekly topic in the lab helps me see the topic from a different perspective and helps me better understand the material. My strategy for that question is to visualize the graphs we have from the labs and apply them to the real world. It helps me realize what motions I have in my everyday life and helps me better understand what’s happening in the world around me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2204,"""What are my goals? My goals are to get better at Physics so that I can be better at solving and applying physics to any problem that needs it in my life. I am also just trying to understand learn psychics so that I have a foundational base I can pull from to help me in this class and in future classes. These equation and theories being applied will help make me better at solving physics equations in real life.How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""This class is helping me achieve these goals by giving me applied physics and also showing me problems to solve using physics. It gives me base ideas that I can use in the main physics class. This class also gives multiple examples and asks us to solve them which really helps me understand these equations and ideas much better. This is what I think this class has provided for me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2205,My goal as a student is to work toward a better understanding of the world around me and the knowledge I am gaining. My goal is to constantly be learning new things and being able to apply them to the world around me to make a positive impact on those around me. This class is helping me to achieve these goals as I am able to further my understanding of physics through learning as well as practicing more problems like those from the physics lecture portion of the class. Being able to work with others to apply the information that we know will help me to further my collaboration and work with others to gain more knowledge of the world around me from different perspectives. I hope to continue to work hard to understand the new concepts that are being taught and have the change to ask questions to be able to get a new understanding of the concepts being taught. I hope to be able to apply this knowledge to the world around me and gain a better understanding of my surroundings because of it.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2198,"My goal is to graduate with a degree. This class will help me achieve this goal because it is apart of my degree requirement. Other than that I wouldn't be taking this class because it wouldn't help me achieve my goal of graduating with a college degree. I want a college degree because hopefully it will help me find a career that will be satisfying and pays well. If that turns out to not be the case then at least I will have a degree in something and can add it to my list of life achievements. If the world doesn’t take climate change more seriously than this will all have been for nothing and the end of the world will have arrived sooner than later. So hopefully, we can make a difference and change the course that our world is currently on. Go Gators."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2202,"I plan on going into the medical field in the future and this class will help me complete some of the basic forms of physics I will need to know for my future classes. I want to become a surgeon and becoming a surgeon does have a lot of self teaching moments and taking this class really allows me to focus on studying tactics and learning tactics. I also plan on being very successful and trying to manage my time very efficiently. This class, since it is very self teaching does make me have to focus my time more and allows me to figure out what needs to be worked on and when. since we also do a lot of online work I am practicing my technical abilities. Also being put into zoom groups or separate groups helps me communicate more and practice on asking questions and not being scared to ask them in the first place. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2210,My goals are to become someone in life. I would like to be someone that my parents are proud of.  In life i hope to be better than where I came from. There are many people that are not able to live the life they thought they wanted to live because their at home situation did not allow them to succeed. I am determined to overcome those odds and make better outcomes for myself. This class is allowing me to achieve my goal by allowing me to fulfill a requirement for my degree. This will give me a step up in having the ability to achieve my goals.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2208,"Some of my goals include performing well in my classes and being able to catch up in all of them, so that I would still be in the track I aim to maintain. Graduating in time while still being able to enjoy the years that will come is also part of it. Lastly, I hope to get into a dental school after and then have the opportunity to help, not just my family, but other people as well. I am an immigrant and I know how it feels to have the need of migrating to a country you do not have any idea about because you want a better life for yourself and your family. This class is helping me achieve those goals in a way that is not specifically related to the topics being discussed, but instead in a way where it strengthens me and my faith. It also helps me develop my skills, especially my critical thinking skills, that will definitely help me as I become part of the workforce."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2200,"What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals? My goals for right now is to graduate SFSU with a good GPA. After graduating, I would like to find a decent job that relates to my major, or with my interests. How this class will help me achieve my goal, by giving me the knowledge of basic physics so that I can apply it to my future major classes. By learning the topics and understanding the materials, it should give me a general idea of what I should be thinking about and how to apply it in real world situations."
