2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2211,"I would say that the values that were taught and shown to me as a child and young adult have enabled me to continue throughout my academic career. More importantly, it has taught me how to persevere when things do become challenging and also to always ask for help when needed even if it is a friend or someone that you can trust for meaningful incite. Let alone from the values of my community and family, this pandemic has allowed me to recognize the most important factors in my life, and to take these factors so that they are applied to my education, such as patience, hopefull thinking, and mindful/strategic thinking. College is not easy nor is it extremely difficult it just takes a lot of commitment, sacrafice, patience, and positive outlook that what one desires will become true one day, as long as the steps are taken to meet or surpass a goal. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2207,"The values of my family has definitely helped act as my driving force to continue my college education.  Considering that my mom is a single parent that raised 3 kids (including myself) and had to go back to college to get her degree, as well as having both of my older siblings go to well known colleges.  For me, having my family and wanting to create a good life for myself and be able to take care of them (with the financial freedom to do so) and take care of them overall, I want to do what's best for me.  One of those things is continuing my college education.  As for actually navigating what and how I do in college, that is up to me and no one else.  I decide and plan out my college classes so I decide to take 15-16 units each semester.  I take it upon myself to decide whether or not I push myself pretty hard the first two years of undergrad school so I can focus and set myself up for success junior and senior year in my major department.  As well as taking it upon myself to do a good amount of research in being sure that I understand and am aware of the classes that I need to take during the time I'm in college.  Overall it's a mix, but in my opinion I believe that because of my family I'm able to live through my college years in the exact manner that I do."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2205,The values of my community and family have helped me navigate through college so far by teaching me that hard work and dedication is the key to success. My community and family all emphasize hard work and its importance. It means that you are dedicated to the process of becoming and learning while going on a new journey. This has helped me navigate through college so far because I have been able to work through tough challenges of online school and being home to use it to my advantage and turn it into a positive thing in my life rather than letting it become something that is negative. Being able to understand that this mindset will help me will allow me to be my best all of the time and always strive to learn and be better.

This taught me to try my best when it comes to college. They want me to get a good education so that I can get a job that in which I can be financially stable for the future. Majority of my family has a bachelor's degree and have went to college. They are all encouraging for my major and help me strive to be the best that I can be.

2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,622,"My values inherited through my family have helped me in many ways throughout my college career. Some of these ways which include responsibility, accountability, and academic honesty. A way that I portray responsibility in my academic setting is by knowing when assignments are due and making a calendar to prioritize what class work I have to do. By doing this is ensures that I am taking responsibility in completing my assignments. In regards to accountability, this trait is reflected in my will to get my assignments done and when I do not complete them, I know the consequences in which I may face. The most important trait that I have inherited is academic honesty. I see this as the most important trait because this correlates highly with my personal morals. This situation can be translated into an issue that I may face day to day. For example if I happen to not finish an assignment I would not allow myself to copy from another peer because it is not fair to my own learning and to the rest of the class that the learning outcome is so low. It can also be seen as me cheating my personal self due to the necessity of the knowledge for future uses."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2202,My family values strength and courage greatly and that has pushed me to do very well in school my whole life. My mom has always told me that to succeed in life you have to get an education and even though sometimes that is not true I do see that often in my family. In my community there isn’t many people who go to college or achieve higher education and that pushes me to want to have in higher education. Since my family values working hard it pushes me to try my best during college and always ensure that I am giving it my all. My mom went to college but unfortunately had to drop out because I was born and I feel as if I should continue what she wasn’t able to. She is also now returning to college which makes me try even harder because she is a full-time mom and has a full-time job and is still able to go to college. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2206,My family has been supportive of my academic career since the beginning. I am the first in my immediate family to go to college and my parents are proud that I have set the example for my younger siblings. When I was first applying to college I only had one older cousin who went through the process herself so she was my support in that aspect. She's older than I am so she had the experience since she was finishing up her master's while I was becoming a freshman. As for the community I think about my close friends and how we try to help each other in any way when it comes to school. A few are the same major as I am and two of them want to become PAs as well so we can always talk to each other in figuring out what steps to take next.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2208,"I am not the first person in our family to go to college, but I am the first to go to college here in the United States. My parents and oldest siblings graduated in the Philippines and so I was not able to get much assistance from them with navigating through college. However, they never failed to show their support to me because they have always been so encouraging and understanding of my college life. They were also always there to remind me of my dreams in life and I definitely believe that my perseverance, passion I have for the field I am pursuing and with helping other people, and most especially the faith I have with God are just some of the values I acquired from them that keeps me going, despite all the challenges life throws at me. We may be apart from each other right now, but the love and support we have are what made us stronger as time passes by."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2203,"My family had a large influence on my academic journey. My family taught me to value my education and to cherish the opportunity. Knowing the sacrifices my family went through in order to come to the United States also influences me to continue pursuing my goals to become a pharmacist. A majority of my family members are nurses, but the health field interested me because I am most familiar with health topics. I chose pharmacy school because I was always interested in medicine and wanted to know more details about it. It also excites me that there are a lot of different possibilities of work that pharmacists can do. I also get my study habits from my family. For example, having a mapped out plan of the topics of what I need to study help me keep organized when studying. Especially when I am confused about a topic, I gather all the information I know, and identify what parts I am confused about."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2210,"The values of my family have helped navigate me through college by always being supportive through my educational journey. Education is very important in my family since many of my aunts and uncles have received degrees in different fields. My family values education since not many of our past older relatives had the opportunity to attend any type of college due to the struggles they had to endure. While being in college my family has been very supportive. If I ever need any help, they are there for me in a heartbeat and if it is something out of the reach, they will do their best to help me figure out a solution. In my community I attended a charter school that was very admin of attending a university. This allowed me to feel encouraged to step out of my comfort of my community and travel to a school of my choice, without feeling alone when making my decision."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2197,I believe that the values of my family has had a major impact with the choices I have made for college. My parents have always recommended college to all their kids do to at least having a bachelors in something and having that for then rest of their lives. I believe that my family was brought up to be very close and to look out for one another and therefor me being the youngest I had felt as if I need to do more on helping my parents and taking care of them. So the first choice I believe that was impacted from the values of my family was going to sfsu. I had gotten into many other schools but all of them were really far from home and I know my parents had gotten very old and sick and I did not want to be away from them and not be able to help them. I know that they do need a lot of help on the daily basis and I know all my other siblings are getting busy with their own families and therefor sfsu being only a 30 min drive from home was a good choice so I can be able to just go home just in case of an emergency. In my community there are a lot of medical influences going on and this had rubbed off on me as well. Therefor I had chosen to go through the route of becoming a biology major and hoping to move onto med school afterwards. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2199,"The values of my family and my community have pushed me to succeed in college. My family has always been big on me taking my next steps into getting into college, but also my own personal goal of playing soccer in college. I’m taking advantage of those every day by getting to continue my education and get my degree, as well as pursue my long-term goal of playing professional soccer. Many people in my area wouldn’t understand what I’m trying to do overall, only people that are close to me understand what I want out of college and out life. I grateful everyday to be able to get an education and have the people closest to me want what’s best for me every single day. Success is no accident when you work hard and put in the time and effort. I’ve always known that and my family has instilled that into my beliefs. Positivity comes a long way and will always benefit us."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2209,"To be honest I am not sure what my values are. Maybe it is do what makes you happy, be healthy mentally and physically, do well in school, etc. I think a big family value is go to college because both my parents have PhDs which I think is a big pressure sometimes. Although I know that they remind me that I don't have to feel pressured to get a PhD because they want whats best for me. I also feel like school is a big value in general too because thats what my life has always revolved around. My best friend that I made in like kindergarten have the same values in that going to college is important even though in different careers. Not only is being educated is a big value but I also think being worldly is important because if you just get an education you can't do much with it all the time.   "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2204,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college, because they have pushed me and helped me when I first started going to the Junior College and got my 2 year associates degree while in high school. Those classes and the amount of work I did in those classes really helped me push through and finish and do well in most of my courses, with their backing. They have also supported me more recently as I have had more medical issues and had to continue to work through classes and finish my work. These values of determination, grit and unwillingness to give up help me finish all my work in a timely manner and turn it in and do well with courses. Another part would be the hard work ethic that I had instilled in me form my parents since I was little. I have been pushed to work harder and do better and that also factors in to some of the things I needed."
