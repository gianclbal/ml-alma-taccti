2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2209,"I honestly can't really think of what happens when life gets challenging... I think that I try to figure out what to do but if I can't I get really frustrated. Or I talk to someone I know who knows how to do what is challenging to me. But that isn't the case all the time since not everyone in my life knows how to do the thing that I think is challenging. Maybe, find information on the internet. I feel like that nowadays a lot of people resort to the internet for everything. I most likely have do that more than once or twice. Or if something is really challenging is to give up. Like if I do a sudoku that is too hard for me I just give up because I am the only one in my family that enjoys and knows how to do them. But if it comes to a puzzle I never give up even if it is a challenging one.  I guess another reason to why some things I quit doing is because sometimes it feels bad not knowing how to do something. That I just want to do something in my comfort zone. I also feel like I haven't had too many challenging things in my life yet because I am relatively young and haven't experienced much. Although the most challenging thing in my life so far was when I was below average on being able to read when I was little. I had to go through a lot of extra help which helped me improve over the years. But I do think that it still lingers in my life now because I have this insecurity about things associated with what I struggled with. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2211,"When Life gets challenging it takes me awhile to absorb and fully accept what challenges I am working. However, once I get over this short period of confusion, frustration, anger, sadness, or any emotion that is a response to specific challenge I do my best to practice positive and constructive outlooks. I believe it is important that during times of significant adversity such as the pandemic, the most important area that needs continuous exercise is the mind. Doing things, such as yoga and breathing techniques helps me be mindful and keeps feelings of anxiousness low. Also it develops a sense of clarity and recognition. I also make the time to do a lot of physical exercise such as running or playing tennis.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2203,"When life gets challenging, I always see it as an opportunity for learning and improvement. It reminds me that life would be boring if there were no challenges. I see challenges as opportunities to grow and to seek self-improvement. If I come into a situation that puts me out of my comfort zone, I always take a breath and assess the situation to see what I can do to overcome the challenge. For example, if I come across a difficult homework problem, I use all my resources like my textbook, reaching out to SFSU's LAC for a tutor, go to office hours and to reach out to my classmates in my group chats for additional help if I cannot figure out the homework problem. Other ways I handle challenges in life is to motivate myself for self-improvement to accomplish the challenge. Learning about growth mindsets helped me motivate myself as a student when I come across a difficult topic or homework problem. I've learned that I am the type of student who learns best by reviewing the material before class starts and listening into class and hear how the teacher interprets the topic. Rather than giving up, I choose to help myself and give myself more time to expose myself to the material so I can better absorb the material."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2197,"When life gets challenging I like to go think about why and what is going on and why it is happening. I often like to isolate myself when life gets challenging, I like to rethink about what is going on as well as thinking about how I can improve myself and how I can not go through this challenge in the later future. I also like to go workout to get my mind away and release the stress. I often like to workout as well due to it distracting me and it refreshing my mind. When life gets challenging I would like to know why it had gotten challenging as well as the different ways I can solve this problem. I have often gotten away from people due to feeling like they can be a distraction as well and I believe in that if I am by myself I would be able to solve what is going on much faster. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2202,Life has been very challenging recently and I’ve learned to cope with it in many different ways some that are healthy and some that are not. I have a very strong shopping addiction so when life gets challenging I tend to just go on a shopping spree online or in stores. This is not healthy because I do not get paid enough money to spend as much money as I do. I often say that money does bring me happiness because I’m able to purchase whatever I want but I often don’t have enough money to purchase everything that I want. I also have started to want to paint and that brings me joy and is able to disconnect me from the outside world. I like to make puzzles as well different types some that are challenging and some that are very easy. kind of ironic how when I am in a challenging time I choose to do challenging things such as paint or do a puzzle but it helps me get my mind off whatever is bothering me.  
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2198,"When life gets challenging I either tackle the problem or I put it off for a little bit. It really depends on the situation because unless it’s something that needs my attention now then I’ll get started on it right away. I see things objectively so for me I am able to disassociate myself from things and see what needs to get done. I am not really the type that will run away from my problems because that won’t solve anything. So, I’d rather just deal with it now and not have to worry about in the future. That’s how I was raised to just finish things now and relax later so that’s how I do things now. I do not really know how else to answer this question, so I am just going to keep writing until I meet the word count of a hundred fifty word minimum. Bye."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2207,"When life gets challenging, I initially spend a few minutes (15-20) getting myself acclimated to whatever is now challenging me.  Then I continue moving forward with my day, taking things one at a time and finishing whatever I need to.  Whether school is challenging, work is challenging, or a personal hobby is challenging me. I take it one at a time and try to remind myself of the skills, resources and tools that I currently have that I can use to help myself.  Then I think of the positive things that I will gain from this experience, and ultimately have a growth mindset towards everything that I have in my life.  Every once in a while, though, when life is increasingly challenging I either get overwhelmed for a few hours or if it’s challenging in a more personal manner I cry/get upset.  Both of which, it has to be a lot for me to have happening/challenging me just because I think it takes a good number of things to tilt me off balance.  In addition to having to be a lot for me to express the stress/response from the challenges in my life.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2200,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?""What do I do when life gets challenging? I try to overcome the problem and try to find the best solution to help resolve it. An example would be being stuck in a homework problem, I'd try to figure out the problem myself. Some ways that I try would be going back into the problem and try to figure out where to begin with then I'd start by finding possible solutions that can be possible. If nothing comes up or if I can't find a possible solution, I'd go back to the lecture, slides or notes and try to figure out what I did wrong. If everything else fails I'd ask my friends. My friends are smart and are very knowledgeable of physics so most of the time they were able to help me and teach me. These are some of the things that help me when I was facing some challenges in the class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,622,"When life gets challenging I believe that it is important to keep going and power through it. When you give yourself the opportunity to give up when life gets challenging it will be even harder to leave that dark spot. If it is challenging already and you decide to stop right in the middle of it, it will be more difficult to pause and come back to pick up where you left off at. It is important to remember your experience and help others through the same experience because without the help of our friends, families, or colleagues we are just by ourselves. It is important that if you ever feel a situation is too challenging that you reach out to others for support or help. A good leader knows when to ask for help when needed or when to support others if needed. Many people would tremendously appreciate when others reach out to support them without having to ask."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2201,I do many things when life gets challenging. I love to go horse back riding and really do things for my selfs . I like to take a step back and really think what steps I should take next. I also look for advice and support from family members or really close friends. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2199,"It's crazy to me how this topic has really hit me the last few days. I apologize for these assignments being late, but I was in a really bad car crash a few days ago, that really should've ended my life. I realize that someone above was watching over me and that God knew it wasn't my time yet. This incident really opened my eyes to how life is about challenges and obstacles, and how we go against them. We have to take challenges head on and adapt to our environment. Being able to fight through any challenge, is what will help myself get stronger and anyone stronger. The biggest thing that has always helped me in any situation when it comes to a challenge, is that I'm such a positive minded person. I will always try to have a positive outlook on anything on life and try to make the most out of any situation. Life is about experiencing and learning. Challenges help us learn, and if we don't learn, we don't grow. We should be growing and learning every single day. I want to take on new challenges every day and help myself grow every day. Life is a blessing and I will always be grateful for what I have and who I have around me. Soccer, my family, my friends, and the things life and God have blessed me with, are many things that help me when life gets challenging. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2204,"In the past year, I life has taken an unforeseen turn in terms of health for me. The way I have been coping or doing is not thinking about it, I spend more time doing work and trying to do other things to not think about that problem. I sometimes might take a break from work just to reset myself, then I go back to it later when I am in more of a working space. Another thing I’ll do is just do more things I enjoy like learning new languages or watching many new movies. I also listen to a lot of different music also which helps with challenging problems in life. Sometimes if I have more time I’ll leave where I live and travel into Nature, usually Colorado, and just enjoy camping and being surrounded by beauty and silence. The last one is very helpful, I traveled last semester to Colorado, and it helped me reset, refresh, and enjoy the little things. That is usually what I will do. Shaun Byrnes"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2208,"When life gets challenging, it is very much easy to give up and let things flow on their own. However, it is important that we also remember why we are doing the things we are doing, despite the challenges of life and for whom we are doing this. Personally, I turn myself to God, talk to Him and offer everything up to Him, when life gets challenging. I believe that everything happens for a reason, even if it has caused us pain, and with that I believe more with His plan for me. I may not understand everything that is going on, but He does and He will provide us with strength and guidance. I will not be able to see the blessings and the beauty of the journey I am taking with Him without the challenges life is throwing me. I know that believing in Him and in myself, with how I was able to pass by all the challenges I have encountered, will make me a better and more developed person that I need to be in the future. This is just a phase in my life, there will be a lot more, but I am with Him."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2205,When life gets challenging I take a moment to be grateful and be in the present moment. Understanding that this moment is all we have is important and that you need to cherish it no matter the situation that you are in. It is always possible to find the good in any situation and being able to step back and see that is the most important part. Understanding that I have the opportunity to control my thoughts and my reality helps me to take control of what is important in my life and take charge. I find perspective and take the challenges as opportunities to push myself to be the best I can be and grow because of it. I work everyday to implement this perspective into my life because that is what is going to help me to succeed and move forward. Finding the good in all things will allow me to work towards my goals without getting down on myself. I also reflect on my daily situations and allow myself to see what is happening without judging myself to harshly and solely for the goal to work to get better and better myself.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2206,"There is a couple of things I do when life gets a bit challenging. The main thing that I do time after time is go outdoors. I will find some time in my week to go on a hike that I can enjoy for a few hours. Being on a trail usually calms me down and makes me forget about my troubles even if it is for a few hours. It comes down to living in and enjoying the moment. Another thing that I do, but not as often as the hikes is go off of social media for a couple weeks. I see it as a “reset”. By doing this I do not get distracted or procrastinate with certain things. If I am able to complete more things, then I begin to feel better about things even if they are out of my control. There is more things that I tend to do when life gets a bit tough, but these are the two main ones that I find most effective."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2210,"What I do when life gets challenging is try not to stress out. Most of the time I do end up getting very stressed and end up avoiding my problems which is not good. I always try to keep a positive mind set. When there are challenging situations in family I try to be the strongest for everyone and try to keep a centered mind. I do handle challenges well for the most part, However, at rare times I will try to wait out a challenge if I am own my own. This is something I have tried to work on since it is not very ideal to do in life, because things will not simply go away if you do not face those challenges. In life we have to face the good and the bad because if not we will never truly live. Life is not life without its challenges. So now this is why I am choosing to not be afraid or intimidated by life challenges."
