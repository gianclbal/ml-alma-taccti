2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2206,"Often times I would find myself being stubborn and try and complete things myself. It does not matter whether it be school work, finances, or social events. Although I sometimes consider this a good thing that I am able to be independent I have learned that everyone needs help at times. There has been times that I have have struggled with class assignments or grasping the concept completely. It was then that I asked my peers to help me better understand the material. Having someone explain a concept will sometimes make you view it in a different perspective. Thankfully I have my peers and professors that I could use as resources. In a social aspect I am grateful to have the friendships that I have developed over the years. The friends that I have now have supported me completely. They always push me to continue doing good and motivate me. Of course, this is reciprocated. Our friendships consist of being honest to one other and simply being there for one. Even if it is just for one of us to vent."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2210,"There are many resources that I have that can support me. In life I have my family who are very supportive of anything I do. This makes me feel confident in being myself and not being afraid of new things. Different resources that I also have are having help educationally when needed. In my school when I need support, I can have a scheduled visit to my counselor's office EOP office or even speak with friends for advice. If I ever need internal help, I can always speak to a licensed medical professional or seek advice from parents and other family members. When in school I know that I can seek support from fellow colleagues, friends, professors and peers. If there is any further help, I need I can always refer to the school website with guidance to different support hotlines four different departments. These are all the different support options I have around me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2208,"In a situation like we are experiencing right now, when a pandemic has taken over most of our lives, it is more difficult to determine what specific resources we need that will sufficiently support and help us succeed. But now, I have come to realize that aside from all other resources I may need, what I need the most is to keep the faith I have in God, as well as the constant love, support and guidance I am already provided with by my family and friends. This is because it is what has helped me to keep on moving forward, despite all the challenges and difficulties life has thrown at me. Also, resources such as those that will help me with my mental health and build connections with people that are within the field I am pursuing, dental field, are some of the other resources I need to support me all throughout my journey in college and with exploring my intended career."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,622,"Going to a university with as many resources as San Francisco State is super amazing. There are many resources for just about anything that a student may need. They have resources to help with academics such as the tutoring programs and great professors for office hours. Some other resources that San Francisco State offers are programs like CAPS, Gator groceries, and the Student Health Center. Despite this being an educational institute, the school provides more than just education. CAPS is a program that we have that offers students who need help with counseling or anything like that free of charge. Gator groceries is a program that is offered at SF State to the students who need groceries, they always have a great selection of healthy foods. The student health center provides medical attention to all students who attend SF state, despite whether or not you have insurance they can help you."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2209,I'm not really sure how to answer this. Is it the resources that support me in this class or in my studies at school or even just in life or my mental health? I feel like I do have a lot of resources that I can use in general but I never use them. Like for class I could attend office hours or do those tutoring things. I normally don't do office hours because I feel like I don't know what to ask and I get too nervous that I forget what I am there for. I have done the school tutoring in the past for another class but didn't really find it that helpful. Because I feel like since I only used them a couple of times and that everyone learns differently its hard to get a tutor that will match the way you learn. I guess major advisors are a great support because they are able to help you with many things within you major and can get you to other resources if you need help. I think big resource to me are my parents. They both support me in what I do and help me grow into what I want to do. Sometimes I can go to my dad so he can listen to my answers and explain to him if he thinks it makes sense and he will then help by giving me some type of input. My mom is someone I can go to for figuring out who I am and what I want to do with my life (also sometimes my dad is like my advisor too). 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2200,"""What resources do I have to support me?""The resources that I have to support me are the lectures, notes, professors, student learning assistance, friends and online. These sources are widely available to me and all help me. Lectures and notes are my primary sources of getting information. Professors are also one of the most important resources because they help me learn the materials and are readily available to help. Some classes has students that are assigned to help other students. They are very useful because we can easily relate to them because they have been in our shoes and most likely have the information and knowledge freshly learned. Friends are always there when I need help and they are very knowledgeable with physics. Majority of them have a physics background so they are very knowledge and helpful when It comes to things that I don't understand. The internet is also a good resources since we can connect to many things online and we can give new perspective of things and different methods in solving things. I use the internet to get more information or to relearn the concepts that I'm confused on."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2198,"The resources that I have available to help me is my family. They are the greatest resource I could have because they only want what is best for me. So, by relying on them and working hard I can hopefully get to where I need to in life. I don’t really know what else I am supposed to write in this reflective journal for physics lab. So, I am just going to try to meet the minimum word count by writing about writing this journal. If you have to deduct points on this journal then I would understand but other than what I listed I don’t really have much else. By this point I need forty more words and if I can just continue to write I will eventually meet the minimum word count. I wonder if these journals are similar to sci classes journals where it is just by turning something in and it is not really graded."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2201,My main resource that I have that supports me is my family. They are always there to push me when I'm having a hard time. My parents don't know English but they are always there asking if I'm ok if im doing fine in school. My sister is also a great help and motivates me to be like her and never give up in life.. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2199,"When I think of resources in ways of supporting me, I think of people or things that can help me mentally and physically when I need it most. The resources I have to support me, are my professors, because I know every single one of them wants to see me do well and wants to see me learn and grow. Then, I think of health professionals and the ways they can help me stay safe in the times we're in and when I need to go to a doctor for any specific reason. One of the best resources I think we all have is the internet. It can help us out so much on a day to day basis with anything we want to learn or look up. My family and friends are resources, my coaches are resources. These are also all people who can support me in any way. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2202,"Honestly, I do not have much support at home because I am the oldest child and my parents do not know much about college courses or are always busy. I do not have any older cousins to speak to and am always finding myself struggling. I also have such a busy schedule and do not have much time to myself to go to offie hours with affects my overall grade. I tend to watch YouTube videos to help me understand topic better if I find them tough, but YouTube videos do not always help me fully. I have access to wifi and a computer and iPhone most of the time, but connection gets spotty at my house so It can harm the hours I have to do my work. My family has always supported me mentally and physically but can't support me when it comes to school work. I have teachers from high school who I used to email but everyones lives got so busy that I do not have time for that anymore. Overall, I do the best I can with what I have. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2207,"I think this is a great question, I think and know that I have a lot of resources that I can use to help myself.  It’s just a manner of looking for those resources to help myself.  Due to the fact that I know that the resources are out there, I just have to take the first intimidating step and look for them.  I say, ‘take the first intimidating step’ because I know that it was hard for me to ask for help.  I still do have a semi-hard time asking for help.  However, the fact that I feel confident saying that I am more aware of how I’m doing, making sure to be self-aware and things like that than I used to be, because of that I’m more aware of when it would be the most beneficial to ask for help.  Whether I ask for support in needing to take some time off work or asking to swap shifts with someone because of not having enough energy to give to my workplace/mentally not able to give the best work that I can give.  Or if it’s talking to my professors just a tiny bit in communicating the current situation that I’m in, if I need any help or if I simply need help with an assignment.  Or if it’s asking my friends in a extracurricular I’m in for some help because I need to shift my priorities and spend more time doing something else (primarily school or take some time to take care of myself).  Overall, I know that there are many resources out there to support me, I just have to take the first step forward in asking for support.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2204,"The resources I have to support me are my parents along with the internet mostly. The resources I have a sufficient amount of resources for helping me achieve the solution to my problems. Recently, I have had a harder time, but due to my resources, I have been able to work through my problems and still work at a good level. It has been hard but I have persevered mainly because of the resources. I have also been lucky enough to be able to go to the beach every week and walk around and clear my mind. This is what has been making my weeks better overall. Along with the fact that I am able to hang out with friends every once in a while makes it much more manageable to get through the week and the semester. I have also had help from my teachers which also helped me more overall. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2205,"The resources that I have to support me include my teacher, my classmates, my textbook, tutoring through the school, office hours, and my lecture course. The teacher is always there to answer any questions I might have and is supportive and helpful at explaining concepts that are new or need further explanation. In the breakout rooms my classmates are there to collaborate and work through the labs together to see if we need help or clarification. The textbook for the physics course is helpful at visualizing the different concepts that we are learning. The tutoring and office hours from the school and teacher help to clarify and ask more extensive questions that I may need help on throughout the year. These resources are all always there to help me to clarify new concepts or get more help working through the ideas that are presented and worked through during class time. Being able to work with others has helped me further understand the concepts in physics."
