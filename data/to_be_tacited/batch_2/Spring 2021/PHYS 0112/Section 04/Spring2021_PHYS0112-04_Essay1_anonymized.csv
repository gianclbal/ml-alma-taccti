Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2197,"Why am I here? Well while looking at this question it had really got me thinking. Why really am I here and what am I really trying to accomplish. Well while thinking over I had to think from the start, the reason I came to SFSU is to earn my bachelors and see where it can take me from there. This class was recommended by my advisor to take and this is the first time I had taken Physics in my class of education as well. I am pretty excited and nervous about this class due to never taking physics and not having an idea on what I will be expecting and what I will be learning as well. But going back to the question, why am I here, I am still not sure what I want to be. I am heading towards becoming an anesthesiologist but I wouldn’t mind just getting my bachelors and then see what I really want at that time. Things come and go and someone's life can change at any moment which is why I want to also want to have fun while I am learning as well. The question why am I here is still a question that changes for me daily. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2198,I am here because this class is a requirement. I'm not too sure how physics relates to environmental science but hopefully I will learn and be able to put it to use one day. Otherwise if you're asking why I am here at SF state then that is because I love the city and wanted to get away from Los Angeles. This is an interesting topic because I just did the same thing last semester with my sci class. Easy points that add up. I am not a fan of math so this class is going to suck for me. Hopefully my sci class this semester will able to lift my grades for physics up because I know I will need the extra help.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2199,"I am here, because I want to learn and understand the general concepts of physics. This course is required for me to get my Kinesiology degree and is apart of a core concept of the ideology of Kinesiology. This core concept is biomechanics and I really enjoy this concept so going more into detail about it will be very interesting. I took physics my junior year of high school, and I honestly barely learned anything. It was really easy to not pay attention in that class and still get an A, which I did. Now I genuinely am focused on learning these ideas and want to learn about it because it's a fascinating subject. My favorite part about learning about physics too was the lab portion. I really enjoyed being hands on and working as a table group to come up with different ideas to create a certain project to go with whichever concept we were focusing on. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,622,"I am here taking physics 112 because it is a supplemental course that comes with physics 111. I have to take this course to fulfill a pre-requisite for my major. I am a biology-physiology so in order to be able to graduate I have to take up to physics 121 and physics 122. ""Since the question is asking why are we here?"" I can go as far back to discuss why I decided to attend San Francisco State in its entirety. I decided to come to this school because it was easily accessible and affordable. I chose my major because I feel like this is something that I was good at and something that I have genuine interest in. I chose to be here because I want to learn science to be able to make a difference in this society. I love learning about biology, but an interest that I discovered while being here is learning about the social injustice with science."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2200,Why am I Here?The reason why I'm in college is because I want to get an education so that I can get a decent job. I am here in SFSU because it's nearby and a good school. I've heard many good things about the school. I want to make my family proud and have a career in which I can be self sufficient. The reason why I'm taking this class is to have better knowledge of my major class since it requires physics. I want to have a good passing grade for this class so I'm trying my best to pay attention and to focus to the class. I want to learn the best that I can about physics so that I can apply it to my major class and to the outside world. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2201,I am here for many reasons. One main reason is for my parents. I want to make my parents proud. They do everything for me and they give me everything. My parents never finished school and I want to make them proud. My dad stopped going to school in the third grade and my mom didn't finish college. My dad came to the United States at the age of 20 and started working in construction. I see him get home tired and in pain from work everyday. Seeing him like that makes me want to work harder. I am also here for me. I have huge dreams. I would like to become a veterinarian in the future. I grew up around farm animals my whole life. I have some much passion towards animals. I have to work hard everyday so my dreams can become real. I would like to have my own farm with lots of horses and cows and goats.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2202,I am here to learn physics so that I can become a doctor. My whole life I have alway loved helping people and what better way than to become a doctor of some sort. In order to become a doctor I need to graduate college and this course is required for me to graduate as a bio major. This class is very interesting since I have taken physics before in high school but I want more of a challenge this time around. I hope that this class brings me tough and simple days to even out the playing field. I hope to gain a broader understanding into the world of physics to help my brain connect more with how the world works. I also know that I want to become a surgeon and physics can help when dealing with serious damages done to a person. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2203,"As an aspiring pharmacist, I am taking Physics 112 because physics is one of my prerequisites for some pharmacy school programs I am currently applying to. I believe physics will help me gain strong foundational knowledge for future class material in pharmacy school. I am excited to be in this class because it is my first time taking physics, and I am thrilled to learn new concepts. It is definitely different from the other classes I have taken. I am comfortable with chemistry, biology, anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology, but I find physics challenging because there is a lot of math involved with solving physics problems. Since it is my first time taking physics, I find it both challenging and engaging because there is a lot of math involved with solving physics problems, but I am eager to put in the effort to learn, understand, and apply the material in order to be successful in the class. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2204,"""Why am I here?""The reason I am taking this physics class 112 and 111 is due to the fact that I did not take this physics class when I was going to the Junior College and getting my Associates degree. Now since I am getting a major in Environmental Science and Geography I need to take physics as a class and a lab. I have to take physics now because it is also helpful for me to do more las and solidify the procedures and equations used in this lab and the physic lecture class. This is another reason why I am taking this physics class. I spent many hours in high school learning physics and now I get to apply these concepts to this class which I am excited about. Another reason I am here is because I am going to go into a science field and I need to help refresh my physics skills. Other than that I believe it is always good to help refresh and remember the physics labs and equations that are used in physics."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2205,The purpose of me being in this class this semester is to gain knowledge that I will need for my future major in Kinesiology. I hope to develop a solid foundation of physics understanding to be able to be proficient in my work. I hope to be able to understand the new information in a way that will help me to gain a more complex understanding of the world around me. I want to be able to implement the math skills that I have to make sure that I understand what I am doing in the course. I want to be able to ask questions and understand better through communication throughout this course. I hope that the work in the lab and lecture course combined will help me fully understand the major basic concepts of physics and I will be able to explain and use them myself. I am here to work hard and learn as much as I can and hope to gain a solid understanding of physics.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2206,"Why am I here? A question that many of us have asked ourselves and may yet not have an answer to. That is okay though because I believe that our answers change in the different stages of our lives. Currently I am here still in the beginning of this journey called life, and I am preparing or setting myself up for a better future. This involves my academic career that I am currently in and the one I want to pursue after my Bachelor’s. School isn’t the only thing that I am here for. Recently I am discovering new hobbies that I truly enjoy and will love to continue doing later in life. Currently I am enjoying spending any free time outdoors. This includes camping, hiking, and doing solo backpacking trips to different countries. Lastly, I believe that I am here to continue becoming a better version of myself everyday. There is no right answer to this lifelong question, but as long as you attempt to better yourself in someway or another you’re already ahead."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2207,"I'm here to continue and further my education.  Personally having the goal to do the best that I can in everything that I do or at least try to.  I want to gain my bachelor's degree and potentially my masters degree.  As well as personally thinking that having my degree will only help me and my future (professional) more than harm me.  Although I do understand the financial concerns and struggle of paying for my college education.  I'm also here because of the internal voices, challenges and opinions that I have for myself as well as having older siblings that I hold myself to a higher standard to. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2208,"Honestly, there would be times where one does not know anymore why they are in a certain situation. But for this class, I know that I am here because it is a step forward to reaching my dreams. It may be a small step, but in life, every step counts. I believe that these steps are significant in the journey we are on with fulfilling our own purposes and I may have trouble fully understanding everything yet, but I know that I will be able to get through this specific step. In real life, it is not important how many times you have failed because it is the number of times you have stood up again that matters. With everything that our world is experiencing right now, it is important to remember that giving up is not the answer. We will need to take breaks, and that is fine, but we should never give up. The challenges life comes with has its purpose or reasons behind and just like with the question ""Why am I here?"", the purpose is for me to be a step closer to my dreams. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2209,I am here because it is a major requirement for Environmental Science. Another way I guess I can say why I am here is because I have not learned about/enough physics and need to learn more so then it can be applied to environmental topics. So basically just to broaden my little to none knowledge of physics. To be honest I've avoided doing physics when I was in high school after taking an introduction to physics. But I think that now that I am older I feel like it is more necessary to take a physics class even if it is just one because just like math it is everywhere. Since I an writing this past its due date and now have had a few labs I continuously learn how much physics is present in our everyday life. It shows me how important it is to be here. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,2210,"“Why am I here?”       This is a question that many of us ask. Why am I here and what is my purpose? Personally, I am here taking a physics class in order to have the prerequisite for another course that is for my major. I am majoring in biology with a concentration in Physiology. I am choosing this educational pathway because I have always aspired to become a pediatrician. As a little girl I dreamed of going to school to have a job that would help others. it has always been an innate part of me to help others whether I try to or not. I guess this would lead me to believe that I was put on this planet to help those in need of care. I always care for others whether it's family, friends or even strangers. when I look back at when I was a little girl, I think about whether she would be proud of me and how far I've come. I do think to myself that I am on the right path once in a while I take a curve here and there but always seem to get back on track."
