2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2187,"My parents did not have the same opportunities as my sisters and I so from when we were very young, my parents have always pushed school onto us. They have continuously told us that we can do whatever we want as long as we still continue with school and get at least one  degree. They just wanted to make sure we had all the opportunities available to us and something like the absence of a degree didn't stop us. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2188,"My family has always valued education. My parents are immigrants, and they believe that getting a good education would lead to a better life. They always tell me that I should just focus on doing well in school more than anything else. They tell me that they don't want me to suffer like them--working labor intensive jobs. So, I have always felt a certain pressure to do well in school. Whenever I'm feeling lazy or unmotivated, I remember what they say and I'm guilt ridden but it has also helped me push through my schoolwork. For me, there really wasn't any other option besides going to college after graduating high school. Because of how I was brought up, the idea that I won't be able to get a job without at least a bachelor's degree was planted in my head. I'm glad that I can learn so much during my time at SFSU. Even though it hasn't been long, I really like it here. I like how everyone I've met in the science department has been so nice, friendly, and helpful. Hopefully, I would get through the rest of my time here in SFSU with more pleasant memories. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2195,"My values are my guiding principles. Throughout college, my personal values helped me in every decision and choice that I made. My parents are the ones who shaped me to where I am right now. They have taught me that I must carry my values wherever I go. Over time, my values change and grow. I have learned a lot and gained knowledge, but the values that were taught to me when I was young, still remain in me.One of the personal values that I treasure since I was young is my faith. Since I was young, my parents would teach me the importance of faith. They would teach me that one thing I shouldn't let go is my faith. Now that I am in college, I can surpass any challenges because of my faith. Becoming deeply rooted in my faith helped me in making better decisions and choices in life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2190,"My community has given me the values of working hard, character integrity, and attitude. These have directly carried into my studies in that I understand hard work is involved to get to any place I want to be. Also I have gotten through and built skills by relying on my own academic merits. I have learned that each section I complete teaches me something useful to help me in my next steps or refining what my next steps. I have also learned that things are less difficult when applying oneself with a good, learning attitude. Having a bad attitude or limited mindset just makes it harder to get through challenges and learning."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2192,"The values of my family and community have helped me navigate through college as I have gained lots of help and support. Whenever I need advice on what classes I should take or if an need help on a homework assignment, my older sister is always willing to help me, which I am grateful for. Additionally, my parents and other family members are always showing their support when I tell them my plans for my future. My community provides me with the essential resources to help me get my assignments done. For example, I’m lucky to have been given the opportunity to buy a laptop and iPad which has really helped me. Without these resources it would have been very difficult to navigate through college and have the amount of success that I am currently having. I hope to continue having the support from my family and friends to continue navigating through difficult situations."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2184,"The values of my community and/or family of origin helped me navigate through college by giving me the space to be independent. Of course, in the beginning periods of my life, I had to be nagged to do a lot like chores, homework, and other responsibilities. Now that I'm an adult, it still surprises me how fast lives moves and how I no longer have to ask permission to do a lot of things like go to the bathroom during class, or if I can stay up late, or if I can hang out with a friend, etc. By giving me that space to be independent, I've been able to practice more discipline in not having another person nag me constantly in order to get my priorities straight. With this sense of independence and discipline, I've had to increase my drive to get homework assignments in on time as much as possible, and balance school, work, personal life, and family. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2194,"My friends and family are a major factor in the goals I hold for myself, and the values I follow because I spend most of my time with them. Good friends push each other to be the best versions of themselves, and encourage success. Although the term success differs for every individual it’s the support of a community that allows us to build confidence and continue to persevere during difficult times. College at the moment seems to be non-existent as we continue taking classes online. However, the values and friends that influence my life, have encouraged me to reach out and explore what the campus has to offer despite not being in person."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2183,"College is really hard. My mental health hasn't been great and everything has been exacerbated by the pandemic. I was raised to be a perfectionist in all that I do and it is really hard to stay focused and give 120% 25/8. I really care about how I do in school and I want to do my best. I am new to SFSU and I don't have a community yet via college: I haven't even been on campus! I want to do well and succeed and learn in all my classes. I feel as though I would have been able to flourish in a regular semester but distance learning is not for me. My goal is to be a dentist and physics is so important in that. Hopefully this summer I can reset and have a better semester in the fall. Phys 121/122 is in my future and I feel prepared for it content-wise but hopefully, things will be better and I will have a fresh start in person(fingers crossed)."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2193,"Going to college to attain a higher education is a given in my family and in my community. It is something that is expected so with this mindset, it wasn’t that hard to navigate through college. I come from an Asian background and we are expected to go to college so that we can have a better future and live better lives. Thinking about my future and having thoughts about how I see myself in the future living the life I want has motivated me to keep going forward. College can be stressful and challenging at times, but my experiences in college were not difficult at all. Personally, I also enjoy learning new things, exploring different subjects, and want to be well-rounded, and this helped me navigate through college. I put in a lot of effort into my work and the hard work pays off when I see the grades that I want."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2185,"Both of my parents finished a Bachelor's degree in college and they always remind me that education is the only treasure that they can give to me. My parents always remind me that education is the most important and that it is the only thing that can get me through everything and that no one can steal it from me. In our family, we value education like a treasure that's why most of us in the family have a degree. There is competition but everyone in the family supports and celebrates the accomplishment of each other and that's what makes us motivated and strive more. I value my family, my education, and also my faith in God. My belief and faith in my God are the most important because I know I can't do anything without His guidance and protection. I know He is the one that gives me the strength and knowledge that I used in my everyday life. I know I have a purpose in this world and maybe one of the purposes I have to do in my life is to support my family and become a microbiologist in the future and maybe I will contribute a significant discovery that will help the science field. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2180,"Throughout my life, my parents have taught me to work hard for everything that I hope to achieve in life. Nothing will be given to me, and it's best if I don't expect anything in return.  Now, my community has actually thought me the same thing, but in a more judgy way. However, the people in my community also thought me more about the values of life. My friends as well. Now, this has helped me in college due to the fact that I know that I have to work twice as hard in life, being a woman of color, and I am okay with that. It motivates me and drives me to pursue my dreams and my goals. Nonetheless, I also have to say that I was in a pretty difficult high school. That school has also thought me struggle, pain, and sadnest. And, the fact that I was able to overcome all these things proved to me that I was more than ready for college."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2186,My background is of filipino descent. My family came from the Philippines and came here through joining the US Military and being able to bring their family here. I am Filipino-American and I feel privileged to live here in the United States because I have so many opportunities to be able to accomplish my goals. I was born and raised in a Christian community of believing in God and my faith has been vital in helping me navigate through college and choices in my life. I also realize that I come from a lower class society where my parents struggled to pay the bills and get by. I am very appreciative of the financial support that FAFSA gives me in order to attend college and not have to pay for college out of pocket. I see the struggle that other families have trying to put their kids through college without the availability of FAFSA so I understand that what I have is a blessing and should not be taken lightly. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2189,"I remember being given the oppurtunity to take classes that interest me. I took AP biology in high school.  I enjoyed doing lab experiments and presentations.  I enjoyed learning about diseases, genetics, and blood biology. I remember my senior year of high -school, I took Biomed, the class taught me how to do research and write research papers in the biology language. It was the first time I centrifuged blood and urine. What helped me succeed in the class was going to tutorials and get help from the teacher. Having people to talk to in the class has helped me so far in my college career because it gives me motivation.  I took human anatomy at a community college that I found difficult but I enjoyed working with a cadaver and learning about muscles. I remember the first time I held a real human brain and heart. Taking this class made me appreciate my body more since I was learning about the origin and location of body organs and what purpose they serve."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2181,"My family consists of educated people who had high educations and also of those who had very little education but worked hard in their lives to make it to a place they are very content with.  I definitely had educational pressure on me growing up and I was also expected to get good grades, which I did but as I got older it was harder because my ADHD got worse so my family let loose a bit. Seeing many of my family members work hard in school and get their dream job really motivated me to work harder. They made me realize that hard work will get you far in life and it would one day pay off. Since I come from a family of doctors and engineers, there was constantly that extra push and stress to do well in school. The community I grew up in is very different than my family. It was more modern and loose and people around me believed you can be anything you want as long as your happy. This was a nice balance for me. "
