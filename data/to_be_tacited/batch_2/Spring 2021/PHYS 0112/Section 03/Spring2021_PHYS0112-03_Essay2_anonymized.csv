2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2189,I want to be a nurse midwife. Who is able to understand the needs and the difficulties poor communities experience when it comes to child mortality and mother's mortality. I have taken a lot of biology courses that have helped me understand the human body. What I can't wait for are the upper division classes that drive deeper into the human biology and the cultural aspects of health care system. Taking Physics this semester is a huge challenge for me because I have never been a mathematical thinker before. Passing this class will be prove that I can do anything so being a nurse midwife won't affect my mental stability with the hardship it brings. I want to be an example to those  who feel at times that there aren't smart enough to accomplish anything they want to especially women who have been deemed as weak and stupid just because they are black. I want to explore my creative mind as well in order to be well and all grounded black woman in science. I hope the end of this year I will have learned so much about my limits.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2188,"My goals are to complete all my assignments, to be successful in my physics class and to earn a passing grade for my classes. This class can help me understand some of the concepts that we go over in lecture more deeply. This class can help me achieve my goals by giving me more practice with the problems and the space to ask for help when needed so that I can complete those problems correctly. This is also my first time taking a physics class and I hope to get the support that I need from this lab class. I believe that I can be successful in this class by completing the work assigned to us our class session. To earn a passing grade in this lab course and my lecture, I will attend all the zoom meeting and engage during our breakout room discussions. By doing so, I think that I would be successful in reaching my goals. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2186,"My goal for my career is to become a nurse practitioner. My end goal is to live comfortably without having to worry about bills or having enough money. This is my main drive for succeeding in my classes and doing assignments well. I just want to be able to not have to worry about paying for anything, but just enjoy life without the restrictions of money. I have seen my family struggle and now experience my own struggle with having enough finances to just get by in life. I am grateful that financial aid assists me greatly to be able to pursue my career goals and help my family and I get out of the lower class and live more comfortably. I can do this by trying my best in all the classes I am in. This includes this physics class. If I earn an A in this class it will allow me to be one step closer to receiving my bachelor's degree in physiology and then get into the masters of nursing program. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2191,"My goals are understanding the basic knowledge of physics, understanding a given problem and being able to solve it. I feel like this class is helping me to achieve those goals. I found that the activities in the labs are simple and very helpful for me to understand little details that are not addressed in the lecture class. From understanding vectors to identifying the direction of forces and direction of motion, I feel like these activities provided in the lab can help me work better on my physics homework and solving physics problems. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2187,"One of my goals for this class is to learn more physics and expand my knowledge on the topic. I have always struggled with physics so I am already not a big fan of it, but being taught by professors who all have different teaching styles has helped me understand more topics than I did before. I know physics can be applied to all sorts of things so I'm hoping that if I gain enough knowledge in this class, I can be even more successful in other areas of my life. If I walk away knowing the bare minimum at the end of the semester, I will still be happy because that will give me a place to start. I plan on continuing my career in the medical field so I will need to be proficient in some level of physics. If I am able to learn the basics now and retain that information, then I will be able to continue dwelling into the subject. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2181,"My goals are to pass my classes this semester without fully giving up. It has gotten harder through the week and the workload is starting to increase for all my classes. With this Physics class, I hope to better understand the subject and do well on any upcoming tests or quizzes. I hope I can set time aside to study the materials I am having trouble with and organize them into parts so it won't be overwhelming. This class is helping me achieve my long-time goal which is to graduate with a bachelor of science degree and go on to medical school and this class is a requirement. I hope to understand the materials really well so I can do well on the MCAT."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2182,"My goals as of right now are all over the place, everday my goal changes right now at this moment my goal is to focus on school and try to make time for everything since my life is getting hectic and there never seems to be a peaceful moment. This class isn’t really helping me in reach my goals but it will help me get there since it’s a requirement when your a biology major therefore this class is sort of helping me reach my goals to better my future. Also my other goal is to be independent and have my own career and house and be able to take care of my family so they can live peacefully and not have to worry about anything. This class is helping me reach my goals by making it easier to understand how things around me are constantly working and how physics does imply on everyday life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2195,"I enrolled in physics 112 because I want to learn more about physics. I want to have a deep knowledge about the concepts of physics. Physics is hard and really hard to understand, however, the activities that we have done so far in this lab helped me to think and analyze. Moreover, I am enrolled in this class because I want to have a connection with my colleagues. What I love about labs is that there are less people in a class, which made it easy for me to get to know other people. My goal for this class is to learn how to collaborate with other people. My goal is to learn from other people’s ideas, opinions, and background. I believe that having a connection with my colleagues would make me a better person. In this way, I will be able to understand people around me, like my coworkers, or patients. By working with other people in this lab, I will learn how to have an efficient team work. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2185,"My goal for this class is to understand the concept of every topic we will discuss and will have an idea to apply it in my everyday life. Also, I want to learn more about this class so I can use it in my next class that has a connection with physics. For my overall goal in life, I want to finish my Bachelor's Degree in Biology Concentration in Microbiologist. When I finish this, I will use it to apply for Nursing, and hopefully, it will be easier for me to get into the Nursing Program. I know this class will help me achieve my goals in life as it is one of the major classes I have to take to get my Bachelor's Degree. Not just that but I know that this class is helping me to learn more about the science of how things work and applying different topics in our everyday life without even realizing it. I know it wouldn't be easy but I am looking forward to finishing this class with a better understanding of the concept of physics. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2183,"My goal is to be able to recognize a physics question and know how to apply a reasonable guess of my answer to the problem. I have had issues understanding the basics of physics in the past and this would help a lot. Currently, I am doing alright with recognizing problems and using logic to solve them. This class is going at a good speed and I am really grasping the info. In a broader sense, my goal is to be a dentist. I have been working as a dental assistant for almost 3 years now and I love my job. Physics plays a big role in dentition and it would be cool to have some general concepts in my repertoire before dental school. I think what will throw me off is angled forces and converting acceleration graphs to the position. I will hopefully be able to ask all the questions I need to clarify my knowledge. So far, this lab helps a lot in really understanding the info and processing it in combination with class.:)"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2193,"Currently my goals are to graduate college as soon as possible with a bachelor’s degree in general biology and to find a job that relates to my career after graduating. I also want to take a little break before I continue the next chapter of my life. My goal is to also get a master’s degree. I still haven’t figured out what my career would look like or what I want to pursue yet, so I will need to figure that out soon. My plan is to graduate this upcoming fall semester. With this ongoing pandemic, I hope I can achieve my goals smoothly. In order to achieve my goals, I would need to take all my major classes for my degree and this class is one of the requirements. Taking this class is helping me by fulfilling those requirements and also this class would be helpful for the next physics class, Physics 121."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2196,My goals are to graduate college and be able to pass my classes this semester. My goal is to be motivated in being able to do all my schoolwork. This class is helping me achieve these goals by it it is one the classes I need to take to be able to graduate later on in the future. This class is helping complete the requirements for my major. My major is biochemistry and this class is useful for my requirements. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2190,My academic goals are to graduate with a bachelor's in Biology with concentration in Ecology. Ultimately I'd like to be doing work I value in the areas of benefiting animals and the environment. I'd like to make contributions to these areas so after a day of work I can feel accomplished that I did something I found important. My goals for this class are to complete the class with a passing grade in order to make progress toward completing my major requirements. Although I will not be going into physics moving forward I am sure some concepts I learn from this class will help as background in the future or at the minimum to help me through the second level of physics. This class will also further my critical thinking skills as we practice physics problems using different strategies to solve the problems as well as provide a networking opportunity to connect with classmates who are also taking this course in similar STEM majors.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2180,"﻿﻿Honestly, I am not certain of my future goals. I am just focusing on a few goals that I can complete within a week or a month. However, the only future goal that I am certain of is the fact that I want to become a scientist. I would like to work in the cell and molecular field. But, I am not quite sure what I want to do exactly (as a career). I just know that I am not interested in anything in the medical field nor teaching. I am interested in research, but I feel like i should do a bit more investigation on the different careers that biology offers. Moreover, this is something that i love about the field: the fact that there is a significant range of different career choices to choose from. I am someone who needs monthly changes in my life. I need to have something to change in my routine at least once or twice every month. Thus, I know that I would not be able to  do the exact same job for the rest of my life."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2192,"I have many goals and plans that I have set for my future. My main goal is to earn a bachelor’s degree in Kinesiology at SFSU. This class will help me achieve that goal, by leading me on the right path. After taking this class I will have the necessary skills and knowledge to proceed in my future classes. After getting my bachelor's degree, I hope to join a 2-3 year nursing program, either at SFSU or another school that I’m interested in. From there, I will be working as a registered nurse. I may want to advance my education and become a nurse practitioner. I hope to make enough money to support myself and my family. None of this will be possible, without being enrolled in Physics, first. As a result, I will study and work hard in this class to achieve a good grade and the proper education so that I can get one step closer to my goals."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2194,"My goals are not set at the moment. Physics is helping me explore the world of science and become more knowledgeable of the systems within physics and how it could apply to daily life. Although I do not have a set academic or career goal, my plan is to get a BA in zoology and a minor in business. This class servers as a requirement to become successful in my plan and should teach the basic understanding of mechanics in this world.  The lab should help me better understand the concepts learned in the lecture, and enforce the goals of the course. My goal for this class is to succeed and understand how physics relates to zoology and the biological field in general. This class serves as a support and practice for me to take what I learned in lectures and apply it to a situation or scenario that will hopefully assist my future occupation."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2184,"My goals are to get an A in this class and to understand the material. Although I wasn't completely confident that I would get an A, after working with Professor Ghosh, I am more confident now. I may not comprehend all of the material right away, but as long as I apply myself, I'm sure that I'll be able to understand the material. The way I will get an A is taking into account all of the assignments and their due dates, and to get them done before their due date. Watching youtube videos also helps, and making sure that I at least spend 2 hours a week on this class for the homework. By getting an A in this class, I will be able to reach my goal of getting a Bachelor's in Biology with a concentration in Physiology so I can become a PA in pediatrics or a Behavioral Analyst for special needs. "
