2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2184,"The resources that I have to support me are the slides from lecture, and the online textbook provided by the online homework. I also have resources of my Professor who is available on Mondays and Thursdays for office hours from 1:30-3:30. I have utilized all three resources provided by my professor at least once before. Resources that I have used that are not provided by the class are my TI-83 calculator, and the mathway website to simplify algebraic equations. I have also utilized my notes that I take during lecture, and my classmates' opinions and input during lecture as well. I also have resources in my lab, with my professor who has office hours on Friday from 1-2 PM. During the labs, the resource I use a lot is google docs in case I need to write things down and download them into a PDF, or google slides in case I have to ""draw"" something. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2188,"I have a lot of resources that can support me. I can attend office hours from my lecture portion of my physics course for support. My lecture professor, Professor Xu, holds his office hours on Monday from 5:00 pm to 6:30 pm and from 2:30 pm to 4:00 pm on Thursdays. I also have this lab section so that I can ask for help if I need. There are also office hours for this lab section that I can go to for additional support. I am also enrolled in a physics SCI class that meets every week on Friday that I can ask for help in. For the SCI class, we go through a worksheet every week as a whole class. We are also encouraged to ask questions when we are stuck. I know that I have many resources that I can go to for help and I feel supported throughout my classes."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2180,"I will be looking at this question from an academic perspective. SFSU offers a lot of different programs and services to support me. Those include, but are not limited to, the metro program. I also like the fact that my teachers are understanding of our current situation, and offer the opportunity to attend office hours. This allows us, students, to further understand the topic, which has a significant impact on our academic goals. Thus, it does help support us. Other resources that I find super helpful are advising meetings and advisors. The students are able to seek help concerning anything from their major to their career path. I am really amazed by this school. It truly offers an abundant amount of resources, while also supporting and meeting our every need. I am nothing negative to say so far, and I feel very comfortable in this environment. I hope that this experience continues as such."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2191,"I have a lot of resources to support me, however I tend to carry things on my own and rarely ask for help. There are so many supports from the school if I ever struggle with studying or inconvenience. Tutoring is a great support from the school that shows the school really wants to help their students study better, and I deeply appreciate their effort in supporting students. Not only in academic achievement, the school also provides an amazing support for the wellbeing of the students. I recently found out that the school offers fitness sessions through zoom in order to keep the students healthy during the time of pandemic. The faculties also offer great support if their students have any inconvenience during the remote learning and I really appreciate their understanding. Without the support of the school, the students would not be able to carry on their study."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2192,"I have several resources to support me with my school work and plans for my future.  One main resource that I have is the internet. If I am ever confused on something or if I need more clarification, the internet is a very great tool to have. For example, the internet has YouTube videos on every single  topic that I am learning that can be watched for further clarification and examples. Additionally , there are numerous sample problems that I can use to practice. Another resource that I have access to is people that have similar experiences to mine, who can give me advice. For instance, my older sister and her boyfriend are seniors of SFSU and I feel comfortable asking them questions to ensure that I am on the right track. Additionally, I can contact my peers who are in the same classes as me. Finally, another resource that I have access to is my teachers and professors in my classes. They can always be emailed or contacted if I have questions or concerns. I can also attend office hours where I can express any confusions that I have. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2185,"During these difficult times, we all need support from someone or something to help us survive or finish what we started. When it comes to school, the resources I have to support my learning and studying are my professors, online classmates and my family. Also, during virtual classes what we need right now is online support like watching youtube tutorial how to do math problems or laboratory homework or observation regarding an experiment conducted. I feel like during these times, online searching and watching educational videos are very helpful in our learning especially for laboratory experiments because we can't do it in-person to observe what's really happening. In most of my classes, we have discord to support and help each other doing homework or just reminding each other about upcoming homeworks that is due or upcoming exams. Having someone to talk to is also helpful and I'm very thankful that I have my cousin with me who is also studying in San Francisco State University that guides me in everything that I do. I am looking forward to finishing this semester with a good grade that will help me succeed and have a better future. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2186,"The resources I have that support me and that I can depend on, in the reference to classes and school is usually the internet. This is if I cannot figure out the answer from using lectures and the teacher. Khan academy and youtube in general has been a huge help in explaining topics that I need extra help on. Sometimes certain teacher's teaching methods are not effective for me so I look for other resources and try to learn from other places. Also another great tool that I need to utilize more often is the course books that are recommended. Seeing figures and things written out really help me understand concepts so sometimes the book is very helpful to me.  In terms of life in general, resources that I have to support me is my friends and family. I have a hard time asking for help but when I finally do, the people in my life almost always have a solution or a plan of action that I could follow to help me accomplish my goals at the moment. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2181,"The resources that I have to support mean are pretty much only the internet. If I am having trouble with anything I deem it faster to do a quick search on google. my siblings are young so they haven't gone through the education that I have and my parents don't understand much. So with the internet, I will also get many examples of an equation if I am having trouble with it versus a teacher who would only help you with that one equation you ask about. They are many youtube tutorials on various subjects. Because of the current situation we are in I can't physically go to a teacher (there is email but I can't do much with that)  and I won't be able to hire a tutor to come and help. So I visit trusted sites to help me with my course works. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2194,"There are many resources on campus such as the tutoring center, ASPIRE, the work center, and healthcare center. I can also email my professors directly, and contact my friends and family. Outside of school there are emergency hotlines and 911. There are several resources I can turn to, as well as people who can recommend things for me, or guide me when I need help. At the end of the day, it is up to me to reach out to someone if I am concerned with anything or think I may need help. These resources should be safe places where I know I can go without being judged, or harmed. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2195,"There are a lot of resources to support, first that comes into my mind is my professors. They constantly give me advices on how to excel more in my academics. Another resources that supports me is the SFSU library. In the SFSU library, I can find a lot of scientific articles that I can use as a biology major. I appreciate it that I do not have to pay in order to have access on a research article. Another resource that supports is the financial aid. As a student, it is hard to work and at the same time go to school. By the help of the financial aid, I am supported financially. I have an extra money to pay my bills and also to pay for textbooks that I need. Lastly, Khan Academy has helped me a lot in this remote learning. It is very hard to learn through online learning because there is no in person interaction with the professor and with my peers. Khan Academy has a lot of videos and articles on certain topics that I am currently learning. Through Khan Academy, I can easily understand the topics and concepts that I am learning in my classes because they provide simple and easy to understand lectures. They also provide additional problem exercises for me to work on. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2183,"I know I have resources available to me, the hard time that I have is finding the time to access them or to even do what I need. I am working full time while taking 19 units this semester and being online for school has been really challenging. my executive disfunction is running rampant. I know that I can reach out to professors and assistant teachers but I don't usually get around to it. It's especially hard to get to office hours because it's during my workday. I don't think I have a hard time understanding the information because I do well on tests but it's more of the time-consuming things I struggle to stay on task. I have lots of online resources for when I need help. In other classes, I have classmates too that I have interpersonal connections with, not so much this class though unfortunately. I don't like doing online classes because it's really hard to stay motivated or feel a personal attachment to when we are learning. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2190,What Resources Do I Have to Support Me?There is probably a number of resources available to me as a student and STEM major at SFSU. I believe there is tutoring services offered through my college. Professors have office hours to answer questions about the material. There are academic advisors for Biology to help me create my academic path.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2189,"Looking at the different resources we have at San Francisco State, I have being a part of HPW this program has helped me socialize and also helped with my knowledge when it comes to dealing with stress, eating healthy foods, exercise, healthy habits when it comes to relationships and use of drugs. I find myself in the room where we talk about the different issues we as students are having during this time. I have my parents are also my support system when it comes to providing housing and food. This is huge because I would have to work during the semester in order for me to provide food for myself and support. I have my friends to talk to when I feel down. I also have an advisor that I talk to when I have stress about classes and she advises me where to go for help like talking to my professors."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2193,"When I need help, the resources that I use to help support me depends on the situation. If the problem is personal and related to my everyday life, then I would ask for help from my friends, family, or the internet. If I have trouble with things that are academic related, then I would usually reach out to my professors. I have tried using undergraduate advising before when we were on campus. During the pandemic, I have used advising provided by my major through zoom and it was very helpful, although it wasn't as convenient as it would be in person. There are many resources offered by the school that were very helpful such as, gator groceries and services provided by the library. Some other resources that I have made use of during the pandemic were resources provided to my family by where I live. These things include mainly groceries, hand sanitizers, and masks. "
