2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2196,What I like to do when life gets challenging is to take a step back and let myself feel all the emotions. Life can get very overwhelming ad extremely challenging. I highly recommend breathing exercises and just taking a step back. Also to be able to pick a day for yourself and to just enjoy your own presence. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2186,"When life gets challenging, sometimes I have a mental breakdown. Then I end up doing things that I can control. For example, cleaning helps me feel better, and working out. I try to accomplish little things (whether its small easy assignments or cleaning something up) in order to make me feel like I am in control and have power over my life. I also go to God and ask him for help with my anxiety and ask him to reassure me that everything is going to work and in the end, it does. I am grateful to have a great support system composed of my boyfriend and family that I can always go to for help and reassurance as well. After I am able to calm myself down, I approach the challenge and try to see if there is something I could do about it or if its something I have to just leave up to God to handle. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2194,"When life gets challenging, I don’t have much of a choice but to keep going. Time will not stop because I need a break, which means, I have to push through. Challenging moments in life do not last forever, and if I think I will need an extra break, I like to get my assignments done early so I can get some extra free time. Otherwise, I always plan about an hour or two for lunch and dinner as break time. During that time I can eat, sleep, and watch some television to relax. If things are extra busy, I have to try avoiding distractions and maintain the momentum to keep going in terms of assignments and upcoming exams. Life gets tough, and there’s nothing we can do about it. The way to get through these times is to talk it out, and find a way to relieve that stress. Look forward to breaks, and be sure to take a full break without thinking of work."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2193,"When life gets challenging, I usually think about the problem a lot and stress out about it. If there is a way to solve the problem, then I would look for a solution and try to make things work. If the problem can’t be fixed, then I would have to deal with it. For example, I was planning out which classes to take during the upcoming summer and fall semesters, but the summer classes I plan on taking all have time conflicts. I would need to take at least six units for financial aid, but the other classes that are required for my major is not offered during the summer. There is nothing I can do about it but hope that more classes would be available during the summer. For other types of problems, I would usually talk to a friend or my family and vent out my frustrations or find alternatives for the solution. One thing I also do is try not to think about it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2190,"What do I do when life gets challenging?When life gets challenging, I think it is important to focus on taking care of my health; physical, spiritual, and emotional. For my physical health I like to focus on eating right and trying to get a decent amount of exercise in. For exercise, I try to roller skate whenever I can. For the less physical aspects, I like to spend time with my roommates and do something relaxing like watch a show I enjoy or listen to music. I also think it's important to evaluate why life is getting challenging to begin with. More often than not, it could be a matter of overscheduling and doing too much. To some extent, it is inevitable as a college student supporting myself, but some of it can be prioritized into the things that deserve my energy most and the things that aren't so important. When life gets hard in classes, I like to be mindful of if the material is feeling too challenging/too easy or if its a matter of feeling like there is not enough time. For the former, I try to prioritize more study time and ask instructors or classmates questions I may have and try to make sure I'm setting myself up to learn best. For the latter, its a matter of prioritization of my time and figuring out how to use it best between working and schooling."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2192,"This school year has definitely brought many new challenges and obstacles that I have had to learn to adapt to. Switching to online learning was a struggle, and I felt unmotivated. However, I learned to adapt to this change a found a way to make it work for me, by putting aside time each day to focus on my work.  When life gets challenging, I cannot simply just give up and ignore the problem because it's not going to go away. Instead, I make a plan to defeat and overcome the challenge. It helps to make a list and slowly cross everything off. There are times when i get really overwhelmed by the large amount of obstacles. in these cases, I take a break from everything and give myself a little time to just breathe and be on my own. It helps me clear my mind and stay focused. Even though it may take some time, it is worth it in the end. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2187,"When things get tough I usually start by looking for an immediate solution. If I can't find one within a sufficient amount of time, then I'll ask someone for help. In the meantime, I will take a break from the problem and go do something else to refresh my mind. I will also try to solve the problem using different techniques to see if there is an alternate solution. In terms of school problems, I will reach out to my peers first and then resort to reaching out to the professor. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2185,"This past few weeks, it's been very difficult for me. I have been really stressed out about my family, financial and especially at school. I am behind in some of my classes that I don't have enough time to finish my homework and submit it on time. In times like this, I usually take a day or two to do something that I enjoy and don't think about all the things that give me stress. I enjoy scrapbooking and rewatching my favorite movies. I also go somewhere where I can relax and just appreciate the beauty of life. I like to go to the park and jog. It's very relaxing and it eases my mind. I like to go to the beach and smell some fresh air. In this kind of situation, I just think about my future that all of this is gonna be worth it as soon as I finish my school. I just have to stay on my track where I have to focus on my priorities, especially in school. I have to remind myself that I'm doing all these to have a better future and so I could help my family especially my parents who support me and guide me in everything that I do in my life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2181,When life gets hard the first thing I notice that I do is seek assistance from the internet. They have answers for everything. when particularly school gets hard I would search up youtube videos on the subject to better understand it. when I need some assistance in my life like inspirations or ideas I also use the internet. Sometimes the answer is hard to find so I would research further. It's a tool that I use when I am put in situations that I can solve myself or with the help of others. when I am stressed I would take a break and go on the internet. I like to learn new things and see new things and enjoy my show then come back to reality and with a clearer mind. So when life gets challenging I seek assistance from the internet. Growing up I have always used the computer for work or school so I have become very accustomed to it.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2183,"When life gets challenging, I react depending on what ways I am being challenged. I have had a lot of health struggles and that I can handle piece of cake, I can push through and be ok. When it's more mental health problems and I don't see a specific cause that is the reason behind my struggles, I have a hard time seeing a clear path to working through. I often get caught in my own head and because I am an anxious person in general, I internalize everything and I tend to avoid things because I freak myself out. It's something I've been working on for a while. Life is challenging right now, not going to lie. The pandemic has been really hard in that limiting ways of interacting with people and that I feel distanced from everything, even caring about things I should. I was fine at the beginning, but I'm so busy I don't set myself up for success, and now that it's so late in the semester, everything is harder."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2188,"When life gets challenging, I remind myself that things will get better and that this is just a phase. This motivates me to see past the challenge and see things in a different light when things get difficult. I also seek help or advice from my friends whenever things get challenging. Sometimes, just speaking to them helps alleviate some of the negative emotions that I have. I think I’ve gotten better at asking for help and that also helps me when overcoming challenges. Another thing that I do when life gets challenging is to prioritize time for myself. I try to go on walks and get enough sleep. Self care is important for me and my mental health. It helps me stay sane really. But most of the time I just learn to accept things as they are. Things don’t go as I wanted them to go and I do my best to still get through. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2195,"Being a college student is never easy. I feel like the closer you are in reaching your goal, the harder the journey becomes. I believe that I am where I am now because God put me here. Everything falls in the right place when it is God who works. All the failures and mishaps that I went through is one of the many reasons why I continue in my journey. Whenever I am going through something, I always think of the phrase “this too shall pass,” and do my best to solve my problem. I always think that if I quit now, all the hardships that I went through will all be for nothing. My purpose is the reason why I get up in the morning and fight. Sometimes, I can be lost and unmotivated, but I thank God, my family, friends for redirecting me to my purpose and goals in life. I am thankful for all the people that are willing to be with me in my journey. I know that I can do all things with God who gives me strength. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2182,"One thing I tend to do once life gets challenging is trying to take deep breaths and watching something that can cheer me back up, for me its watching my kpop groups funny moments since they tend to cheer me up, lately its been really rough due to a lot of family problems which is why I've been slacking a lot sadly which I should not but life some times hits hard like a roller coaster. I also tend to knit a lot which makes me calm and takes my stress away. Also, classes this semester have been dragging me down therefore, I have had no motivation to try since teachers don't reply to emails nor do they understand that it is really hard learning at home. Also, I try to stay positive since when I am negative I am just making it more worse for myself than making it better. These are some things I tend to do when I am feeling challenged when things are getting hard in life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2189,"When life is challenging I take a step back and reflect on my feelings and actions. Lately, I have been taking breaks when I need them so I don't burn out. I watch a favorite show as the big bang theory for a good laugh and relaxation. I have been trying to go outside often but I always end up staying in the house and taking a power nap. I also do some personal care activities like foot scrubbing at home and cutting my nails. I also take a 30-minute shower and use essential oils for relaxation. I also vent to my sister about stuff and listen to music that gives me motivation. I drive to sceneries and view the ocean and I love taking pictures and listening to music during my car drives. I have also been walking around the house as exercise and the chine squat poses for my back."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2191,"I learned that when life gets challenging, it is necessary to stay calm and try not to panic or overthink about the situation. Oftentime, I reach out to my close friends and family in search of advice and comfort. I know a lot of people would panic and become pessimistic because they think that there is nothing they can do to improve the situation. I remember the first time I ever faced a challenge in my life, I did not know what to do but panic and thought that there is nothing I can do to get myself out of the situation. Eventually, it got better as I constantly went through challenges, I learned how to manage my emotions. Instead of letting myself drown in intrusive thought and wasting time on panicking, I learned to ask for help rather than struggling to deal with the situation alone. It is really helpful to have people to help us during our hardships."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2180,"Life will always put obstacles in your way, one way or the other. Thus, what truly matters is how you deal with the situation and what we will do in order to surpass it. It certainly will not be easy.When life gets challenging, I tell myself to focus on the important stuff, all while trying to think in a positive way. It's harder sometimes, but it helps. I also tell myself that it won't last. To just get through it as best as I can, and try to move on from it, and/or learn from it. Honestly, I don't know what else I would do in different scitiations. But, I spoke from past experiences. All I can do now is hope that I remember to stay calm, to stay focus and as motivated as  I can. It will get better.I also hope that the challenges that I face have some advantages in the long run."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2184,"What I do when life gets challenging is reflect on why I am feeling challenged, prioritize in my life, and what is getting in the way of accomplishing my goals. For example during this semester, it was really challenging for me to manage attending 4 classes at SFSU and one class at skyline and work 3 part-time jobs, in addition to the nonprofit I work for and help around the house with my family. In order to manage my time well, I had to realize that the reason I was so stressed and felt challenged was because of the fear that I would let those around me down. Afterward, I prioritized that school came first, I figured out that what was getting in the way of accomplishing my goals was poor time management. I then reorganized my work schedule to revolve around school hours, and had to schedule specific time to work on homework and spend time with family. "
