Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2180,"﻿Growing up, I was very interested in science. To the point where I even asked my parents for a scientific microscope. However I never really understood how that passion came to be. I was only surrounded by the subject at school, but not really in my home. I only have one family member who studied a science subject but she didn’t live near me. Furthermore, I am here to pursue a career in science which begins by attending an undergraduate program. I am here to concentrate on my classes, all while maintaining a healthy mentality towards it all. More specifically, I will try my best at school, all while trying my best not to be overwhelmed mentally. Nonetheless, I am here to begin my journey into the “science world.” I plan on devoting the rest of my life to the advancement of science. I am not quite sure what I will be specializing in, but I am currently interested in cell and molecular."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2181,"The reason I am in this Physics 112  is because it is a required class for my major. My major is biology and I hope to obtain a bachelor’s degree then apply to medical school after. I want to become an optometrist and hopefully open up my own clinic one day.  I took physics once before in high school and I did not do so well. Got the lowest grade I have ever gotten in high school.  The subject scared me so much that I stayed away from it as long as I could. Based on both my lab and lecture professors I am actually excited to be here. They have been nothing but kind and fair. So far I  understand what I am doing and I hope this continues throughout the semester. I know I have to put in my own effort, I am prepared to do so. So the reason I am here is because I want to take the next step in my education and hopefully graduate soon by completing and passing all the required classes."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2182,"Ariana AzamiPHYS 112-03Professor Ghosh10 February 2021Reflective Journaling #1Why am I here? The reason I am here to be honest is because I kept living even when times get rough and I couldn’t take myself out, but now I am doing good in life there are still some things I wish could change in my life but I have no control over those things, so I just have to be strong and keep moving and working hard until I leave my toxic household one day hopefully. Also, I am here because I want to become a better role model for my siblings without me, they would be lost sadly since they depend on me highly and come to me for everything, they need help whether that be life, school, financially, and etc. So, I keep it going for them too and not just myself. Also, I am here because my grades and participation in school helped me into getting accepted into a four-year CSU instead of going to a community college, which makes me the first in my family to go to a four year."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2183,"Christa CollmanWhy am I here?I am taking this intro level physics class for several reasons. I tried taking physics several times in the past. I attempted taking AP Physics in high school and nothing clicked so I dropped it. Then, I tried to take it at Smith College, but I had issues with the professor and my health which caused me to miss too many classes to pass. I have taken Calc 1 and 2 but some things about physics still confuse me. There is something about some of the general concepts that logically don’t make sense to me...  I am looking forward to this class for a deeper understanding of the course material. I am a dental assistant who wants to go to dental school myself so I need 2 semesters of physics to not only take the DAT but to apply to schools. There is so much physics in the world around us and I am hoping that I will be able to apply my knowledge for greater STEM concept understanding and analysis."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2184,"I am here because I need to satisfy this course, along with PHYS 111, in order to graduate with a Bachelor's in Science in Biology with a concentration in physiology at San Francisco State University. With that major, I plan on applying to be either a Behavioral Analyst for Special Needs kids, or a Physician's Assistant in Pediatrics. Although this course is just a requirement, that does not mean it does not have any other effect on my life outside of school. For instance, I am able to go to this school because of the scholarships that I was awarded. If I do not maintain a high GPA, then I may not be able to be eligible for a renewal. So no matter how relevant the courses I am taking are to my major, each of them are equally impactful in terms of my financial aid. I am here to not let that scholarship money go to waste and to not be a disappointment to my family. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2185,"Why am I here?  I am taking this class because it is a major requirement for my Bachelor's degree in Biology Concentration in Microbiologist. I actually have no idea about this class but I'm sure it will help me in my future goal and career. I don’t know what to expect in this class but I know it will help me in my everyday life as taking this class will help me understand the concept of energy, force, and motion that we do everyday. When I took the pre learning physics survey in class, I kind of got the idea about physics and why it is important to learn. I didn’t realize that we actually use physics in our everyday lives like doing grocery shopping that involves calculations. I can't even remember the last time I took a physics class but I am looking forward to learning more about this class. I know it will be difficult for me because it's online but with the help of professors and my fellow students, I know I can learn something and pass this class. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2186,"I am here mostly because it is a prerequisite for the major that I want to complete. I am currently enrolled to finish my bachelor's degree in biology with a concentration in physiology. I think that this physics class will help me get a basic understanding of the different concepts of physics that I might need later on in life and in the other science courses that I am going to take. I think it is important to have a decent understanding of physics in the science world since it covers the basic study of matter, motion and energy. These concepts are crucial to understand especially since I want to study biology. I would probably end up needing to understand how those different ideas relate to the real world and how I can solve problems later on in life. Energy is an important idea especially to the human body. Eventually I will learn how energy is produced and used throughout our own biological systems and how it relates to the medical world."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2187,"I am a psychology major and will be graduating this semester. I have always been very interested in science and that was why I chose to follow a science career. Even though I love science, I am not really into physics. I find it kind of difficult and I don't see how it is extremely relevant to my career field. I want to be a doctor, so I guess I can kind of see how some physics is needed, but I don't think it is the main focus. I am taking this class primarily to fulfill requirements needed for med school. I also wanted to brush up on my physics knowledge so when I take the MCAT, I am not completely stumped. I hope to pick up some learning techniques that will imbed some of the core points of physics into my mind. I've realized that by taking these classes, I have met a lot of people who are also interested in the medical field and it's been really nice to be able to talk to them. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2188,I am here in this course because I would need extra help with understanding the course materials. I'm kind of anxious about taking physics because I have never taken physics in high school. I have been avoiding physics as much as I could because I heard from other classmates in high school that physics is really hard. I'm kind of scared about physics. I hope to understand more of what we are taught in the lecture through the physics lab. I also hope that I will get to know more about my classmates in this class since there are less of us in the lab than in the lecture. It can also be hard to fully understand a topic or get our questions answered in the lecture since there are so many of us. I think I would be more comfortable in a smaller class such as this lab session. My goal in this class is to attend the zoom meetings every Tuesday and complete all the assignments. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2189,"i'm taking this class because it's a requirement for a biology major. I don't think that this class will help me in my future career as a nurse midwife maybe i'll learn something.I thought I escaped physics in high and I would never have to see it again. I really never liked physics because I always thought of it as a hard subject. I believed  for you to be able to take physics you have to be smart. Since this is introduction to physics that doesn't require advanced math sounds better.I hope in taking this class i'll push my thinking ability and use critical thinking when I come across a problem. I hope I'll be able to learn and not memorize  the material for the sake of the exam. Since labs are online, I know it wont be easy to actually do the practicals but I hope the online stimulations will help. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2190,I am in Physics lab because it is a partner class to physics lecture and also because it is part of my major courses in my major. I am a Biology major with emphasis in Ecology. I am interested in animals and the environment and ultimately want to be doing something that benefits those areas in a positive way. My experiences with physics in the past have been mixed. In high school I did well in regular level physics but now in college I have had to drop physics and lab before due to not understanding the way the instructor was teaching. I am nervous about being prepared for the calculus components of physics this semester but I am optimistic it will be a good semester. I am ready to ask lots of questions as they come up and commit the time to getting practice on the assignments. Hopefully with that I will do well in this class! 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2191,"Personally, I do not like Physics because I am not really good at Physics and I had a bad experience with Physics. My performance in Physics back then was not good and my grade was really bad. I had problems understanding the definition and applied concepts. My major is Pre-Biochemistry and Physics is one of the requirements for my major. Since I did not have good experience with Physics in the past, I am very concerned for my grade and performance in my Physics class. I am taking this class more seriously than before in hope that I could get a better grip of basic knowledge in Physics. I hope that this class will prepare me for a better experience in Physics and make me regain my interest in Physics. I will try my best to understand the problems and I am grateful for the help of the instructor."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2192,"I am here to receive an education on physics. I took a physics class in high school and I did not take away anything from the class as it was very difficult for me to comprehend. I barely took notes, I was on my phone a lot during class, and I did poorly on the tests. I want to be in this class to actually gain an understanding of the subject. I am paying for my education now, so I understand that I must take it serious and take advantage of my class time. This class is also a stepping stone towards the degree I hope to obtain in a few years. I hope to earn a degree in Kinesiology and the only way I can do that is to take this class. I will try my best to understand these class concepts so that I will have further success in the future."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2193,"I am in this class, Physics 112, because it is part of my major requirement. I need to take this class so I can graduate with a bachelor’s degree for General Biology. Besides taking this class as a requirement, I also want to learn more about physics. Taking this class might give me more practice with math, since this class deals with a lot of equations and problem solving. I remember having an enjoyable time during my physics class back in high school, with circuits being my favorite topic. Although we won’t be learning about circuits in Physics 111, it would be nice to refresh my memory of the other physics topics that I have learned before but forgot. It’s been around five years since I last learned or worked with physics. Taking physics is important for my career because all sciences are closely related to each other, and it would expand my knowledge and experience in sciences."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2194,"It was recommended that I take physics before chemistry and my comprehension of physics is better at than chem. Thus, taking chem would be a better option for me to save when we return to in person classes. Physics 112 is a requirement for all biology majors. I am enrolled in this class as a Zoology major, and I am not sure what physics has to do with biology yet. This intro to physics course may serve as a foundation for concepts that I may cover in both chemistry and biology in terms of the limitations or functions of objects and organisms. I have previously taken a physics course in high school and I did enjoy it, however I barely passed the class. This time taking physics I will try to focus on understanding the concepts in terms of situations and how to rethink situations. My previous struggles may have included my slow process of concepts, however, reaching out and getting help with different perspectives should help increase my chances of doing better.    "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,2195,"I am a microbiology major and I need Physics 112 in order to move on to Physics 121. Physics is one of my degree requirements that I need to fulfill. I believe physics is very important for my degree and career because it is teaching me how to solve a problem and also how to efficiently picture a problem that needs to be solved. I took this class because I want to be familiar with solving problems and be an expert on analyzing graphs and calculating data analysis. Furthermore, I know that physics has contributed a lot in the medical field, and so, as an aspiring medical student, I want to know the impacts of physics in healthcare and medicine. Physics is also helpful in our everyday lives. I know physics is everywhere, and so by taking this class, I will be able to understand more what is happening in my surroundings. By studying and understanding physics, I will be able to understand and able to describe the motion, forces, and energy of my surroundings. "
