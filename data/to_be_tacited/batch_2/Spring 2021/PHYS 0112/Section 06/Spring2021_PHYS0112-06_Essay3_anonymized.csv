2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2235,"When life gets challenging, I tend to pray. I turn and trust in my faith when things get tough. Just recently, I've been going through lots of stress due to an overload of schoolwork that gets really hard to do when I am simultaneously battling health issues. So, I've been praying and trying to relax myself. All while still trying to do my work. Before COVID struck, if I was stressed or sad or times were tough in general, I would go to my friends and family for guidance. It's always easier to count on the people you love to be with to make you feel better and relieve yourself of stress. Doing things with family and friends whether it just be chilling and talking, playing games, watching TV or movies, etc., will always be my best way of getting the tough times off of my mind. I think it's always good to give yourself a break once in a while and not overwork yourself. I've learned in psychology courses that stress over the years will lead to illness in the near future depending on the severity of your stress. I am at risk of that. So, I normally don't enjoy being by myself when life gets challenging. I look for people, or faith, to bail me out. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2238,"When life gets challenging I try to let my friends and family in on what is going on. Usually my friends and family give me advice and then I decide for myself what I think the best decision to make is. Honestly, sometimes I don't say anything and won't talk about what's challenging for a few days because I need that time to process what I am feeling and going through. I also try to make sure I am taking care of my mental and physical health by maintaining a good diet, going on walks everyday, and getting enough sleep."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2247,"At this point in my life, I feel like I have gone through many ups and downs but at the downs, I always realize that it's very temporary and that as long as I keep my eye on my end goal, I can get through anything. Even up to very recently, I have had many friends attempt to commit suicide or at least have suicidal thoughts and when they are down like that, I try to teach them the same thing. In my opinion, I feel like the lows are the most challenging to get through but yield the best results. At the more challenging points in the semester I have to keep the same mentality throughout. My ultimate goal is to acquire knowledge to not only achieve my biology degree, but to also lengthen the extent my knowledge of how anything biological tends to work.The downs are just apart of the process so I should just enjoy it while I can!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2251,"When life gets challenging, I continuously try to tell myself that everything is going to be okay. I tend to get overwhelmed with certain tasks, even when they end up becoming easy for me. So I rely on my friends and family to reassure me. I especially do this with my sister. If I bring up how I feel like a failure at certain points in my life, she tells me that I at least tried, and that's a success in itself. I even decide to push my plans away to focus on something that I want to achieve, then I could reward myself with the fun. When life gets challenging, I give myself words of encouragement. I also right in my journal to do deep thinking with myself and reflect on the moment when it is necessary. Overall, I try my best to stay positive. There is no point in putting salt on the wound when I'm already down. All I need to do is believe and I will achieve, with the help of productivity, of course."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2250,When life gets challenging I wonder how I reached that point and reflect on what I should do. It's hard not to quit when the going gets tough but we wouldn't be here if humanity quit at the first sign of trouble. Unfortunately these days I don't have much strength to spare these days with where my life is currently and the virus hitting at a that moment. How can someone be sturdy when day after day you get chunks of pieces taken from you. Just feels like I'm chugging along mindlessly. Talking to friends and family help but its tough.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2242,"when life gets challenging, I like to journal, talk to friends, and pray. I find that keeping my thoughts inside just makes me even more stressed out, so I find that life's challenges pushes me to lean on my loved ones even more. I also like to journal and write out my thoughts because it feels like I'm ""taking the trash"" out of my mind, and I come out of it feeling refreshed and clearheaded. I also like to FaceTime friends or talk to my family about what's on my mind. I also have been loving doing guided meditations and sitting still, and listening to soothing sounds or even silence. I think thinking about good things puts me in a good positive mood, so I try to focus on the good in any situation "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2253,"When life gets challenging I usually turn to family and friends. My boyfriend is a good listener and so I would also go to him. I'm fortunate to have people in my life that I can trust and rely on. Another thing I would do when life gets challenging is I try to keep myself busy and productive, which kind of helps me escape and cope with whatever hardships I'm going through. If I don't have time to think about my problems, they sort of don't exist. Instead of avoiding my problems, I try to find ways to work through them while not making them the center of my world. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2256,"When life gets challenging, I tend to distract myself from whatever is going on. I would distract myself by listening to music, playing video games, or going out for walks. These activities help me get through challenges by distracting myself or making my mind focus on other things. Talking to someone also helps when life gets challenging. Talking to friends or family can help you vent out any emotions that you have, so you don't feel alone."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2246,"What I do is first take a step back. I take deep breaths, and calm myself down. I try to assess the situation, and try to find a way where I can find a solution. Other than that, I like to just go outside, whether that be to go out for a walk, or go to play pickup basketball. I do this because I enjoy physical activity, and while I do any sort of physical activity, that's where I feel the most happy. If I feel like I need to talk to someone, I try to talk to my parents, because I trust them to give my the best possible advice. But I know for a fact that whenever life has gotten challenging for me, I haven't really panicked. I know that life isn't perfect, so the best way to handle the tough times is by staying calm."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2257,"When life gets challenging I usually try to pause and break it down to make it simpler and less overwhelming. Yet, within the past year, I can't say I've done that. I have tried to do something about the challenges, but nothing would resolve, so it lead me into forming the habit of just kind of ignoring it. I noticed I started pushing the challenges under the rug and would just hope nothing too extreme would happen, yet now it's slowly catching up to me. I know some resources can help, but that's just me being stubborn on not reaching out because I have the mentality ""I can do this, I don't need help, I can figure it out on my own."" "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2249,"When things get challenging, whether it’s with school, family, or work, I take a step back and remind myself why I’m here and why I’m doing what I’m doing. I take some time to think of all the people I have in my life that I can rely on when things get rough and I remind myself that I shouldn’t be afraid to lean on them or just talk to them to get something off my chest. I also take time for myself, whether this means not picking up an extra shift at work or even taking a day off for my mental health to kind of “reset”.               More recently, since I made the decision to go back to school to finish undergrad to go to vet school, I remind myself that I’m doing this because I have a purpose and a passion for something. I feel so lucky to be passionate about my career because so many people don’t ever find that. Even if it sounds like a humble brag, it’s something that keeps me going."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2239,"I sleep. I think that method just rushes away from my insecurities out the window until the next day or I just vent/sing/dance to not to get me to think about those things when life gets hard. If it gets really challenging, where to I have no help from my friends, I always ask the professor for help. By going to his/her office hour, I'll be able to develop a bond, so I won't feel uncomfortable speaking to them, because I tend to have a lot of questions of why does that work? what is the cause of it working? and etc... This just develops my thinking as a student who has an open mind to certain topics knowing that some of those certain topics are extremely hard and it's hard to understand and such. Oh, and I play video games to vent out my stress from life knowing that I'm procrastinating to do the work, but for some reason, I work much harder when I procrastinate. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2241,"This is an interesting and important question to ask. The reason I say this is because life hasn't really been the same for me for about two years, close to when I started my college career in late 2019. Before this, there were a few death's in the family and of family friends. But around late 2019 was when the deaths of close people around me felt like it was just exponentially increasing. This, along with starting college, not having many friends at all, being in a turbulent long distance relationship, it was just very overwhelming and has only improved a little bit. ""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" I have no answer for this. Hopefully I'll find an answer to this soon."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2259,"When life gets challenging I spend time with my family. Friends, school, and social media are some of my largest changes I face today. So to cope, I spend time with my family. They love me for who I am and remind me of all the good I bring. People who don't like me or when social media put me down go to the people who love me most. They bring me back that we are just people living our lives for ourselves and no one else. When school gets hard I take a break to either get food or go on a small walk to clear my head. Visiting my friends also releases some of my stress and makes me feel better."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2237,when life gets challenging I tend to put it on myself and try not to bring challenges and problems toward other people just because I don't want them to carry my burden. I was taught to try to solve my own problems and get help only when necessary. But I have also been taught to always ask questions when in times of concern. the sense of knowing where my people are and that they are safe is one of the best ways I cope with challenging times. I rarely talk about my problems and other issues  around me and it goes the same for people in my circle. So whenever there's issues I would try to solve it myself first and I try to help others the best I can if they need my help. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2255,"When life gets challenging, it’s usually because I feel mentally strained and want a break from any work, to just think for myself and treat myself somehow. Especially now during this pandemic, I’ve had a hard time keeping up with classes and assignments, I can’t help but feel like I’m slowing down and it’s so hard to catch up. This obviously doesn’t apply to everyone because life gets the best of people in different ways. To feel better, I like discovering new music, going down deep YouTube holes, watching a movie from my list of many, or catching up with a show. Basically, exploring something new or getting back to things I couldn’t get back to due to school are things I find most comfortable. Honestly, even taking a nap and doing little as possible are other things I do when life gets challenging but they aren’t as fun or enjoyable as the rest."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2252,"When things get challenging I try to write down a to do list and stay organized in school. When I check off things it actually helps me get things done. I like to add in 10-30 min breaks after each thing I get done because that makes me make sure that I am not slacking when I am getting my things done. I remind myself that once I get this done then I can scroll through Instagram or whatever I want to do at that moment. But in terms of life. I try to stay calm and think positively because when I think negatively it starts to get into my head. But then again its hard because I am kind of by myself at this point in my life. Its okay I am sure it will get better, but after the pandemy started, it really revealed who people actually are and it's really funny to think that the people I trusted are actually the people that let me down. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2245,"When life gets challenging I tend to just drop everything for a moment and take time for myself. Whether it be hours or minutes, this is something that helps me feel like I have control of everything. During those times I reflect my life, the good, the bad, etc. by journaling. I also find ways to distract myself from the challenge. By either cooking, listening to music, napping, cleaning, and other various things, which actually helped more than I realized. At first I thought it was me avoiding my responsibilities, but I’ve come to an understanding that this is necessary, that I am simply pausing to focus on myself and I will continue to go back and push through that challenge, once I get ahold of myself. Often though, I do avoid it purposely, but I can never escape it for long, so I'm constantly finding a way to approach it better."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2248,"When life gets challenging, I cry. I know that isn't productive but I feel like the only way to get through something is first to allow myself to be upset and sad and just feel whatever I need to feel. Then I can move on and realize that I can get through it, whatever it may be. I am a very emotional person so I have always felt the need to cry when I am upset and I feel overly joyous when I am happy. I take the good with the bad. I feel like after I cry I am able to think more rationally and able to come up with a solution to the problem I am facing. So, when life gets challenging, I cry and then I figure out how to get through it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2240,"Honestly I'd like to say that I rise to the occasion but in all honesty I kind of just shut down when things become overwhelming and I tend to ignore them.  In physical emergencies I tend to do fine, but when the piles of things for me to do become too great I don't even know where to start so I don't start to fix any problems.  I don't know how to fix that part of me, but I guess I can start to do small things here or there.  I think the biggest challenge for me is that I have ADHD, which makes it hard for me to focus, keep track of time, stick to a schedule, do things I don't want to do, etc.  It really ought to be called Executive Functioning Disorder instead of ADHD, because the symptoms are a lot broader than just not being able to concentrate... but I digress."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,1717,"When life gets challenging I usually get overwhelmed and very anxious about what the future holds. Whether the challenges are presented in school or daily life, I shut out people who I think will not understand what I am going through and only confide in a few friends who I know will support me and not tell everyone my business. When challenges present themselves I tend to find blogs or podcasts about people who experience the same kind of thing and overcame it as motivation. "
