2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2251,"My family is full of many doctors and nurses, so they know what hard work and dedication means when studying in school. Although I am not studying to become a doctor, they are extremely happy that I decided to go to college to pursue a bachelors degree in science. I feel like I need to do well in school, not only for myself, but definitely for them. They try to offer help in any way possible for me to succeed. Aside from my family, my EOP adviser has for sure guided me on the right path. If I need help academically, she is quick to give me the resources to push myself. Whenever I feel down on myself, thinking that I probably won't pass a class, she gives me that little bit of hope and encouragement to continue. I and will finish strong! Thank goodness for these people in my life."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2239,"The values of my community or my family or people who I consider friends have helped me navigate through college when I didn't know how to travel back to visit my home in Hayward from SFSU told me to take this certain line to get to the station in Daly City then travel by BART until I get to South Hayward. Then take a uber/lyft, since my family members were at work. We talked and like played around when like we're still in home, because we're technically still in quarantined but not, but otherwise we are just all stuck in the house, because the outside things we want to do are like closed or some people are not comfortable and don't want to take the risk of hanging out, until everyone gets the vaccine. Uh uh we get boba on Fridays/saturday every 2 weeks, because boba keeps me from going crazy, since I dominantly drink water in the house. And my friends help me nagivate of what to do in college like which professors to take and such."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2257,The values of my community anf family helped me navigate through college by being supportive and being a shoulder to lean on. They helped me comfortable with the idea that what I'm doing is for myself and it's something I'm passionate about. They are my support system and are the ones that encourage me and give me confidence to help me stay determined and motivated.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2248,"I think the values of my family have helped me navigate through college because they remind me that I can do anything I put my mind to. College is hard work but I can do it. My family encourages me to do my best and it makes me want to keep going and not give up. I want to make my family proud and I want to be proud of myself. I won't just give up because I am struggling, I will work harder or find a better way to get things done. They remind me that I have to work hard for some things in life, and college degrees happen to be something I have to work hard to get."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2242,"The values of my community have helped me navigate through college because they have influenced my goals and what I want to do with my life. Specifically I have learned the value of love in everything. the solution to conflict is love, not hate. My parents have also taught me to be grateful for everything I have, which has really helped me during tough moments of my life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2252,"I think my family really helped me at a young age. My mom used to be my number one supporter when it came to school. She was so school oriented for me when I was young so she got me to be school oriented growing up. For example I remember in the first grade we used to have vocabulary tests. I don't know if I used to study for those but I remember I always got some wrong. When my mom found out about what grade I got, she was mad. It was to the point where she made me write the word different 100 times before she got home from work. TO THIS DAY when I write different I literally spell it as I write it. Like I am literally spelling the word in my head as I wrote it twice in here. Another person is my brother. He is 5 years older than me so I had someone to kind of follow through school. We both went to the same elementary, middle, and highschool so if I asked him questions he would help me. I used to go to him for homework help by like 4th grade till 6-7th grade ish, they I stopped because A.) I made friends to do homework with B.) I was growing up and I realized he has homework too. Even now, he always asking how I am doing in college and what's going one!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2241,"The values of my family are such that education is perhaps the most important thing in one's life. My family has a long line of teachers and educators, and a lot of them have degrees with higher education. This honestly is hard to reconcile with my current life because I have never been a stellar student. I love learning and science, but I just haven't been outstanding in getting good grades and standing out. However, I feel like those values of pursuing education no matter what is helping me get through remote learning. As hard as it is to continue with this current and temporary system, my persistence in continuing my education through the pandemic and remote learning is something that has been fostered from my family."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2235,"So far, college has been kind of a solo ride. Not all by myself of course, but it definitely feels more lonely not being able to attend class physically or have to go to school to learn. It's my second semester in college and it feels like it's just been me and my computer. But, we can't really control the fact that covid is here and it affected everyone. Though, the people I surround myself with have still played a big part in keeping me afloat during these past two semesters. My family being at home has been a big part of my happiness since I haven't been able to go out. Also, being in GroupMe chats and Discord servers with some of my classmates across all courses has made it easier to connect with the people from school. My friends from high school and middle school I still get in touch with through video games or social media, so they're always there to lift some stress off of my shoulders. I value the people around me to help keep my mental health good during a stressful freshman year. I've learned in a psychology course that studies have shown that first year college students go through the most stress and I'm feeling that now."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2245,"My family consists of people who were unable to pursue a better education and job, due to immigrating here and not having enough money. Thus they have always wanted me to be and do better in order to have a life that isn't like theirs. Determination is a big value my family and I have, determination is what got me here in college, and how I continue to push through to complete my assignments. Another value is courage, college is terrifying, everything is new and expensive, and I can never guarantee that I will graduate, or pursue my dream career, yet the courage also keeps me going."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2259,My friends and family have helped me navigate through college by just supporting me. They can't do much other than just watch and send good energy and vibes my way. The college has been hard especially being the first year and doing all my work online is very draining. They do all the little things like give me fruit while I'm studying or stay up with me when I have a lot of homework and test.My friends like to have study dates online or take dinner breaks to get away from the computer. If we know something about one of our classes we try to help one another out so we are not struggling. This all my community does not much but the little things help every now and then. I think I rely more on myself because no one truly understands how college and my classes are going. Thinking about this now I should have asked for much help from my teachers and tutors.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2246,"I think that they have really taught me to be patient. My family is all about patience, and taking things one item at a time, and with the current situation of the world, along with having school online, having patience I feel like is key. Another value is to always give everything your best effort. At times, I didn't feel like going to a specific class, or not do an assignment, whether it be homework or classwork, using all my effort. But I understand that I can't slack off, because college is the last place where I want to slack off. The last value that has helped me is trusting myself. At times, I didn't trust that I was going to get a good grade on a certain assignment, but I have told myself that as long as I try hard, then I should trust that I will get a good grade"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2256,"The values of my friends, family, and community help me navigate through college in different ways. My family values have helped me navigate through college because they were huge motivators for me to go to college. My parents believe that college is the way for a stable future, so they like the idea of me going to college. My parents are also supportive of me and help pay for my tuition. The value of my friends has helped me navigate through college by being there for me. It's hards to focus in class when you don't know anybody, so having friends in the same classes makes things a bit easier since we can help each other out. The community in SFSU helps me navigate through college because there are counselors that help me decide what courses to take and keeps me on the right track."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2255,"I’m not sure what exactly my community’s or family’s values are considering we’ve never established any but I do have some of my own. I really value independence, relationships with family/friends, and learning so I make sure I keep these values while doing school. Last semester, my first semester of college, I felt really dependent on my professors for extra credit opportunities, curving test scores, and recorded lectures, and even though it was a hard semester given the pandemic, I knew I shouldn’t have been so dependent because my entire college experience wasn’t going to stay like that. I needed to learn to work and study for myself instead of for the sake of my grade which leads to my value of learning. Making sure I actually retain the information presented to me in class is important because I have to remember it for future classes according to my major (Biology) and not just for that current semester. Again, I do need to work on distinguishing the motivation to work on school from the need for my grade. Lastly, communicating with friends and family frequently maintains my relationship with them because I can tell them easily that school is my priority without feeling like I’ve distanced myself from them for the wrong reasons and they are supported of my decisions/work no matter what."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2253,"My family values hard work, but more importantly, daily (self) discipline. The idea of daily efforts having a compound effect has really been instilled in me. Putting in consistent effort is better than bursts of short-lived attempts when trying to finish a task or achieving a goal. When it comes to navigating through college, I find that those values have really helped me succeed in accomplishing realistic aspirations. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2247,"When I refer to my community, I am referring to mainly the community of other students I have met throughout my college experience. In reality, the ""community"" I am surrounded with outside of school (such as the friends and coworkers I keep in touch with and spend time with) either do not go to school, or are not serious about education in any way. So my building up another community comprised of people who are relatively on the same path as me and/or have similar goals than me, I was able to buckle down and dedicate myself even more to my studies throughout college so far. These ""classmates"" have been willing to offer help even after we no longer have a class together, they graduate, or they transfer to another school and that support has meant the world. They have been able to hep me when I feel like my back is against the wall and I feel lost related to my schoolwork, and I do the same. So I feel like having the value of always wanting to help others without anything in return has lead me to those who are willing to do the same. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2244,"I believe that the values of my community have helped me through my time in school by providing me with inspiration and support. My family have supported me in trying to achieve my dreams. In addition, my family upbringing helped me hone in on my sense of curiosity that has pushed me towards science."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2249,"Growing up in an Asian family that did not conform to the stereotypes of Asian families was different than hearing how my friends were raised. Typical Asian parents are stereotyped to be overbearing, too hard on their children, and expecting the most out of them for reasons other than for their child’s own wants and goals. This normally presents itself as “my mom wants me to go to med school, but I want to be an artist”, or “my parents grounded me because I didn’t do well on a test.”               The values of my family facilitated my learning by knowing that I should find and follow my passion, that I can achieve any goal that I set my mind to. From starting as a cinema major to taking a year off and end up working at a veterinary hospital and graduating from veterinary technician school, the values my family instilled in me is what pushed me through and help me get to where I am today – a year away from graduating undergrad and applying to veterinary schools."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2240,"My family has never expected me to get all A's... but they did at least expect me to do above average.  That has proven to be difficult for me since I have ADHD and I struggle to concentrate in school.  They tend to have more negative reinforcement than positive reinforcement, but oh well.  My friends have a similar mindset to school that I have, but it wasn't until I met one of my best friends that I realized my true school and life potential.  He has shown me how to be a lot more organized and professional in my daily life, and I wouldn't be half as effective as I am today without him.  So for me, I'm doing the best that I ever have been in school and in my own personal life.  Hopefully I'll be able to carry the lessons that he has taught me into my future workspace, it's always been a fear of mine that I'll never have things under control... but at least now I feel like I am getting to the point where I am in control of my own destiny and not just being along for the ride."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2237,"my family provided me a lot of support especially financially because I do not have to worry about rent, tuition , and other expenses that needed to be pay for me to navigate through college. With that in said, I get to focus on my studies more which allow me to find myself as well. They encouraged me to try as many things I liked so that I can be good at something which would benefit them in the future. Now that I decided to study plant biology, I can go home and help them with their work and take over what they started when they retire. Though it is a lot of pressure, but they invest in me to live in SF and study here already so because of this, it motivate me to give back for their hardwork. "
