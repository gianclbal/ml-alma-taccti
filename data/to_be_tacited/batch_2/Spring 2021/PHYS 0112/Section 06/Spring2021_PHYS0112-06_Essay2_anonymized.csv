2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2246,"One of my goals is to go into the medical field. This class is helping me achieve my goals because in order for me to fulfill all the requisites that a physiology major requires, taking physics is one of them. I personally don't know why physics is mandatory, because I can't ever imagine myself needing to use physics if I become a doctor. Other than that, another goal of mine is to just increase my knowledge. It would be very interesting to see how the different laws of physics work, and how they work in our everyday lives.Â "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2258,"Well my long term goal is to be a physical therapist. My short term goal is to pass this class. I am not the best at math so I'm really putting my math skills to the test by being apart of this class. Right now I am not completely struggling but I know it is going to get harder. So I am trying to prepare for that. As of right now, I really watch the lecture and lab videos more than once. As in I am always referring back to the videos. This class helps me achieve my goals because in order to be a PT I need to be stronger in math. So this school is not 100% math but it has a good chunk of math that I know I will need. So by passing this class, I am one step closer to achieving my goal of becoming a PT. I honestly am really happy to be in this class because for one I am brushing up on my math skills but also I have never taken a physics class before like ever. And so far I am enjoying it. I am also really lucky because my teacher for my lecture andÂ  for my lab are great. They both are really helpful and are very friendly.Â "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2236,"What are my goals... I think the first would be to learn to type faster (I think I said that the last time I had this question in text form;;).Â  Life goals!! I don't even know!!!! I think graduating would be nice. I like learning but not being so formally tested and everything riding on one moment like that.Â  Other goals: learn the basics of physics so I can have a deeper understanding of biology, meteorology, and astrophysics (cause those are all cool subjects imo), put in more consistent effort for school work & hobbies, be happier... yeah I might just end the list there.Â  I'm glad this isn't a formal essay because I can't really express myself that way.Â  Also, I've been typing a bit more like the way I talk, maybe because so much communication is web-based these days?? But I digress. I hope everyone else has more clea-cut goals than I do!! ðŸ˜…"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2254,My current goal is to get all Aâ€™s in my classes this semester. I am currently a B/C student and I hope to change that this semester. My long term goal is to graduate with my BA in Biology. Soon after I am going to either find a job in the hospital or continue to go to school to get my masters then find my career after that. I have been considering switching my major over to Nursing but I am very scared that I wonâ€™t get in. This class is helping me achieve these goals because it is one of the pre reqs I have to take to get my degree. This also is giving me lots of information that I may need to use in the future.Â 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2247,"Currently, my primary goal is to graduate with my Biology degree. When I first started studying my degree, my goal was to go to medical school and become either a neurosurgeon or a cardiovascular surgeon. Over the years, I have been introduced to new people and new ideas and now feel like I may prefer going into biotech instead of the medical school route. Because of that, I am still not entirely sure as to what I will be doing after I graduate (still doing research to find what truly interests me!), but for now, my primary goal is to finish my degree. This class helps me achieve this goal by providing me with more knowledge in physics that can directly translate to the science of biology. In other words, the knowledge this class has to offer allows me to better understand the subject of biology which will allow me to be more advanced when it comes to me putting my degree to use!Â "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2259,Some of my goals are finishing college and working my dream job in the future. I want to get my BS in microbiology and attend med school. I still have to look into where to do go and how to get there but for now I am I making a small outline on my goals. The future jobe I want is to be a Pathologist specifically a medical examiner like on the crime shows. I know this class is going to help me alot in the future in my career along with getting my BS. I am sure this will also help with MCAT some way. So I am taking this class serouisly to help me acheive my future goals.Â 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2250,My goals here are to learn the basics of physics and how they reflect in the real world. We are on week three of the class so there is still much to learn before I can say that this class has really helped me achieve my goals. I am certain that these goals can be reached by the end of the semester if not then by the next semester. Little by little the class is helping me understand physics which is exactly what I signed up for.Â 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2252,"I want to get into medical and become a doctor, so this class is meant to help me graduate with my biochemistry degree. I am hoping that I use some important and useful material that I get from this class in my everyday life as well as in my career path. I am also hoping that this class in particular helps me continuously improve my GPA (not saying that its bad but saying to keep improving my GPA) so that when I do get around and apply for medical schools, I am able to show how well my GPA is and how well I did in this class as well as my other classes required to be taken for my degree and get into a really nice school. I am dreading the MCAT exam and I am hoping that I get a high enough score that my GPA really gets me to that finishing line. I know that when I do get to medical, that is only just the beginning of a long journey to actually become a general surgeon, however, this is just the first step and I need to focus and get through this step (graduating SFSU with a good GPA and getting a good score on the MCAT to get into med school) before I worry about the next steps in my career path!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2256,"I have multiple goals for myself, one of them being to pass my class with a relatively high grade. This class can help me achieve this goal helping me understand physics better. The physics lab recaps on terms from the physics lecture. This allows me to better understand the content through the lab work and practice problems. My other goal is to get a degree for my major. Both the physics lecture and lab class are requirements for my major, so taking this class help with my goal. My personal goal is to go outside more. Since lockdown, I haven't been going outside, so something that I've started to do is go out for a walk. Catching up with old friends is also a goal that I wanted to do. Not being able to see my friends have distanced us, so having time to catch up and chat will be cool."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2241,"My goals are to get a comprehensive understanding of the world through physics so that I can succeed in my environmental science career. This class is helping me achieve that by showing me the relationship between velocity, position, and time. Although I am doing the work to do this, I still have trouble figuring out the exact relationship between these three and why they are the way they are.Â "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2248,"My goal is to finish my degree and graduate. This class is helping me achieve these goals because Physics is part of the requirements that I need in order to graduate. After I graduate with my Bachelors degree, I want to become an athletic trainer. I don't know how exactly Physics will help me achieve that goal but as long as it is a requirement for my degree, I will be here. That being said, I am enjoying learning all about it. I have never taken physics before so it is all brand new to me but I understand everything so far."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,1717,"What are my goals...how is this class helping me achieve these goals?My short term goal is to pass this semester. All of my classes. I find that this physics class is the hardest one for me to keep up with. I Hope that this class can help me achieve my goals so that I can eventually move on to other courses required to complete my biology major. but my short short term goal is to be able to catch up in this class overall. Like I said, I find it hard to but I'm trying my best."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2257,"One of my goals that I want to achieve in the near future is, obviously, my number one is to graduate. Especially now that I've transferred, I have a new wave of motivation and confidence to finish school after struggling last semester from losing all that motivation. I'm excited to see where my next few semesters at SFSU are going to guide me through. This class is helping me achieve this goal because I need it for credit but it's also going to help me apply new learning skills that I can utilize for any real world scenarios in a sense. Something that I started learning about physics was that it shouldn't be approached as a math problem but approached as trying to figure the different solutions Â to get to the answer. So in a way, I kind of took it as there's no one way to approach a problem, like it's not step-by-step and I think that's important to remember because there's not just one book on how to navigate through life in a sense.Â "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2255,"Overall, my college goal as of right now is to get my Bachelor's degree in Biology because I want to become a zoologist or veterinarian. After I get my degree, I'd like to work or assist at a vet or at the San Diego Zoo, where I currently live. I am taking this class to complete my G.E.s and without it, I probably wouldn't be able to graduate. My goal for this class is to pass, submit all my work on time (because I have a bad procrastination problem), and feel motivated to learn to not just treat it like more work I have to get done (this applies to all my classes though). I want to learn something from all of my classes that arenâ€™t related to my major to be able to look back at the odd college experience Iâ€™m currently living and say I was able to enjoy it through thick and thin."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2238,This week I want to abide by my homework and study schedule. I want to lay a specific schedule that allows me to focus on homework for all my classes. This reflective journal sparked the idea of getting back into that habit I once had of following a daily homework schedule. The past couple weeks its been easy to fall off or get behind in work for calculus class. I also need some motivation to keep learning and studying hard for that class. Getting back into a routine would be helpful. This class has also helped me make sure I stay on top of my lab work. Having time in class to complete and work on it has been helpful so that I don't push it off and procrastinate on it. Maintaining a mindset of trying to get my work done right away once it's assigned would be very helpful.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2245,"My goals is to graduate with my BS in biology, and in order to do that I'm taking all the classes that are required. Physics 112 is helping me achieve this goal, since it's a required class. If I pass this class, I'll be able to move onto physics 2 and so forth, until I finish everything that is needed. Another goal I have is to be able to understand physics and be able to ""summon"" the material forward if ever needed in the real world. I think it's cool that physics is everywhere but it goes unknown to many people, so by taking this lab I'll be able to be one of the few who are able to be like ""oh this is what we learned in physics"". Â "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2237,"my goal is to find a job that feeds me well. this class will help me achieve that goal because it will provide me with basic knowledge about physics as well as how things work in this world and will give me a better understanding when solving problems. specifically, I'm going into plant biology and physics does play a role in plant growth, if I'm able to corporate the concepts I learn here and apply it into the plants world, I would be able to figure out the best optimal plant growing conditions to maximize yields. Maybe figure out new ways to grow plants too. Physics will help me be creative with ways to solve problem!Â "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2244,"My goals are to one day become a scientist and help communities struggling with climate change. This class is helping me achieve that not only by being a major requirement for my degree, but also by helping me learn more about how the world works and to learn more about scientific communication. I think that it is important as a scientist to have scientific knowledge that extends out beyond ones chosen field: after all science is focused upon all life and all things known, not just biology, physics, math, etc. I think that by learning more about physics, I will also become a more well rounded individual in general and be able to know more about my own lived experiences.Â "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2251,The goals that I have at the moment are basically to pass all of my classes with Aâ€™s and Bâ€™s. I also would like to be less of a procrastinator. This class will help me achieve these goals by turning in the work on time and not have at least more than one missing assignment. Another way is to be open and not be afraid to ask questions on problems that I have trouble working on. I can also speak to my peers and get their input on how they are able to do well in the class. In the end I just need to have better communication skills and an overall positive and productive attitude.Â 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2249,"My short term goal is to graduate from SFSU no later than 2023. My long term goal is to attend UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and become a small animal veterinarian. Related to this class, my goal is to understand physics. I feel like thatâ€™s a very loose goal but having never taken a physics class, Iâ€™ve been a little overwhelmed with this class. Iâ€™m trying to really put my heart and mind into this class and understanding the concepts because itâ€™s only the first physics class of many that Iâ€™m going to have to take in order to achieve both my short and long term goals. This class has been a very straight-forward class and Professor Sturner is extremely patient and helpful which is what I figured out I need in a professor. I want to understand and like physics because itâ€™s one step towards achieving my goals."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2239,"My goals are to pass this class, but also to learn more about physics because I have never taken a Physics class ever so I'm open-minded to this type of class. This class would definitely help me achieve my goals because it'll help me know how things work in the everyday you see perspective like how things work in your everyday life if that makes sense. Otherwise, my other goals are like losing weight and such. Like can physics apply how fast I'm moving when I exercise makes my body lose weight or something like that I don't know how to phrase the question. Yeah, I'm just curious to see how things work especially when I dance 2x faster in my kpop dance exercises like how fast am I going when I do dance and such."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2242,"My goal is to become a physician who provides great care for her patients. This class is helping me achieve these goals on a practical level because it is a prerequisite for medical school, but it is also helping me out because it is developing my critical thinking skills, which will ultimately help me out as a physician. IT is also helping me build discipline as I study, which is important for a program as intense as medical school. I also find problem solving another important skill for physics, which will help me as caring for patients requires a lot of problem solving. I also think collaboration as I form study and lab groups is another skill I'm learning in this course, which will help me out as a physician because healthcare is very much at team sport where nurses, midlevel providers, and more work together to provide care for the patient.Â "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2235,"In life, my goals are to be successful. I just want to be able to have fun and live the life I want to live when I'm older. And I know I must do well in school to be successful and live that life. This class I believe can help me towards that goal. I like science. Every single science class I find a way to be fascinated by the sciences and natures of this Earth. Of course I'm the class so I get get credits for my GE and my major, but I really just want to learn. My short term goals are to get back into the school spirit. With COVID and all, I find it difficult to be motivated for anything. I miss seeing friends and going out. I even miss working out and being in shape. But that's pretty much all."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2253,"My goal is to do well in this course so I can eventually apply to medical schools once I have taken the required science classes. This class is one of many science classes that I will need to take, but this class is also a a prerequisite for other science courses, like second semester physics lecture and lab. I find the concepts in this course not to be too challenging (unlike organic chemistry), but it's hard to apply what is taught in lecture to the problems we are asked to work on.Â "
