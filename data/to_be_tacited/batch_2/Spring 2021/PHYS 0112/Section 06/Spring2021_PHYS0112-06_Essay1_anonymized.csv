Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2235,"I am not too sure what exactly I should write about. How should I ask the question 'why am I here?' ? Why am I in the situation I'm in? Why am I where I am at this moment? Is it asking generally why I am where I am, or is it asking why I am here as of right now, writing the words I'm writing?I'm in this class to be learning. I always want to be learning. Right now, I am at my desk typing this up. Typing word for word whatever comes to my mind. I enrolled in this physics course partly because I need it for my major, but generally because I love science. At night, sometimes I watch YouTube videos or documentaries on astronomy or anything else science related. I joined this class because I was into the hands-on labs I got to do with friends in high school. I found those to be really fun. Of course, unfortunately, I won't get the opportunity to have a hands-on experience in this class due to at home learning. Personally, I like where I am. I strive to achieve the best grades I can get. Right now, I am just getting back into the school mindset. Long breaks take a toll on me. My mind stays on vacation mode until I finally wake up. I think now, I can finally say I'm awake. I will do my best to achieve good grades and stay on top of my school work. I've already lost a bit of time due to my lack of concentration, but I'm catching up. But again, not only am I trying to earn A's on paper, I want to be able to fully grasp the content I am being taught. I don't mean for this to get deep or anything, but I am always looking to improve. Other than that, I just want the world to go back to where it was a couple years ago. Being able to have fun with friends and family. And being able to experience my first year of college actually in school would've been nice too. And this reminds me of the meme/vid I always see on social media of the group of guys saying ""it is what it issss"" in an accent. That's a funny video and it lives in my head whenever I can say ""it is what it is"" in any given situation. I feel like it's tough to be myself nowadays because I don't have the opportunity to do the things I love. Hopefully, I can be me soon."

2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2236,"If this question is for the class we're in right now, then I'm here to complete a requirement for my degree, but also to learn more about physics! I hope one of these days the concepts will actually click with me... I genuinely enjoy math and want to get back into it.If the question refers to why am I here, like in this moment in time, then that's a good question to ask.  BUT I'm not a philosophy major and only speculate on what brought me to this moment in the universe.  I'm not even sure about my major anymore! Everything's up in the air!! So I'm just going to try to do a little better than my best every day, and enjoy the time I can. Idk if that actually answered the question, I really used this journaling activity as a mini ramble/ brain dump.  Hope that counts! "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2237,"Why am I here? This is a powerful question for today. I would like to break it down each step. Why am I in this class is because it is a required in my major and I have never took physics class before so I value this class as a learning class for me, not just for the credits. Why am I here in SF State? I visited a friend at SF State 3 years ago and I fell in love with the school and how much it felt like ""home"" to me, so I decided to transfer here. Why am in here in San Francisco? my parents don't want me to study in my home country, Thailand, because they think I'm going to be narrowminded, so they sent me to Canada first then I decided to come to the U.S. Throughout my journey, I think I gain a broader knowledge of how people do things in different places and I feel like I am more understanding. I guess ""Why am I here"" serves as a purpose for finding who I am and what I want to be and what I want to learn. I decided to major in botany and hopefully physics will help me understanding how plants works. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2238,I am here because this class is a required GE for my major: Biology with a concentration in Ecology. I am also here because I haven't taken physics since sophomore year of high school and I wanted to brush up on the concepts. I am interested in learning more about the physics concepts! It's a bummer that we aren't in person to do lab. I think this lab would have been fun on campus.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2239,"I am here because I need to take this class for my major required lower-division class. I honestly have never taken Physics before, but I heard from my friends when they were taking AP Physics, that Physics was absolute torture, maybe because it was an AP class and not a regular class. But, I just want to get this class out of the way, so I can focus on my major classes that look more interesting. Like for me, Physics, Calculus, and Chemistry are all like ew, but when it comes to Biology, I'm more intrigued by what occurs in our body and why do certain diseases affect certain people and such. And is it possible to use technology to find out the cure of diseases so, we can cure the people of their short-termed life? Sometimes I'll be interested in other non-biology classes, but it depends on how the professor can make it fun even when sometimes it's boring and hard, but when the professor is enthusiastic 24/7 I'd focus more on the subject than be like I don't want to be here, I don't want to be here, the professor makes it hard LOL. Oh and my major is Biology concentration in Physiology :)"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2240,"“Why am I here?”Starting off with the light questions for a reflection I see.  On the surface I am only taking this class in order to fulfill my requirements for my Biology degree.  On a deeper level I am in this class because I started taking ADHD medication and my school work has improved well enough for me to be in this class.  I am so much more confident in my mental abilities than I ever was before, so I decided to try and reach for the stars with my vocation.  I have always loved animals, evolution and nature, so I decided to go on a route that I never thought I could achieve.  I still haven’t quite decided what I want to choose as my concentration for Bio, but evolutionary biology is a topic that fascinates me, so I’m going to look into what I need to do in order to move in that direction.On a much broader sense, I am here on this Earth for no particular reason other than a lot of long processes that got me here.  We are all the children of the stars, so I’d like to find out what it means to be human in this changing world, and how to save what we haven’t yet destroyed."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2241,"""Why am I here?""I am here taking Phys 111 and Phys 112 because it is required for Environmental Science majors. While I don't know what direction I will be taking with this major, I am excited to be enrolled in these courses just because I like to learn about how the world works. Honestly, I think I'm pretty stupid when it comes to science and math, but I really like it and that's why my major is ES. Because of this, however, I don't think I will excel in physics just because my problem solving, critical thinking, and logic skills have been weak ever since I can remember. Regardless of all this, I'm still really stoked to take this class. Physics has always somewhat interested me and I am more than happy to know that after this semester, I will know how the world works!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2242,"I think I'm here because God planned for me to be here. I've realized that sometimes in the moment, I'll get frustrated about the place that I am at because I feel like it isn't a place that ""meets my standards."" Yet, I've been realizing recently that everything does happen for a reason, and that I am here because I need to be here, and tomorrow I'll be somewhere else because I need to be there. That's why I think the fact that I am here has to be planned and intentional. Specifically for this physics class, I am here because I am pre-med and I need to take physics before applying to medical school. Although I probably won't use a ton of physics in practice, I believe that this subject will push me to think in ways that will benefit me as a provider. Being able to think critically and logically is so important as a healthcare provider, and I know I am here to learn how to do that better. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2243,"I am actually super excited to be in this class, and in all of the classes that I am taking now that I have decided on my major and career path! I decided two semesters ago that I wanted to major in Zoology, but before that I had trouble finding drive to stay in school at all because it felt like there was no point. If this class was not a prerequisite for my other classes I likely would not be taking it because this is going to be an extremely hard semester but on the bright side it is getting me one step closer to my degree. I was not even going to take Physics this semester because I already had my schedule set up, and I was going to take it anther semester; however, I got dropped from another class for not meeting the prerequisite so I decided to hop into this class instead."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2244,I am in this class because it's a requirement for the Biology major. I chose to be a biology major because I am very passionate about science and I have always been interested in environmental protection. I hope that all my education allows me to become an ecologist and a researcher and that I can help to study the effects of anthropogenic climate change on various ecosystems and their respective flora and fauna. I hope that in my career I will be able to do something that I love while simultaneously being able to help the planet and uphold communities who are at the heart of their own environmental protection. I think that the conjunction between science and community is very important and I hope that I can be an activist not only for environmental protection but also against environmental racism and the capitalistic accumulation of land and resources.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,1717,Why Am I Here ?I am taking a physics lab because I am enrolled in physics 111 and I need to take a lab. I am majoring in General Biology which I hope will lead me to the career of my choice. I would like to become a pediatrician but what I would really like to become is a pediatric oncology nurse and help and make children cancer patients happy! I am here in school because I would like to have some education and better job opportunities and provide a better future for my son. I want to be able to help my son when it’s his turn to take science and math courses and I want him to think that he has a smart mom! I am here because I want to learn from my peers and learn of my capabilities
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2245,"Why am I here in this class? I’m here because I am beginning my journey towards my dream career. As a student who wants to become apart of the medical field, I have a lot to do and complete with soaring success. One of the things I have to do is learn physics and be enrolled in physics lab, as it a requirement. Physics isn’t my most favorite class, actually, it’s not even one of my favorites, because physics is something I have to spend a lot of my energy on, in order to understand the concepts. But I am still here, and I’m trying my best to give it my all, no matter how tired I am. Now, why am I here at SFSU? That is a question I don’t know myself, but I don’t regret it- there is a little part of me that does regret it, but that's because of how costly SFSU is."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2246,"Being completely honest, the main reason why I am here is because it is required in order for me to fulfill all the requirements for my major. Technically speaking, I can take the lecture part of physics, and decide to take the lab part of it another semester, but that wouldn’t make much sense. Another reason why I’m here is because I also want to learn about how physics works, because we deal with physics in our everyday lives. From throwing a ball, to driving a car, physics is hidden in everything we do, whether we realize it or not. I took physics in high school, and to be honest, I didn’t really enjoy it. I think the main reason was that the professor was pretty boring, so I wanted to give physics another shot. I’m hoping that this semester of physics will be way more fun than the physics I took in high school."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2247,"I often like to reflect on my choices and how they have gotten me to where I am today. Because of that, I feel like asking ""why am I here?"" is asking me to reflect on what exactly brought me to where I am today in all aspects such as relationships, school, or work. To me, I am where I am today because of a thirst for more knowledge. The past few years, especially the year 2020, I have seen a great change in all aspects of myself as well as my life. I feel that since I began to invest time into learning more about ways in which I can improve myself, I have not only changed the way I used to think, but also my goals as well as what I believe it is to be successful. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2248,"I am in this Physics class because it is required for my major. I am majoring in Kinesiology and I hope to become an athletic trainer. I decided to take this physics class because I have never taken any physics classes before and I figured I should stick with general physics. Also, I read some really good reviews with this class and specifically taking physics with Professor Sturner so I decided to give it a try online this semester."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2249,"I am here in this physics class mainly because my major requires it. I am a biology major with a concentration in zoology. If my major hadn’t required it, I honestly don’t think I’d be taking physics. I never took it in high school and it always kind of intimidated me. I’m trying to go into the course with a more open mindset and the willingness to do well and learn about it. I’ve been a big believer in manifesting your own destiny so while I’m not fond of physics (yet) in any sense, I’m trying to be open to learning its concepts and applying them where I can in my day-to-day life. It is my dream to go to veterinary school but getting into veterinary school means needing to have an above-average academic standing so if having this changed mindset will get me there, then it is what I’m going to be preaching."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2250,I am here because I need physics in order to pursue a bachelors in Biology. I chose this specific class because it was open and able to fit my schedule. I didnt check rate my professor or anything like that to see how easy or hard this lab is so I'm walking into this blind. As for why I am here in this university I thought it would be nice to go to a university far away and learn new experiences.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2251,"The reason I am in this physics class is because it is required for my major. I am majoring in Earth Science and this specific science does compare itself to a lot of topics having to do with physics. Although there isn’t really a choice to be in here or not, I actually enjoy this class. It does get confusing at times, but I feel like my knowledge really expands when learning about it. I want to be able to see things that remind me of physics in my everyday life. It would also be pretty cool to sound smarter in front of my other peers. I hope that physics really helps my major and meets the standards to become a brilliant geologist."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2252,"I am here for my major. I am a biochemistry major and physics is a requirement. However, I wanted to take a physics course in high school because it can be a useful life skill to know. I know that my brother took physics courses for his major and he talks about the ""physics"" of things and how/why things happen because of physics. I want to be a doctor one day so I hope that in the end of it all, all the classes I take prior will help me to achieve that goal I have in life. I also hope that one day I will be smarter than my brother and taking classes that he took will slowly bring me to the finish line of this competitive game on who knows more out of the two of us. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2253,"I’m taking this class mainly because it is a prerequisite for medical schools. I delayed taking sciences courses as a premed student and now I am taking them all at once. Aside from that, I am here because I want to learn physics. I have tried taking physics before but decided to drop it due to course load as well as level of difficulty. This time around,  I think I have the right mindset and resources to help me succeed."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2254,"I believe that I am here to make a change in this world. I am definitley here for a reason. I consider myself a miracle baby. The doctors told my mom months after she gave birth to me that if she didn't conceive the time that she did, she most likely wouldn't have been able to have me. So I do consider myself a miracle. I think it is pretty cool how everyone has some sort of story to tell. Like there is a background behind everything and everyone's story is pretty different. I am here to become one of the best Physician Assistants there are. I am here to make a change in my community and for the many people of color. I am here to be first generation student in my family to graduate from a masters program. My goal is to give back to all of my loved ones. I want my mom to have it all once I make it because she was always coming through for me no matter what. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2255,"I’m in this class for a major requirement, I’m pretty sure. My degree pathway and roadmap recommended Physics 111 and 112 for me since I’m majoring in Biology with a concentration in Zoology. I have never taken a physics class before so I really don’t know what to expect with the exception of tons of math and laws of motion. All I know is that my friends majoring in Math or Engineering have definitely taken physics before and will continue to do so. I’m not the best at math so I am a little nervous. I didn’t know Math 198 was a prerequisite for PHYS 111/112 so I’m taking both classes simultaneously, I think that might be helpful for me this semester though. Some of the concepts the physics lecture has mentioned remind me of what I learned in my high school chemistry class (which I loved) so I’m excited to get a recap on them aside from learning a whole lot more."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2256,"Why I am here can mean many things. Why I’m here in college is because of my family, friends, and teachers motivating me to attend college. My parents are a huge motivator for me to head to college because they want me to succeed and I want them to be proud of me. My passion for environmental science also had a role in why I am in college. I feel that if I want to study or have a profession in environmental science then I would have to obtain a degree. College life is something that I wanted to experience as well. Having a dorm, clubs, and independence is was something that appealed to me. The experience so far is not what I expected due to COVID-19 and the lockdown. The reason why I’m here taking Physics 112 is to finish my general education. I took physics in high school that there was an interesting lab experience, so I was hoping that maybe the class can be interesting as well."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2257,"I'm here because I need to take this class for credit. I've taken physics two times already, because I need the credit for my major, yet I didn't pass those times. This next round, I guess you could say, I'm really determined to pass. Physics has been a hard concept for me to grasp, yet so far only two weeks into the new semester, I already have a better understanding than I did before. I am a little nervous still just because I don't know what the work load is going to be like and how much balance I'll be managed each day with my classes. Either way, I'm ready and determined to pass the class and get a better grasp of what physics is. I'm just overall ready to face the challenges I dealt with before, now."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2258,"Well, I'm in this physics lab because I am taking physics so I just thought it would be easier to take the lab with class cause then I can understand what I am learning more. Because if I took physics now and decided to take the lab next semester, I feel like I would forget a lot of information so I feel like this is smarter. Now if your are asking why I am taking the class in general, I'm taking it because it's a requirement for my degree. I am a Kinesiology major so I definitely taking this class as well as physics 2. I am pretty nervous for this class because I have never taken a physics class before like at all. So this is my first time taking a physics class and on top of it I am not the best at math so I hope everything turns out okay. I am excited to learn though! I hope to really grasp the material and use it towards everyday life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2259,"I am here to take this class to meet my prerequisite for my major. I am nervous and excited to be here though! I like math and this class uses lots of math so I should be okay. Being here will also prepare me for my future career I believe. In the future I plan to be a Forensic Pathologist, in other words a medical examiner. I think physics will be helpful to help me solve many cases and being families peace and justice.I also think I am here for many good reasons. I have plan to help many people in the future and give back to all those who have helped me along the way. Without them I would not be here now."
