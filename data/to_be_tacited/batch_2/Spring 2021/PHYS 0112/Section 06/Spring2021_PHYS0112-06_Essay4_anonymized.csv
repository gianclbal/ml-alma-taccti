2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2237,"What resources I have to support me is my professors, my parents, my family, my friends and myself. These people are the most important people that I think of when I am in need of help. Professors for career and school advice. Parents and family for financial help as well as emotional support. Friends for social support. I also think that having close relationships with these people will help me in the future because they will also look out for you the same as you support them. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2235,"One thing I can say about this class is that there are lots of resources to support my learning. The fact that the zoom classes are recorded is really helpful. The textbook is a resource, we have classmates and a good professor to ask for help, and we have the notes from lecture slides to look back on. This even goes for the rest of my classes. I feel that my professors have done a good job of supporting us with lots of resources. We even get resources like videos and simulations for lab. We also are provided with resources to help us be successful students in many ways. I've seen things to help us be organized and on track with our studies, I've had meditation lessons and things to help us relax when we got overwhelmed or stressed, and I've been given ample time to complete my assignments. It also helps to have understanding professors in a tough time like this, where we aren't even attending school physically. Which I think is harder than being at school. It's harder for me to focus and keep a healthy lifestyle when I'm stuck at home."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2246,"One resource that I have to support me are my parents. I know that if I am struggling with something, whether that struggle is related to me mentally, academically, physically, or in any other way, I can lean on them and ask them for advice. I know that I can trust them to always have my back. Another resource is a basketball. Whenever I've felt stressed, or am having a bad day, whenever I play pickup basketball, all of the negative energy that was surrounding me goes away. Whether that be playing pickup basketball at a park, or at a gym, I sort of enter a whole new world, leaving all my problems at the entrance. Another resource I have are my friends. Similar to my parents, I know that if I am ever struggling with something in my life, I can talk to them, knowing that I can trust them."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2251,"The main resources that I have to support me would be my EOP advisor and my family and friends. Whenever I need help, my advisor gives me information on the most available tutoring or nearby meetings that help my cause. She also creates a pathway for my classes to make sure that I'm not going to be learning in the wrong one. I also turn to her when I start to freak out with my classes. My friends are a great resources as well because we are able to learn from each other. We can easily ask each other questions without feeling ashamed or embarrassed, school related and life related. My biggest resource would have to be my sister. She has seen me stay up during long nights trying to finish a paper or assignment. So, she brings her laptop and tries to find videos or articles to finish faster. Mind you, she is my younger sister, I am truly lucky to have these wonderful resources."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2253,"My resources include my family, friends, boyfriend, and cat. They help me stay on track when it comes to life goals and they are supportive. I’m grateful for them. Does Netflix count? I think it’s a great tool for relaxing and stress relief. Also, video games. I go on walks in the trials near my house and that is very cathartic. The only area I’m lacking in resources is in my career. I can see where I want to go and what I want to do (doctor), but I don’t know anyone in the field already. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2259,"""What resources do I have to support me?""I have many resources to support me such as friends family and people within the university. Usually, when I need some support I meet to talk with my friends. They know me inside and out and they truly understand me. We are there for each other so the support we have for one another is very meaningful and heart-touching. My family is second because they don't know that well on an emotional or mental level like my friends. However, when my family sees me struggling financially they are always here for me. I am very blessed to have parents who help out like this especially in a time like this. My school has many resources too especially with homework and projects. I have office hours and tutors all online which is very convenient now. I can also send emails if I need any more help with my school work. When I have to have support myself I have to have prep talk or rant on Twitter to let it all out."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2244,"In my life and moving towards my future goals, the resources that I have to support me are becoming more apparent. I have a nice network of great friends and a partner and parents who are there if I need to talk and I appreciate that. I think that in these times, when I am stressed, I should seek the support of others in what I am going through. moving forward in my career, it would be helpful to discuss my goals/trepidations with others and to ask for help when I need it. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2241,"This year along with previous few years have been more difficult for me than usual. It isn't until I reflect about my situation and ask something similar to ""what resources do I have to support me?"" that I understand that I'm actually really fortunate. I have a very supportive family and we are all very close to eachother. As much as they can get under my skin, we all know that we can support and help eachother no matter what. Along with my nuclear family, my girlfriend is a great source of support. Sometimes when my family doesn't cut it, she really helps ground me and bring me up. After i get a pep talk from someone in my family or my girlfriend, I instantly feel better and a I have a new sense of clarity with regards to my situation."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2245,"I believe my family and friends are people who support me in many ways possible. Sometimes they even provide me with actual resources that help me get one step closer to my goals, such as sending me medical schools, jobs, and other opportunities that make it possible to have a broader experience with the world. They ground me when I struggle with school, work, and just life in general. Thinking about it I'm very fortunate to have these people because, without them, I'd be lost and would have given up a long time ago."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2247,I am very grateful to have a lot of support around me. I have a tremendous amount of support from my parents who are always trying to help me succeed the best way they can. I feel support from my boyfriend who keeps me dreaming for a life that I know I deserve and for holding me accountable when I start to slack on my productivity. Sometimes you don't recognize yourself falling off because you become comfortable but I'm not in the position to be 'conformable' so I know I always have to get back to it!  I also feel support from my friends who always try to uplift me and try to keep me focused on my goal. I feel support from- some!- of my teachers who don't mind working with students to make sure they understand the content and also work with the students when students' lives get rough outside of school. I feel support from the earth too. It is what we all live off of so my appreciation to her is infinite! 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2239,"I have my family, my friends, the resources from my professors provided me and resources from what the library has. Also, I can rely on those resources for therapy and such, because they are open to me to use when I feel like I need to use it. This is because all these resources are used to help us emotionally, mentally, physically, etc... I believe the internet sometimes can be a good resource and video games and music to distress from your real life. For me, I play valorant, so I can get all my rage out from procrastinating. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2242,"I have many resources to support me. First, I have my family and friends who support me and my goals. I think they provide me alot of emotional support while I am feeling down or discouraged. They also cheer me on when I am doing well, which I am very grateful for. I also have my classmates and teachers to help me clarify any questions I might have about a course. I also have online resources to give me information to help understand things I might be confused about. I love using YouTube to help me with classes, particularly Khan Academy videos, because they clearly answer questions I have about certain topics in class. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2252,I have my brother and mother supporting me 100 percent. My brother always helps me with school work and just getting through school without giving up while my mother helps me emotionally get through problems in life. I also have a special someone who is supporting me always and that really gets me through anything honestly. I have a planner that I write things down in when things are due or when I work to keep me organized which actually is something that supports me so I am not lacking behind or forget when things are due. Sometimes I stray away from it but when I get back to relying on it I am keeping everything I have so organized and getting everything done. I feel like mental support really comes from music and reading. I love music and I've been listening to this new playlist I've made to remind myself that I am not alone. I also love reading webtoon or Wattpad because it keeps me in check on like where I am and what I like to do. I used to write so reading really takes me back for a second and reminds me of who I am which is loving writing and how it takes you places you didn't know you could go. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2249,"The resources I have to support me are mostly social and emotional resources. I have a great system of family, friends, and coworkers that are always there when I need something or just someone. I was never a fan of reaching out to peers or “strangers” for help and now I attribute that to fear of judgement. Now that I’m older and more understanding of my own needs and why there are the resources there are, I am more okay with reaching out to people other than my immediate circle.              I realize that the resources to help students such as tutoring, office hours, and learning assistants are purposefully put there to help us students with specific areas that others may not relate to or understand. It would be hard to ask my boyfriend for help in a science course that he never took but it would be easier and make more sense to attend office hours of that professor."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2248,"What resources do I have to support me? I don't really know which way to take this question. From a financial viewpoint, my parents still support me and I live under their roof. Academically, I rely on my teachers, classmates, YouTube and Google. Sometimes it is hard to understand certain topics and I have to watch a few different videos and ask for different ways that things have to be explained. Either way, I think my family supports me the most by encouraging me to stay in school and keep up the hard work."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2238,"The resources I am lucky enough to have are my family and friends. Without them life would be very lonely and boring. They all believe in me to do my best academically, and spiritually. I'm glad I have them to cheer me on. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2257,Some resources that I have to support me are probably friends and family. I guess you could say they're always there to reassure me that it's okay with what I'm doing. That what I'm doing is enough because it's for me. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,2256,"There have been times that I have needed help when it comes to schoolwork or emotional needs. There are plenty of resources that I have used to help me with my school work, one of them being office hours from teachers. Office hours allow me to access help from my professors and get a better understanding of a certain subject. Another resource that can help me with my work is by asking for help from other students. If those options aren't available for me then I can always use the internet. If I need emotional support I have friends and family to talk to."
