2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2158,"To be completely honest, in my family no one went to college, but growing up it was always expected of me. It's still really only expected of me even though I have other siblings and cousins who aren't being pushed as hard to follow through on their education. I partly think this is because I was always good at school, and I made friends with kids who took the honors and AP courses. Being around them as an influence made me push myself to take hard courses and challenge myself. So now, as I'm navigating my way through college I have all of those people as support systems and reminders that they know that I can do this. My peers also, who I've met this year have helped me look forward to continuing my education. I've made great friends who have some of the same values as me and I feel like college just provides people with a different kind of community than we've had before."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2163,"I think that because my parents are such hard workers that kind of attitude has been given to me as well. I was always taught to give not just academics but everything all of my effort and I think that that is really good for me. Not just this but I have also been taught that failure is okay. Obviously this is with the intent that I will eventually succeed eventually but I know that along the way, it is okay not to be the best at everything the first time that you do it. I think that this really helps with school because I cant grasp every topic immediately but That does not mean that I cant do it without hard work and perseverance"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2168,"My family and friends have been a huge part in helping me transition from high school to college. When I found out that my freshman year of college was going to be completely online and that I wasn't going to get to play my freshman season of soccer, I was extremely disappointed and felt like all the hard work I put into getting good grades and developing my skills were all for nothing. I know my family was disappointed for me too, but they continued to have a positive outlook which made everything a lot simpler. Without them continuously supporting me and encouraging me to keep going, I think I would have had a pretty rough first year of college. Knowing that I was able to get through that rough first semester made me extremely hopeful for the future, and the support from my parents and two older brothers makes me excited for when I get to move to San Francisco in July. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2178,"I'm a child of immigrants, from a place where education is a privilege that most people can't afford, my parents never had the opportunity to attend middle school, but they knew that education is one of the greatest tool that you can have to lift yourself up from poverty. My parents always told me to do well, and to do my best in regards to school and then get my money up. My parents also always told me to seek help when I need it, there's nothing wrong with admitting when you are struggling, be it either in life or in your educational pursuits. I'm glad that education was so important to my family, because had they not emphasized the value of education on me, I don't think I would have bothered to try as hard in each of my classes like I do. All in all, they made sure I'd never doubt the value of higher education."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2155,"The values of my family have really helped to shape me into the individual I am today. i am driven, and competitive. My family has always valued hard work, and no matter what giving it your best shot. This importance in the value of hard work has made me realize I can get through anything. Whether it be a tough class, or a career dream that may seem unattainable, they always emphasized that as long a I work hard I can overcome any obstacle, and that its okay to fail! They also preached to be kind and understanding. That it is important to take in al points of view before deciding your position or opinion. Having a sense of people's culture, upbringing and family life are extremely important in navigating the world and the college life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2161,"The values of my community are derived from the people who make my community, so this would be my family and friends. The values they offer me are love, support, and respect. This has allowed me to feel comfortable growing as a person because I had support around me. A very important person who offers me value is my sister who supports me and advised me throughout life. She was the one who encouraged me to go to SFSU despite me being intimidated at how far it was from home (5 hours away). My friends have always known I would get into a great school and when I got into SFSU, they were so proud of me and this encouraged me to do good so I wouldn't let them down. Many people in my community have offered reassurance in me, especially when it came to education where I was afraid I'd fail. But they are the reason I am here today in a great school and continuing to do my best because they knew I was very capable of this!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2166,"I am a first generation student of immigrants. My family never got to go to college because when they graduated high school, instead of celebrating, they had to flee a war-torn country. There is grit in experiencing that that I will not ever be able to achieve, but I work hard to. The strength and bravery as well as the vulnerability that it takes two experience these things to go through all the things that they had been through are the reason I am in college. My parents worked hard to give me the nurturing, warm upbringing that they deserved but was stolen from them. I would like my parents to see themselves in me. If I can grow up to be half the person my mother is, I know that I have done right. I have not gotten here alone. I have only made it this far off of the backs of my family. It does feel like a lot of pressure sometimes, but I feel the love more than I feel the pressure."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2176,"My family is extremely supportive on my journey though college. Perseverance is an important value that I have learned from my family. There are many uncontrollable obstacles that can be in the way of success, but preserving through the good times and even hard times will be worth it in the end. My friend group has taught me discipline in their studies. I have modeled what students I want to be after them. They are much bright and hardworking women. I never developed great study habits during high school and was lost during college. So, i reached out to them and they taught me some really great study tips and tricks that I have now been using to this day. Without my friends and family, I would not be where I am today. They have helped me tremendously throughout my journey in college and I am so thankful for their support."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2157,"The values of my family that has helped me navigate through college are hard work, never giving up, and being honest because they have taught me to be transparent. That kind of helps me to communicate with my classmates honestly, meaning that when I am confused about something I can honestly say that to my classmates or teacher because I know that they will help me to clarify what is confused for me. And I know that sometimes we do not speak when we do not understand something because we are afraid that others might think that we are dumb for not understanding something ""simple"" but one of the values that my family has taught me makes me come to the taught that is better to speak out our confusions because if we do we will get them to clarify but if we don't then we will be unable to proceed with our work. I also have learned that it is okay to not understanding something we are humans and it is okay to not be perfect! Also trying my best always in everything that I do and always working hard to achieve my goals. My family has also served as an inspiration for me through college because I have a five-year-old sister and I love her more than anything and I want to be a role model for her so that she can say my sister did it I can do it too, also my parents have always worked hard for me and I want to make them proud because they have always been by my side. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2159,"My family's background is from Senegal, where a lot of the population doesn't have access to education. I grew up in Senegal from age 6-12 and I attended a private school. Private schools over there tend to have a better education compared to public schools, unlike the US. Growing up, I was made very aware that not everyone has the same opportunity as me, so I needed to appreciate that and couldn't fail at school. With that being said, I have an appreciation for education a lot more especially since I want to practice medicine overseas and educate small communities. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2174,"Education has always been encouraged in my family. Although, I was never really, probably still not, an ""academic go-getter."" I think my parents really pushed the idea that having an education was the best thing to do and although I am here pursuing the completion of my degree I still wonder how much of this is really a ""true desire"" that stems from me verses the expectations placed on me by family and the influence of society. I remember when I was much, much younger, I always believed that having a degree meant that you had reached the greatest accomplishment ever and although it is an accomplishment, I wouldn't consider it that way today. I do however, think that they helped instill in me the value of hard work and not settling. I see how much my parents struggled and worked just give me a little more than they had growing up. In a way this, this has served as a sort of stimulus to continue pursuing a degree and more than anything, it is now more about me having a desire to improve my self and to show myself that I can accomplish what I set out to do. At least, I think, that's what I convinced myself of. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2177,My community has helped me navigate through college because my school helped us to stay motivated to get into colleges. But I believe that our school was so focus on picking the UC where some students shifted their focus on their actual majors just to get into a UC. My family has helped me navigate through college by supporting me financially. My parents did not go to college so they don’t know much about the school system. But I know I can lean on them whenever I need them almost for everything. They make me feel like I’m supported. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2173,"My family helped me navigate through college by encouraging me to take advantage of the resources that I can. Also, taking as many units I can and taking classes in the summer time as well to try to help me graduate as fast as I can so that I can pursue my career. Also, by taking programs in college, it allowed me to understand how college is like and how to manage my time with school and things outside of school. These programs gave me support and helped me plan out what I need to do in order to graduate on time by taking the right classes. With the help of other, they helped me plan out what I have to do in college in order to get to that next big step which for me would probably by trying to get into medical school. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2165,"I think I have a really great support system. I appreciate my parents and friends for being there for when I need some help, guidance, or advice. I think having friends that are also college students and have similar personal, academic, and career goals as me is another great way for me to stay motivated and just move forward with everything we want to pursue in life because its nice to have each other to talk about things we can relate to in school or even find or provide resources for each other that we didn't really know about before. I think we also need that push or some sort of accountability from others so that we can continue to work hard for ourselves even when times are difficult. I also learned through my college experience that everyone is going to go at their own pace and it's good to accept that."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2167,"Some of the values that I have been able to carry throughout my life from my community are being to give back and don’t forget where you have started. Growing up in my community I was blessed to be surrounded by a lot of mentors and role moles that I have helped get to where I am today. Most of these role models and mentors mostly had the same goal to help others and give back what they have received in their own personal life. I think this is very valuable because this will not only help me become a better person and make connections but will also give future generations the opportunity to walk the same path as you or make an even better path for others after them who are pursuing the same goals. As for my family, I think my parents are mostly the ones that influence multiple values in my life. One of them being able to dream big and pursue higher. As a daughter of immigrant parents, I was pretty much at a young age embedded with this because like most parents they wanted a brighter future than what they had. They sacrificed many things to not only look for a better future for them but also for the family as a whole to be able to pursue higher in the future. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2171,"During this time my family and friends have brought me the advise to be thankful throughout the school year. It is easy to be down and feel defeated from everything that is going on in the world. However, it has given me the time to truly be thankful for everything that I have in my life. Even just my health, a reminder that my body has made it through a global pandemic and to appreciate my health overall. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2170,"The values of my family have instilled hard work into my everyday life. I maintain two jobs while still attending school, and I feel like that is a decent workload. However, thanks to my upbringing I am able to handle it and not get too stressed. I am able to utilize my time accordingly and plan out when I need to handle life and complete assignments."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2156,"I am not really sure how exactly to put my thoughts, due to the fact that I had the same approach for all my education careers in my life. I was taught by my family that education is one of the most important things in building the career and towards a successful life. Another important thing to keep in mind is that at the first stages of career, education and experience is more important than the finances, so its better to keep concentrated on the education and gaining experience in your field of study, rather than concentrating on making money. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2172,"The values of my community/family have helped me navigate through college as they have provided a good emotional support system for me. Living technically independent from my family now that I have started college has taught me to value the relationship with my parents even more as well as remember what they taught me growing up. Growing up, my parents taught me to be determined, to aim high, to be patient, to be compassionate, and to be humble. I believe that in college, these values have been very important to me in regards to my performance in college. In my own apartment, living with my roommates have taught me to be more managing of my time, to know my priorities and my boundaries. Overall these values have helped me navigate through college as they have all taught me how to care for my own and go at a pace that I am comfortable with while still staying true to who I am. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2162,"My family has a value of education, so it has helped greatly with navigating through college. They offer their support constantly, and are aware of the difficulties that can arise from being in college. As remote learning is new for virtually everyone, I have had plenty of support to get through these passed few semesters. In addition to my family, I have had much support from my friends. Some of my friends have already graduated college, so they offer me advice and provide encouragement when burn out is beginning to creep on. They also offer post-college advice, which is something that I tend to worry about. It is nice to be able to ask advice from people who have gone through the college experience and entered the workforce already. I appreciate guidance greatly, especially when it is encouraging and supportive, so I am grateful for those in my life that can offer it to me. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,571,"My family and community values hard work and resilience, two principles that I'm constantly referring to as I navigate through the challenges of higher education. It's really no secret that the life of a college student is hard, but another quality that my family/community offers me is an endless amount of support. What's most important behind my two core values is the room/conditions for growth. Its respecting the journey despite the challenges of higher education!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2164,My family has instilled the values of hard work and perseverance in me to help me navigate through college. My parents taught me from a very young age how school was very important and working hard to achieve your goals was a topic that was shared with me from a young age. Our culture values education highly so my parents taught me to pay attention and work hard throughout my academic experience. I can use these values in college and hopefully they will help me in the future as well after I graduate from undergrad. These ideas have helped me along the way and have gotten me to where I am today.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2160,"I think my values of my community or family have helped me navigate through college because in my circle i was grateful that people in my circle cared and tried to give me the resources that they couldn't get when they were my age. Hard work has always been a big value in everything I do whether its school, sports, or a job I think that has translated into college."
