2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2172,"My goals right now are to gain knowledge and experience in science fields and work up to achieving my career goal as a Clinical Lab Scientist. I want to learn more about science and any science that can help me excel towards my goal. Learning is a big part of my goal because it allows me to understand concepts that are important to my career. Physics 112 is helping me achieve these goals because it does not only fulfill a requirement for my major, but it also teaches me the concepts of physics and how to apply these concepts to our everyday life, and including biology. The study and work habits I have and continue to develop in this class also help me work toward my goals."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2176,"My goal is to one day be in the pediatric field of medicine. My personal experience as patient and seeing the lack of Latina women in the field, has driven me to pursue a career in the medical field. I ways always discouraged by my math and physics classes. i am not the strongest in those subject and question why do I ever need to know these formulas and subjects. I have since realized that these classes can make me a well rounded person knowing information in a variety of subjects (not just typical biology courses) physics is relevant into medicine. Physics can help us understand the involuntary and voluntary motions within our own body. This subject is not my strongest and it will take a lot of work and effort to get the grade I want, but I know how important understanding physics is as another way for understanding the world around us."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2167,"The reason why I am here is to continue that path towards growth and success. To be able to do that I need to take stepping stones to continue to be able to reach different heights, dreams, and goals that I am trying to pursue. One of these stones is being at SFSU and precisely in this class because it is one the course requirements for me to graduate.  In the near future I am looking forward to being able to get a college degree and after that pursue more schooling at medical school in hopes to become a cardiothoracic surgeon. Which then I can help those in need but also provide my and my family and I a comfortable life. To be able to do this I will need to be present in the moment to be ready to take my choices and pathways towards the future ahead of me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2175,"my main goal is to become a vet within the next 5-8 years. This class is of course a requirement to graduate, making it an important step to achieving my goal! Additionally, I plan on eventually having kids, and they'll have to take high school and college physics, so it would be nice to help them with that as much as i can! Overall, this class is part of my journey towards my adult life, and towards achieving my goals quickly and efficiently. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2164,"My goals for my future is to finish my undergrad in biochemistry and go on to grad school. My hope is to get into optometry school and become an optometrist. Physics is helping me with this goal because it is helping fulfill my course requirements needed for my major, but it is also helping me prepare for future classes that I also need for my major. Physics 112 is helping me prepare a foundation for physics II and physical chemistry. These are major requirement courses that I need to fulfill in order to graduate with an undergraduate degree in biochemistry. I have always wanted to work in the field of medicine, but recently I decided on optometry as my end goal."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2179,My goals are to get my bachelors degree in Biology so I go onto dental school. This class is helping me get it because it's a requirement. But I don't just see it as a class that I have to take. I also see it as a class that I can take away from. I like to learn about the way things work in the world. And to understand more about the world of physics.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2159,"My goal for this semester is to pass all of my classes with A/B's but I thrive to get an A. By doing so, I will try to be organized, use the planner that I bought earlier this year, and will turn in assignments early. This goal of mine contributes to my bigger goal which is to graduate and get into an ELMSN program. I hope to use this goal to help people in my community but also in countries in need. Another goal of mine is to stop procrastinating/being lazy and to finish my tasks on time without any hesitation. I know this seems harsh but I tend to procrastinate a lot and then it stresses me out when things are due. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,571,"My goals are to educate others about pressing ecological / environmental issues in a way they can understand because let's be honest, science is really cool but also difficult to understand. My hopes are that if people truly understand why scientists say/advise the things they do, they'll be more inclined to follow/take action. One main example I give is that there are people out there who think climate change is a hoax. I think this class is helping me synthesize and practice communicating extremely difficult concepts in a digestible way via our post lab assignments!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2162,"My goals are to get a degree in biology and enter a workforce that I find enjoyable. I want to find a job that I enjoy doing, that aligns with my interests and can give me a fulfilling life. I a still figuring out exactly what that is, so that is another goal of mine. I hope to use my time at San Francisco State University to discover what exactly I want to do. At the moment, I am leaning towards biology writing. I am more comfortable writing than I am doing arithmetic, so I figure that biology writing would be a good career path for me. I have recently added a minor in journalism, so another goal of mine is to fulfill those requirements and learn more about biology in journalism. This class is helping me achieve those goals by being a stepping stone to all of my school-related goals. It is one of the many classes I need to earn a degree. In addition, gaining knowledge in physics will help me with my career if I do decide to go into science writing. I will likely need to know many different types of science in order to write about them. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2163,"My goal right now is to become a pharmaceutical scientist. This class is helping me primarily by fulfilling a requirement, but that's not all. It is also just helping me get more familiar with science and just the process of doing it. That's like the scientific method as well as study habits. This class is also helping me just learn more about the world and how stuff works. which admittedly isn't one of my goals but I still find the material very fascinating. My other goal is to be able to develop good study habits and taking this class (lab and lecture) are helping to give me an opportunity to get better at that."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2178,"My goals are really simple. One of my most important goals is to be a homeowner. My entire life I've only ever lived in a small apartment, tightly packed with my family and being used to having essentially no privacy, having a place to call my own would be a dream come true for me. It nay not seem like much to most people, but to me its really everything, like it would mean stability, wealth, a chance to give my future kids more opportunities than I was allotted, and it means even more as a first generation American and first in my family to get a higher education. So yeah"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2174,"I 've always known that I wanted to work in the health field and so I chose to major in Biology because I thought that it was general and could apply to many fields. I am planning on applying to nursing school once I complete my B.S. It has taken me quite longer than I anticipated because I simply didn't know what to do. I constantly found myself unable to decide so at one point I decided to quit school. I am back at it and I am truly hoping I can wrap up my degree so that I can finally move forward in this aspect of my life. Physics is a requirement to complete the degree and so it must be done although I still find it to be one of the most challenging classes, along with chemistry. I am not fond of either. I do understand how it ties into so many aspects of the medical careers and of how physics is really all around us. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2165,My goal this semester is to stay focused and obtain a better and greater understanding of what I am learning in my classes so that I can apply to my own life and use it after I graduate from sfstate. I have taken a lot of classes and it has been very difficult for me to stay concentrated on what we are learning and remember  that information which makes it harder for me to get the best grades I possibly can. I still try but I know I can do better. I tend to fall behind a lot too and I already see myself but I know its not too late so my goal is to stay on track and spend a little more time studying the content that I am learning in this lab because it does correspond with my life which is pretty cool and fascinating. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2160,"My goals for this class is to achieve a good grade. I would also like to understand the material and earn a common knowledge of physics because I think it'll help me in my future. I feel that having experience of doing these labs will do so. So far this class hasn't been to bad, I like how we are grouped up when doin these labs to work together to complete because it could be very confusing to do so by ourselves. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2155,"My goals are to graduate with a bachelor's degree in Biology-Physiology and use that degree to pursue a career in the medical field. I hope to get into medical school or a Physician's Assistant program. This class is helping me achieve my goals because it is meeting my major degree requirements, which I need to graduate. This class is also giving me a good understanding of how things in the world operate and function and will probably be helpful in my understanding of the human body and how it interacts with the physics of our word as a go through additional schooling. It will also prepare me for the next physics 2 class I have to take to meet my degree requirements, so I will have a solid background before jumping into more complex concepts. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2161,"My current goal right now is to be on schedule with all my classes, especially ones I am struggling with. I want to feel confident in what I learned and be prepared for any tests that come up. Physics is a hard subject for me, so I know I have to devote more of my time to focus, review homework, and rewatch lectures to help myself. This physics lab helps me review and reanalyze concepts we've covered in class that I may have not gotten the first time. It also helps practice physics because we are practicing on concept problems that revolve around what we are learning in class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2170,"My goals are to better understand Physics and how it applies to our real world. There are a lot of different practical applications of physics which makes it easy to grasp in a visual sense. I like that a lot, because it allows me to visualize the problem and go about solving it in a way I can understand. The applications of formulas also help me further understand algebra.  Since we have to re-arrange the formulas to figure out what we want from the equation,  it allows me to practice those skills. I am going to have to also take Physics II so I will need a concrete understanding of this moving forward. I feel like this class is doing a great job in helping me understand these materials and subjects."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2158,"My goal is to graduate with my degree and pursue a good career that will help keep me stable. I want to be able to love my job, and be able to someday own my own home and have a lot of dogs just running around. I have a big love for all animals, especially dogs. For my future career I want to involve myself in animal rehabilitation, my major is biology with a concentration in zoology. I love animals and think that I would really succeed in that kind of environment. This class is helping me to achieve those goals because it is a major requirement for me, and by passing this class I can be further along the path to graduating and getting a good job. I have many science classes to take for my major, so I’m naturally knocking them out one by one as the semesters come. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2177,"My goals is to become a occupational therapist or maybe a nurse. I just want to work in the medical field because ever since I was a kid, I dreamt to be part of it. I believe that this class will help achieve my goals because 1st it's one of the requirements in my major which is Kinesiology. Also, I believe that this class will eventually help me one day because most of the gadgets used in the hospitals basically use physics to build. I believe there's a lot of physics involved and one of them is through radiative therapy for cancer patients. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2166,"My goal is to go into the medical field. My goal for this class is to have a greater understanding of physics overall, because I have no prior experience. I would also like to be able to take what I learn in this class and apply it to anything I do later on in life (like the physics of physiology). This class has gradually made me more interested in physics and although some topics have not been as easy to understand at first glance, they have become like puzzles for me to solve on my own and try to figure out. Sometimes I don't figure it out until days later, but I eventually always do. This class has helped me with building my problem-solving skills and tenacity. I have been taking a lot of time outside of class, just generally trying to understand topics that might be difficult for me by watching youtube videos from trusted sources, re-watching class lectures, and explaining topics to my family."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2168,"One of my goals currently is to get my degree in Environmental Science at SF State. Hopefully by doing so, I can start looking for jobs that interest me that relate to the environmental science field. This class is one of the school's requirements to graduate, so by taking this lab I am one step closer to graduating. Another one of my goals is to get really good grades throughout my 4 or so years at SF State. I'm striving for primarily A's and B's, so hopefully I can come out of this class with one of those grades. I'm also excited to take this class so that I can enhance my knowledge and learn new things that I've never known before. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2156,"In order for me to achieve greatness, I have to master many things, and physics is one of them. Phys 112 helps me to better understand concepts in physics and their applications through simulations and virtual experiments. This course is parallel to my main physics course, Phys 111, thus having many advantages. The main thing both courses have in common are the topics, meaning both classes cover the same topics at the same time. Another great way Phys 112 helps me in mastering physics is that most of the work is done in groups, meaning we experience different approaches to the problem while solving them, giving us the opportunity to view the problems from different points of views. I find Phys 112 really helpful, and an essential to what is waiting for me throughout my career, mechanical engineering. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2173,"My goals are to pass all of my classes and to gain and retain as much new information that I can so that I can use it outside of my classes or in other classes too. This class is going to help me think about what goes on in my everyday life more deeply. This will better my understanding and add to my previous knowledge. This is either my first physics class or I might have taken a physics course a long time ago, so this class should have a lot of new information which I can learn from and apply to my daily life. Taking notes, listening to lectures, doing the homeworks, and using other resources will help me pass this class along with studying.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2157,My goals are to understand better physics because I do not understand it pretty well. Another goal that I have is that I want to work in the medical field and I know that this class is a prerequisite for it but I prefer not to see this class as just a prerequisite but to see what I learn from it and how I can use that on my everyday life and in my future career. This class is helping me to achieve these goals by providing me with the learning. And by explaining things better for me. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2171,My goals for this class is to learn about physics. I did not take it in high school so almost everything is new to me which is pretty exciting. I signed up for this class to fulfill my credits to be a Kinesiology major. It will be interesting to try and make connections between kinesiology and physics. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2169,"My current goals are to stay on top of my homework and to grasp the concepts of each topic that my professors are teaching, I believe going overwork and through the motions is completely different from actually learning and grasping that concept. Recently i was behind on alot of work due to unfortunate situations so i would like to stay on top of my since I just caught but back up on everything."
