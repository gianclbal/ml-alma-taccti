2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2168,"What resources do I have to support me? For starters, I am surrounded by an extremely supportive family which includes my mom and dad, and my two older brothers. I know that my family will always be there for me whenever I need them to be, and will support me and any decision I choose to make. In addition to my family, I have a huge team that is another great support system. I am very fortunate to be able to play on the women's soccer team, especially because I know I will be entering college with 30 girls that will already have my back. I also have my three amazing best friends back at home and my boyfriend who never fails to be there for me when I need them to be. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2173,"Resources that I have to support me are my family and friends who will always be there to help me become a better person and to help me grow and learn. My professors are also there so that I can ask questions when I need help along with my classmates. There are also resources available through the school. For example, the tutoring sessions and the other classes where they are made to help with certain classes like physics, chemistry, biology, etc. The internet is also another resource available to help support me because if I don't understand the material for like my math class, I can use Khan Academy or another resource to find videos to go over the material I learned about more in detail. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2157,The resources that I have to support me are the video recordings for class since I can go back and review the material so that it helps to solve my confusion and helps me understand better the material. And whenever the video recordings do not help me and I am still confused I know that I can meet with my professor and that he would help me solve the problem that I do not understand. I also know that there are more resources like metro tutoring and there they can also help you and support you. My family is also important resource for me because they support me and serve me as inspiration to keep working to achieve my goals. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2178,"I personally feel that I have a lot of different resources available to me. The most obvious and helpful resources that available to most people would be the internet. There's so much knowledge and so many helpful tools and videos and text that uploaded to the internet every second and all of it can be easily accessed with some Wi-Fi and a cell phone. Then there's other resources for things like mental health and emotional support, I've got my family to turn to when I feel like I need some emotional support or someone to talk to, and for others there is access to mental health facilities or things like that. Before Covid I could have said that tutoring hours with other students or even just sitting in the library provided a lot of help, but now all we got is our prof. office hours to see what more we can do "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2164,"I have many resources that support me, including my friends and family and my academic counselor. These resources are available to me when I need them, for example I can schedule a meeting with my academic counselor to discuss future class schedules and my degree progress so far. My family is also available to support me when I feel unmotivated. They help me stay on track and focus in my classes. I can also email my professors if I have any questions or attend their office hours to further discuss any materials that I might not feel certain about. I can also attend tutoring at the student center if I need additional help."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2161,"The resources I have around me are available in different ways, such as virtual contact, emotional, or educational resources. The virtual resources I have are my teachers, classmates, and counselor. They help me with school and any problems I may be struggling with. The emotional resources I have around me are my family and friends. They support me emotionally and financially and they help me through tough times. The educational resources I have are textbooks and our online database, J. Paul Leonard Library. These help me with most aspects of school. They are also very resourceful in studying and writing essays. Other resources I have are FAFSA, which helps me financially with school payments, and CalFresh, which helps me financially to pay for my food and water."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2177,The resources that I have that do support me are my family. They are my greatest motivators for what I want to do in life. Other resources that help support me mentally are my dogs. They reassure me to the things I do are enough and they are my greatest stress reliever. I like to be supported mentally from the people closest to me. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2162,"One resource that I have to support me is my family. My family is very supportive in my education and help in many different ways. I am lucky enough to be supported financially, which alleviates the stress of having to pay my own way through school. Without worrying about student loans, I am able to focus more of my attention on actual school work. Another resource I have to support me is the university itself, as well as the teachers. All of my teachers are very supportive, especially during this difficult time of online learning. There are office hours and other resources available if we need them, which makes reaching out and asking for help much easier. Another resource I have is my own goals. I know what I want out of my education and future, which gives me the motivation to continue on. I can fall victim to burnout quite easy, so keeping my focus on my goals motivates me to keep pushing, especially when the end is in sight. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2160,"Resources I have to support me is using the internet to do everything basically because of covid 19. I use platforms such as youtube, discord, and the schools sites and ebooks to help me succeed in my classes. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2155,"Some resources I have are my friends and family. They keep me motivated, and are always there to help me sort out tough decisions or evaluate my next plan of action to reach my goals. Some other resources I have are at the SFSU veteran's office. They provide help and assistance in all aspects of school and personal life. It is awesome to be able to reach out to another person with military experience because we can relate and have shared experiences. My class mates support me, with study groups and medias platforms to share information and study tips. If I am having trouble with a concept I can easily get in touch with one of my classmates and they have always been there to help me clarify and understand the material. Just reflecting on my ultimate goal is also a resource for me. Thinking about my dreams and goals helps me stay motivated and push through any rough classes or assignments. It helps me to stay focused and determined about what I want in life. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2167,"Some resources that I have that support me are first my mentor who are there for me to help me with any trouble I have and also help up to their ability. Office hours from teachers have also been a great resource for many of my classes to be able to talk to my teacher and receive extra guidance throughout material I am having trouble with. I haven't used this resource, but I did wish to have used it  this semester, I know the semester is not over and I hope I am still able to use it for the upcoming final at the school tutoring center. This would have been very help for that extra help with material I am struggling in class. The last resource I find very helpful throughout this semester is the SCI classes that SFSU offers to give students that extra hand for those hard classes. For me classes would be Chem 115 and Phys 111. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,571,"I feel lucky enough to have so many resources of support from my friends and family to the internet. For my study breaks I like to accompany my dog outside in the backyard for a while. I have a hammock I like to sit at and sometimes read or I'll use our outside furniture for homework. Other times I've even had bonfires while I study. With a couple of clicks on the interwebs, I can go to office hours if and when I have trouble with my homework. I can always email my questions and know that they'll be replied to. I have an abundance of resources fortunately!  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2174,"There are many resources today to support me in this class. We have you and you have made it very clear that you are here to help. There is also a tutoring center here at SFSU. My classmates are also a good resource, although it has been a  bit more challenging with the online classes rather than in person. The other great resource is the internet. There are so many platforms that are helpful for students today. Google has become not only my go to but I am sure a resource that many students use today. You as well as Professor Brewer have office hours and that is also another resource. Youtube also has some great videos on how to solve problems and explanations of concepts, which are fundamental to approaching alot of the problems that we come across in physics class. In other regards, my motivational resources to finish my degree come from the support and encouragement of family and friends. I truly believe that they are some of the most precious things in my life, especially now during these pandemic times."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2165,"I have countless resources to support me if I really think about it, whatever the case may be. I have family that support me in school and in life, I have friends who also support me in school and life, I have advisors and professors at school to support and guide me with my academic and career goals, I have the internet to help me find other resources that will guide me and give me answers to questions I may have about myself, others or the world. There are so many resources available to us that I sometimes forget about and realize that I am not alone and can use all that I have to support me in life, to be happy, to learn, and to grow."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2156,"At this age, the greatest resource in terms of knowledge we have is the internet itself. Whether it is a Khan Academy video, or a forum at which the topic is discussed and explained, we can always get the answer to any question that arises in our head. Setting aside the fact that I can always contact my instructor for explanation and answers, I can also watch videos and forums where a similar problem is being discussed and see different approaches to a problem, which with no doubt helps the solving process. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2166,"This semester has been the most overwhelming one I have had to date, with a lot of things outside of school that I have had to deal with. The most helpful resources in dealing with those things have been my friends and family and also reaching out to my professors. The educational resources that have helped me the most this semester are office hours and tutoring as well as doing my own research on topics that I do not understand from reputable resources outside of the classroom like khan academy. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2172,"Some resources I have to support me are TASC, the mental health support center, my own peers, my professor, as well as resources from the internet. TASC can support me with tutoring in case I need any additional help in my classes. I feel that the SF mental health support provides me with a good support whenever I am feeling down or overwhelmed. I know during online school, learning has been a little difficult as well as it is almost the end of the semester so I am feeling a little burned out. My own peers can support me as well in giving encouragement and helping each other with assignments. My own professors can help me not only with the class and understanding the material, but also helping encourage me and support me throughout the course. The internet is also a good resource for me since I can find multiple examples and explanations that help me understand the material even more. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2175,"I have plenty of resources available to me , through the school and through my own personal means. for example, the school offers tutoring services, and i can also get them myself through a private service. additionally, I have a great support system including my peers, friends, and my significant other. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2158,"I feel as though I have many resources that support me in different ways. I have two really good friends I lean on for emotional support, and they give me different perspectives on things I may be having trouble with. In general too though, they're just really great people and I know that I can always count on them. My parents, and other close family also are one of my biggest support systems. They all encourage me, and have helped me get to where I am today. Without everyone encouraging me to be successful, I wouldn't even be typing this right now. I would have never imagined living in San Francisco, making the friends that I am, and doing the work that I'm doing. I'm grateful for having genuine people to count on, because not everyone can say that they do. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2176,"My family is my biggest support group I have. They are always with me through thick and thin, always by my side whenever I need them. While only one of my parents attended college, they always try to make sure I receive the best education possible. My friends are another prominent support group in my life. As said before because only one of my parents attended college and my dad graduated from college over 20 years ago, there are a lot of changes on how the college process works. My friends are there to help me fill in the gaps on missing information on how to get through college. They have helped me put together a four year plan for myself to get through my degree. I could not have thank them enough by setting me up on the right foot to have a successful joinery though college. These support groups are what truly make my success."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2163,Some resources I have to support me is first my organizational system. I know that I am not able to be completely on top of everything so I like to plan out my weeks ahead of time in order to ensure that I am as productive as I can be that week and that I am set up for success. Secondly I have the internet which I find very useful when trying to solve a problem that I am suck on. My friends and family are also a support system albeit not in the same way. They support me by being their for me when I am having a tough time and I find that very helpful.  
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2171,During this time of covid I am very grateful to have many resources that I can turn to in need. One of the main resources that I have is my family. My family supports me throughout everything that has happened this year and dealing with college. Another main source were I feel supported are my friends in my life. It is always easier to deal with things when I have people beside me who have my best interests. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2170,"Reflective Journal 4	I use the class resources as well as going to office hours with my professor. I also use Khan Academy or various other resources through youtube if I am still stuck on a problem. I find having multiple resources very useful, because it allows me to fully understand the topic and get information from different sources. Some teaching styles help me understand the material better than others. I also use my classmates as a resource and I found that to be one of the most effective ways in understanding a topic. We are all in the class together and it helps that they know the exact problem I am working on or struggling with. We have a discord that we use in order to keep in touch with each other, as well as remind each other of due dates coming up for assignments. All of these resources have really helped me get through this class and I am very grateful to have access to them.  Although, I wish I was on campus this is definitely a great alternative."
