2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2157,"When life gets challenging I try to calm myself take walks to relax and think about what I can do to make things better to find the motivation to study for exams to do my homework. Since sometimes I feel overwhelmed by everything I feel too stress and sometimes due to all that sometimes I feel that I can do it anymore. But in the end, I do not let the stress or the load that I feel put me down to quiet, when I feel that I can't handle it anymore I usually try to take time off, I try to spend more time with my little sister play with here watch movies and shows with her and that actually helps me a lot and also since I am the first member of my family to go to college I used that as motivation and think that I can be like a role model for her to follow. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2158,"Recently, I have been going through a lot. I'm struggling with a lot of things, and I feel like I'm overall just overwhelmed with everything. What I do is distract myself really, I use school as a way to keep my mind off of the outside stuff. I also try to hang out with my friends more, or facetime my mom. I don't have the best relationship with her, but since I've moved to sf for school, and I've been away from home, I call her a lot so that we can talk and catch up. I think I'm just very homesick honestly, on top of everything else. I try to keep calm, and remind myself of all the things I am grateful for, and all the things I plan to to with my future. Thinking about going back to campus, and making friends honestly is something that I think about a lot, and that gets me really happy and excited. I try not to let what I have going on affect me, so I do things like see friends, facetime, watch movies, and listen to music. Music to me is soooo therapeutic. I will forever listen to R & B from the early 2000's. My go to for sure. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2175,"when times are challanging, i make sure to surround myself with people who i know have the best intentions for me. this includes my friends, my siblings, and my partner. they all get how im feeling and try their best to help me with the problem as well as to make sure i dont center my whole life around it. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2167,"Usually when things in life or even when I come across things that overwhelm or challenge me there is either one of three things I do. One of them is to take a break from what is happening to recollect my thoughts. During this break I would either take a nap to relax my whole body and mind. Another thing that i would do is paint/draw, art has always be a very comfort for me since I was little and has helped me get through things that i found tough to do in my life. Also when I was very active and I would do high school sports, exercise was another thing that I would do in the break because it would help me relieve any tension and stress that I have built up in my body. The other thing that I would do if I found something challenging is cry. Even though I'm not known to be very sensitive or even a crier in my family, I don't know what it is about crying after feeling challenged but it has helped my relieved stress in my body and helped me recollect my thoughts to confront the challenge again. Fun fact I would use the crying method unless I'm alone. If I'm not alone I don’t feel like crying at all. Lastly, I usually use this method last because I am a very stubborn person and because I am a very introverted person, but as my last resort, if I can't figure it out or can't seem to overcome the challenge I will ask for help. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2176,"As I approach midterm season I somehow find myself in a pit of stress, but to combat the stress I do several things. I love to paint. Painting is one of the hobbies that brings me true joy. Painting itself can be stressful, but I see it as a good stressor. I use acrylic paint as my medium. Painting can take me from 3 months to two days depending on the size and complexity. Another thing I do when I am stressed is play with my golden doodle Buster. He has so much energy and keeps me occupied. Having a dog really changed my life for the better, even though Buster himself can be too energetic, he is also a good stressor to have in my life. Hopefully midterm season can fly by and I can relax during spring break and play with my dog and finally start on big canvas paintings."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2156,"Challenge is something that keeps the world rolling. The thing is that challenge makes us stronger, more adaptive and tests our imagination when it comes to solving issues. Nothing can be don without a challenge. Every important or life changing decision should be made knowing that it won't go without challenges. Challenges try to see if we are ready for the next step or not. It guarantees that what comes next is more important and influential than what was before. When life gets challenging I prepare for the worst. I put the most effort possible. I prepare myself to face the worst enemy possible. By doing so I make sure I can survive anything, since being prepared for the worst is a guarantee that anything below that would be survivable. I accept the fact that challenge is a not forever and what has a beginning has an end, so it will be over soon, and better I face it, better it would pass for me. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2155,"When life gets challenging I always try to take a step back and look at my situation from a new point of view. Then I can see what needs to be done, and how to overcome that challenge. I also try to stay positive! Keeping a positive mindset is actually proven to make you smarter, better able to problem solve, and overall happier in life. When I remind myself to stay positive it puts me in a better mindset and I am able to get out of my tunnel vision thinking and see the challenge in a new way. I will also utilize my other resources like calling up my mother, talking with my boyfriend, or calling up my brother. They often are able to give different perspectives on the challenge and help me to realize what good things I have in my life, and that according to my grandmother, ""pain is temporary!"" "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2161,"What I do when life gets challenging is focusing on destressing. I get stressed easily, so when I have a lot on my plate, I quickly become overwhelmed and it becomes harder to work, even if work is the most important thing at the time. This is why I need to step back and make sure I am physically and mentally okay so I can continue to productively and efficiently work. Destressing can be done in many ways, such as watching Netflix, hanging out with my cat, or baking, but my personal favorite is hanging out with friends. They are the best stress reliever and they ground me when times get tough. I surround myself around them especially on my most challenging days and I am lucky to have them. Another thing I do when life gets challenging, considering the challenge is work or school, is I make sure to organize my life and know everything I have to do. The best way to do this, personally, is using an application called Notion. On Notion, I write my assignments for the week, upcoming tests, things I have to do, and fill in my calendar. Doing this saves me much more time and stress because I know what I need to get done. Staying organized is one of the most important things to me and I need it most when I have a lot to do.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2178,"Whenever things get challenging, I like to ignore my problems until the very last minute and pretend everything is fine. Ok that was a joke, sorta, but what I usually do is step away from my problems and take a break from the thing that's messing me up. It's good to clear one's head and to return to topics and issues with a clear mind, because when you are looking at things without a clear mind, then usually your own irrational emotions get in the way of logical problem solving, which usually leads to exaggerating the problem even more. One of my favorite activities to clear my head is meditation or reading, both take my mind elsewhere and allow me to escape for a little while, which is something we could all use from time to time. Sometimes its good to talk about your issues with family or friends, just to get it off your chest."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,571,"Life for me gets challenging when I don't take care of myself. For that reason, when I'm feeling overwhelmed and stressed I first take some deep breaths and then do a self check-in. I try to find out what my body needs whether it's sleep, water, or sometimes even just a small break with a walk around my backyard and some stretching. Other times I just feel like I need to work in my bed or outside! "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2173,"When life gets challenging, I take a few steps back to try to go over the situation or the problem over again to see if I missed any parts and see where my confusions are. If I really can't understand it, I would seek out help from others to help me better understand the part that is challenging to me. Sometimes, I would move on to something else and work and focus on that, then go back to the part that is challenging to me. I could go over my notes, lectures, other resources that could help me better understand the challenge I am facing. Also, I know that there is always a way to solve the problem and I just have to figure out the way to get past the challenge. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2174,"When I feel overly stressed I Iike to go for a walk with my dog. I usually take him out everyday but on some days he will get 2 or 3 walks. Especially now during the pandemic since there isn't much to do. Sometimes I will also talk to a close friend and I will let them know, ""I need to vent, I hope that's ok."" And thankfully, they are good friends so they will listen and give me some comfort. I also find that anything self care is great for me, a nap, a bath. I try to do these on a regular basis so that I don't let those feelings accumulate. Oh, and I pray. =)"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2159,"When life gets challenging, I tend to get stress out which leads me to do the following. I write down all of my stressors which are typically things I have to do like school assignments, work deadlines, or my personal life. I write everything that I need to do and give myself a deadline on finishing those items off my list, which also helps me manage my time better. I also ask my professors or manager for an extension and the reason why I'm asking for an extension. I usually almost never ask for an extension because I like to finish my tasks on time. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2165,I am a pretty sensitive person and can sometimes be hard on myself when life gets hard but I always seek help in any way possible whether it be by reaching out to my family or my friends. Then I try to remind myself that it's going to be hard for the moment but not forever so I just have to keep moving forward. I like to listen to music or guided meditations that make me relax. I also like to go outside for a walk or go somewhere where I can get fresh air and just get a mental break from everything that may be going on in my life if it's stressful. My life can get a little overwhelming sometimes so I try to remind myself to take breaks and do some self-care so that I care for myself when things get hard. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2171,When life gets challenging I feel like I handle my situations by putting my problems to the side and try not think about my issue. This is not the best thing to do because then I will have to deal with my problems later. I like to distract myself from other things. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2163,"Honestly I have no idea right now. Im going through alot of stuff personally right now and everything feels really challenging and I dont have a lot of motivation to get through. but im just trying my best like I always do even though life is really challenging right now. Im really just trying to stay calm and focus on what is important even though that seems impossible to me right now I know that doing that is the best way to handle such a challenging time. also just trying to take things one step at a time. If I look at everything right now, i know ill get overwhelmed so Im just trying to focus on one thing at a time and get through all my work and my issues I have right now."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2162,"When life gets challenging, I try to find a balance between being productive and taking some time for myself. Sometimes I struggle finding that balance, so I really try to focus on being mindful of my time. It is easy for me to fall into the habit of laying in bed and not getting things done. When I realize that I am doing this because I am avoiding facing challenges, I know that I need to take a step back and manage my time better. I also try to set time to think about what is happening, why life feels challenging, and what I can do to feel better. I find that getting to the root of the problem helps me rationalize the situation at hand. Reminding myself what I am working towards and why is also helpful for me to keep working at something that I may find challenging, such as burnout from school and work. Finally, finding time to do things that I truly enjoy helps a huge amount. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2160,"When life gets challenging I try to embrace it because I know there will be bumps in the road but its all about perseverance and how you handle those problems, making sure they don't get the best of you. Things I do when I go through struggles & challenges is stepping away and doing things I like to find some peace and come right back to it because that helps me feel more motivated. I also think meditation is a good way to calm yourself down because a lot of the times you can panic or be overwhelmed with the tasks in front of you. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2168,"When life get's challenging, I try and stop and think about all of the good things that I have. I reflect on how lucky I am to have a roof over my head, clothes to wear, food to eat, and a family who is always supporting me in whatever I do. This past year has been challenging for everyone, but I think what really helped get me through it is doing things I love and surrounding myself with people I love. Being at home with my family has really made us all become closer, especially me and my brothers. I also think finding little things to keep you distracted from what's going on can really help. Whether that's creating a morning routine that helps you feel more productive, or picking up on a new hobby such as cooking or painting. Another thing that's important to do when life gets challenging is to remember that the pain or struggle or heartache won't last forever, and there will always be that light at the end of the tunnel. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2166,"This semester has been the most difficult I have ever had and I have faced many different hardships along the way. Life has gotten challenging but when this happens, I have been leaning on my family. My friends and family has been very supportive in every way possible. I am very grateful and lucky to have them in my life. One thing that I like to do when life gets challenging and remember my ""why"". Why am I here? Why am I in college? What do I wanna do and why? Why am I in the position that I am in and how can I avoid this from happening again? I like to ground myself in my purpose because doing so makes things very easy to focus on. Doing things day by day, task by task, and stopping to smell the roses along the way is a lifestyle that has really helped me during difficult times."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2164,"When life gets challenging, I like to take some time and relax. This can be done by reading, exercising, taking a shower, or watching TV. Usually when I'm doing school work and I get stressed out I allow myself to watch one episode of a show I'm currently watching or if I'm stressed at night while working I'll take a shower and let myself relax for a little bit. Normally when I get stressed I can't accurately work and finish my homework so it's necessary for me to take at least a ten minute break to calm down and make myself ready to focus. Finding a way to get my mind off of what's causing my stress really helps me calm down and focus better when I restart my work. I also like to plan my week out in advance and even include what days I can work on homework for my different classes and that helps me feel better at how I will manage all my work. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2172,"When life gets challenging, I like to simply take a breather and go outside, or just take a nap. Enjoying some fresh air helps me release the stress that’s been building up and the nature and surroundings help relax me. Sleeping also helps me release the stress when life gets hard since when I sleep, I don’t have to think about the problem and I don’t have to deal with it. Although I know it it will still be there when I wake up, I know during that moment when i’m asleep, there is a moment of pure bliss and peacefulness. I also like to plan ahead and think about my problems and possible ways I can tackle them and resolve them to take the stress of worrying out of my my mind. I think we all should have moments of bliss because life is always going to get hard, and we deserve moments of relaxation. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2177,"At the moment, I'm not sure how to answer that question. This past few weeks have been so hard for my family. My family has definitely been my strength energy, but I have been so behind in various classes because I didn't know how to handle the loss of my grandmother. This past weekend during her funeral, I finally have put in peace that she is with the heavenly father so I have to rise back up again."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2170,"I enjoy meditation while hiking. We have so many great spots around Sonoma county to hike and it is easy to find a nice, quiet spot to center myself. I also like to go on trips just to get a change of scenery. COVID has been preventing this , obviuosly but I just received my first vaccination dosage today so I am free to travel on the 13th of April after my second!! I work with kids so that is how I was able to get my vaccination."
