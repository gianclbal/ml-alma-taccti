Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2155,"I'm here at San Francisco state because the military brought me back to CA. I enlisted in the military in 2016 and just finished my contract, so I decided to use the GI bill to further my education. San Francisco State had a great assortment of degrees to choose from and also this location would keep me close to my family. The reason I'm in this physics class is because it is a requirement of my major and eventually I would like to use this degree to become a physicians assistant or go to medical school. I think understanding physics and it's fundamentals will be extremely beneficial to my future goal of becoming a doctor, so I plan on really investing myself into this course."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2156,"I was always passionate about cars. They were my interest as a kid and realized they would become my career. I was born and raised in Armenia, and to be honest there is no quality education in here. I knew since the beginning, if I want to succeed in mechanical engineering I have to study abroad. Due to the fact that I have travelled a lot, I really liked the United States as a country, and as I grew up I realized that its a country that would fit me the best. Silicone Valley is the ultimate areawhere technological advancements are being made all the time. San Francisco is the city that appeared to my heart the most. Math and physics are the main two subject I have to master in order to become a good engineer. This course will no doubt help me master physics and improve my math skills, thus positively affecting my career. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2157,"Hi, my name is Leydi. I am here taking physics because it is a prerequisite for my major which is Biology with a concentration in Physiology. However, I am looking forward to learning what is physics about and how do we use it in our daily life to understand things better. To learn how things function, I am a very curious person, and every time I have the opportunity to learn something new I take it positively and try my best to understand things and to things well. So even though I do not consider myself a math lover I am willing to give my best to learn how to solve equations and solve physics problems to learn the process of physics and being able to understand how things function. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2158,"I’m here overall to learn and to do well in my academics to help myself for my future career. Taking this physics course is taking me a step closer in doing so. It is one of my required courses to take, and I actually believe that I have to take one more physics course after I have taken this one. I know that I can pass this class, so I’m ready for the challenge. I’m a biology major so I will have to take a lot of science courses to be able to graduate and get that degree! I’m a pretty well rounded student, and I take my academics very seriously. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2159,"I am here to take this lab because it is a requirement to take it co-currently with my physics 1 class. Physics is the study of matter and the universe. Physics has a combination of both science and math and is used in our daily lives. I have to take physics because of my major but it would also help me in my future career since I will be dealing with human anatomy. What I mean by that is, I aspire to be an NP but in a trauma setting and although physics doesn't have a direct correlation with the human body, it does have a connection with someone's action, like a car accident, knowing how fast someone was going and the impact. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2160,I am here to pass this class to fulfill a requirement I need to achieve my goal which is to get a degree and continue on to become a PT. But while taking this class of course I would like to learn the material and earn a good grade instead of just trying to do the bare minimum because that would just be wasting my time. Physics sounds like a cool topic and i enjoy picking up on new things.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2161,"The reason I am in this class is that I am working towards my goal of majoring in zoology and becoming a wildlife rehabilitator after I graduate from SFSU. Although this course was necessary to take for my major, I believe physics will help me someway in zoology and science overall. In high school, I took physics but I didn’t understand a lot of it, but I hope to truly grasp the information this time around and I am looking forward to a physics lab part of this class. I am here because I want to be and I want to be a scientist. I hope to stay determined throughout the school year and I can already tell that I have a support system that will help me through each chapter and topic we will go over in physics. The feeling of feeling supported makes me motivated to continue and push myself to learn! "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2162,"I am here, in this physics class at San Francisco State, as a step to get closer to the rest of my life. I plan on getting a degree and entering a career that I hope to be fulfilling and enjoyable. I want to be able to live a happy and comfortable life and this is just one of the many steps along the way that will get me there. From this physics class, I will move on to the next physics class, and continue my college career until I have enough units to graduate. I spent many years after high school wondering what I wanted to do with my life, and held off from going to school in order to figure this out. I finally have a general idea, and am excited that I am working towards that goal every day. I have high hopes for the future and plan on working my hardest every step of the way. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2163,"I think that the easiest answer to this would just be to focus on the class first. Im really just here to fill a requirement. If I'm being completely honest, physics has never really been my favorite subject. I think that I don't really look at the world from a physics perspective so I don't really get the full appreciation.  What I mean by this is I never look at a car and wonder why does it accelerate the way it does? However, I know that Taking this course will enrich my understanding of the world and how it works which is never a bad thing. And next why am I at state? and that question I don't really have an answer for that yet. I think over the course of this next year I'm really going to look for classes that I like and hopefully find something I want to do as a career in the future."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2164,"I am a student at San Francisco State because i decided to stay at home for college. This was a difficult decision I had to make with my family and ultimately I decided it would be best for me and my family to stay at home. I am taking this class because of my major, biochemistry. This class is helping me work towards my goal of one day becoming an optometrist. This goal has changed many times over the years, but it has always been centered around medicine. I had been thinking about all the different uses of my degree in the medical field and ultimately decided optometry would be the most interesting and fulfilling for me. This decision is also what influenced me to stay at home for college and what helped me decide SF State was for me. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2165,"Why am I here?This is actually a really great question to think about every morning when I wake up out of bed. I have a purpose to be here on this earth. To live, to breathe, to love, and to learn. There is so much to do in life and we all have unique paths in what we want to do. I find myself learning to be the person I can be to be happy, healthy and prospering. The past year, I have learned to be more aware of what decisions I make that lead me towards my goals in all aspects of life. Therefore, I am in school to continue to learn so I can earn a degree and find a career I would like to pursue in. Doing so all includes my purpose of taking these classes and studying to learn and use my knowledge now and in the future. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2166,"I am here because I have never been here before. I am a first generation student from a family who notoriously hates math, so I have avoided taking physics all throughout my education up until this point. But this class is more than just a requirement for me. I do not have any experience with physics and I think this would actually be a really good challenge to finally overcome. I think it will be good for me to step outside of my comfort zone. I have always felt like I wasn't good enough at math to do physics and be in STEM in general, or that I just couldn't do it, but not anymore. Being in college has motivated me because I have worked so hard to get here with the support of my family, and I don't want to doubt myself anymore. I know I can do this."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2167,"Coming from a minority immigrant family, a higher education is always very important and looked up at. Higher education is very looked up in my family because most of my family members never really finished their education because they wanted to come to the US for a better life. So I was very influenced by this and found a goal to go into medical school. Therefore I am here attending this class to be able to reach that goal of mine. I also want to be able to not only for myself but also for family be able to create a comfortable future. I would like to repay as much back to my parents because they have worked hard for me to live a better life. Also have had their own sacrifices just to give us a better future. This I am also able to be here because my parent have been able to create this opportunity for me to be able to reach my dream and goal in life "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2168,"Why am I here? Well to start off, I decided to continue my academic career at San Francisco State mostly because I got a scholarship to play on the women's soccer team. Getting to play soccer at a college level has been my dream since I was a little girl, so I am very excited to get back out on the field once we are able to. For why I am in this class, I think mostly just for my GE credits. This is my very first college lab as well as my very first online college lab, so everything is still very new to me and I don't really know what to expect. But I am very excited to get this semester going, and hopefully taking this lab will give me good knowledge that I can take with me for future classes. I hope taking a lab online isn't too difficult but I'm definitely ready for the challenge. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2169,I am here today taking physics 111 and 112 because it is a requirement and it is also a class that I am very interested in taking. Even though I have no knowledge about this subject it will help me along my pre-med route.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,571,"I'm here not only to satisfy requirements for my major but also because I want to. I'm eager to learn about physics and the laws that govern our everyday world. I would consider myself a knowledge junkie if you will lol. I like to learn about loads of different things, especially about how our world works. I'm fascinated with space and want to be able to one day read a physics scientific journal and actually be able to follow and understand it. I'd like to be able to think about it conceptually and form questions that perhaps one day be answered by others in the field. I'm here because I want to be able to contribute to the knowledge we know about our world :)  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2170,Hi my name is Jacob Steiger. I am here at Sf State studying Biochemistry! I am looking forward to this upcoming semester as this is the first physics course I have ever taken. I cannot wait to meet all of you!
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2171,"I am enrolled in this class because it is a prerequisite for kinesiology. I do not have much experience with physics because originally I was a pre-nursing major, but then switched to pre-kinesiology. I started off with pre-nursing thinking that I would be able to do it along with being on the track team. I soon realized that it was much more difficult than I thought. I switched to Kinesiology because I took sports medicine in high school and it really interested me to learn more about body movement especially as an athlete. Now I am taking physics to continue on with kinesiology!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2172,"I am here in physics 112 because it is part of my major pathway and also apart of the physics 111 course. As a major in microbiology, physics is an integral part of my major requirements, thus this is why I am in these classes today. Why did I choose to major in microbiology? Why did I choose to goto San Francisco State University? The answer that I can best come up with is that I love San Francisco. I love the weather here, I love the people, and the culture. Why did I not decide to just goto Sac State for college, where I could be close to home? I guess it's because San Francisco offers many opportunities to live independently and also still be close to home. San Francisco State also has a good biology program as well as a CLS internship that I need to become my desired career. Maybe that is why I chose to goto San Francisco State. The good opportunities the college and the city has to offer has ultimately put me into physics 111 and 112. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2173,"I am here to help myself become a better person and to help out others in the world. I feel like my purpose in life is to find a balance in life where I can have time to do what I love to do and do what I have to do to help out others. I am in this Physics class so that I can fulfill the requirements for my Chemistry degree which would be one step closer to achieving an even bigger goal. That goal is to get a job in the medical field with my degree, skills, personality, experience, etc. This will allow me to learn more about the world around me in a different perspective and be able to look at situations with different points of views. I am not here just to get a good grade, but also to learn as much new information as I can and to try to retain that information. I am here to help try to work towards a goal so that I can eventually give back to my parents for everything that they have sacrificed in order to give my brother and I the best life that we can have."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2174,"""Why am I here?"" - An excellent question. I have asked myself this question many times with a varying range of answers depending on my mood and other circumstances. In a literal sense, why am I here, in this physics class at SF state? This class is a requirement for my major and there is no way around it. I never really understood why this is a requirement, but it is what it is. I am here to further my education and so I must complete this class so I can get my piece of paper. =) And hopefully pursue another one later on."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2175,"So I'm a zoology major, and this class is apparently a requirement for me,which i guess makes sense, it kinda falls into the science/math category. So focusing on my major, I chose to be a zoology major because I have always had a passion for helping and learning about animals, as well as giving them a voice. And by always, I mean since like second grade. Of course I looked into diffrent paths and majors as i went along, but I always came back to being a vet. I am at SFSU because my sister is a senior here, but also because I love the city. Any city would have been enough for me, as it is better than going to Fresno State, which is the closest UCS around here, but SF had to have been the best choice! The people, the architecture, everything! I just can't wait to be on campus and experience it in person, it will really be a life changing experience! "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2176,"I like to ask this question when I am beyond frustrated that I cannot figurate certain problems in my physics homework. Why am I here? How have I gotten this far if I cannot figure out simple equations or topics within my respective courses? The imposture syndrome creeps up from times to time, but I remind myself of the hard work and dedication I have put into every single class to come out on top. It hasn’t been easy, but I am blessed to have an amazing support system such as my friends and family to cheer me on. I am here to continue my journey to hopefully one day get into medical school (and to hopefully on day become a pediatrician). But on a more microscopic scale, I am here in this because it is simply a requirement, but I do want to excel in this subject. Math is not my strong suit but after taking calculus, I gained a little more confidence. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2177,"I am taking this class because it's one of my requirements for the Kinesiology program. But mainly, I took this class because I told myself that I would finally take a physics class in college. In high school, I was intimidated to take the AP Physics class. Almost everyone that I knew took it, but it never interest me. Since almost all my friends took Physics I would always be in the classroom after school when they had to finish a lab. The physics teacher became a close friend of mine since I would always be there. My junior year, Ms. Fitz would encourage me to take the class but at the time I prioritized Biology. When I got to college and realized how much I enjoyed Kinesiology, I started remembering terms that would come out of my friends mouths back in high school and how it connected to Kinesiology. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2178,"I am here because I need this course for my major, I understand that this is kind of mean but its the truth, I want to be able to afford a roof over my head, food on my table and in my fridge, and hopefully a stable environment for some other people to thrive in. If I want to be able to do ANY of that, I need a job that can support such a lifestyle, Biology is the clearest path to financial security that I can see. Personally I wish that I didn't have to waste literal years of my life to simply provide for me and those I care about, it seems like a violation of our basic human rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Sorry this is off topic. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,2,2179,"I believe that I am here to become something in life. To have a major and a profession. My whole life I was told that I had to study hard and have a profession so I wouldn't be like my parents. It's not that my parents are horrible people, but they just want me to be better than them. And that's really what I intend to do. I want to make them proud. I am taking this class because it is a requirement for my major."
