2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2499,"From the perspective of a person looking back at my life, most likely it would be seen through the lens of consequentialism. Caring more about my actions than smaller details that led to them. Completely avoiding the conversation about my own interests, my goal is to use my position of great privilege to some positive effect. I am able-bodied, have been given the opportunity to pursue a STEM degree, to work in a field accessible to very few. If anything could come of positive consequence of my life in the field, it would to add to the body of human knowledge as much as possible. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2073,"I first started at SFSU as a Computer Science Major, but a semester later wasn't provided any help with any advisors or professors. I was doing it for the money for obvious reasons I didn't really have much passion for coding other than it looked cool. I learn to code without any help from professors and I didn't really enjoy that. So I searched for a new major, one that would bring me some content feeling and accomplishment. My first reason going into STEM was for the money but I found out that wasn't going to help or fulfill me continue my journey as a Computer Science major. I chose Civil Engineering because I want to become the first Engineer in my family and break the cycle as the first College grad as well. Choosing Civil Engineering helps me push myself not only to become a better person but also excites me of what I can accomplish/build as the years progress in my Professional Career. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2500,"I want to go into the STEM field mainly because I’m interested in science and mathematics. I want to become a doctor so I have to take STEM related courses in high school as well as in college. Sure enough, I’m interested in most of the STEM classes I’m taking right now even though I took them just for my major requirement. It seems most of the things I have to learn in those classes are applicable in everyday life situations so I feel like I’ve become a lot more knowledgeable about how things process or how us, living things, are built up. Not only that, STEM field offers us a lot of good job opportunities compared to other fields. For me, going into the STEM field is like a double-win because I can both pursue the career I love and get a good job at the same time if I’m in this field. That’s the main reason why I want to go into the STEM field."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2501,"I realized that I wanted to go into the STEM field probably at some point when I was in middle school or my early years in high school, when I realized that I love the math and science fields more than other fields such as history or English. Up until that point, I had excelled in any math or science courses that I had taken, and I found those to be way more interesting than my other classes. So, I figured why not go into a field that combines the two? Also, my brother-in-law is a mechanical engineer, so getting to talk to him about what he does and the schooling he went through has helped me determine what I want to do with my education/career."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,458,"I would like to help in finding ways to stop destruction of Mother Earth and to find ways to help her heal. In the field of electrical engineering, I wish to join the e-transportation movement.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2502,"When I think about why I want to do into the STEM field I think of a couple major factors. The first main reason why I want to go into the STEM field is the financial positive it comes with. Personally, I want to become a civil engineer and I know that it is typically a well paying job of about $85,000+ annually depending on where you work. I use this as motivation so I can hopefully live a comfortable life and not have to worry too much about how I will need to provide for necessities. The second main reason is because I am interested in the type of work. I like the idea of designing and creating so I originally thought that I can fulfill this likeness towards a career. Overall, I think that going into civil engineering and the STEM field in general will lead me towards living a satisfactory life."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2503,"since my childhood I loved science. Two of my uncles are engineers the older one is an Petroleum Engineer and the younger one id Chemistry Engineer. My goal was to be an engineer at the time. However I wasnt sure what engineer I wanted to be. Both of unclesw kept motivating me to be like them and my father is the oldest but he is not an engineer. My father favourite hobby beside fishing is modifying and fixing cars. he used to take me with him to the garage when i was 8 so that i learn. when i turned 13 i wanted to be a Mechanical Engineer. However, when I graduated high school Kuwait government said that it would not send any student on a scholarship for Mechanical Engineering, because there is more that enough of Mechanical Engineers in Kuwait, thus i choose Electrical Engineering and came to San Francisco."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2504,"I joined the STEM field because I have always enjoyed science. I as a child I was very good a math but I found it a bit boring. When I started taking science classes in high school I was able to apply concepts to the math and I decided that that was a career I wanted to pursue. I started a computer science major. I liked working with computers and imagined myself getting a job in Google or Microsoft. Unfortunately, the professors weren't the kindest of people and everyone in the major were sort of bitter and not helping. I then decided to change major to Chemistry because I really enjoyed that class in high school and well here I am. A second year Chemistry major looking forward to learning more about physics and how to apply these concepts to chemistry. The more I learn about everything, the better I will be in my career."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2505,"One of the main reasons that I wanted to go into the stem field was because a lot of people had said that they were having a lot of trouble finding a job after they had graduation college and then I found out that many of them were not in the stem fields, and that people who were in the stem field did not have the same difficulty finding a job as those without a stem major degree. And another part besides having job security was that engineering is a respectable major that makes a decent wage and also is a growing industry."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2506,"I want to go into the STEM field because I love math and science. Math and science have always been my favorite subjects throughout my school life. Even though I might not excess academically in some STEM classes, I enjoy doing the work and learning new things in those classes. I enjoy understanding how things work in the work and why things happen. I especially love hands-on activities and enjoy doing labs with other classmates. Setting up labs and going through them are very fun to me and I definitely miss doing them in the labs at campus. I want to go in the STEM field because of the occupations that go along with it as well. Not only do STEM occupations include my favorite subjects, but they make a decent amount of money."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2389,"I want to go into the STEM field for several reasons. First, I have always loved building things and creating. I feel as a mechanical engineer, I can have a wide range of things I can enter. I can help build mechanical prosthetic limbs or with designing a rocket that goes to the moon or mars. I can work on astronaut suits or cars. I have always had an interest in mechanical devices since in highschool when I saw the endeavor fly over my head back to Edwards Air Force Base in SoCal. I also saw many test flights being done over me head since there was an aerospace station in my area. The idea of helping create something unique that can help move mankind into the future excites me and is the reason I want to go into STEM."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2507,"There are a few reasons why I want to get into the STEM field. I can narrow it down to two main reasons. The first reason is I am able to be creative, I am able to build and create solutions which then lead to my second reason why and that is being able to help other peoples. I grew up with a hands-on household. I was exposed to a lot of tinkering and mechanics work from a young age. From woodwork to working on cars and motorcycles, and bicycles. My overall goal is to be part of a society of innovators that take initiative in creating solutions to benefit everyone and everything. I hope one day to be able to create new tools and technology that can help those in the medical field, or get into a sector that focuses on sustainability. This is why I want to get into the Stem field, to benefit the lives of others and society in general."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2508,"I chose to be in the STEM field to challenge myself in every aspect. I wanted to follow a different path leading to psychology, but I was first drawn into Stem by taking care of my chemistry, biology and math. Most people would avoid that part in the curriculum but I was intrigued by how much it challenged my thought process. I have also been in a slight interest of designing and assembling parts or components of a vehicle or other objects around. Imagining is one thing but making it happen is a whole different success that I want to reach someday. Engineers don't have a guideline to follow and with our knowledge, we can create a better future for ourselves. Back in my grade school days, my school lacked enthusiasm in education. I wanted to prove to myself that I don't need to stay local to determine a successful future for myself. I wanted to learn, fail, and mainly accomplish. Wanting to be an engineer is tough but it is feeling satisfying the closer I get to my graduation. One day I will look back at all my struggles in school and realize it was worth my time considering that I want to be a successful engineer. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2509,"I am a student of computer science but from this semester I want to switch my major to Electric engineering. Actually, I don’t know, why I choose electric engineering, but I am good at math before. So, I choose this major. But I am scared about this major, is it easier than computer science or not. Actually, coding is hard for me now, one of my friends suggest me to take an electric major, so I choose it. I need to revise all the concepts of physics properly again and that’s why I need some time to understand, I think day by day I can learn."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,433,"The main reason why I want to go in the STEM field is do to the fact that back in high school my favorite class were math and physics. Knowing that, I looked for majors that will fall in the line of my favorite high school classes. These majors ended up falling in the STEM field. To add on to this when I was a kid I feel in love with cars and car movies. In the movies they had work on big engine cars and mapping out the car parts on programs like solidworks and other online castings. When I was a kid I thought about being a mechanic were I can work on cars, but then reality struck and I realize that I needed a career not a job. So with that in mind, I decided to be a mechanical engineer. Where not only can I have a good career but also work on car engines and hopefully help be apart of a engine making team. "
