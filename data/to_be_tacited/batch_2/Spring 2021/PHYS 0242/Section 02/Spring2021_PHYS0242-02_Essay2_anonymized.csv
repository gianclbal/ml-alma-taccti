2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2508,"I would like to achieve the proper understanding to each lab as best as possible. Although are objectives are slightly different from being face to face, I still get the concepts by the simulations. This kind of knowledge can be applied to everyday life. Which is my main objective for this course. I'd like to reflect these kind of situations in lab towards my household appliances or any given object. I don't just want to receive a good grade, but receiving the proper education will help me grasp a better understanding of physics in my everyday life. My second goal would be to do the labs correctly. I assume by reading the formal lab reports, id get what will be done in lab. Sometimes its a bit tricky but the simulations are a true work of art. It has not only guided me through this course but I can also mess around with the programs without causes any discrepancies. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2505,"My goals are to graduate on time and have a deep understanding of engineering so that I can have a good career. This class is a bit different than the other physics courses that I have taken, because there is usually something small that relates to my major in my previous classes. But in this course,  Thermodynamics is something that has really connected to my major and has really been helpful. So even though this course is a graduation requirement, it really has helped me in my other engineering classes and also helped me in achieving my goals in having a deep understanding of engineering."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2389,"My goals for this semester is to learn as much as I can regarding physics. I hope to have a mindset of sticking through and learning topics that I might find boring or difficult. I usually tend to skip over more tedious work if I already have a safe grade and this semester I hope to overcome those bad habits. I also hope to be able to speak up in lab and class time if I have any immediate questions. I usually tend to wait till the time is over and ask a classmate. These are the main things I hope to accomplish, learn as much as I can, and set healthy, good habits for the future."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2509,"My goal to be an electrical engineer. For this reason, I need a physics course to understand the concept properly. Hats why this lab course is helpful for me to reach my goal. Day by day its teaches me different topics which is good for my everyday life, so, now I can understand, hats going on when I put my foot in a micro oven to warm my favorite food. So, this way this course helps me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2510,"Reflection #2              My primary goal for school is to earn my bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering. This class will take me one step closer to that goal as I just need a few lower division engineering courses and all upper division engineering courses.               Another goal of mine is to give myself the opportunity to earn a better paying job, so it feels like I made my father proud since he immigrated to the US. This class will help me give me a better understanding so I can go on and pass my other classes.              A goal of mine is to set an example for my both my older and younger siblings that we are capable of graduating college. My older brother dropped out and my older sister didn’t give it a try. My younger siblings are in 10th and 9th grade. This class can help my goal because I enjoy when people ask me what I’m studying. I just bring up Physics and I already have their attention even though that may not understand what it is that I am saying."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2500,"My goal is to be able to attend a medical school after graduating from SFSU. In order to apply to medical school I need to complete certain required classes, including two semesters of Physics with lab. I have already finished my first Physics course last semester so this class could be considered as the last Physics class I’ll take. Although I’m a Biochemistry major and took Physics classes purely for medical school application requirements, I found Physics really interesting and practical in many daily life situations. Sometimes, the concepts I learnt in my Physics class help me with certain concepts–like calorimetry–in my Chemistry class so I’d say Physics is really helpful for boosting up my learning skills. Also, we usually have to read and think a lot to be able to understand complex Physics concepts and these reading and thinking skills I acquired in my Physics are really essential and useful for my other classes as well. So, I’ll say I really like my Physics courses even though they are not for my main major; they not only let me know how things are functioning in daily life situations but also enable me to develop many essential skills for other classes!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2504,My goals are to be able to learn more about how physics can help my understanding of chemistry. There is a lot of overlap with concepts in this class and what I am learning in my chemistry lecture for example the ideal gas law. In both my physics lecture and my chemistry lecture we are using the ideal gas law but in different ways. In physics we use it to see the properties of thermodynamics of a system while in chemistry we are using it for chemical reactions and the equilibrium of gas mixtures. It is concepts like this have helped me connect ideas and thought to better my understanding of how the world works and I can incorporate these ideas into my studies and research. This class just like my chemistry lab helps me put those concepts in practical use and help me gain new skills through experimentation and exploration. While physics and Chemistry at first don't seem very similar they both try to explain what happens in our world. Physics looking at the big thing and Chemistry the small things.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,458,My goal is to graduate and make the most of the learning process while in the University. The lab classes supports the practical learning with hands on experiences based on the the concepts and theories from the lecture classes. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2506,"My goals for life are to get a stable job with civil engineering and maintain a health mental and physical health. Last semester was hard for me because I needed to balance school work and real life work during a pandemic. My goals can change as time goes on, especially when things change like a pandemic. However, my goals down the road will remain the same: get my degree in civil engineering and be healthy. This class can help me achieve my goals because it is a requirement for my degree. In addition, this class allows me to increase my knowledge in engineering along side my other classmates, who can help me on the journey. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2507,"With this physics lab, I am able to conduct and apply real-world situations and practice through experiments. As the previous semesters have been quite different from our traditional labs on campus we will make do with at-home experiments and with provided online simulations. The skills I hope to gain from this class would help my learn about what to expect in my particular field of interest which is mechanical engineering. Physics can be applied to all engineering fields so it is important to learn the skills from a physics lab. When we get back to in-person labs, I plan to gain knowledge on how to work specialty equipment, learn safety and other on-field practices to take to my future career. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2501,"My current goals are to finish college, obtain my degree as a Mechanical Engineer, and find a job in a career that best suits my interests. For a while now I know that I've wanted to become an engineer due to my fascination for STEM subjects. However, in order to achieve my goal there is still much knowledge that I need to learn. This class serves as a good foundation to provide me with basic knowledge of certain physics topics that I will encounter in later classes and in my career. Without covering these physics concepts, I will not have the skills to apply them to an engineering context."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2499,"Though by no comparison equivalent to an in-person lab course, my goal for this course (aside from requirement) is to hopefully gain experience interacting with the experimental (rather than theoretical) aspects of concepts covered. Applying the abstract mathematics presented in lecture to the real world, or as close as possible during a global pandemic."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,433,"My goals for this semester is to get the best possible grades I can get. In order to do that I will need to understand the material and study heavily before exams. One way this class could help me is by refreshing my memory on physics subjects. This class goes over physics topic we gone over from the lecture portion, so we are able to get multiple interactions on the subjects. Another goal of mine to gain a better understanding on how this world works. Why do things happen certain ways. There are many questions I have on why things work certain ways and the best way to find answers to those questions would be in this specific class. In physics we study and understand why things work certain ways like why does ice melt or water boil. The best way to find answer for my question is to take this physics class and expand my knowledge. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2503,my goal is to pass all of my classes with good grades. here in Kuwait we have  a lockdown due to the pandemic and after my grandmother have done s surgery in her spine i am taking care of here as my parents are working and also taking care of my younger syblings and i also have my online classes but i am still focused on my goal which its to get the bachlor degreed of electrical engineering 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2502,"When I reflect on my life at the moment, I can think of two main goals I would like to accomplish. The first major goal that I think of is wanting to get a job as a civil engineer. The main way this class can help me achieve this goal is just by fixing my work ethic. By doing so, I should be able to pass all my classes, pass my qualification exams, and maybe get hired at a good engineering firm. Fixing my work ethic could potentially improve my work quality, ensure my assignments are completed to the best of my ability, etc. The other major goal I have in life is to live a comfortable lifestyle. The was this class can help me achieve this is the same as the first. If I can ""get my act together"" now, it will hopefully pay off in the long run and give me the opportunity to not have to worry about how I will pay for necessities and wants that I may have later on in life."
