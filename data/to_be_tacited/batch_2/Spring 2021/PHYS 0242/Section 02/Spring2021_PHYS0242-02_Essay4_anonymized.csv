2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2510,"Online learning has negatively impacted me. I feel trapped at home because I must attend class from my computer. I have so many distractions around me. I don't have the motivation I once had because I feel I am not learning very well in most of my classes. I tend to stay out late now because I need to be outside so I won't lose myself. It wasn't like this before because going to campus would be my the outside I needed. Now, I just feel trapped. It has messed with my sleep schedule so much. I sleep later at night because I don't use much physical energy to put me asleep early. I'm just concerned that whatever I do learn throughout this semester, I will probably forget because I don't learn very well online. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2500,"Being a college student in the Covid era, I have many setbacks in enjoying the college’s campus life. Having to focus on my computer screen for more than twelve hours a day, I can’t help but feel bored and so lonely at times. Going to school was indeed physically tiring but spending time with my friends and classmates was never boring back then. Now, I can only listen to online lectures and do all the assignments on my own without being able to work together with friends like when we were in face-to-face classes. Although I’m the kind of person who loves to stay at home and enjoys spending time with my parents, I sometimes feel melancholy when I reminisce about the times I hung out with my friends. As for positive self-care, I’m spending more time with my parents and doing things that I always wanted to do with them yet I couldn’t do because I didn’t have time. And, I’m also learning a new language since I have some extra time now. Sometimes, when I’m mentally exhausted, I draw some portraits or read my favorite novels. Doing these things, I feel less lonely and bored, so I recommend everyone should also find something they love and do (or learn it) during these times for self care."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,433,"Online classes have made learning a lot more difficult than being in class. Being at home zooming has me less engaged and eager to learn. Being in a comfortable environment like my home made me slack off more. For my self-care I like to workout at least 5 times a week. Being able to workout helps me destress from work and online learning. The only concerns I have from online learning is the massive change that  will occur on my gpa. Although I may have suffer a little in gpa, I am still learning the most I can from zoom. I unfortunately haven't joined a club or any other extracurricular activities do to my absence on campus. SInce the pandemic started I moved back home and that's made it difficult to gain school services."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2505,"Before the switch to online learning I was getting comfortable asking the professors for help and coming to office hours, but now with the switch I do not feel comfortable going to office hours or asking the teachers for help. I used to have to get up early to commute to school so I had to have a strict sleeping schedule but now with the freedom of taking classes anywhere, my self care has gone down. One concern that I have for my learning is whether online learning to the best way to learn about engineering and if I will be a qualified engineer and whether I can learn what I need to learn efficiently online. I personally feel that the best way to support me would be partially open the campus for the core classes and to have elective or general ed courses be taught online."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2499,"The experience being a first year transfer student during the pandemic has been no doubt a detriment to my educational experience. Though some knowledge and connections have been gained during this semester (and year), much experience has been lost. I was not able to take any lab courses in-person at all, the PAC is only online, it is especially difficult to make connections with professors. And most likely much more that I have no knowledge of. Though better than no option for education, fully online first year has not been a completely beneficial experience. I am glad to be able to attend SFSU during the fall."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,458,"I am not doing well with online classes, I am having difficulty in catching up with the online class responsibilities. I am struggling with the present situation and still looking for ways to cope."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2506,"Online classes have heavily impacted my learning. Before online classes, I used to be able to attend in person classes and have an incentive to pay attention because of the surrounding environment. Being at home and attending classes is not the same in my case. I have to many distractions being in a busy house. In addition, I have to work more than usual because both my parents lost their jobs and I have to fill in to help pay with bills. I definitely prefer in-person classes over online classes for these reasons. As for self-care, I haven't been doing much. I have to try to get my assignments in on time and work. I do play video games but most of the time, it just adds more unneeded stress. I am tired of online classes and wish that things would go back to normal next semester. I used to be a good student but due to online classes, I lack motivation and incentive to do assignments and attend zoom meetings."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2502,In my personal opinion online classes have negatively impacted my learning. At the moment the self care I do to prevent my situation from getting worse would be watching tv shows and anime. I can tell that online classes have negatively impacted me because it has essentially killed any motive I had to learn and it feels like I have to force myself to do anything. I have a big concern for my learning because it does not really feel like I am getting anything from a majority of my classes. It feels more like a struggle to get through the semester rather than improving my capabilities for my future career. In terms of my well being it is having a slight negative impact on my mental state because I am struggling to get my work done for other classes and its makig me nervous/anxious since it will most likely result in me retaking a couple classes.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2501,"Online classes have honestly been terrible for my learning and for my mental health. While the classes and professors I've had this semester have been the best out of any semester since we've been online, it still just does not compare to learning and attending college in person. I come from Orange County, and I chose San Francisco because it gave me the opportunity to experience a new place and to have some sense of independence, and unfortunately due to this pandemic I've been in OC more than I've been in SF for college! I really hope that there will be at least some in-person courses in the fall because I would love to get back to our beautiful campus & the Bay Area."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2389,"I feel like online classes have interfered with one on one time I may have had with professors. I enjoyed going to professor's office for questions I may have had on homework or an exam. For self care, I am exercising frequently, eating healthier, and trying to maintain a schedule so I am not on the computer for more than several hours a day. I do not have any concerns anymore regarding my learning and well being. At this point, I have adapted and am pretty used to it. I hope we get to go back to in person very soon."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2507,"When Online classes first start to become the norm, I knew it would be a disadvantage for me. Coming into SF State I had the need and want to be in class and in-person. Being in a physical class I feel more engaged and more attentive. I am a hands-on type of learner so being confined behind a computer screen isn't the best way for me to learn. I hope online learning especially with labs can get more active with more d.i.y/ homemade labs. There are some conveniences to online learning like not having to commute to school and deal with parking fees, but being home I feel easily distracted. Can't wait to get back to campus."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2508,"The online class system was a very different transition compared to face-to-face. At first, I did think that there wouldn't be a huge change considering that it’s a certain topic and we're just analyzing it. But some engineering courses cannot be taught online. I personally think that its due to the style of the professor’s teachings. Besides that, the subject could be easy to comprehend. It makes sense to have it online and we could review the video again if they recorded it. But asking questions and office hours are sometimes pointless since they are at very random time slots. But I cannot complain about being fully online. I came back home, and I am saving so much money for not paying rent. This reflects on my self-care situation. I didn't feel like I was being productive with my well-being and covid made me transition into a healthy lifestyle. My only deficit would be graduating during the zoom time. It is fun being in person and seeing familiar faces but that's just the way the situation is set to be. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2503,"Online classes are much better than in person classes, because you can be in your comfort zone while studying in each zoom class and you will not be distracted or feeling uncomfortable being around some classmates that you might don’t feel comfortable working with. Furthermore, online classes make you stay more at home which it’s better for keeping social distance and maintain a good health rather than in person classes where you can get interacted with more people which increase the chance of spreading the pandemic "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2504,"I think that online classes have really impacted my day life. When we have class on campus I would commute everyday to class and I like the feeling of running around campus trying to get to class. Walking around and going up and down stairs to get to class was a really fun experience and bumping into old and new classmates was really cool. You started to build a sense of community. I remember that for a while my friend Maddie and I would go to the arcade at the bottom of Cesar Chavez and watch me play X-Men vs. Street Fighter. I even tried teaching her how to play it. So that sense of community is gone now that we have online classes. It's a lot harder to schedule a zoom call with classmates than to just hangout after class to work on homework together. Still, I like the convenience of not having to wake up so early to get to school, but online learning is very lonely. I try to keep in contact with some of my old classmates, but when you can’t physically interact with them it's very hard to work together. But I push on and hopefully soon everything is safe so that we can slowly return back to in-person classes."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2509,"I like the online class because I can save my time and I don’t need to dress up to go to university and don’t need to wait for a bus, and I can focus fully and no more distraction, so the online class impacts me this way. For my study, I try to finish my homework day by day, but sometimes it's difficult to manage everything, work, study, and cooking I need to manage by myself. So, I am everyday busy. My concern is that I can understand the concept properly, and I can do all assignments on time. So, I think I can do better day by day."
