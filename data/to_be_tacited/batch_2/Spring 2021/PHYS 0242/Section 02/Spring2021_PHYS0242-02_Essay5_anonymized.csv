2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,458,"Since this is the 2nd time that I've taken the class, it further deepened my appreciation Physics. It gave me a deeper understanding of how physics affect our lives even at sleep. I do am considering a minor in Physics."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2507,The greatest takeaway from this lab for me is when we covered the topic of waves. I enjoyed that unit because we were able to take our time as a whole class to complete that lab and it was a nice learning process for me because it was also as an iLearn quiz format so I was able to see what I did right or got wrong in real-time to see if I am actually doing my lab work correctly.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2501,"My greatest takeaway from this class would be the general amount of knowledge I've accumulated in this course during the semester. We've addressed a lot of fundamental physics topics that will benefit me especially in my career, but also just in my understanding of every day life. I believe it would benefit everyone to have a better understanding of how the world around them works; the more people who realize the physical principles of nature, the easier it will be to recognize if there is a problem and to figure out how to fix it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,433,"My greatest take away from this class was thermodynamics. since I am a mechanical engineer, I will be taking the thermodynamics class. Having read and have practice it. I feel confident that I can do great next with it next semester and be able to understand the concepts a lot better. The thing I like the most about the physics lecture was the exams. Since the exams were more based on knowing the concept and being able to use the textbook was really helpful. As well with the due date being reasonable. I feel like more class should follow the same exam style. When taking the exam I was not stress, and more confident. In a real world scenario you should use resource to help you produce the best possible outcome. Being handicap and relying on memory is not alway the best especially when stressed. Your memory of concept becomes more foggy and you're less likely to perform to your own expectations. In the lab section the use pf phet simulations was very helpful.Seeing visual of what we are learning and studying really helps solve and confusion we may have had. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2506,"My greatest take away from this class is not necessarily a topic that was covered in class. It is more of a lesson learned from taking this class. My greatest take away from this class and online classes in general is that I do not do well in them. Before the pandemic broke out, I used to be able to attend all my classes and get school work submitted on time as well. Now with the pandemic, I have more responsibilities on top of my schoolwork and it builds up stress. I realized from this semester and last semester as well, that I succeed better in in person classes. I think part of me misses the social aspect of school and the incentive to do good in a real school environment. Doing everything home is distracting for me because everyone else in my family is home as well. I just hope that we get in person classes soon (safely of course) and end online classes."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2505,"One of my greatest take aways from this class is comfortable with the zoom breakout rooms. When we first started doing break out rooms it was a bit uncomfortable but since in this class we had originally started doing them every week I got over that fear of not speaking in the break out groups. Another major take away from this class is remembering to finish the post knowledge check and the summary, I tend to forget about assignments often and had to remember weekly to do them before the Sunday deadline."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2499,"While designed to provide experience working in a lab environment to actually *see* and interact with the effects discovered by science, unfortunately the online experience of Physics 242 is entirely different. At no fault of SFSU, the department or anyone involved in this class, the only lab options involve interacting with simulation programs and filling out answers from a 15-year-old lab format. I would now contrast the experience of taking a lab course in 2020 and 2021 with my previous lab courses at SFSU, but alas, I transferred to the school in early 2020 and have missed the entire experience. From what I have heard from non-transfer students, professors, and grad students, the experience compared with the last year and a half is entirely different. Somehow I am ""missing out"". As to what this actually means, I may never know. As a sudden jump from despair, as a class we were able to persist through Spring 2021. Our initial vows to work together through this tough period has (mostly) been fulfilled. I hope that in the future I'll have the opportunity to attend a lab course as they were intended. What was my greatest takeaway from this class? I am not sure, perhaps I will truly know after having a point of reference in a non-remote course."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2502,"My greatest take away was more to fix a personal issue rather than academic aspects. My greatest takeaway is that I need to commit more effort and do better time management in general. As the semester was progressing I definitely felt my motivation to do anything decline. Mostly due to the pandemic, the online learning format for this semester has done damage to my work ethic and other aspects of my academic life. After reflecting upon this, I realized that I need to push myself harder if I want to be able to achieve my goals for my later life (future career).By putting more effort into everything I do, I should at least be able to meet the minimum requirements that will allow me to progress in my life. Definitely this class / lab has helped me realize that I need to better in general or I might never succeed."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2503,"This class have taught me a lot in physics beside working with students to complete the labs. The atmosphere of the sessions was very comfortable and flexible it’s one the best labs that I have ever taken. I learned how to use each simulation to understand the lessons we had for each session and using the simulations felt even better than the reality in labs, because the simulations shows everything so you can understand while imagining at the same time. One of the most important things that I took from this class is that I have become more certain that online classes are better than in person classes."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2510,"This is my first semester here at SFSU and first time being full time online. I know I wasn't present for that last couple of weeks of the semester and I thought I could get away with the recordings and just doing stuff on my own. However, I wasn't able to and this lesson is my biggest takeaway. I'm learning to take online more serious. As for the class, I enjoyed the buoyancy lab the most. It gave me a better understanding as to why boats with tons of weight are able to stay afloat. I also did enjoy working with classmates in the beginning since it was random. But when groups were made, no one really participated in my group and did their own thing. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2508,"My greatest take from this course reflects from lab 8 to lab 14. They all have the same formal concept of light or sound. The refraction and reflection portion made me understand how light can bend and cause illusion to the human eye. It is a beautiful scene when we encounter rainbows after it rains. The wavelengths of the certain colors were what fascinated me the most. This explains Pink Floyd’s album cover “Dark side of the moon.” Seeing sound deform from a certain obstruction also gives me a bigger perspective as when music is coming from a certain room and sounds louder or lower than expected. I was always curious as to waves or water flows through a river and has certain obstruction in the middle. The wave optics portion of the lab went into detail with waves, but I would have liked to learn about vortex bedding and how certain objects, like slits, interfere with the movement of water and creates ripples or deformation within the movement. Besides that, this lab was one of my favorites compared to the other two."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2509,"From this class, I do all the lab except I miss the first lab because of late adding the course. I think that was my greatest part which is take away from this class. Otherwise, I try to finish all the labs. I try to spend one day a week for this lab course and I learn about heat, temperature, sound, light, water waves,s and how they work. Before this lab course, I didn’t think about this which always around us and our everyday life. Anyway, our instructor is very understanding and helpful and he always tries to help us."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2504,"I think that my greatest take away from the class will be the experiments and the experiences from doing them. While I wish I could have had this lab class in person so that we could have done the experiments hands on, most of the online simulations were really cool and informative. Looking back at all the labs, I am really curious as to how we would have done the refraction and diffraction labs in person. Seeing the light and how they react to different surfaces would have been really fun to do in person. That aside, I think that TA, Hamzah, did a really good job at explaining all the lessons and helping us through the labs and any questions we had about physics in general. In the end, I think that the thing I will take away from the class is the experience of having taken an online physics lab and still being able to learn and enjoy the experiments we did."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2500,"My greatest takeaways from this class are-1. The important concepts of Physics (like entropy, buoyancy, sound waves, reflection and refraction, image formation by different lenses and mirrors, etc.)As I attended the synchronous lab sessions regularly and did all the weekly assignments, I found that they helped me a lot to understand the lecture materials more easily, and they were really helpful when I took tests as well.2. Time management skillsAfter taking this class, my time management skills also improved. Knowing that doing all four parts of the assignment–lab exploration, post-lab knowledge check, summary, and feedback–in one day is too stressful for me, I tried to finish as much as I can while I’m in class. Then, I do the rest of the assignment on Thursday and Friday evenings, which leaves me very little homework to do during the weekend. This way, it can not only help me feel a lot less stressed during weekends but also allows me to understand the materials better. 3. Group workWhen I had to do the lab exploration parts alone at the beginning of the semester, it took so long for me to finish them. Sometimes, it took me even more than four to five hours to complete them. However, as we started doing them as a group in class, I found that the lab exploration part becomes a lot more efficient and easier. Thus, from this, I also learned that group work is not always stressful, and sometimes, it can help us to finish our work even faster. Overall, these are my greatest takeaways from this class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2389,"The greatest take away from this lab is how we can create labs or experiments to replicate the findings of scientists years ago. Visually seeing it in lab, helped me understand the concepts a lot more thoroughly. This class also showed me how complex and difficult physics concepts can be better understood by doing them in real life. Understanding gas properties, heat, sound waves, water waves, and light waves/particles was all very interesting to me. I hope my future labs are as interactive and engaging as these were. I also learned from this class that working online is not soo bad as long as you have an instructor/lab facilitator to help with any questions. I do not think I have ever asked as many questions for any other class compared to this one. So going forward to make sure I understand concepts more, I'll just continue asking questions to ensure I got the concepts down."
