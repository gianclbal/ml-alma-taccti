2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,433,A concept we covered in class was thermodynamics and the sub concept of heat engine and heat pumps. A heat engine takes in energy from a heat reservoir. Then with that transfer of energy the engine can produce work. Then the engine transfer the energy to a cold reservoir. An example of a heat engine is the combustion engine of an automobile. This auto engine produces a work that causes the powered up object to move either forwards or backwards. A heat pump is the opposite of a heat engine. A heat pump takes in energy from a cold reservoir. Then instead of producing work it takes in work on itself. After that the heat pump transfer that energy into a hot reservoir. An example of a heat pump is a fridge. A fridge takes in energy from a cold reservoir and release the energy into a reservoir which would be the air around it. A perfect heat engine or heat pump is the carnot engine. This engine is 100% efficient and impossible to create. Although it seems that a carnot engine is the best thing to us it is impossible to have such an efficient engine. Instead we relay on heat engines and heat pumps that are more practical and actually possible. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2510,"How are heavy objects, such as ships, able to stay afloat and not sink?     With buoyancy, an object is able to stay above certain liquids. When an object is dipped in water, the objects displaces its own weight in liquid. An object floating or not depends on the density and volume. Big ships are both dense and have a large volume but, the inside of these ships is hollow. The hollow inside is able to keep the density at a minimum and allow the ship to displace more water. With more water being displaced, the amount of water displaced becomes heavier than the boat allowing it to stay afloat. You can add more weight to the ship as long as the ship is still able to displace water but if it can’t, then it will eventually be submerged. The formula to find the buoyant force is F = density x gravity x volume."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2499,"A concept introduced during Week 6 (and had increasing relevance) was the Inverse Square Law. Though only referenced during the official lab, understanding and applying the concept is essential for proper lighting in CG and Photography. Especially in a completely fabricated environment, understanding the reflection of light across multiple surfaces is an important component of creating realistic lighting and not triggering the ""uncanny valley"" when creating photorealism.In this scene from Iron Man, where Tony Stark first suits up in his Iron Man suit, the exact opposite effect is replicated. The suit is entirely CG, yet a shadow covers half of his face. Cars and machinery can be seen reflected from Stark's shoulders. While not important to the broadness of society, in terms of CG understanding proper lighting (such as how to properly replicate reflections with the Inverse Square Law) is necessary for photorealism."

2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2500,"My Question: What role does damping play in bungee jumping?One important thing that we covered in class last week is the concept of damped oscillations. In both my lecture and lab classes, I've learnt that the maximum amplitude of the oscillations gradually decreases with time when a system is damped. In bungee jumping, damping comes in from air resistance, the tension or friction from the bungee spring, etc..This concept is the main idea behind bungee jumping. In bungee jumping, the jumpers are attached to a spring and form a mass-spring system. In this case, the oscillation of the jumper is subject to damping, where their motion gradually decreases due to the two opposing forces–upward force exerted by the spring and the downward gravitational force–that dissipates the kinetic and potential energy stored in the bungee cord and the jumper. As we can see from a graph of the motion of a bungee jumper, the jumper's maximum speed and rebound height (the amplitude) gradually decreases and they finally stop moving after a few oscillations.  That's why I'd say the main idea behind bungee jumps is damped oscillation. Without damping, the bungee jumper would never be able to stop their motion and that's a bit too scary. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2502,"- Why sound get quieter the farther you are from the origin.The reason why sound get quieter as it travels is due to pressure instead of the sound wave speed. In the Sound Waves Lab we went over the properties of sound waves and pressure waves. In the lab exploration, we did an experiment in which we observed a graph that showed the relationship between pressure and time as sound gets further away from its speaker. The results from that observation is that the pressure was not constant and decreased over time, starting out strong initially but getting quieter as it gets farther away. This is relevant to people's lives in multiple ways such as how ambulances work. For example, as an ambulance is responding to an emergency you can faintly hear its siren. If the siren starts to get louder it means that the ambulance is traveling closer to you and you experience a higher sound pressure. As driving procedure goes, you have to pull over so the paramedics can save lives. If the sound/pressure waves did not work this way then it would be detrimental to people that may need help. Overall, this concept is important to our lives even if it may not be obvious."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2509,"In the past few weeks, I learn a lot of concepts about Buoyancy, Gas properties, heat, the First law of thermodynamics, Maxwell Boltzmann distributions, Simple harmonic motion, and Sound waves. here, I use many equations to solve the mathematical problems to determine the values.At instantly,i remember i)pv=nrt ii)p=F/A iii)P-V diagrams iv)delta-Q=mS(delta-T) v) W=f.d.cos(Theta) vi)f=1/T vii)V=lamda*frequency.here, I just mention what I remember instantly. but we have more equations .So, what we learn in the last few weeks, related to our everyday life. As an example, when I make tea and boiling water when we play music on the guitar when our cycle tire busted when a baby swing in the park. Actually, in our daily life, everything is related, and everywhere it's applicable. but our ordinary eyes can understand the real concept, but a student of physics can understand this but it's a little bit difficult to memorize all the equation."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,458,"It is just the tip of the iceberg....An iceberg floats with majority of its body submerged below the level of water. The volume of the whole iceberg is greater than the volume of the water displaced because not all of the iceberg is submerged. Since it floats, the iceberg is less dense than water. The mass of the iceberg is slightly lesser than the water. So looks can be deceiving, the problem might be small at first glance, only to give you a big surprise when you dive deeper into the water..."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2506,"A concept covered in lab from the past couple of weeks is the Maxwell Boltzmann Distribution. In the lab and post lab for the Maxwell Boltzmann Distributions, we explored how particles move in a system and how their speeds change depending on their mass and the temperature. A question that can be formed based on the Maxwell Boltzmann Distribution is how can particles escape a system if the escape speed is not high enough?The Maxwell Boltzmann Distribution shows the distribution of particles' speed in a gas at a given temperature. The graph has a bell shape curve where the average velocity is usually near the peak of the graph. Now if an escape speed of a system is very high compared to the average velocity of a particle, that does not exempt the particle for escaping the system. The average velocity is just an estimate of the particle's speed. It is where the most particles are moving at. However, there may be some particles that move at faster or slower rates. This is shown in the Maxwell Boltzmann Distribution. This information can possibly used in people's lives with the pandemic, I believe. When wearing masks, we reduce the amount of particles leaving our system. However, it does not prevent all particles from leaving our bodies, but a majority of them do. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2504,"I think that being a Chemistry major there is a lot of overlap between my chemistry lecture and this physics lab class. One of the things that we used on both was the Ideal Gas Law. Here in this class we used the ideal gas law for finding the pressure or volume of a gas in a given area, whereas in my chemistry lecture we were using it to find the moles or particles of a gas in a given area. We both used the same formula for Ideal Gas Law, PV=nRT or PV=NKbT. P stands for Pressure of gas, which is usually in Pascal (Pa). V is volume, which is cubic meters (m^3). N stands for number of particles, while n stands for number of moles. R is the Universal Gas Constant, 8.314 J/mol*K, and Kb is also a constant called Boltzmann’s Constant, 1.38*10^-23 J/K. Finally, T stands for temperature in Kelvin (K). A couple of relationships with the ideal gas law is that if either one of pressure or volume remains the same along with N or n, the change in either V or P will be directly affected by T. If you increase the temperature and volume remains the same, pressure will increase. If you decrease the temperature and pressure remains the same, volume will also decrease and vice versa. This is a good thing to know if you are working with the Isovolumetric, Isobaric, and Isothermal processes so that you can see if your answers follow the rules of the Ideal Gas Law."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2505,What is the first law of thermodynamics and why is it important? The first law of thermodynamics describes a system that the only energy change is the internal energy and that the transfers of energy are heat and work. It can also be simplified as the change of the internal energy of a system is calculated through the heat plus the work. This is important to know about because it demonstrates how energy is transformed and how it can change from one form to another. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,2,2389,"I think one of the most important concepts we learned of was springs and simple harmonic motion. This concept gives us a lot of information in which we can find masses of objects using springs, find velocities, accelerations, potential energy, kinetic energy, etc. The list goes on and on. We can find a lot of information using the equation y=Acos(angular frequency*t  + phase shift). The use of springs can be seen in all sorts of shock absorbers in cars. Without our knowledge of this, daily comfort on a drive to work or school could be extremely uncomfortable and even damaging to our bodies. Damping is another concept that is applied directly here, when the springs in cars are compressed, some energy is lost through heat, which allows the vehicle to feel less of it. All these concepts of harmonic motion, springs, and damping can be seen in other applications such as clocks with a pendulum and sound waves."
