2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,645,"﻿I want to go into the STEM field as a civil engineer because that is where innovations in modern construction happen at a rapid pace. For me, a degree in engineering and in STEM will give me an advantage because my focus in the field can then rely on research and not just measurements I am to take on site. I have always known that I want to go into sustainable construction and while that might now sound like engineering or research, becoming a civil engineer is the right route for me to take. Not only do I want to do construction but I want to be good at it, I want to inspire and make new things with a purpose so that I can be innovative. That is why I am studying engineering, so I can take what I learn and better apply it to the construction industry."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2527,"The STEM field was something that I did not know much about when starting high school, I had never even heard the word “STEM.” I joined the robotics team at my high school and that is where I learned what the STEM field is and if it is something I wanted to pursue a career path in. I chose to focus on the “E” in the word STEM, which stands for engineering. The major I chose to pursue is Mechanical Engineering and the reason I chose to pursue a major and career path in the STEM field is because the way I see it, it is the main field of the future. We need science, technology, engineering and math to make advancements in society which is exactly what the STEM field is about. I enjoy tinkering with tech and tool, but especially automobiles. I worked to become an automotive technician which is exactly what I got to do. Usually you need a certification to become a technician but because I had so much experience in the automotive field, I was given a job based on hands-on experience."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1891,I wanted to be in the STEM field because the field has many opportunities for jobs. I am majoring in civil engineering and my dream is to one day work as a manager or contractor at Water and Power. my father is my motivation as well because he is an independent contractor in construction and engineering. Personally I like math and I have the most fun with math and decided to become a civil engineer major. It is also a bonus that many jobs will pay you a nice salary which is nice to have.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2403,"I have always found mathematics and science toppings intriguing growing up.  These subjects were enjoyable for me and I understood them.  This interest got my parents thinking I was going to become some sort of engineer.   At the time, I didn't know what an engineer was or did, but it seemed to make my parents happy so I stuck with it.  After learning more about what a civil engineer does, I began to build a stronger interest as well.  Even though it was initially my parents who pushed me, I believe that I will enjoy becoming a civil engineer."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2528,"I honestly am not totally sure that I want to go into a STEM field. I am taking this class to satiate my curiosity rather than for the sake of pre-professionalism. Though a career in STEM is entirely plausible for my future, I don't want to confine myself to STEM. However, an aspect of STEM that aligns with my overall goals is how STEM, particularly physics, rigorously interrogates the operations of the world around us. I simply yearn for an enlightened understanding of the universe, whether that understanding comes from literature, philosophy, or physics. I believe that there is a creative artistry in problem solving and explaining the world through math and equations, which inspires my keen interest in physics. As of now, I think that academia is the ideal career route for me. Aside from simply learning, I too want to contribute to the advancement of human understanding in a specific field. Thus, I would love to conduct research in the future."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2529,"I am here because I love science and want to be an engineer. I love finding out how things work as well as the math behind said things. Mechanical things always sparked an interest in me whether it was a Mustang Cobra, the San Onofre nuclear power plant near San Diego, or how something so big like an airplane can take off and fly so high with ease. Engineering is not just making something, it’s a way of helping society move forward by either making people’s lives easier through technology or by reducing our impact on the planet by reducing our carbon footprint. I’ve always wanted to help people and engineering is one of the ways that I saw fit with what I wanted to do and how I want to help people. That is why I’m here even though I suck at math as well as learning. That is why I am here."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2530,"While there exists a multitude of reasons as to why I wish to go into the STEM field, there are three main reasons as to why I wish to do so. First of all, most if not all jobs in the STEM field have high starting salaries for college graduates, and as someone who has witnessed first-hand the struggles many in poverty across the globe face each day, I wish to pursue a job in a well-paying field to avoid this. Secondly, computer science (my current major) is a field I have always been enamored with since a child. Computer Science is a creative and expressive field, where oftentimes the shorter and more concise the code, the more 'beautiful' it becomes. Long and tedious code may be one way to approach a problem, but there are always hundreds of ways to approach different issues, and it is up to a computer scientist to decide which solution satisfies the given conditions. This freedom of expression is what drew me to the field of computer science, and one of the main reasons why I wish to go into the STEM field. Finally, the main reason I wish to go into the STEM field is because of the people. Just in this class alone, I found myself surrounded by smart, determined, and like-minded individuals. It is often said that one's surroundings can affect their growth and mentality in their everyday life, and by being surrounded by such well-rounded and intelligent individuals, I hope to push my own personal growth both in and out of the STEM field to greater heights!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2531,"At first I didn't really want to go into the Stem field, if I am honest, I didn't consider going to college until my last year of high school. But, my high school is called STEM Academy of Hollywood, by the name you can guess what it is about. I been taking engineering courses since freshman year of high school. Despite that, I never really thought of going into the STEM field. But, there was one field that did get my attention, it was civil engineering. Construction has been around me ever since I was 7, my dad was an supervisor, and worked along side my uncle who is an architect. But of course, I forgot about these memories, until I went on a trip back to my home country, it was then that all these memories came back to me and made me realize ""well, it would be a waste of time if I didn't do something related to construction."" and that was when I decided to go into civil engineering. It might not be the greatest reason why I went into the STEM field. But it was thanks to this that I managed to find a balance between a career that I will enjoy but will also provide me with a variety of different jobs which will also have good pay. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2372,"I want to go into STEM because there’s so much to learn. I love that its never ending learning and even if you do catch up with most data things are always growing and involving in the way we do science, it’s really cool in my opinion. Adding to this that’s what I would like to do. I’m an astrophysics major there’s so many things left to be discovered and rethought about in this field. I would love to find something new to teach or write about. Anything to change people’s way of thinking or spark conversation and to me space is an unknown void just waiting to be discovered and discussed. That’s what I want to go into STEM."
