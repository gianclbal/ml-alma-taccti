2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2528,"A question that I have based on the concept of sound wave intensity is how humans are able to control the volume of our speech. Firstly, most people calculate volume based on decibals, which is found through 10log(I/Io). Secondly, intensity is a result of the maximum change in pressure squared divided by 2 times density times volume. Thirdly, the maximum change in pressure is proportional to the maximum displacement amplitude and the wave number. Thus, it might be accurate to conclude that humans control the volume of their voice by vibrating our vocal chords at different amplitudes and wavelengths, which changes the maximum pressure change, which thereby changes the intensity and decibals. However, I am not totally familiar with human anatomy and this reasoning might be oversimplified. This information is applicable to people's lives for it explains the very foundation of our speech-based communication. Furthermore, by regulating the air density in concert halls, orchestras and performers might be able to better control and hone the intensity of their sound in an effort to attain the perfect note. Additionally, by regulating the temperature in concert halls, the velocity of sound in air can be controlled as a result of the formula v=331root(1+(Tc/237)). Therefore, concert halls and stadiums should be carefully monitored for their temperature and air density in an effort to create the best sound, a tangible benefit to music enthusiasts in our society. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2534,"In this week I have learned more about the simple harmonic motion is a type of motion regulated by many factors. Also in the lab experiment when we did investigate the properties of a mass on a spring. At the beginning of the experiment, the potential energy is so high. reaching the equilibrium position the speed attains its maximum value and the kinetic energy extends to its maximum limits. It is primarily shown that the weight of an object affects the equation as all. Also, I have noticed  adding a heavier object ( mass), the period calculated is higher, which leads to much less angular frequency and by doing so Increasing the energy levels of both the kinetic and potential energies- An everyday application is a fun activity that people make Jumping from a high place with a spring attached to us is called “bungee jumping”. The concept of this act is derived mainly from the simple harmonic motion. When heavier people jump from a high place it takes them more time to come back which applies more energy on the connected spring."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1093,"Earlier in the weeks we did a lab on the harmoic motions displayed and tested on graphs. I did similar concepts regarding this from wokring on damped simple harmonic motions for a class called matlab. Damped harmonic oscillators are vibrational structures whose amplitude decreases over time. There are second-order ordinary differential equations containing a term relative to the amplitude's initial derivative. When going back through the notes and concepts, it was very easy for me to familiarize with certain topics i learned about previously throughout my classes. A real-life example I remember about osclations are swings. Simple harmonic motion is often shown by swings in parks. Another example is that the simple harmonic motion can be used in bungee jumping. Because of the bungee cord's elasticity, the jumper oscillates up and down, resulting in SHM. A simple push causes the cradle to rock back and forth, which is maintained by the SHM theory, lulling the infant to sleep. The basic harmonic motion is the swing's back and forth, repeated motions against the restoring force. Since any object subject to a force in stable equilibrium behaves as a harmonic oscillator for tiny vibrations, the harmonic oscillator model is rather relevant in physics. Harmonic oscillators are present in abundance in nature and are used in a number of man-made instruments, including clocks and radio circuits."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2530,"The ideal gas law is a mathematical formula connecting the quantities of pressure, volume, amount of substance, ideal gas constant, and temperature. Essentially, from the ideal gas law we can gain the understanding that under equivalent temperature, pressure and volume of all gases contain the same number of molecules, but not the same mass. However, this does not work when temperature and pressure are near the point of transforming into a liquid or solid. If we think about it, this pressure from gases is used in our daily life, whether we use a pump to remove the gases from an overly pumped-up basketball or when gases rush in to fill up a deployed airbag. From what we saw in the week 3 lab, an ‘ideal gas’ is one where the particles are in random, free flowing motion and spread out to not be packed together. The ideal gas law can also give us more information when it comes to a system experiment measuring pressure, volume, and temperature (assuming number of moles of has remains constant). When the gas is kept at a constant temperature, its pressure is inversely proportional to the volume, which is known as Boyle’s law. When the pressure of the gas is kept constant, the volume is directly proportional to the temperature, which is known as Charles’s law. Finally, when the volume of the gas is kept constant, the pressure is directly proportional to the temperature, which is known as Gay–Lussac’s law. One example of ideal gas laws used in real life is the working of airbags in vehicles, where when the airbags are deployed in an accident, they are rapidly filled with gases that inflate the air bag. Another example would be Boyle's Law, where the pressure on a gas halves its volume, provided the gas temperature of the gas and amount of gas are constant. Think about how when you come up from below the water surface from scuba diving, the released bubbles increase and grow the closer you approach the surface. The reason this happens is because the weight of the water's pressure increases with depth, so as you rise, less pressure means greater volume for bubbles to rise instead of the bubbles being suffocated by increased pressure the lower you go under the water surface."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2527,"At the moment I am having a little trouble coming up with a question that I can answer so I will ask a question that I do not have an answer for but I also do not expect anyone else to have a solution to this yet. A question I have is about this week’s material, is it possible to increase distance away from a certain sound but have higher pressure? Meaning can you be far away from a speaker and have that sound be the same volume as if you were right next to the speaker? This would be great for outdoor activities like parties, when you have just one speaker and you move away from that speaker, the volume is way lower than if you were right next to it. This could benefit people so they do not have to buy more speakers and go through the hassle of hooking them up together. At the moment, I am running two powerful tower speakers and two bookshelf speakers in my room, the volume and bass is extremely loud from outside as well but it is not the same level of volume when you are far away, I have had this question for a while but after doing this lab I think I will have my answer."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2529,"A physics concept that I have done recently that relates to life is damped and forced oscillations. A damped and forced oscillations is a restraining of vibratory motion this can be used in alot of different things. Forced oscillations periodic force that is external to the oscillating system We use springs on a lot of things. we use them in our Beds, cars, trucks, HVAC, and contruction equipment. Damped and forced oscillations are basically the foundation of transportation modern society because without it we would not be drive for a long time and things would break alot more easliy. Damped and forced oscillations allow force to be controlled in a way that we want it to behave as well as be used at a safe level. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2531,"One question I have, regarding heat and pump engines, is what is exactly the difference between them? Basically, a heat engine is a device which absorbs heat. Basically, heat is being transferred from a hot reservoir to a cold one in order to raise the temperature of the cold reservoir. And a pump engine does the opposite of it, at first I thought it worked in similar ways, it still involved some sort of energy transfer from a hot reservoir to a cold one, but that is not the case. As I said earlier, the pump engine does the opposite, meaning that energy is transferred from a cold reservoir to a hot one in order to lower the temperature of the hot reservoir. But to do this, it uses work since this energy transfer is not a natural one, hence why it requires work to do this transformation. An example of this can be a refrigerator. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2533,"In week 2 lab  we discussed bouyancy. bouyancy. What bouyancy is basically is is that it is the upward force that an object has when it is in a liquid. This force is called the bouyant force. If something has a higher buoyant force then gravity it will float and the opposite it is true if the buoyant force is lower than gravity it will sinkthis information is relevant because we are around bouyant forces everyday in our life. An example would be floaties in a swimming pool. Floaties have a buoyant force stronger than their gravitational force so they float. If there wasnt a buoyant force there would be no way children or people who cant swim can even go in the water survive. Another example would be a life vest. The life vest gives you a higher buoyant force which helps you float and without one you would drown and this has saved many lives. If people didnt have access to these learned about how to calculate buoyant force and put it on a freebody diagram. They would be able to find ways to make makeshift versions of these essential objects. This would allow poorer people the oppportunnity to swim or even not drown while at sea, I see this a very important t hing as many people dont have the funds to buy these buoyant objects,"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,604,"I think that in general everything we learned in Physics is very relevant to society because the only way we can trust that our machines will work well and consistently is to know in advance how everything should work and, figuratively, what everything should look like. The only way we know this is because, to a certain extent, we understand the things that happen to everyday things in everyday life and we can describe those things using math. Since we can describe them pretty accurately with all the equations people have thought up throughout the years we know what things are supposed to look like. Things like in Thermodynamics, we can't just assume what is going to happen when we build these machines, we have to describe them in some way to ensure ourselves that we're not endangering anyone. This general information is very important to society's growth because it is how we have humans have progressed, in the use of machines, and we would have not gotten to this point without our extensive knowledge of Physics and Maths."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2372,"(come back and finish)Recently we learned about sound waves. In important thing to note is that the equation for T or period and the equation to find the frequency are generic equations and can be used as they are. Another, point to remember is the equation: A cos(wt +face constant) or A sin(wt -kx +(face constant)). "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,645,"﻿    As we approach the halfway mark in the semester it is nice to look back on what we have learned thus far. In the last 8 weeks one topic that stuck with me is the concept of Simple Harmonic Motion. As a civil engineering major this was particularly interesting to me because it pertains to the structural integrity of things such as bridges. Yes, talking about/analyzing the Tacoma Narrows bridge last week did inspire me more into this concept because it is one of the most famous examples of miscalculations gone wrong. For me, this topic was understandable because of the equations and how they tie together via calculus derivations. I am an equation minded learner and having all the equations for harmonic motions in front of me was very helpful for my comprehension.     A question I have about this topic is how the phase constant phi is related to the frequency. While this is fairly easy to find on paper/on a graph I am not sure where this phase constant can be exemplified in real life. I want to learn more about where this shows up in real life and how it can be applied in harmonic motion."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2403,"In both oscillations and wave motion, there are different variables that affect it.  The one variable that I had questions about was the phase constant.  How do you find the phase constant? Is it something that needs to be calculated or observed from the motion?The phase constant is something that is just observed from a picture or a graph.  Similar to the amplitude of a wave or an oscillation, the phase constant can be found by looking at where the position and velocity of the particle is.  The phase constant helps to determine the initial conditions of the object's movement.  Determining the phase constant of a wave or oscillation might not directly connect to everyday life situations, but it can be related to analyzing and interpreting visuals.  When looking at the motion of an object, the phase constant has to be determined by observing.  Improving one's analyzing skills can benefit in the real world in varying situations.  Being able to read the room or analyze what people are doing around you can determine wether or not something is going on.  This might be a little bit of a stretch to connect analyzing data to analyzing people, but it still pertains to the same skill."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2535,"What is sound? (If I ever was asked by classmate, friend, or a relative this will be my response)              Sound is basically vibrations that travel as waves through solid, liquid, and gas. Sound is generated by a sound source that creates vibrations in our surroundings with a speed of sound depending on the direction. Sound has a couple of properties such as frequency, wavelength, amplitude, pressure, and the speed of sounds. Pitch is represented by frequency and higher the frequency the higher the pitch and if we have low frequency, we will have a lower pitch. Loudness which is represented by how high the amplitude or lower the amplitude. Pressure in sound is based on the medium. There are a couple of things that can make us hear sound which are called sources such as earphones, headsets, and musical instruments.  We can measure sound or sound pressure or sound power using a decibel meter and it captures sound and gives us a reading in a unit called dB. There are some sound that we cannot hear because it has low frequencies such as infrasound because it has very low frequency that the human ear cannot detect. Human ear can hear sounds that are around 0 dB because our ear has a threshold but hearing sounds above 90 dB for a period can damage our hearing.    "
