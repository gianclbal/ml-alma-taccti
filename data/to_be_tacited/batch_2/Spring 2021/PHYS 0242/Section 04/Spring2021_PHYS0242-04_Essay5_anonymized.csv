2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2533,About this academic semester I learned many things but I would say the most important thing is how I feel able to learn how to overcome obstacles and persevere. Taking physics so I have Home has been challenging semester but I feel like I did it and it took a lot of effort for me to get there from doing the lab experiments via simulationsTo have it terrible Internet connection to where The way she keeps freezing I learned my Patience  as well as my drive/Effort level  helped get me to where i want to be  especially during this Covid pandemic.This is because you run into Many obstacles in your dream career path so I am grateful for the opportunity to learn this life lesson earlier on
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,645,"My greatest take away from the PHYS 240/242 course is about light and how it behaves with relation to optics. I never was able to understand how different mediums like glass, mirrors, or water affect light beams and what we are able to see. After learning about these principles, I am questioning the affect of optics in my daily life. I know that may sound silly but as someone with eye and vision problems I am fascinated about how optical lenses are able to correct vision, or at least enhance it. Different forms of glass and mirrors can affect how our vision is in so many different ways and that is amazing to me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1891,I think my greatest take away from this class will be that the speed of sound is not a constant but actually changes depending on the temperature. I had a lot of fun learning thermodynamics and tons of other physics branches this semester. This class made me very stressful at times but overall I think that it was worth it to learn these exciting things that happen in our world.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2528,"I think that my greatest take-away from this class is an overall better understanding of the equations that govern our physical world and how those equations are proved. Additionally, I think that I have learned how the explain the phenomena I encounter in everyday life through physics and math. I have improved my problem solving skills, though I am unsure if I will be able to remember all the equations I learned this semester. However, despite the difficulty in remembering the exact equations, these equations have allowed me to better explain physics concepts. Overall, I think I have gained a solid foundation in physics (excluding electricity and magnetism) upon which I hope to build an understanding of more advanced and interesting topics. I'm not sure if I am supposed to be able to prove the formulas I have learned, which worries me a little bit. Hopefully physics classes that I take in the future will not expect me to have all these equations memorized. I think that this class, in a broader sense, has helped me get through the isolating effects of the pandemic through offering me an outlet to which I could spend my time and efforts. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2527,"My biggest take away from this class is that using simulations helps me learn the material. Seeing how the system works in the simulation is a great way to actually understand it. Since we can not use the tools in the physics lab, using simulations made a huge difference when it comes to understanding the labs. I guess I am more of a visual learner than studying something but the easiest and fastest way to understand something is hands-on experience such as being in a lab and actually doing it yourself. As this semester comes to an end, I really hope that we have in-person labs next semester as it helps understand the lessons more than just using a simulation, it also keeps your attention rather than becoming distracted. I enjoyed taking this lab but I wish we had it in person to retain my knowledge better. I hope to put this newly acquired knowledge towards a project or internship."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2403,"My biggest takeaway from this class was how water, light and sound waves interact.  They all have similar properties and can be applied in the same equations.  Each of these waves can be compared, but also have their differences.  Light waves move the fastest, while water waves move the slowest.  When interfering with alike waves, they have the same types of interference.  When two waves collide, regardless if it is light or sound, they all create nodes and antinodes where constructive and destructive interference takes place.  I always thought that sound waves, physical waves and light waves are extremely different, but can actually be categorized in the same area."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2534,"This class was challenge for my self because this is the first time  I am taking lab online ,but I actually learned how to depend on my self and trust my self to do better in lab sections . also what I liked how this class giving a chance to students  to express their opinions in each lab we de the feedback idea is great opportunity to express thoughts and opinions .This class was vey interesting to learn about physics and apply it in real life application and given an example everyday life . physics is interesting because it related to a lot of daily activity that we do . the most interesting topic in this class We had a lot of opportunities to improve are grades.  I think something really cool we learned  was how different distances and angles effect what we see in mirrors. Especially when we think of movies or shows, I feel like at least I have never thought of how hard it might be to make sure the angles are perfect enough for specific scenes. I can't imagine the thought that goes into scenes where the characters go into the mirror mazes at carnivals or other instances like this one from IT. This class will be the last physics class for me happy ending (:"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2529,My greatest take away from this class is two things. My greatest take away is understanding how heat transfer works and the effects of having it over not and how important it is to cool a system. I have always understood how many engines make power. The second would be how sound waves behave. Since I want to go into automotive engineering one of the most important components of a car is the engine. If the car sounds crappy people wont buy and wont like the car. If I get the calculations wrong to make the engine efficient the car will have a bad rep. This is important because if I get one thing wrong in a heat engine I can cause millions in damages. So this will help me in hopefully my dream job and will help me be successful. These are my greatest take away from this class.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2530,"My greatest takeaway from this class was the real life modelling of physical phenomenon, which helped cement some important concepts for me! For instance, when considering reflection and refraction, while I understood the mathematical formulas and concepts behind the two phenomenon, I was not able to interlink the two together. The lab on reflection and refraction helped do this for me, as modelling refraction and reflection using the simulator allowed me to better understand how the mathematical formulas we use for the two are related to their workings! Such linking was common in almost all the labs I completed, allowing me to not only succeed in my physics lecture course, but also in other courses as well. This lab course has allowed me to develop and refine my critical thinking and understanding skills. The lab helped me establish the relevance of the theories I learn, and how to better connect theories to their applications. In turn, I gained coherence regarding the main concepts of which I did labs for! Overall, my greatest takeaway from this course was understanding the difference between theory and application, and in understanding this difference, I was able to relate the two together!"
