2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2403,"The start of online classes really threw me for a loop.  I was living at towers on campus and had to move back to SoCal to finish off my second semester of college.  Luckily, I live in a good environment with parents that are supportive.  It also helps that I have my own room to study, focus and have me time.  Even though it took a little time to adjust to the different learning style, it didn't take too long.  By now, I am completely used to looking at my phone or laptop 5-6 hours a day doing lectures, labs and homework.  All these changes that happened to suddenly definitely did change the way I live.  I had to get used to sitting in my chair hours at a time trying my hardest to pay attention.  After the first few months of doing this, I noticed that I began to feel lazier and lazier.  The solution was for me to stretch in the morning and have a little workout session at least once a day.  I tried to eat a little healthier, but that did not go so well.  So, my main way of taking care of myself is by exercising, wether that be stretching, running, playing basketball or lifting."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1093,"I just do homework and study to pay for an education that I am not receiving in full. Since online education began, i did quite in fact enjoy a little bit of it just because i get to be home and stay home with having the finnacial worries of rent, food, and transportation. i live 500 miles away from the campus and i do get homesick most of the time being in San Francisco, it was definite nice experience while it last but I do miss being home and seeing my family alot. Some concerns i have for my learning is that is this really the most cost effective of my money to invest in the education like this for everyone. Though learning is not as easy for some. There is proof that learning online can be more successful in a variety of areas for those who have access to the right technologies. According to some studies, students who study online retain 25-60% more content than those who learn in a classroom retain just 8-10%."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2527,"Online classes have impacted my learning as it makes me less interested in the material we are learning. This is all due to the reason that our learning is no longer hands-on, so we are not able to use any of the mechanical equipment to do any projects or assignments. The concerns I have for my learning are that I am not properly learning the material since I am not able to use the equipment in person so when I go to an upper-division course, I fear I may fall behind because I am not at the skill level that the class requires. I have been trying to learn the material as if it was in person, but it is tough to do because you can not meet with your peers in person and learn from each other. I also do not like that professors have been assigning more homework since we are at home, the whole workload is drastically increased."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2534,"Learning online its been  very hard for me because I like to be in class and interact wit other students to learn better specially  with labs I like to work in real lab environment. What I am doing my best to get good grades in my online classes plus I am using a lot searching online to help me improve my learning. I wish we can go back fully in class to learn better especially with major class I am an electrical engineering major I need more of hands-on experience . Also to access tutoring service at the university being able to make a study group with classmates helps me A lot to learn from each other . My concern is  how about major classes how students graduate when they have to do project and research to graduate specially with engineering students they need more hands on experience . I really hope we go back in campus to experience university life clubs and workshops , entertaining  with other students ."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2535,"Online classes are not actually the smoothest type of learning because of the pandemic. Most classes have so many assignments and it is hard to keep track with all of them. Also, I feel like that I am just taking the classes to pass not to learn. Online classes have affected my mental health a lot because I am in my bedroom most of the time and because of the pandemic which made me very stressed, and I also got sick for over 6 weeks and that made it hard for me to keep up with all the assignments. What I like about online classes it made me stay at home and not move to San Francisco and save money and honestly, it also made me realize that the education system needs to be fixed because if we can do this online we don’t really need a lot of in person classes and instead of going to lectures it will be beneficial to get internships because it is more hands on at least for my mechanical engineering major. Also, a lot of the exams are straight forward in the online format and my concern is when we go back to regular schedules (post-pandemic) professors will expect us to know a lot and assume that we learned a lot because ion my experience the type of questions on an exam before the pandemic were super hard and now, they are very logical and straightforward."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2533,"onlone classes have been a real tough struggle for myself especially with how it puts less of an emphasis on in class participation more so on studying on your own and typically when i am in class i like to ask questions and i feel like doing that now in an online setting somewhat disrupts the flow of the class. I also have a hard time focusing when it comes to class due to it being online . self care wise i like to take breaks between my classes and either play a game or two of call of duty or watch an episode of anime to wind down and relax after a stressful day.I honestly think my learning has taken a large hit when it has come to the pandemic as a majority of classes  emphasize testaking abilities now than actual knowledge this is because for alot of my classes you can have the correct answer but if you do not input it in correctly the way the website wants you to then it is wrong,"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1891,Online classes has really been a double-edged sword to me. At first I thought that online classes would be very cool and forgiving because now I do not have to worry about housing cost and commuting to school. I can now save money for housing and starting using the money I save for other things I need. Lately Ive been going outside for a 30 minute walks every other day as a health routine because I am not as active as I was when school was in person. The only concern I would have is that is how long would we have until we have to be in person.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,645,"﻿Online classes have been a shift from what we are all used to. When we first started a year ago, I did not mind it so much because the semester was almost over and I am decently good enough with technology so it was easy to get by. Similar ideas stayed with me Fall semester however the isolation has defiantly gotten to me. I work from my bedroom in my apartment and over the last year, this room has been where I sleep, go to class, study, eat, and spend the majority of my time. I sometimes feel like I can’t stand these 4 walls anymore. To cope with isolation and online school, I try to get out when I can to workout. I will do some form of activity like going for a run on the beach or a bike ride everyday if I’m not too swamped with work. When possible I will see fellow students or other friends in the Bay Area in a socially distant manner with masks on. It is hard being young in SF and not being able to connect socially with people, at least not often or in a meaningful way. My learning hasn’t been too impacted I don’t think. I do feel that any hands on labs have been impossible to recreate and I miss having the experience of interactive learning with labs and projects."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,604,"Surprisingly the online classes grew on me as the semesters went on. Before the online semesters, I had never really done well in school, I never had my own room before or after college so it was very hard for me to want to sit down and do work. It also never really interested me either, but the semester before we got sent out of in-person classes I was on academic probation and I really said I was going to start trying because college was costing me a lot of money, let alone the rent, so I began to try. Midway through the semester moving back home was not the best for that plan because of my family situation. I had nowhere to stay, I could have lived with my dad in his one-bedroom apartment but that was not really what I wanted to do. So I moved back down to Southern California, it took a lot out of me to continue trying at school while moving around frequently over the first month, but it got done. I got okay grades then went on to the summer and whatnot, being at home(Southern California) really made me see things differently and I fundamentally changed how I lived my life. I did the classic delete social media and drink a lot of water route and it was very good for me. I also quit video games because I didn't have my own personal gaming console so I really had no other choice and that helped a lot. So I decided to use my time for good, fundamentally working and going to school and doing nothing else. This was pretty bad for my mental health, but I met a girl and we went through a long year, but because of her experience in therapy, she really helped me acknowledge my emotions instead of suppressing them. This was very hard and I couldn't remember the last time I have cried before this year, but overall looking back at everything online classes gave me the time and the freedom for some much-needed soul searching. Living in a different place every so often really gives you a different kind of loneliness, one you don't get from simply having your own room. It was good though because online school helped me achieve this while getting almost straight As through the summer and winter semesters."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2530,"Online learning has resulted in me being complacent in terms of personal responsibility, as I feel less pressured to attend lectures and lab courses and really push myself to be the best student I can possibly be. Furthermore, as I struggle with both anxiety and loneliness, it becomes harder for me to really push myself to try and work in an isolated environment, no matter how connected I may be with my fellow classmates. In terms of self-care, I am working towards being better connected with my family and reaching out more to fellow students for help in classes I am currently struggling in. Furthermore, I am also keeping a personalized journal which helps me keep track of my daily life and creates order in my otherwise disorganized current life. One of the biggest concerns for my learning is my family's effects on my learning, as well as my mental state and what repercussions it may have on my ability to focus on my classes. My sister was recently admitted to a psychological ward due to her fragile mental state, which has thrown my family into disarray and has left me feeling both worried and hopeless. As my family are some of the few people I can maintain close contact with during online learning, my sister's deteriorating mental health has made it difficult for me to focus on my learning when such issues are going on around me. Furthermore, my sister's case has brought my own mental state into question, as I struggle to find new coping mechanisms to ensure that my own health and learning are not effected.Overall, I believe that online learning, while being great in terms of increasing my personal relationships with family and giving me more opportunities to exercise personal responsibility, has also been trying for my mental state as well. I hope that when we do transition to in-person learning environments, these issues will naturally resolve themselves!"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2528,"Online classes, especially for me, have impacted my ability to focus and retain material in class. I think that sitting at home on my computer all day enables my mind to wander and follow distractions. Frankly, this experience in classes is especially concerning for me as I feel that my academic success is predicated on my ability to pay attention and engage in material thoroughly. Additionally, I am hoping that my material retention and memory are hindered only short term, and that long term the issues will self-remedy. Another disconcerting effect in my online learning experience is my lack of participation. I found that, prior to online learning, I would frequently contribute to class discussions and express my ideas. However, I have found that, on Zoom, I tend to simply watch class and take notes rather than participate. I also hope that this issue will self-remedy after the cessation of remote learning. Overall, though, I am grateful for the continued opportunity to learn from universities. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2531,"Online classes have highly impacted me in the sense that learning has become more challenging. Like many, I though online classes would be easier but that does not apply to Stem classes. I've realized that my motivation has been sinking and sinking as the days go by, to the point where I don't even feel like doing the better minimum, but I always say ""a little bit of work is way more than zero work."" I think this is the main challenge I've encountered, although I'm still surprised I've passed all my classes during this period of time. Times are challenging, and I believe it is normal to struggle with so much going on, it would be impossible for us to not be affected however it still bothers me that I'm not the same student I used to be before the pandemic. The pandemic also made it hard to have fun, but lucky me I enjoy watching anime and playing videogames more than anything. This is definitely what I do for self care, also play basketball in my backyard. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2529,"Horrible, I do not like them but I do not hate them. Most of my professors are giving more work than I or the class can handle. Coming from a poor background classes arent Horrible, I do not like them but I do not hate them. Most of my professors are giving more work than I or the class can handle. Coming from a poor background class is not my only priority. I have to worry about groceries or getting caught up. My professors are not understanding nor does it seem like they care. It seems like they just want a check which is horrible because that could shatter someone's dreams. They do not even take into account peoples situation and some professor dont even respond to may email and when some do its with rude response.  So to some it up I am doing very bad and I have tried to contact the professor but I have heard little from them. "
