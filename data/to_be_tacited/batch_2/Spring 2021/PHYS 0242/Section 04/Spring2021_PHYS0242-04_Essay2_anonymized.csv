2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,604,"At the end of the day I am an engineering major so I guess the goal would be learn how to build things that I enjoy building and hope that it benefits my life in some way and is not just a hobby. This class teaches me a lot about the random processes of the natural world and how we can define them so we can make them into a  mechanical system. It also teaches us about the fundamentals of mechanical systems. But beyond school, this class helps me practice to be more and more responsible each day. In a world riddled with distraction and temptation, it is hard to keep track of what I want to do and what is forced on me. I very much think that things worth having take time to obtain, so I try to work towards seeing the beauty in the boring things of life. But as a 19 year old it is very hard to do that when all around me are things that are trying to take time out of my day. Physics makes me see the reality of life and the beauty in plain living because of how it describes everything that happens in the physical world, and at the very least it helps me keep somewhat of a level head even though I battle with addictions every day."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2528,"My short terms goals are just to learn and explore my curiosities thoroughly. I don't really have any career goals currently. However, I do enjoy the content we are learning and, with every class, I find my curiosity only growing. Physics 242 specifically offers me the ability to explore these aforementioned curiosities through a psuedo-hands-on experience. Practicing and applying the concepts I learn in 240, I am able to better understand how equations and laws are applied and observed in the real world, which is precisely what I hope to gain out of taking this class. I don't really view this class in a preprofessional sense, nor do I with any class thus far. This class is simply aiding my goal of better understanding the world around me by teaching me precisely how it operates and functions. I also feel that this class has enabled me to allocate and partition my time more effectively."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2532,"My goal is to understand about the physics and science, this is so amazing that how our world and human civilization inventing new technologies and industries that all based on science. It is so amazing and interesting  that learn about science. I am engineering major most of my classes are based on physics and electric circuits, Even though, I had some hard time to understanding every concept of physics and science, I am catching it up and doing my own research based on the classes I am taking now. Overall, physics help me to understand basic concept of life and It is major class to me, since i am majoring engineering and this is the good start of something that you want to achieve in engineering work field. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2403,"My short term goals that this class can help me reach is to learn about physics in more depth and develop problem solving skills. This is very important for my major and in life because problem solving is everything in the field I want to go into.  This is similar to my long term goals of graduating with an engineering degree and moving on to a solid job.  In this case, this class is crucial to understand and pass in order to get my degree.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2533,My goals is to become an electrical engineer and graduate i also want to become stronger in physics as i have a hardd time really internalizing concepts but ive been getting better at it. i believe this class can help with with my discipline and attention detail. This because for labs one must be able to properly follow instructions and be able to excute the lab as accurately as possible.Ojnce done  you must be able to explain your results and the reasons why you got them and then from their you can start answer similar questions. This process can make someone more attentive and have a better for things and this is what i need for a couse or section.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2531,"I believe this class is mainly meant for students to learn how to work in groups as well as become critical thinkers. One of my goals is of course to major in civil engineering, but going further than that, I want to be successful at what I do. Of course, critical thinking is a must when you become an engineer, so this class is already helping me develop those skills. Not only that but working in the engineering field is basically like doing a big group project all the time, so working in groups will help me in the future since it is something that I will be constantly doing once I go into the engineering field. Overall, this class is helping me learn skills that will help me succeed in the future. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1891,My goal currently is to become a contractor for the water and power located in Los Angeles. I know that this class will help me achieve this goal because this will get me a bachelors degree in Civil engineering. I need to understand how physics works because without it how would I know if the bridge I am going to build for the public use is going to collapse. I do not wish to receive a lawsuit because of my inability to recognize that the bridge will collapse. This class will help me realize that physics happens everywhere in the world and it is not going to stop.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,2527,"My goals are to finish my undergrad and open up my own performance shop. I have been working towards this goal for many years now, gaining knowledge and understanding how running a performance shop works. I have worked at one for a while so I know how to deal with customers and what kinds of tools you need to run a shop of that size. This class can help me work towards my goal by working with peers, it helps me better understand how to work with people. I have learned a lot during this lab section but there is more to learn. I have been working on learning how to open a performance shop with my friend, we have been discussing this for two years now and are becoming more serious on this by the day. We work on engines and our personal cars together as well as learning how to work on newer cars since most of our experience is on classic cars and 90’s Japanese race cars."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,645,"My goals for university are to get a degree that can better myself for a future career. I want to be an engineer and to do so I need a degree that can prepare me, hence why I am majoring in civil engineering. Engineers in university and in the workforce rely heavily on the concepts of math and science, in particular physics. Additionally, physics course have helped me in Circuits and Dynamics (more specific engineering courses for my department) because all the foundations needed for those applications are learned here. I am finding more and more this semester that all my course compliment each other terrifically because the curriculum is very coherent. "

2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,4,1093,"My goals are to actively understand the concepts of each lesson of each week so I will know how to tackle problems that are asked that will come at me. One of the ways I'm going to do that is to study and do all my homework each night, study at least 20- 30 minutes every other night and practice problems related to this weeks course, and ask questions to the instructors or fellow classmates if I stumble on somethings I don't know. I believe that how the class is going is definitely helping me achieve these goals with the weekly labs that also go very in-depth with so many questions on what we should do along with the weekly homework that is designed for us. I believe the work load is also very fair while it does take some time to complete, it challenges me to think more with all these questions and finding the balance to learn throughout my other classes "
