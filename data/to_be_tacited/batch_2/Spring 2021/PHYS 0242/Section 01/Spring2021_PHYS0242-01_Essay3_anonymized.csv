2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2491,"There are many topics that will be helpful to us and for the society in coming future. But I think that Buoyancy is the very important to understand. Because it is application from balloons to submarines and to humans as well. As when we do swimming it depends upon buoyancy as buoyancy depends on density and volume. This will help the society in many ways as the world is getting hotter due to the increase in green emission which will effect the buoyancy of the objects in the surrounding or in the atmosphere. Due to the hotter atmosphere  the particles in the air will moves at faster speed than usual. This will make air less dense and it will be very hard for us to breath in such environment. So, it is very important for our society to decrease the carbon emission the atmosphere so that we can make our planet Earth a better place to live for our future generation. As Mahatma Gandhi said ""We have not inherited this planet from our forefathers, we have borrowed it from our children.""PS: The above quote I have remembered from my school time only. It was there in my 9th standard social sciences book. I have not copied from any site. thanks,"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2480,"A concept that we discussed a few weeks back was heat transfer and how work can be applied to for an engine. a question I want to discuss about the topic is the importance of loss of heat or loss of energy in an engine. I really like the concept of heat being transfered and creating work but the problem of this is the fact that we lose heat though out the system. How can we make it that we do not lose heat (or energy) in an engine. i know saying that is nearly impossible because of friction, but if we can some how find a way to make it happen, I think it can solve many problems about energy and waste in the world."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2440,Something that I learned was about buoyancy and how it affects different materials and with different fluids and how the buoyant force. What was cool depending on buoyant force the object can either float or sink depending on object and fluid density. That's what I learned in class.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,161,"One concept that has been covered in the past weeks was heat. A question about heat that I want to ask is, what happens to heat when you have one hot item and one cold item? To answer this question we have to look back at the heat lab where we learned that, heat always transfers from the item with higher temperature to the item with a lower temperature until both items reach equilibrium. For example, you can add ice to a room temperature water and the water will slowly lose heat and the room temperature water will get colder as it transfers heat to the ice, and as more heat gets transferred to the ice, the ice will begin to melt."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2481,"Some concepts that were covered in the last few weeks were Gas Laws, Laws of thermodynamics, and buoyancy.  Of these concepts, I would question how does head engines work comparing to heat pumps? To answer this, we'd want to look back on the differences between the two processes. Heat engines produce work through means of burning some kind of fuel of generation of heat, and use a portion of that energy to produce some other form of force, motion, etc. Heat pumps on the other hand draw in energy to transfer heat from a cold reservoir to a hot reservoir. These two processes can be applied to everyday life, such as the combustion engine working as a heat engine or an air conditioner working as a heat pump."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2493,"The question I have is regarding escape velocity of earth and the expansion and compression of materials. Why does some material of the same type expand at different rates at the same temperature. I thought this was interesting because of the Perseverance Rover landing on Mars. I was watching the live stream in class with a professor and some friends and a topic of the rover expanding due to heat while leaving earth and entering the mars atmosphere. The reason is expands at different rate even though the temperature is ""constant"" is that  the thickness and the position of the material has very much to do with the expansion of metals. The one catastrophic result that the engineers at NASA were worried about was entry and the landing for obvious reasons, but the entry could have torn the rover apart and caused some of the hyper sensitive and precious equipment to be damaged and the whole mission right there and then would have failed. Thankfully they got the report that none of the equipments were damaged in landing and entry so the mission was a success so far. If we wanted to relate this to the real life example we could talk about how and engine has to be at certain to operate at maximum efficiency, if heated up too much the air tight seal around the piston would suffer and cause the chamber to get scratched by fiction and so on."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2494,Two blocks with the same volume are dropped into a tank of water.  The blocks are made of different materials.  The first block floats with half the block below the surface of the water.  The second block sinks and remains at the bottom of the tank. Why is that. First we need to know density and how to get density and density= mass/volume. And the units are kg/m^3. And the second thing that we need to understand is the Archimedes’ principle which is buoyant force is equal to weight of the liquid displacement which is also equal to mass of liquid times gravity which is also equal to gravity times density of liquid times volume of displaced liquid. And knowing that the fluid is water which has 1000 kg/m^3and we know that one floats with half the block below the surface of the water and the second block sinks and remains at the bottom of the tank. Then we can conclude that the first block’s density is lower than 1000kg/m^3 and the second block is over 1000 kg/m^3. I believe that this knowledge has helped us throughout human civilization like building boats to life vest. This simple understanding has helped us to travel across oceans and also helped us to save lives. And this also helps to create cool sports like surfing and water polo.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2492,"What is damping and how does it apply to the motion of a wave either on a spring or string? Well, damping is when an external force such as air resistance or friction is applied to a wave which in turn decreases the amplitude of said wave until an equilibrium is reached. This can be observed when looking at a mass on a spring. When looking at it vertically in a situation where the spring it is stretched and let go, ideally we would say it would move up and down the same distance which is was displaced. But in real life air resistance would come into play with this motion and it would create damping causing the mass to slow down and the amplitude to decrease over time until it reaches and equilibrium point. An example of this in real life can be seen when a person bungee jumps. When they jump they reach a maximum stretch with the cord and then they bounce back up, then down. But they never reach that max point agin. They begin to slow down until they come to a stop and they are lowered back down."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2497,"Microsoft Word - SIMPLEHARMONICMOTION.docx 	 	 		 			 				 					SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION REPORT Alemu, Endalkachew Course physic 242  					Date 03/18/2021  				 			 			 				 					Simple Harmonic Motion is a form of oscillatory movement that involves object movement to and from a point associated with particle movement around its stable equilibrium position under influence of restoration force. In a real case scenario, its principles  				 			 			 				 					1  				 			 		 		 			 				 					apply; Musical instruments, Cradle, Car Shock Absorber, Swing Pendulum. For instance, in the mechanical design of various Cradles, these Simple Harmonic Motion concepts apply in the structural setup in determining the amount of force needed to stabilize the infant. In particular the focus of this project is to use the concepts of Simple Harmonic Motion to conceptualize the steady-state hand tremor involvement in associating different frequencies and amplitude in motor control (Brauchie,et al, 2014). This medical-related activity will assist patients with wrist-arm constraints by minimizing the difficulty in conducting fine motor function especially by reducing the frequency and amplitudes in these hand tremors. The ultimate goals is to include mechanical dampers based on these Simple Harmonic Motion parameters that cradle the hand and the wrist. Similar to the Project conducted by other Mechanical engineering students, this one seeks an alternative of delivering a touchscreen interface to control the motor functions between the Wrist and the Arm.  					In the medical fraternity, tremors are a major concern especially in conducting fragile Surgeries. The estimate Amplitude for wrist-related tremors is 7min and the lest are those from the Eye with 1.2min while those from the General body are about 2 min. These wrist movements with tremor frequency obtained through Simple Harmonic Motion complicate the microsurgical procedures especially the case of Vitreoretinal Surgeries (Saxena and Patel, 2011). The solution in this challenge lies in introducing research and prototyping Active Handheld Tremor Cancellation gadgets.  				 			 		"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2482,"A concept that I thought was interesting and enjoyed is Buoyant Force. This topic was interesting to me because of the amount of weight of displaced water is equal to the force. The concept at first seemed simple, however, once we started to get more into the material I noticed that factors such as density, pressure, and mass all have a small part in the effects of Buoyant Force. In our everyday lives we don't stop to think, ""Is that a buoyant force?"" Something I've noticed is that most of the topics we learn in class or lab, are more evident around me. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,552,"A topic that I learned in class and thought was pretty cool is pressure and buoyancy. I thought the simulation was pretty fun and that pressure is pretty cool because when I use to go swimming, I would dive to the bottom of the pool but my head would end up hurting. This had to do with pressure because the deeper you go under water the more pressure there is hence, a human being can only go underneath water for so much before they cant handle the pressure anymore. P=F/A"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2495,"What is the purpose of the carnot engine?I think the purpose of a carnot engine is a goal for us to reach.  Since we learned that the carnot engine is the most efficient thermal characteristics of a heat engine, we know that we'll never be able to reach that goal but it gives us something to work towards.  A carnot engine does not take into account real world losses such as losses due to friction or losses to ambient.  Though we can not currently bypass these losses, things such as our car engines will be affected by many different variables.  If we design an engine step by step while compensating for these losses as we begin each part of the design process, we can make something that is good for people(low cost to operate and maintain) and we can make something that is easy on the environment(less pollutants and waste)."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2487,"I feel that online learning has been affected the way I learn as I personally am a very hands on and in person learner. It’s more difficult to learn like this as there are many more distractions at home. From my parents, to neighbors, to outside etc; it makes it very hard to focus sometimes and complete assignments at the correct time. Therefore I do feel that I have had a harder time to fully focus and absorb all the information I learn in my different classes. Also since I’ve been working all through the pandemic it has brought a different level of stress, within the job, the fear of contracting COVID and much more. I think what mostly concerns me is the fact that I’m not retaining all the information I need for my next courses or also my social skills have deteriorated at some level. It has been a little hard to get new friends or hang out with other people I personally like to be with."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2484,In lecture class we learned about the intensity of sound and how it is related to energy. The threshold of hearing and the threshold of pain was given as the range of a human's hearing. I would imagine knowing these is important for developing hearing aids that I believe help regulate the waves in a person's ear. I tend to be sensitive to noise and often wear noise-canceling earbuds. I imagine for people like my grandma who is hard of hearing they were a device that will amplify the sound by increasing the intensity. intensity is equal to power over the area. since the area of the ear remains constant I imagine the power is increased to increase the intensity. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2453,A. concept covered in class was buoyancy because if you were to be a new pool or something the water will rise and I never really understood that until learning it here in class. I learned how there is so much going on when something is floating in the water and how the weight will affect how much water will be displaced and such. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2485,"The concept I am choosing is heat. In that week's lab, we did an experiment in which we got to do at home with just hot water and cold water. A question I have about the lab is if mixing hot and cold water makes the total water a the end be at equilibrium of each other, what if we just leave them out just by themselves. Since the cups themselves are not thermally isolated, the cups take into account of the surrounding temperature. After that, the water would also change in accordance with the temperature change from the cup. This information can be applicable to people's lives where people can keep cold beverages in cold environments and hot beverages in hot environment such as keeping a coke in the refrigerator. Nobody likes a warm coke and definitely not a hot coke either and this applies to water as well."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2498,"The concept of harmonic motion is a foundation for so many other things. The concept of this motion are used in so many ways with so many things in our everyday lives. From cars to mountain bikes and it all starts with a basic spring. From there it becomes more complex like most things in physics and builds on itself eventually becoming an oscillator. The harmonic motion is in swing, trampolines, and bungee jumps. It can be used to stabilize a mechanism in a machine or create fun and safety for the everyday person. Harmonic motion is that same as the thought that when you push something away it will return. This is all due to the force that was applied on it initial just like when you are on a swing. You are moving back and forth constantly with the force being applied to the swing by either you or another person. It is beautiful in its simplicity and even the equation is straightforward. It being x = Acos(wt+ϕ) and w = sqrt(k/m). It all builds on itself just as it should and is one of the most fundamental parts of physics that is used by people. Even a parent installing a swing uses it in the back of their mind so the swing does not drag or catch."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2488,"Buoyancy is the ability of an object to float in a fluid. The buoyant force is the upward force applied by a fluid on an object that is submerged. Archimedes Principle states “ the magnitude of the buoyant force on an object always equals the weight of the fluid displaced by the object”(Serway). Buoyancy is expressed as the density of the fluid times the volume of the fluid displaced by the object and gravity (constant), B=fluidgVdisp. The density of the object vs the fluid is an important contributor to whether the object floats or sinks, below are some cases.-Case 1: object<fluid considering Vdis=VobjThe density of the submerged object is less than the density of the fluid. The downward gravitational force is less than the buoyant force and the object accelerates upward.-Case 2:object>fluid considering Vdis=VobjThe density of the submerged object is greater than the density of the fluid. The downward gravitational force is greater than the buoyant force and the object accelerates downward.-Case 3:object=fluid considering Vdis=VobjThe density of the submerged object equals the density of the fluid, so the net force on the object is zero therefore this object is at equilibrium.An example of buoyancy is a beach ball, the beach ball experiences an upward force called buoyancy. The reason the beach ball floats instead of sinking depends on the density of the object vs the density of the fluid. In this case, the density of the fluid is greater than the density of the object causing it to float."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2489,"The concept I selected is the first law of thermodynamics and the question I have is why are there different definitions/equation for the change in internal energy. From my notes and remembering what we talked about in class, there are different equations because there is one that we use which is the work done on the gas/system and the other one that you can find by searching the internet is the opposite which is the work done by the gas/system. This is applicable to people's daily lives because thermodynamics is happening in their everyday lives, whether it is the engine in their car or the fridges in their homes. So, the first law of thermodynamics benefits society because without it, a lot of appliances and machines would not be able to function. "
