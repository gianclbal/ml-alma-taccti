2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2490,"I want to eventually become a mechanical engineer and as a mechanical engineer, I might end up working in a scientific setting. This class can help me prepare for that environment by walking me through the scientific process. I find lab settings to be my favorite because I feel as though my potential is at its peek. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2440,My goal in this class is to learn physics and the basics of it. This will help in the future if I want to work in a space agency where using physics can help and learn the basics and deep understanding helps around seeing engineering in a different way. To help me find any other job that's related to physics and this class can give some basics to further my knowledge. It's just like playing a game say rugby the basics are tackling and passing once you have a good base then you can start with more advance and better you will get at the game. This class can help like these labs are pretty nice and interesting I wish it was in person but the pandemic. I need this as well for my major so I can go on and get my degree but it comes back to that physics is basics for everything so you need to know what and how you're doing it. That is why and how this class can help me achieve these goals
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2492,"For this class I guess one could say that the goal is to get an A or to juts past the course. But this is not really the case for me. Of course I want to get a good grade and pass this class to move up in my education but for me that is no the biggest goal. My goal for this class is to apply what I have learned in class to a visual, and meaningful experiment to further my comprehension on the concepts we are learning. Obviously the more hands on is not so possible because of covid but at least have visual. In a way use this class as a kind of tool to see if I'm understanding the concepts and if I'm not be able to understand them by the time I leave the class or finish the lab report. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2489,"One of goals is to graduate and this class will definitely help with that because it is a prerequisite for other classes which I also need to take in order to graduate. Another one of my goals is to become a good civil engineer which this class will also help because there are a lot of concepts in this class that engineers need to know and understand in order to be successful and know what they are doing. Also, things we learn in this class will be built on in other classes so you have to do well in your core/fundamental classes or it will lead to more stress and struggle later on. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2486,"My goals are to do well in my degree and get internships for the summers between semesters and get a job when I graduate. This class can help me achieve these goals by helping me better understand PHYS 240 so that I can get a better grade. My greater knowledge of physics can help me to understand the math and physics that is prevalent  in my other, engineering-specific, classes. If I do well in my classes, I have a better chance of getting an internship or a job.This lab can also help me to get into the habit of turning assignments and other required items in on time, as well as help me adjust to online work as it becomes more normalize and prevalent even after this pandemic ends. But the main takeaway from this class will be a greater understanding of the concepts in physics 240 that will help me as they reappear in future classes."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2496,"My goals in life are similar to most people, such as getting a degree in a subject that I enjoy learning about, getting a career that I know I will love, and doing good at it too. I also have a goal to be able to grow and raise a family with my significant other, and be able to make it through life together. I want to make my family proud of what I have accomplished, and what I have earned through this process. I would love to progress in a company and become a valuable and wise member of the company's team. I want to be able to pass on my knowledge to many others that are starting out, or even to my peers. I want to be able to live comfortably, but knowing that I earned it. I want to be able to let my kids do what I was able to do, and study what they love to study, do whatever they want to do. I want them to know that I will have their back, and help them through life. I want them to end up better than me, and grow even further than me. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2484,My goals for this semester are to pass my classes and do my best. my plan so far has been to take the semester one week at a time. thinking about the semester as a whole it seems too large and fills me with anxiety. I have a weekly checklist of hw assignments tests and quizzes that need to be accomplished for my 8 classes. this has focused the 17 weeks into 17 parts that each seems manageable. This class is nice because it already breaks the semester into 17 weeks. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2481,"My goals of this course is to get a better understanding from a more hands on aspect. Even though it's through simulation, I feel like I get to see how things work. This course has been helpful so far on visually seeing how gas particles work with pressure and heat, buoyancy with objects under water. Even though it is through remote learning, this lab course has helped me get more out of the lectures."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2497,"Microsoft Word - 1stlawofthermodynamics.docx 	 	 		 			 				 					Reflection  					My goal is to become a world class engineer who not only efficiently applies the knowledge acquired but also one who persistently seeks to improve what is already there. It is also my goal to protect the environment from harm caused by the sources of the fuel used today. In the world today, most of the machinery that are used are less than 70% efficient when it comes to energy consumption. Since petroleum products are most widely used source of fuel. This does not only increase the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere but also increases chances of contracting respiratory diseases.  					As an engineer, this knowledge will help improve on the efficiency of engineers by looking for ways to be use the environmentally friendly source of energy by consistently experimenting. Furthermore, the nature only gives but what it receives from humanity. Knowledge of thermodynamics is useful in power plants.  				 			 		"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2453,"My goals for this year was trying to pass all my classes because of all the stay at home situation, I feel like it makes it harder to focus in my classes. At the same time I want to also balance things this year since it is so different and it really took sometime to get used to. My main goal in life is to start finding jobs that relate to my major so I can have more background in that area, that can also make it easier to get the job since you have some type of experience. This class can help me achieve my goals by just keeping the way it is because it does not give me a load of homework to do and I hope it stays this way throughout the year. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2494,My goal is to become a mechanical engineer and in order to do that I need to learn the material that would help me to become a engineer. And this is one of the classes that will help me to reach that goal as it is on of the major foundation of mechanical engineering. Also because this is my goal this class is very important to have a strong foundation in and will help me in the long run in my goal in becoming a mechanical engineer.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2495,"Currently, my main goal is to become a professional electrical engineer with a master's in renewable energy.  I think this class will help me reach my bachelor's and give me insight and skills to complete my upper division classes.  I have a background in mechanical work on nuclear propulsion plants and I have seen at least some of these topics in action but it's always great to go over the theory to hopefully solidify my knowledge."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,552,My goal is to one day work in the space industry as a mechanical engineer. I am interested in space exploration and I always see news articles and images of new discoveries in space. I want to build rovers and spacecrafts to make space exploration possible. This class can help me achieve my goal because to get into the space industry you need to know how to do physics and how it applies to outer space and etc. I think that I will be able to take a lot out of this class and will be able to apply my learning at my dream job. My other dreams also involve working as a mechanical engineer at different fields as well. I want to work at tech and gaming companies as well because I have always been fascinated by the process of how games are created/ developed and how tech companies change the world.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2498,"At this point in time, my goals revolve around having order in my life. Recently, I had surgery and my family bought a condo that we are travelling to a from randomly. I need things in my life that stay consistent so I can have a feeling of things being normal. Class are on thing that do that even if at times it is hard to make it. So having classes like this are good for my long term goals as well as my goals that are for everyday life. As my life is going right now I have to goal of staying at the condo for a few months and making a routine there and have more independence. This should be happening in he next month or so. So, having classes and slowly adjusting my schedule before going there is my goal right now. It is going well so far, but I have yet to add exercise in for the moment. But as time passes my goal will be complete."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2493,"My goal at least for this semester is to frankly make it through this online almost prison like semester. With the semester being online it mean more work/time consumed, every class so far has a video lecture in addition to the required zoom lectures, simulations, and so on. This class can help by making it so I can meet the requirements for semester and done have to repeat. Honestly, I think the everyone is probably going to say something along the lines, it been one really stressful and tedious year for everyone involved and it seems as though even when we come out of this thing won't be the same as they were before Covid-19."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2482,"I have set long-term goals which include a college degree in electrical engineering. This class will help me to learn the basic fundamentals of physics that are key to having a successful career. The more specific topics that will be useful for me are related to energy, potential energy, heat, and of course the several laws that we covered in the lecture thus far. As for short-term goals I would have to say this class is one of the many I still need to fulfill the requirements for a degree but it is the last class in my physics series so I’m pretty excited about that."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2491,To be consistent with the work and not to delay work to last minute. Most important think I have to learn is not to plagiarize in any form.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2480,"My goals are to become a physicist and work on some ground breaking experiments. this class is can reflect on some of the stuff i might need to know before getting in to higher physics and work and difficult projects. this class will also help me on doing group work and collaborating with partners, see how I understood a subject versus how they understood the subject. understand different way to learn a subject and different studying habits that might be more efficient then what I am currently doing.   "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2485,"My goals are to reinvigorate myself with the motivation for school that I used to have before Covid-19 started and get myself going. With online learning, it is just not the same as in-person learning. At home, there are so many distractions that it is almost impossible to focus. This class can help me achieve these goals because the lab sessions can help me focus more in a longer duration. Like for every lab, I try to finish everything on the same day. Then, I try to integrate that practice into my other classes. Recently, I just got a pair of Airpods Pro, and the new cancellation noise feature feels like it helps me focus. Just listening to music while doing school work feels good and finishing the work early feels good too. I think I’m getting there, but I still have a ways to go."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2483,"My goal is to hopefully graduate from SFSU with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering. However, in order to achieve this goal, I first have to learn all the material I can in order to be successful in my field. That is why I am taking this class. This class is one of the required classes that I have to take. But, aside from this class teaching me physics, it is also teaching me other stuff that is needed such as time management. These are a few goals that I had. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2488,"My goal is to become a civil engineer and this class is a prerequisite but it also has a lot of topics that I need for my major. For example, a topic that we recently went over is thermal expansion. For construction, it is important because if we don't calculate correctly it could cause a collapse in the construction."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,161,"My goal is to pass all the classes, and graduate in time with a degree. My ultimate goal is to find a good paying job where I actually like to work, and the working environment is friendly. I think this class can help me prepare for other upcoming classes, and this class can give me knowledge about physics. With that knowledge I can carry it over to everyday life situations or carry it over to other related classes. Passing this class and gaining new knowledge is like the roots to my goal. Since this class is online it also provides me with extra experience because online classes teaches you to use your resources."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2487,"My goals is to become a Mechanical Engineer, and eventually work with a large car company. Well specifically Ferrari or Lamborghini. I believe that this class can help me there as what I want to focus on in my career is design and functionality. This class can help with that as it provides us with understandings of how physics affects objects and moving objects and how it can guide us in the creation of better things using physics. "
