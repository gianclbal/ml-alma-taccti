2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,161,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that you can learn about physics and how it works through simulations. I always thought to learn about physics you had to be in class in person and do labs. However, I never imagined that you could learn about physics through simulations such as the ones we used this semester. This semester really gave me a different view on learning, and I learned how there are numerous simulations I can use to learn about physics. For future reference if I ever come across a physics question that I don't understand I will use the simulations to help me. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2485,"Now that this semester is online, my greatest take away from this class is that simulations really help me understand the concepts of physics more easily. Having pictures while working with questions about the topic is really helpful. I always hear that you don’t need to search up the questions for answers in this class and it really makes sense for the whole semester. The class was made to help students understand the topics easily. For the whole semester, I did not feel stressed about this lab at all because of how the class worked. I’m glad I was a part of this class, but sad that this is the last class for the semester. It is also a shame this class was not in-person as I imagine it would’ve been more interesting working with the experiments personally."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2483,"My greatest takeaway from this class is time management. Since everything was due on Friday at 11:59 pm, I sometimes waited till the last minute to finish the lab, but if I managed my time correctly,  I finished the lab on time, and learned the material. But, aside from that, I learned so many new physics topics. Some of the topics I had heard of, but I didn't really know about it. However, with this class I learned a lot. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2482,"What was the greatest take away from this class?My greatest take away from this class was the interactive online simulations of gas molecules. By using the simulation I was able to better understand how gas molecules behave. This take away also had to do with the lab partners that had. We kind of gravitated towards each other, we were not assigned. One other take away is that online learning is only good for some courses and I actually learn more in some courses. However, for a lab that is not coding, zoom is TOUGH! The effectiveness is hard to obtain as well as the interest in the topic. Overall, it was a challenging course, as it should be right? Going through this semester online only makes me look forward to this coming new school year. I am excited about some of the courses being in person and hope that it only gets better. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2484,"The greatest takeaway from this class has been relating each physics Principles gone over back to real-life situations. In most of my physics classes, the topic was treated as a way of explaining the world around us but never directly referenced how to accept in general terms. This class has systematically drawn those conclusions helping develop a deeper understanding of the material more thoroughly."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2492,"There where two major takeaways from this class for me. The first one is that although online learning is not the best there are ways to still absorb material and learn from the labs. Some ways include simulations and teacher lectures. For me the simulations in particular were very helpful in understanding the material from both lab and the lecture. Even though being in person and being hands on would be ideal there are thill ways to learn and stay engaged online. The second takeaway would be that working in groups, contributing and actually talking to each other is very helpful in better understanding concepts because if you don't know something you group member might and vise versa."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2453,my greatest take away from this class was being able to learn so much about physics and how things work. I found it interesting learning how a lot of things we do in everyday life has to do with physics. Even just shining al light through glass or throwing a rock in water can have lot of physics behind it 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2493,"My greatest take away from this class was that even though this lab was online it was the best we could've done so in this instance it wasn't bad, but if I'm going to be honest I didn't really learn much. It's just that editing a pdf and a taking a quiz on a simulation doesn't help me learn, feels like I'm just sitting here pushing buttons on what I saw, I didn't set up anything or do anything to help my understanding of how this is happening. I just hope that classes return to in-person next semester. What I liked from this class is that we could pick the group we were in and the intro/lecture at the beginning of class, and the most important is the CAT/ANIMAL VIDEO OF THE WEEK, it's weird because it just help with stress from the previous class. All in all, I enjoyed this class for it being online and we did the best we could to try to get the material across."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2490,"My biggest takeaway from this class is that its helped me with understanding the concepts from Physics 240. For me it's difficult to grasp concepts and ideas in physics verbally so having a portion of my learning be more application based really helped me understand these concepts. Even though this lab was online, the simulations are still helpful when compared to not having them. For example when we had the simulations about the lens portions, it was really helpful having those visual examples to help us understand the curvature of the lenses and the direction the light would travel after hitting them. Most labs are a resource to physically apply the ideas and concepts from the lectures and this class did just that. Overall it was just helpful and intriguing to take this lab. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2491,"There are my great things I have learn in Physics 240 which will not only help me to pass this semester but which will help me to succeed my future. From this class I have learn the importance of group work and how to work well in hard situations for example in the time of pandemic. It is very hard to do practical while sitting at home but this class made everything possible. It tell me how to use your knowledge in tough times and how to learn from different situations. Sometimes, I feel frustrated because I came to United states as an international student to experience the American culture and campus life but this pandemic wash it everything. But one the other hand I'm not the only one everybody is suffering, but the best part is I'm still getting education. At last, I just want to say that thank you for teaching me the greatest lessons of life.     "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2481,"The greatest take away from this class is using your lab partners and instructors for help when you need it. A lot of groups usually end up not speak to each other during the labs. Finding that group of people that are willing to help and explain certain parts of the content is really beneficial; especially since the instructor can't be in every breakout room at once. Having those helpful lab partners helps you keep up with the pace of the class, or just helps you understand things better overall."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2497,"Reflective journal on PHS 242  					Reflective journal on PHS 242  					The course has been educative in giving practical application of the calculus learnt in physics. Calculus is a branch of mathematics that helps to build models when solving real life situation. This finds great use in physics when solving and explaining the various basic laws and phenomena in modern physics. The course has also equipped me with more practice in performing and interpreting the results of simple experiments and demonstration of physical principles. This will be applied in other units of study as well as in the outside world at work and when solving problems. The course has improved my problem-solving skills as well as impacting knowledge in physical phenomena associated with electricity, magnetism, optics together with showing relevant applications in engineering and medicine field. The course has also equipped me adequately with essential knowledge that will be important in case I advance the physic study to 140 and 241.  				 			 		"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2495,"I think my greatest takeaway was learning how to reference the materials presented, my note and the book better than I could before.  It helped me complete the labs much faster while still being able to practically apply the material.  I think I was successful in this class even though some of my other classes were more difficult because we've been learning remotely.  That success came from easy to understand directions and material presentation which made it easier to process."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2496,"My greatest take away from this class has to be about learning about all of the different types of processes, and getting to see how they work, at least by a simulation. One major thing that I found to be interesting was the waves lab, when we were going over light waves and sound waves, and how they look and ripple when there is a slit or two slits in a wall that the wave passes through. I also liked how the labs were not so much math as they were when we first started. I felt like I could understand the general understanding of the processes and what was going on. I feel that I will be ready to tackle the next semester challenges and material with a little more ease, and I have confidence in myself for my future classes."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2489,"The greatest takeaway from this class was even though we are doing online classes, we can still learn a lot of new and different things compared to if we were doing in person learning which is good because it is really hard to replicate in person learning especially for labs so being able to somewhat show new concepts and ideas using simulations and different websites is really helpful and can help with your understanding of certain topics. So even though online classes can be tough and can sometimes affect your learning, this class has showed me that using different methods like simulations or videos can still help you learn. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2488,"My greatest takeaway from this class is being able to explain material based on observations that I have made through an experiment. I think that doing labs virtually is not the same as doing them personally, however, the simulation that we did helped a lot with certain topics. The simulation helped me because I am a visual learner and I could see how different topics interacted in real life even if it was through a simulation."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2498,"Honestly, this class was a lot of fun overall. Half way through the semester I changed my major to accounting and could have dropped out of this class, but I stayed because I was interested and wanted to further my knowledge. I feel that as we walk through the world we do not think about things that are going on around us and why they happen the way they do. I love the feeling of doing something or observing something and thinking, ""I know why that happens the way it does."" It is a pleasant feeling that can make my day. I feel that even if I will most likely no use this class in my future job. I will use this class for my hobbies and to enjoy life just a little bit more from the little things. I like to write stories in my spare time and have already used this class multiple times for a science fiction story concept recently. This class has enabled me to touch on a new genre of writing that I found difficult before. This may not seem like a great take away for another person, but to me this has made my life more enjoyable in a way that has always been close to my heart. My stories and the little things around me have always made me happiest. So anything that improves those two things, improves my life. I did not know that this class would benefit that when I joined, but it was a welcomed surprise."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,552,"Overall, my take away from this class was that even though we are online, it may be more difficult to preform labs in an online environment, it is still possible to do through lab simulations. I personally thought that this class was not that bad but the labs were a bit longer than I was use to especially if classes were in person. I thought that working in groups of 4 was pretty good because we were able to communicate with one another and help one another learn from each other. to keep it short this semester wasn't as bad as I had thought but it could have definitely been much better."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2494,I think that the greatest take away was find what is interesting to me to see what part of physic that I really enjoy and want to commit to for the rest of my life seeing what part interested me and what part I didn't as much. And this class has helped me to see what I want from physics and and how it can help me on my goal to becoming a mechanical engineer. And I think this class has help me with what different specialty that I am think I want to work with in the future. And I know that physic is one of the biggest assets that a engineer can have as it not only helps to with technical and mathematical problems but also how to test and design question to help us to make a think deeper of maybe my is something not working or how to organize a test to make sure the product is safe. And physic lab was not just about equation but problem solving.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2487,"My greatest take away was probably how to understand how to use and that there are online resources that can help us sample an experiment. Even though it isn't the best way to learn topics that would usually be learned with hands on activities, those online resources definitely helped. Plus they were fun to interact and play around with"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2440,One of the greatest takeaways from this class is learning how to use a PDF annotator. I also learned more about physics and how to use and see in everyday tasks. I also learned about lenses which for the longest time it confused me and didn't understand until I saw the visual representation of what it was and how it worked. I also learned about many different physics topics like interference and how heat can be transferred to one another. Those are some of the things I've learned in this class that I found useful.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2486,"My greatest take away from this class is all the different ways that waves impact the world we observe in every day life. We can observe waves in the light we see every day, the rainbows in the sky. Waves also form the sound we hear. I have rubber inserts for my ears that change the shape of the ear, which reduces harsh frequencies without lowering overall volume. The study of waves is what makes important inventions like that possible. I also have a prism on my windowsill that creates rainbows in the sunlight. This is due to the different indexes of refraction for the different wavelengths of the sunlight that reaches it. All the wavelengths come out of the glass at a different point, separating out the colors, creating a rainbow.We also went over thermodynamics which explains the ways we observe and feel temperature changes. Everything wants to reach thermodynamic equilibrium due to entropy. This was interesting to me because it makes me think of the heat death that I read about in one of the books I read this year."
