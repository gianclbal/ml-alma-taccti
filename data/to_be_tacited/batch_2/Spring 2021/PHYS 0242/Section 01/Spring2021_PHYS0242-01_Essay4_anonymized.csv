2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2440,How online learning has affected me is learning is not the same online I prefer in person. I am a hands person and not being there doesn't help. The learning online isn't the same I really hope we come back in person for classes so I can get learning. Then they charge us as much as if we were there and it's not fair like the wellness center where I'm not using it why should I pay for it and the student health center too I'm not using it. Then the professors assign a lot of homework compared to in-person which is kinda weird in my mind. Then the stress of the pandemic is not helping to try to get supplies for me and my family and also working a job to help out the family and pay for school bills. I also heard most likely next semester in the fall will also be online which would suck if that was the case. That is the impact online learning had on me and on my wellness and energy.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2486,"Online classes have made it easier to get to class, but now it is much harder to carve out time for work. Having the classes just contained in my laptop makes it feel less serious. Tests are very hard now because professors impose short time limits which is really stressful. Sometimes my internet will cut out or someone in my house will interrupt me.For self-care, I have a beach chair in the front yard that I like to sit in and read in the afternoon to relax. I have been living in Tahoe, so it is the first time I have been feeling the heat of the sun in a while.Some concerns I have is that when classes come back in person, I will have forgotten how to interact in a normal environment, and all the classes will seem much harder. I've gotten used to being able to listen to music as I watch lectures because my brain needs to do multiple things at once sometimes. In person, listening to music in one ear is very rude."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2482,"The impact of online classes was not as intense as it is this semester, at least for me. So much so that my anxiety level, blood pressure, and weight all skyrocketed. I consider myself to be a moderately cautious health person. I exercise 2 to 3 times a week but despite that, the toll of courses and everything being closed due to COVID has taken its toll on my mental and physical health. I have since begun to see a therapist and journal. My alarm that I'm getting over-stressed is my puppy Max. He somehow can feel when I'm stressing out and starts to lick my leg or sits right next to me to get my attention. Eventually, he will bark if I don't stop staring at the screen and pay attention. Self-care is something I'm practicing and getting better and better at every week. I've bought myself flowers, took Max out for lunch, drink tea before bed, yoga (beginners), allow myself time to exercise, make sure I get 8 hours of sleep, and the best self-care I've learned, DO NOTHING. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,161,"Online classes has changed my learning completely. Online classes has made me a little lazier, however it has taught me how to do research on subjects and help myself learn the material. Due to online classes I feel like I have more time to spend on one subject, and I have more time to spend on studying for a test or a quiz. Online classes definitely has its ups and downs, and the way I take care of my self so I don't overload on work is I either workout in my garage, play video games, or watch anime. By doing these activities I usually take my mind off of the stressful work. By doing these activities it also helps me prepare for any work that is assigned to me because after the self care session I feel more refreshed and ready."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2485,"Online classes have impacted my learning where I am forced to learn from Zoom meetings. In that sense, students are bound to their homes to learn just like I am. In my case, there are always distractions at home that take my attention away from the class here and there. In addition, online learning I think has made me more lazy than I was before online learning was made since the beginning of Covid-19. That is the impact of online learning. For my self-care, I’m doing well so I don’t think I need to do anything excessive for self-care. I just do what I usually do in a normal life except I just have an added twist of online learning instead of in-person learning. Concerns I have for my learning and my well-being is being lazy because of online learning. This semester, I am trying to slowly get back to being more productive, so that I can prepare myself for when the university opens back up for some in-person classes."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2488,"Have online classes is not the same as being in person for many different reasons. personally online classes have affected me negatively. My workspace and motivation have changed thus affecting my grades and productivity. I try to stay motivated but it hard to sit for hours in the same spot for all of my classes and continue sitting on the same spot to do homework. For self-care, I try to exercise which helps my muscles from sitting all day long and I can use up my energy. I also try to avoid bed and PJs as much as possible. My learning has declined significantly which is what I am most concerned about. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2453,"I felt like it was  hard to get used to the online learning and I found it very difficult to get use to. Overtime I did start to get the hang of it but I still do not like it and I hope to start school soon. Concerns I have is that I feel like I am not learning as much as in a classroom. To me it feels much easier having a person in front of me teaching me and also having classes online, it helped with time management so I would know which homework is due and such. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2495,"In my experience, online classes have been pretty tough.  I enjoy being in an actual classroom and feel I learn better when seeing the instructor in person and having peers to bounce ideas and ask questions.  I do like that all my classes are recorded and its easy to go back and review something I missed or need to clarify and also like that we can attend lectures right from our room.  The problem with that is it's tempting to just not go to class sometimes and say you're going to make it up later.  It gives me too much opportunity to procrastinate which I find myself doing a lot more than usual.  At home, I try to stay fit by working out and getting outside.  It's also very nice to not have to sit in traffic for hours each week and lose all that time.  I know, though, that as soon as we get back to class, I'm going to be saying how great it was doing all remote learning."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,552,"Overall, online learning has been very different from in person learning. it is much harder waking up and actually to be focused in class because there are so many distractions all around us. for self-care whenever i am starting to get stressed out I like to listen to music or what anime. i found this to be extremely helpful because it helps shifts my attention off the stressful work and helps delude my thoughts. somethings that are concerning is our physical and mental health. a lot of people including myself just are not built for online learning. sitting in a classroom is much more beneficial and it also makes me more focused."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2496,"Online Learning has affected and impacted my learning and way of learning in a great variety of ways, both good and bed. Recently, I lost my grandmother who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. She was almost 89 years old, and she was in a home due to her condition. It made me very depressed for a few weeks, since the last time I saw her she could at least remember who I was. It's a very heavy loss to me and my dad, as well as my grandfather, but we know that she doesn't have to suffer from her condition anymore. I plan on visiting my grandfather this summer. along with my family to comfort him. Moving away from the very sad stuff, my schoolwork has piled up so much that I often stay up for most of the nights of the week, only sleeping about 3 nights of the week. It's very taxing on me and my mind, but I know that I can't just give up on my future career. The work load has definitely increased by a lot, and I definitely do not like it, but it must be done. I definitely appreciate my professor in PHYS 242 for allowing us to turn our labs in late when we need it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2490,"So far online learning has only really made me less active since before the pandemic I was super active and I had a strict schedule and it was probably the best shape I've ever been in, but now since I'm at home, all I can really do is do body weight exercise and walk my dog. That only takes up a tiny percentage of my day and I still have hours of inactivity. I'm just worried sitting in front of my computer all day at my desk will affect me if school starts again. I'm also worried that I haven't really understood the classes that I've been in and once I graduate I might be behind compared to someone who has practical experience in the field. I mostly just feel lazy and unmotivated but I know that's not how I was before since I had a super motivated mindset before. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2498,"Online classes have helped me recognize what I want out of life and where I want to be in the future. Through taking these classes, I have realized I wanted to change my major because I realized how this would be similar to how my job would be in the future. I want to work on data and analysis, but I want more of a human component in my work as well. I changed my major top accounting for this reason. Having these classes helped my realize what I needed to do to take care of myself. I have since gotten a job and workout at least 4 days out of the week as well as going to classes. I am happier with this more well rounded schedule even if it seems I am doing more work to others. I also enjoy an hour or more of reading at least every other day to keep my spirits up."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2487,"Online learning has been something completely new to me and honestly is convenient but it has taken away my concentration and ability to make more friends in person. It has taken away my social skills to a degree and I feel I have had a harder time learning, especially since I am a very hands on learner. What I do to self care is going on drives after work, trying new food places, or go and take photos of things with my camera.  I am worried to no being able to remember or keep the little information I learned this year. Additionally I am a little worried to become more isolated and less social.   "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2489,"Online classes have made me kind of lazy and not motivated to do things sometimes like homework. It can also be distracting because you can go on the internet or your phone which causes you to no pay attention and can affect your learning which is bad so for me to avoid this, I put my phone somewhere else where it cannot distract me and I usually try to finish a lot if not, most of my assignments on the day they are assigned because I will get lazy or I will forget. Other than these things, I do not really have any other concerns about my  learning and well-being."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2481,"Its crazy that something like this pandemic could come out of no where  and disrupt so much of our lives and change things so drastically. I think remote learning has put a lot of pressure on learning on your own time. I feel like I don't get a lot of the content from the course from some of my professors, and it's mostly me reading their lecture or doing my own research on topics at hand. I miss being in a classroom with a professor, it puts me more at focus rather than being at the comfort of my room and wandering off into my phone. My concern is that I won't get the necessary information on certain subjects that I'd need for future courses as much of engineering builds off of each last course. I hope that I'll be able to finish out my undergrad in person rather than through online courses."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2493,"Online classes suck, they are awful. The whole online aspect of this semester is really having a negative impact on my learning and I don't really have anything to do on my free time, since you can't go out or anything. Honestly it's just an awful situation in general for everyone. I hope this thing blows over soon because this is just honestly too stressful and exhausting to deal with. There isn't really much else to say it was the same last semester and the same if not worse this semester."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2491,"Online classes have impacted my learning in many ways. I'm an international student from India. I came to United states to get better education but due to online classes the knowledge I'm getting is not much effective. Being a civil engineering major it is very important for me to get hand on experience and practical knowledge but due to online classes lab and practical learning is not much effective. In person labs are more fun and we get a lot to learn from them, But online labs are a burden and its seen more difficult than the theory classes. Moreover, due to online classes I miss the campus community and friends. The time we spend with friends and the group work in library. Furthermore, online learning have made me lazy. Due to COVID 19 I'm stuck in the four walls of my apartment and can't even meet my family and friends, as my whole family is in India. I environment which I thought before coming to States, I'm not getting it. Due to which sometimes, I feel depressed. To overcome these situation I do mediation and video call my family back there in India.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2494,"Over the pass few week's I have ne neglecting my own health as everyday I am sitting at a computer doing homework or in class about 60 percent of my day then I eat, sleep, shower and brush my teeth and repeat a endless cycle. even on Saturday and Sunday I am doing homework so I don't interact with friends and family as much as want too. I think this has negatively impacted me in school work is that I don't feel like I am doing to my best of my abilities and also not enjoying what I am learn as much. But I do think that have family and friends that talk to me does he me to feel so relief on my mind that they are ok and going through the same thing that I am. But i think after this semester I need to make some time to have some self-care like having time to talks to friends and family maybe hanging out with friend if covid is almost gone."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2497,"Microsoft Word - PERSONALSTATEMENT2 (3).docx 	 	 		 			 				 					Reflection  					Online classes are some of the learning processes which have made it easy for the learning to take place in different parts of the country. The online classes carried out by different people have encouraged different people to pursue different courses without having to move from one institution to the other. However, the online classes have impacted my learning in a positive way by ensuring that the learning is carried out in the best way possible. As a result, I have been encouraged to remain focused in my studies due to the different learning resources provided. For self care, I have been able to borrow ideas from the online articles provided hence acquiring the needed ideas in my career. Again, the self-care practices have ensured that the spread of different disease is reduced therefore safeguarding my health. The concerns I have for my learning and my well-being are that the online classes has reduced my confidence in the learning activities. This is achieved due to the lack of physical interaction in the learning processes (Grover, 2021).  				 			 		"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2484,"Online learning has been a really good experience for me because I have a stable home life. I am very much a homebody and get really bad social anxiety when on campus so the prospect of prolonging online learning is really appealing to me. I feel bad for all those that crave campus life because I rejoice in not having to go back yet. Structure and self-motivation are very important for this kind of learning so I keep a strict schedule so my assignments are all turned in on time without getting overwhelmed with the workload. My PTSD is largely why I like staying home where I feel safest and have few triggers but I understand the importance of having some social interactions to keep healthy and active. For this reason, I purposely don't order all my groceries online to give me reason to get out of the apartment. Exercise is important for keeping healthy so I always bike to get my groceries or walk with my boyfriend. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2492,"If I am being completely honest, online classes are not my thing. When this pandemic first started and especially last semester I was doing horribly, I wasn't engaging in my classes I was doing work just to get it done and I felt like I wasn't learn anything. It also didn't help that a lot of my teachers last semester were not understanding and were also struggling to get with the online classes. Because of this my mental state completely declined and life was honestly horrible. But I took some time off during the winter and spent some time with my self and my family. This is when I realized that this college thing and the major I am taking are the most important things in my life and are worth while, and if I wanted to be successful I had to find a way to rearrange myself. So this semester I bought myself a desk to have a work space so I wouldn't be doing classes in bed. I made sure I wasn't on my phone during class and that I was actually trying to learn. I also make sure to ask for help when I need it because that is what the professors job is. Thanks to this, this semester has been significantly better. Although I would much rather be in person I understand that that is not completely possible yet and I'm trying my best to continue with my learning and focusing on the good things in life in general. "
