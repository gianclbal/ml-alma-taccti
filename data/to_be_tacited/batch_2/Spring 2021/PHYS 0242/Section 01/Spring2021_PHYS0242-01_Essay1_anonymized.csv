2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2480,"Lutfi Maaz  The reason why I want to get into stem is because the subjects and the work actually gets me exited in the subject and I like to do the work, unlike other jobs out there. An example can be like, in engineering you can see the a structure being built and see the progress of the work you put in all Infront of you. Another example is doing optic and laser experiments, for some reason I find this very interesting and very appealing to do. Over all I think that stem is a very interesting topic that helps people in many ways. I can see my self liking many different disciplines of stem."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2481,"I decided to go into the STEM field because of my last job. I used to be a maintenance technician in the US Navy. I maintained the missile systems on board the USS America. For the job itself, I'd troubleshoot and fix any problems in the system. This gave me hands on experience with an assortment of electronic equipment. So once I decided to leave the military, I felt that I should use my experience and knowledge from the military schools and find a job in mechanical engineering. Although I learned basic electrical theory and trouble shooting, I wanted to that stay close to that field of engineering."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2482,"Why do you want to go into STEM?I want a career in STEM because I’ve always felt that the sciences are a challenge for me and I like challenging myself. In STEM there are so many uncertainties that keep us always wanting to find a bigger, better, and faster way to do things. The challenge for me is figuring out what field of STEM I want to work in. I know that EE is what attracts me the most but there are so many options within the EE field. I’ve always felt that I would stay in academia doing research after grad school but I need to wait till then to see how beat up I am from grad school. If I do make it through and decide to stay in research, there are other aspects that I would need to learn like grant writing. These are all worth doing if it’s something I enjoy doing. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2483,"I want to go into the STEM field because working in this field one can make a change to the world. Engineers, doctors, nurses, etc., all help make people live a better life. When we are sick, we go to the doctors and nurses in order to feel better. Engineers are the ones who make homes to live in and buildings to work in or go to school in. There is a bigger list of stuff they do, but these are a few. This is why I want to go into the STEM field. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2484,I just fell into it. I like exercising my brain and find mathematical formulas that give clear answers to how and why the world works both interesting and cool. too many people equate Panamanian to the supernatural when there are logical reasons for why things happen. The STEM classes I have taken have all pulled me further into the field of engineering and helped with developing more skills useful for being a critical thinker. Stem classes create problem solvers. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2485,"I want to go into the STEM field because STEM seemed more interesting to me than other subjects such as english or history. I think I wanted to go into the STEM field because math was sort of an enjoyable subject. Solving problems, getting it wrong and then going through the problem again and then getting the right. That is the feeling that I liked getting. I think my interest was sparked more in senior year of high school when I had great teachers for physics and calculus. For physics, it is interesting to understand how things work under the laws of reality. When I’m not doing school work, I usually find myself watching videos on computers or playing League of Legends with friends. I’m mainly interested in computers because they are like majestic beasts. Every computer has the potential to be a high performance beast. For a while, I was stuck with a garbage laptop with something like a 980MX graphics card. And then when I had the chance to build my own PC, I had to find the parts that had good performance and good price for its pay. That’s when I started to delve more into the parts themselves."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2486,"I want to go into the stem field because I really enjoy math and science. I like learning about how the universe works and how we can make the universe work for us. I think it is really interesting how we can use math to figure out real, physical phenomenons.I am majoring in civil engineering because I have always been especially interesting in man-made structures and their designs. It is very interesting to me how we build our structures to survive natural conditions, like the earthquakes in California.I am also very interested in astronomy. I think it is amazing how we can learn so much about things that are so far away that we see them billions of years in the past. I also enjoy how a lot of science is brought about by science fiction. I like to try to connect what I learn in stem to the possibilities I see in the world around me and in the books I read (I read a lot, sci-fi or otherwise)."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,161,"Well, first and foremost I need to go into the stem field because I am a Mechanical engineering major. I have to pass these other classes or else I will not be able to move on with my major courses. I also think that the things I learn in these classes might come in handy later on in my job field. All the stem classes are closely connected and they intertwine with one another. In order to pass one, you need a little knowledge from all the other courses from stem. Plus stem is also in a majority of the jobs we see today, and many of the high paying jobs are in this field. The stem field is usually challenging and I love to challenge my self when it comes to learning new things. This is the majority of the reason I choose to go into the stem field. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2487,"The biggest reason I want to go into the STEM field is because there I am able to design and create things that have a use in the real world. Also because I particularly like to work with my hands, feel and work out things that are physical, it excites me. I also like the versatility of the field, there is so many different things and areas I can work on as an engineer, it's pretty fascinating and cool. Also a funny aspect is because I don't think I can operate or find interests in other areas of work, or careers; for example I cannot be a doctor because if I see someone else's blood I'll more than likely pass out, I get weak and bam just out. A lawyer doesn't seem as fun, I don't like arguing, and the amount of Laws and loopholes to know are just too much to figure out and remember. Also the financial benefits that come along with the major is very attracting and reminds me that the hard work will pay off in the future. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2488,"I want to go into the STEM field because it is something that I enjoy doing as much as it stresses me out. I've always loved math and science classes. In my sophomore year of high school, I took physics, and in one of the labs, I was supposed to calculate the placement of a ramp so a marble could go down the ramp and through 3 hoops landing in a cup with sand. I was so scared because our teacher only gave us one try. We had to calculate everything perfectly or it would be an F. At first, I thought it was a bit over the top, but he said ""what if you build a bridge and miscalculate? The lives of people are in your hands you don't have another chance to redeem your miscalculation."" I understood why he was doing it, but never the less I was still freaking out. I double-checked, okay maybe more like quadrupled checked my calculations, and it worked. I was mind blown that I did that. Ever since I've always wanted to go into STEM."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2489,"I want to go in to the STEM field because I feel that being a civil engineer is what would interest me the most and I would enjoy it more compared to other majors and fields. In the STEM field, you get to experience and face new problems/challenges all the time and maybe be a part of big discoveries. Also, if you are in the STEM field, you get paid pretty well which is also another reason why I want to go in to the STEM field."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2490,"I've always wanted to work on cars ever since I was a kid. I was always intrigued on how the engines worked and whenever I would see a classic muscle car I would just fall in love with them. Eventually when I got to middle school and high school, I began to think about what I wanted to do for my career. This was also around the time I started realizing that I really enjoyed math and I had always excelled in it. I then realized that engineering could lead me to the career path I've always wanted which is mechanical engineering. STEM is also know as science, technology, engineering and math and these are all subjects that I really admire and that I excel in.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,552,"I want to become a mechanical engineer because ever since I was little I would play with legos all day building all sorts of things from rocket ships to dragons, my imagination was endless. I never even thought about becoming an engineer because at that time what really caught my eye were firefighters and policemen. Seeing them save peoples lives while getting to drive a police car or firetruck was amazing. It was not until high school when I had to really think about what I wanted to do with my future. I really thought about it and came to a resolution of being an engineer. I want to work at NASA and potentially become an astronaut. This is my greatest drive for wanting to become an engineer. I want to build the next great spaceship that can venture far greater distances and maybe be a member part of the flight."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2491,"In the 21st century, scientific and technological innovations have become increasingly important as we face the benefits and challenges of both globalization and a knowledge-based economy. To succeed in this new information-based and highly technological society, students need to develop their capabilities in STEM to levels much beyond what was considered acceptable in the past.I choose the STEM field because I want to pursue civil engineering. Working in an exciting environment: by studying civil engineering, you are involved in the entire product development process. From the beginning of the project’s design, to bringing it to life and maintaining it – civil engineers are always needed! I want to make a difference in society and save the environment through my education in the STEM field. I want to make sustainable and environmentally friendly buildings. In civil engineering degree I would focus on real-world projects that involve sustainability concepts and practices. Moreover, STEM field is an amazing field filled with lot of amazing discoveries and there is lot more to discover. This field help me to think out of the box."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2492,There are many reason why I want to go into the STEM field. first of all I've never been a big fan of english classes or classes where we have to interpret the meaning of something so obscure like the color of a curtain from a poem written years ago. Subjects such as math and and science have reasoning behind them and for the most part have a straight forward answers. Then when they don't or are a bit more difficult i enjoy going through the process of understanding the problem and finding some fort of solution. math and science help explain the world around us from why rollercoaster work to why the earth is orbiting the sun. I like knowing those things because it helps me feel safe and knowledgeable about the world. also for the longest time I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life then once I took my first physics class it just all made sense to me and I knew this is what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.  
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2493,"The reason I want to do into the STEM field is because I love science, I feel that there is so much we don't know that it maybe so small of a percent that the amount we do know is literally like nothing. We don't even know that what we know is even correct so that always has interested me. Other than that I love to build thing with my hands and use technology to design things so I choose to be a mechanical engineer. Math was also always a strong point for me when I was a kid, got it drilled into my head as a very young child by my family. I also could say that the most motivating part of going into STEM is that you could be involved in something that advances the human race so be it a new phone, or even a rocket that can take you different planet more efficiently, it really makes me excited for the future, even if I couldn't be apart of it. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2440,"The reason why I choose the stem field is that I really like solving problems. I like working with my hands and it makes sense in my head and I love learning sciences and learning certain topics that are super interesting in my mind. I really want to work with space sending objects into space which I have been inspired by since watching star wars and space which is super awesome. I love the laser in there which inspired me to get into it. At first, I really wanted to work with Nuclear reactors but not many jobs in the US to find so I went down mechanical engineering because it was such a broad subject and would help me the best. Another reason my dad worked with nuclear reactors in the Navy when I was little so that inspired me a little bit. That is why I got into the stem field because I was inspired by those topics."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2494,"I think that the reason that I want to go into the stem field is that I think that parts of science is figuring out what to do with knowledge that we don't or don't have. For me I love making things and designing tools or objects. And I find it fun to make new objects out of nothing. I see the stem field as a way for me to step into a place that expands my knowledge. I see the stem field as a connection of art and science. I can make a design that is useful and cool, something like a phone or a car. And there is unlimited possibility of what I can do to make it more effective, safer, cheaper and so on. I think that stem fields help to make the quality of life better as we design or make new things that help to solve day to day problems worldwide."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2495,"I want to go into the STEM field because I want to help make a more energy efficient world.  I know I'm just one person but if I can make one person's life just a bit more convenient or give one more person access to electrical power I will be satisfied.  Ideally, I want to invent things or improve upon existing designs.  I have always thought ""I bet I can make this a more efficient device"" so hopefully I can take the knowledge I learn here and apply it practically to the real world."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2496,"I want to go into the STEM field because I've always had a passion for building and designing automotive and mechanical parts for machines and cars. I loved to build with legos and make robots from Robotics classes in highschool, and I also feel very comfortable when it comes to the subjects that are needed in the field of Mechanical Engineering. I'm also comfortable knowing that I can understand I can do what is needed of me from the companies that would hire me, and I'm confident in my abilities. I do enjoy the fact that my field will leave me with a good amount of wealth. I want to be able to live comfortably, and not to worry too much about my financial situation. I like to live fairly comfortably, and I want to continue that, as well as be able to provide for my wife and children when I have them."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2453,"I decided to join the STEM field because I wanted to stick to something about cars and  when I began to look into what kind of jobs that would work, I found that being a engineer can get me somewhere, but it also took me some time to figure out what kind of engineer I wanted. I figured mechanical was the path I should take because I like doing things hands on which helps me learn better as a person. Although even after choosing mechanical I had thoughts about switching to another major, but nothing really caught my attention not even other engineering studies and figured I was too far in to just change it. "

2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,1,2498,"When I was deciding on college and my future I made a list. This list included the jobs that I thought would be enjoyable to do for the rest of my life. On that list was engineering, author, lab researcher, nurse, doctor, physical therapist, among others. When I was narrowing down this list I thought of it in depth. Most the jobs I listed were in the STEM fields so I realized I had more interest in STEM as a whole. After I realized this, I thought about what area of STEM made me the most excited to learn. I wanted something that would challenge me and make me want to learn more. When I was doing this I realized I wanted to know a lot of detail about out things functioned in technology so I chose Engineering. Overall, It was when I realized I enjoyed STEM that my life path became clear."
