2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,444,"My goals for this semester is to achieve good grades and learn more about physic topics. As well to continue working on physical labs and by doing so it helps me to grow my thinking and knowledge. Overall my goal is to graduate with a bachelors degree in physics. As I've heard how difficult this major can be, I expect myself to push my boundaries and challenge myself in these different classes. Perhaps in the future work as a lab technician or a pediatrician anything that will use what I learned in school and something that I will enjoy doing. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2523,"My goals are to stay focused and complete my classes for my future as best as I can. If I do not understand something I will ask my professors for help or attend the office hours they provide. For staying focused, I will try to take notes as the professor goes through the presentation in class. If I ever miss anything, I try to go over the recorded material on Ilearn with the worksheets. This class can help me achieve by being patient with the work. I tend to take more time understanding the material and homework. I try to stay focused in lecture. Breakout rooms help a lot because if I have any questions I can ask my peers and elaborate more on the topic. If my group does not understand, we can ask the professor for help. And that can help me achieve my goals for this class."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2511,My goals for this class are to understand more of the real world applications of physics. I like working with cars and physics is a large part of knowing how a car works. Through this class I want to gain the knowledge of how to apply physics to understanding and fixing issues with not only cars but anything mechanical in my life. I am fascinated with understanding the inner workings of anything mechanical from watches to airplanes and I feel that physics is the basis of that. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2526,"Javis Balestier  Reflection #2  My goals are to finish up my college career with a positive mindset. Which means I would like to be confident going out in the real world looking for a perfect spot to place myself for my future work. With the academic year coming to an end, I will be starting my senior project in the upcoming fall, I am excited to use the communication skills learned from this class, with the concepts from all my other courses to bring a confident idea to light in the next year. Another goal of mine is to keep my organizational skill consistent throughout the rest of my academic career. For this class being very reflection intensive it keeps be constantly checking the assignment page and setting reminders to get all of my work done by the proper time."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,648,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?My goal is to start my own engineering firm that deals with the movement of fluids. I have always found it fascinating how for example, the Hetch Hetchy Dam provides most of the drinking water and power for the City Of San Francisco. I think that I can achieve my goals by using what I learn in this lab and applying them to my career. Every piece of information that I pick up from this class and my other classes is suppose to help my develop my mind to think like an Engineer and to have the ability to problem solve. I also find some of the topics in this lab and also Physics 240 interesting because it explainms how something works, for say a refrigerator"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2521,"One of my goals is to hopefully a develop a passion for physics and enjoy its beauty more since it does describe the world around us. What is very interesting is that it seems like I have always been a math person but for some reason, physics was never my thing despite physics being a subset of mathematics. I think this class can help me achieve these goals because the simulations are very good visual aids in helping me understand how the concepts actually work in a process. It always seemed like the calculations in physics were super easy but conceptually understanding everything was the most difficult part. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2525,One of my goals this semester is to stay focused and stay on track with all my school work. i think this class will help me achieve this goal because our physics lab is based on what we learn in our lecture so it is very important to make sure i understand what I'm doing in that class because it will help me a lot in this class. I also want one of my goals to be able to recall certain ideas and concepts within physics so it's easier for me to understand what I'm dealing with. this class will help me by helping my understanding of physics. lately online class has been really tough when it comes to staying focusing and making these goals will help me want to stay focused during class.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2522,"My goals are to become a Mechanical Engineer and to design large scale products to help the world become more technologically advanced. The is class can help me achieve these goals by teaching me about forces, thermodynamics, tension, thermal expansion, and other topics that are necessary for creating things that people would use. For instance, if I wanted to design my own cruise ship, I would need to learn about buoyant forces so that my ship would not sink. If I wanted to build shelters for the homeless, I would need to know about tension and thermal expansion to select the right kind of material that would not expand or contract too much in the changing weather and something that would not melt in the hot sun, and I would also need to know about different tension forces that would insure the shelter does not collapse. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1052,"The goals that I have envisioned are first and for most is to pass all my classes and graduate because thats whats most important to me at the moment. During my last two years in college once my classes settle down more i want to look for for internships in my field and get a head start with expirence, and build my resume. In terms of personal goals I want to maintain a nice physique and stay in shape to keep my mind and body healthy, as well as learning more new recipes on how to cook because someday I would like to move out and have a set of skills ready to take with me. This class can help me achieve my academic goals by explaing thourghly and simply the equations and formulas I would possibly need in future classes. This class is just another step closer to graduate and get my degree in civil engineering. Also because personally physics is interesting and I genuinely enjoy learning new concepts and how our world works so it can help me expand my knowledge."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2512,"My main goal and one that is affected by this class is to graduate from college. To be honest, I don't know exactly where I am going to take the degree I get into the real world quite yet and what exact route I am going to take but for now my main goal is to get my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. This class serves the purpose of helping me along that path as I am currently in the second semester of my sophomore year. As PHYS 240/242 is just one of the required courses that are along the path of getting to my goal of achieving an electrical engineering degree."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2520,"My goals for this semester are to pass my classes, get a better understanding of the basics required for my major and eat healthier. This class can help me with two of these goals. First off, this class is a part of the requirements for my major as an electrical engineering student here at SFSU. This class will help me with collaborating with other students on lab assignments, which is one of the skill sets required in my field. Secondly, it will give me a better understanding of how physics relates to my major and its applications for my field. By passing and understanding this class, I will have a better understanding of my major as a whole, especially with more complex topics that are based on topics covered in physics. Lastly, this will help improve my GPA for my major overall."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2517,"My goals are to graduate relatively on time and this class can help me achieve these goals by passing it. I really need this class as it's required by San Francisco State to have. Although I didn't know why I would need this class in the beginning, I am beginning to see how this class will eventually affect my future career and further achieve higher dreams. I don't really know what else can be said. I don't want to sound like an asshole, I don't really see how besides my future career this class will help achieve any other goal. It's pretty straight forward and it's like a race track only on goal after the start."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2519,"I think my goals right now are kind of askew. of course my goal in school is to graduate with a degree and live a comfortable life with a decent paying job, and of course passing this class will help me do that, but I think my main goals right now are to take care of myself and try to be happy. this is mostly gonna get done by staying on top of my school work, eating healthy, trying to get sunlight, and spending time with my friends and family (socially distanced of course). I think the biggest thing we all need to learn to do during this pandemic is learn to take care of ourselves, when the mind is alone we often self reflect in destructive ways, so making sure that I maintain the right mindset is crucial"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,427,"One big goal I have currently is to get a summer internship. I was supposed to intern somewhere last summer but because of covid none of the places I applied to were open to interns. It's not only important for me to be in the field doing work and seeing how it is, but I also think having previous experience is extremely important especially in the STEM field. Another goal I have is to not fail all of my classes this semester. I don't really get why but this semester my classes have been really hard and a lot of my teachers don't want to listen to the students and how we think the class could be actually helpful to us. I really wouldn't want my GPA to plummet, but I am optimistic. Another goal I have is to have enough time to go outside on walks or runs because i've found them to be really helpful for my mental. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2518,"My overall goal here at San Francisco State is to graduate with a good GPA and find a job that excites me in the field that I’m interested in. I think this class can help me get there by one, helping me communicate with my classmates more frequently, especially with all classes being online now, it’s definitely hard to make connections with others through a screen. So far, I really like the vibe that this class gives me, the professor is genuine with his intent to make sure his students learn exactly what is necessary to make it once we graduate and go in the real world. A lot of what we are learning definitely applies to the field of work that I could possibly be interested in, so understanding the main principle and the reasoning behind it is crucial. I definitely think I have the tools to do this and succeed."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2524,"My goal is to learn physics well. I think physics is very important in life. This class can help me do some small experiments so that I can better understand the principles, and let us discover that there are things that we often encounter in life. The existence of physical knowledge. This is an experiment that can help me learn physics well."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2514,"My main goal right now is to graduate, I wish to graduate soon, the only way I can do that is by doing well in my classes, I should work hard and pay attention to class. It is a bit difficult with zoom, classes, but I will do my best. The way I can get help with this is just to keep teaching the way you teach and helping with labs. I think most of this has to do with me and making sure I stay on top of all my work. I think the most help I can get is just staying on top of my work and making sure I dont have any trouble with the material, other then that the help I can get is help with any questions I have. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2516,"My major goal in life is to be able to use my physics degree that I earn from school to give me a good job later on in life. This class is integral in reaching that goal not only because It is required of me to take it, but also because this lab class teaches important skills that require a hands on approach to dealing with physics questions and problems that I wont get in my lecture course. This class also give us a chance to physically see what these equations do and how they effect the experiments that we work on which is important for being able to fully understand how to use our degree in a scientific environment."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2515,"My goals in this class are mostly to pass and to supplement my understanding of the class material for PHYS 240. The best way I can do that is to be diligent and actually turn in all my work. There is not much very complicated about that, but I should do my best to pay attention and think every question in a lab all the way through. Falling behind will make this very difficult."
