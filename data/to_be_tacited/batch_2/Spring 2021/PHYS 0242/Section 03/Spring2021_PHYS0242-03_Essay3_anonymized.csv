2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2514,"The main thing I see something that I find interesting heat and thermodynamics and the effect they have with cars. I have been interested in cars. I have been interested if it possible to make pistons fire more efficiently with more force. another thing I have been finding interesting if thermal expansion. Again with the use of cars. I do not really have a lot of questions about it, I have just been thinking that it is interesting to have material be able to take such high heats and still prefer properly. But I mainly thought about heat and thermodynamics as use of cars, but I am sure there are many more uses. I am interested to see what other uses heat can be used for and the possible ways that it can be used to better someones life. I guess even looking at the effect heat has of different gas' is interesting also and seeing how molecule weight has to do with the effect on the gas. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2517,"Mass on a spring was one of the few concepts that i actually really enjoyed doing and sadly i wished it was in person but that's not possible. But something as simple as simple harmonic motion with Mass on a spring can affect everyone's life. This can be applied to everyday life, such as how springs are in car suspensions, some uses in bridges, and even something as simple as a bike. The equilibrium of those type of springs can affect suspension which effectively helps your butt literally, and figuratively. But this is as a general as i believe that being its source which is transportation.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,648,"The topic I want to ask a question about is the Carnot Engine. How come we can not produce an engine that has 100 percent efficiency. Well in a perfect world, we would be able to, but the laws of physics and thermodynamics tell us that there is a loss of power or heat within the system when the engine or pump is doing work. We do have real world examples of high efficiency engines, but they will never reach the true efficiency of a Carnot Engine"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2511,"How can we relate heat and phase change of ice and water to real world events?The biggest way I think we can relate heat and phase change of ice and water is to global warming. As the temperature of the world rises, we see the effects of that higher temperature through melting of ice bergs in cold areas such as Antarctica and the Arctic. As we know, I’ve starts changing into water once you rise past 0 degrees Celsius which will cause the sea level to rise and potential flooding to happen. As more severe weather starts happening, when it starts to get colder and all that water sits on the roads, the water will turn back into ice and expand in those cracks of the roads and destroy car roads and freeways."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1052,"A concept from class that I found most interesting was the reflection and refraction and my question is how does this concept help us better understand the speed of light and its light rays. Well to answer this we need to understand how reflection and refraction work. We know that reflection waves hits a surface and bounces off whereas refraction waves goes through a surface or medium.We also know that incident rays will have the same angle as a reflected ray when it bounces of a surface but smaller angle on the refracted medium this is all because of index of refraction how fast can rats enter a medium or light can get through as well as snell's law dictating these angles and what images will convey through certain lenses as well. We know that the speed of light has ray lights that act as waves moves between a media, and its wavelength changes but it's HZ stays the same. So speed of light does not require a medium interestly because the speed of light is always constant in a vacuum. I think this is important in our lives because we are progressive species that want to break the boundaries of our current studies such as having a fast enough vehicle or the proton particle accelerator where they move super fast and in their research has created new forms of particles. This will help continue our goal of progressiveness as well even time traveling we know theoretically faster we go the possibility of time traveling."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2526,"what does thermodynamic equilibrium mean?It is possible for two systems to have different temperatures ( example cup of ice cubes, and a cup of room temperature water)if the two systems are combined the higher temperature system will begin to lower until the temperature of both systems are equal, then the thermodynamic equilibrium takes place when the same temperature exists throughout the system. This topic is significant because the idea that energy flows from hot to cold would seem to be incorrect based on how a person who uses an ice-pak for an injury feels the chill from the ice-pak. this would confuse the idea with energy flowing from cold to hot.From this we can consider how a thermostat works in a house and how their can occur errors if it is placed on a wall that on the opposite side is the outside. the thermostat would then take the temperature of the wall from the outside and the temperature of the wall on the inside to determine if it needs to raise or lower in order to be at the specified temperature set by the user."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2524,"After several weeks of teaching concepts in class or in class, we are all learning the first and second laws of thermodynamics. I think it’s not a big problem to understand it well. All these knowledge can be used in life, such as the first law of thermodynamics. The total energy in remains unchanged. It only converts from one form to another. It exists in our lives. For example, when a car burns gasoline, its energy is converted into power. Push the car forward. The essence of the second law of thermodynamics is the principle of entropy increase. Adiabatic and irreversible processes are the conditions of the principle of entropy increase. I think there are many representative examples in our lives. For example, heat is transferred from a high-temperature object to a low-temperature object, or water flows to a low place, and the gas expands from high pressure to low pressure."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,427,"I don't really have any questions, but I think this weeks topic of sound waves is really interesting. Many people know when they play an instrument, a sound will be produced. I think what's really interesting though, is how temperature changes the frequency and wavelength of a sound wave. Knowing this, I think its super cool how concerts that are outdoors come to be. I feel like they probably have specific people that are in charge of making sure the sound comes out right at all times. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,444,"How does a PV diagram work and its connection to the First Law of Thermodynamics?In the First Law of Thermodynamics, PV diagrams is a pressure and volume graph and a cyclic process. These PV diagrams are used to determine the change of volume and pressure in a system. As well it can determine the work done of a system, when graphed the space under the curve represents this work done. During our lab we had to sketch the process of a piston locked in place, immersed in a mixture of water and ice. As its immersed the piston moved slowly. We had to draw out a PV diagram to show how the work done by the piston is positive because the work done by the gas is negative. Outside of the physics lab I believe we can use a PV diagram when we put a gas under certain restrictions or change certain things for example when boiling water in the stove and closing its lid. On this kind of process the net work equals the area enclosed on the system."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2512,"For me, one of the things I had a question on was from the chapter of Maxwell and Boltzmann's understanding of how based on the structure of molecules alters the energy of the system and the equation attached to it. I say this as I for a while before looking into it and understanding it wasn't sure how this made sense as I used to think and wonder why this is since molecules move freely in all directions at the molecular level. However, although that is true that doesn't account for and or pertain to this topic exactly as Energy Equipartaiion is all about rotation, translation, and the vibration of molecules. So based on these factors each degree of freedom accounts for (1/2)K_bT. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2515,"During this semester we have gone over the different gas properties and more specifically the ideal gas law. I believe that the ideal gas law is very important to understand even at a basic level because it describes how we interact with the fluid that is the most often around us, gas. I believe a good question to ask about the ideal gas law is does it also apply to gases in the vacuum of space, like for the astronauts in the ISS. Does gas act the same for them as it does down here? From what I can tell this has to be the case, as fundamental laws of physics should apply throughout the universe, not just on earth. Sometimes they do not apply when we get very very small in the world, but that is called quantum dynamics, or modern physics, and I do not know enough about that yet to really understand it at all? At my current levels of understanding, it seems to me that pressure, volume, and temperature act the same down here on earth as they do up in the ISS. This is at least my understanding from reading the textbook and doing an activity on buoyancy in my 240 section. This information seems also applicable of earth for people who scuba dive. Air acts the same, but the immense pressure as people dive deeper down needs to be accounted for, and the ideal gas law seems like it applies here."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2521,"My question is regarding the concept of sound waves, and it asks, ""how does the temperature relate to the frequency of a sound?"" We can answer this by analyzing the topics we learned in class. The speed of sound actually depends on the temperature directly, and, in turn, the frequencies of a sound all depend on the speed of sound. This can be applied to real life if we wanted to find the frequency of a sound, but all we knew was its temperature. If we wanted to find the exact numerical value for the frequency, we could use the formulas and tools that were taught to us in class in order to do so. Given the temperature, we can determine the speed of sound by using the speed of sound formula, and using the obtained speed of sound, we can use this to find the frequency using the frequency formula, however, we would also have to find the length of our given space, which we could find by using a measuring tape or other measuring device. Finding exact numerical values of frequencies can be very beneficial to society since we can then find an exact frequency where a certain person experiences pain in their ears and we will know at what frequency does the pain start."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2525,"I will be writing about dampingThe question I have is why do we use damping on springs in systems?The reason why we use damping on springs in a system is to be able to control the springs at a certain level. this can be helpful when you're buying a car. For example, I have a suburban that is meant for hauling large loads in the back, the damping used in the suspension system allows the car to move easily over bumps in the road to even out the outcome and allow me not to worry about the stuff in the back flying around. think of it as one of those really expensive camera rigs that hold the camera steady while the camera man moves. it's like that but for cars. the wheels will move but the car bed will feel less movement."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2518,"Something that didn't quite make sense to me the first time I heard of it made me formulate this question. If a piston is pushing down to compress a gas, what is the work done on the piston and the gas? When a piston is pushing down to compress a gas, there is an external force present that is putting in work to push the piston. So, the work done on the piston is negative, because without the external force, the piston would not move. The gas is just sitting there in the chamber and receives the work done by the external force and results in an increase in pressure because the gas has nowhere to go with the decrease in volume. So, the work done on the gas is positive. I think the reason for the confusion would be that understanding how, without the presence of the external force to put in work to the system, then the system will maintain equilibrium. We also need to take into consideration what the system looks like, is there any thermal isolation happening, because if that is the case, then there are going to be a few changes, like the temperature will not dissipate into the atmosphere, rather it will be trapped and the temperature of the gas will increase as a result.  "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2523,"Why do boats not sink in the ocean? This is due to the buoyant force. Buoyant force is described as an object that is somewhat or completely submerged into water and the displacement of the liquid weight is equal to the buoyant force. With this concept one has to understand density as well. Density is described as the mass over volume. When looking at boats, we look at the body of water and that total volume compared to the boat's buoyant force in the water. The boat's mass and volume is only a tiny portion compared to the ocean’s mass and volume. When comparing two objects a person must look at the mass and volume and the density of the two as well. Then from there they will be able to determine if that object can float or sink within the liquid."
