2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2519,"I think that before online learning, I wasn't doing things to take care of myself, because I had things that I could do make me happy and compensate for when things got tough. now that we're in the thick of online school, it's been a lot harder to stay motivated to do school work and show up to class. sometimes it feels hopeless, like a waste of time. I think that in these times i've really tried to prioritize taking care of myself, whether it's get enough sleep, or do things I enjoy, and not worry about school as much. sure, i should do my best to pass my classes and do good on the tests, but also that I shouldn't lose sleep over a late assignment. we really need to understand how important mental health is. it's difficult when you are the only one looking out for yourself, but that means it's also only on you to determine how you feel about things, not anyone else."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2524,"I think online learning has little effect on me. I think the only effect is that it is too boring, I can only study at home, not chat with classmates. My concern for school is when to start school and I want to go back to school. My self-care is to get up and eat breakfast every day and go for a run to keep my body healthy. I look forward to the day when I return to school."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2525,"online classes have impacted my learning in many ways. first, it has taught me how to use any resources i can that are not cheating to help learn and sometimes it gets hard because i feel like im teaching myself a lot of the concepts. classes have also become harder which i dont understand. for self care, i try to do a lot of my work in the begining of the week so i have the weekend all to myself and allow myself to relax and get ready for the new week. ive also been talking with other class mates and friends and we check up on each other and help one another in anyway we can."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2511,"Online classes have really made me comfortable at home and give me more time to take care of myself. Instead of having to wake up super early to catch an 8am, I can relax for a bit when I wake up and not have to rush straight to a class because I have a few classes that are asynchronous. In terms of learning though, I tend to take advantage of that and push everything until last minute and then I’m cramming towards the end instead of dividing my time properly. I think it is  all just a matter of getting used to because some day the future may look like this again and we’ll have to adapt so I might as well get a head start on it."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2523,"Online classes have been different being online, but I believe that it is up to the student and the professor to determine how impactful it can be. Being online for some courses has been a breeze, but for others it has been more stressful. Some professors haven’t made being online as easy for others. And especially labs, (not physics) have been difficult to learn the material online. Engineering labs, we do not get the hands on experience that we need for the future. I liked the physics lab this semester. I thought it was well organized and that definitely makes a difference. Some concerns I have would be that my screen time has increased drastically. I even had to update my prescription glasses and get a blue tint for them as well. I feel that with online classes, a student always feels that they are missing something. Even when they are up to date and have everything in, there is still a worry that something isn’t. Some self care things I have done is that when I have my free time, I try to do something that isn’t technology and that helps."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,444,"Online classes have impacted my learning now in a better way. I feel that I have gotten used to just being at home and scheduling when to do my homework. It is a bit difficult to work on essays because being at home, it makes me a bit lazy to type out papers. I do miss being physically at school surrounded by the outside but it feels okay being comfortable at home. To self care I'm sleeping a bit more, taking breaks meanwhile I've done a lot of work and this is something new that I have never done. As well watching tv shows and working has helped to relax and self-care. As of now I have no concerns over my learning. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2515,"Describe how online classes have impacted your learning and what you are doing for self-care. What concerns do you have for your learning and your well-being?Online classes have been somewhat difficult to keep myself accountable in regards to coming to class and socializing with my classmates. It has been very very easy to cut myself off from people in an attempt to focus on my studies, which is not the healthiest way to live but at least has been good for my GPA?The best thing I've been doing for my own self-care is doing my best to keep myself to a somewhat strict schedule while also being forgiving on myself when I fall short of my expectations and need to take a break. Scheduling in breaks sounds a little silly, but has actually been quite helpful. My main concerns are that I tend to go too heavily in either direction, either only working or never working, and this difficulty with keeping myself accountable in virtual learning and not leaning on people to help each other through the course means this is... rough. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2526,"Some impacts of online class learning have been not being able to get the enjoyment of passing by other like minded individuals on campus, while also enjoying the setting of the resting between classes in the Cesar Chavez building which I did almost everyday in between my classes to feel and see others working on school work around me or conversing with other students. But some self car I have been able to implement over the last year is spending more time with my younger brothers, while we all say restricted to spending our school day at home. I have also been able to build more confidence while working and completing assignments as an individual, spending more time finding the right style of studying to achieve success in my classwork. Now in my free time I play a lot more video games then I did before which has let me find a semi-relaxing environment to spend time with my friends. I have had no concerns about my well-being during online learning over the last year."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2518,"I am definitely one of those students who enjoys coming to class because I can pay attention much better and actively participate with the professor and other classmates. I was never one who likes to take online classes, the only one online class I took was at community college and I dropped it after the second week because I just didn't like the structure of how online classes were set up at the time. Now, with only online being the only choice, I've kinda learned to deal with it, even though it is not the best scenario for learning, but there are some positives to it. I live in San Jose and was commuting every morning to school, which honestly wasn't too bad but day after day it kind of drained me out. I liked going to campus because I'd be there all day, as I'd set up my schedule so that I wouldn't have too big of gaps, and the gaps that I did have would be either getting food or going to the library to do some work. I feel like at school I would definitely have more concentration when doing my homework compared to at home. In the library I'd put my headphones in and go to work, but at home there's just too many distractions for me to focus. Especially in those long lectures where it can already be a little hard to stay focused, it's gotten even more difficult to pay attention. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2521,"Online classes have been pretty rough in terms of motivation and learning. I do enjoy both our physics class and lab since I feel like I am learning a lot and the workload isn't insane, but my other classes have been a different story. I find myself getting very distracted very easily as well as struggling to find motivation to get assignments done as well as study for tests because I'm pretty much all alone in my room every single day and didn't have the pleasure of being in a real classroom surrounded by other students who I could relate to. Being around other students in person definitely helps me stay motivated and it actually almost makes me a perfect student since I get everything done on time to the best of my ability. The concerns I may have involve me getting screen fatigue since I have been staring at my computer screen for hours and days on end which definitely fatigues me. I also try to give myself breaks just so I don't always feel like a pile of work is on me at all times. I am definitely very excited to return back to campus in the fall so that I can reach my fullest potential that I had initially been progressing well towards."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2516,Honestly online classes have drained me more than in person classes. I feel like when we are in person a professor can actually get a feel for how the class is doing because they can actually see our faces and not just look at a black screen why lecturing. its also hard being one of the only people whos willing to speak up in class because It can get really annoying when I have to answer all the questions because then it feels like none of the other people  in class are even trying 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2522,"Online classes have negatively impacted my learning. When school was in person, I used to be very engaged and I actually knew what I was doing most of the time. Now that class is online, I am not as engaged and I am confused more often than not. What I am doing for self-care is cramming all my weekend homework into the week so that I could relax and have all the time to myself on the weekends. Concerns I have about my learning is how much I'll be able to understand in on-campus classes that are reliant on the courses I had to take online. I don't really have any concerns about my well-being."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,648,"Its been weird for me. While I enjoy being at home and get the opportunities to get stuff done between classes, I miss the social atmosphere of being in person. I am hoping that my senior year will be in person, so I can enjoy my final year of school. Studying wise, I am able to do better in my studies at home versus school. I can attribute this to time management and re-watching lectures that are recorded, which gives me a chance to re-absorb information."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2514,"I feel that i have struggled a bit more with online classes, especially in lab classes. I feel that I have not fully been grasping all the knowledge properly. I can not wait to be back on campus, at first I was excited about being out of school, but now I realized its really not that great, I miss being on campus and getting to walk around instead of spending house sitting at a my desk. The small walks between classes was definitely something nice that you did not realize you sometimes need especially after tests of long classes. But something I have been doing is keeping my room clean, it is very east to let it get dirty and I feel keeping it cleans helps me stay motivated to keep up my work and to keep doing what I have to, because it is very easy to just stay in bed all day and forget about school."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2512,"Overall online learning has made classes harder for me, harder to learn and retain information, and made classes and college not as fun of an experience it was when I was on campus. I say this as online it's harder to truly engage with the topics, professors, etc. Simply understanding the topic can be more of a challenge as well as enjoying college as I'm basically just doing homeschool being isolated learning by myself basically. In terms of self-care, I tend to work out quite often whenever I'm not burdened by work as well as play video games so that way I get to talk and play with friends that I'm not able to see in person now either them being back at college or also home online learning due to covid. All and all thought the big things I'm worried about learning and well-being wise are the facts that I feel like when we actually go back to in-person since now I will be heading into upper-division electrical engineering courses, that due to online learning I might not truly be prepared for what's to come in the future and well-being wise just not being able to see friends family, and just socially active in general as although it doesn't seem like a big deal after living through it for a year I think we can all agree that just simple daily interactions with random people, society, nature, etc. are in a way a necessity."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,427,"In terms of self-care I don't think i've been doing much, except on Tuesday's I go to a nearby park and run for a bit and I feel like since I started i've been feeling better mentally. The problem with online classes is that it's really hard to separate my social life with my school life. Since I'm in engineering I only get one weekend day to actually relax and hang out with my friends and family, and during the week I feel like if I take a break I always feel guilty about it and start thinking I could be spending time on homework instead of just sitting there on my phone. I'm thankful I wont have to take summer classes and instead enjoy my summer with family and friends and hopefully an internship at the SF Public Works. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2517,"Online classes have been a blast that's for sure, but along the good there's the bad. Some issues that came along with the online schooling is not being able to socialize as much. Being in my room is just very hard mentally. Only thinking of waking up going to school and going to sleep with some activities in between are very hard. That's not good for anyone but if we had in person lecture then at least i was outside to get some fresh air. Other than mentally learning in this online style i believe is easier as we can immediately start homework and even take a break in sweatpants. The only downfall is teachers aren't that great at responding to emails. So to recap selfcare and general wellbeing has taken a dip but learning is something that's better personally for me."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1052,"Taking online classes has changed the way I view my education and other aspects as well in terms of my own drive and resources. I feel that online school is a grey area and for me if someone has the resources like good wifi and their own room to concentrate in a quiet area it is relatively not bad to do online school. This all goes to waste however if there is no drive online school showed me that although my living situation is not good and I lack resources with my drive I can work through it. It has made me self aware that it's up to me to put in the work and that online school is a reflection of how much you get done with time management. In person school we all have the same resources and time which makes it easier for some students. Personally I love online classes to some extent because it's less distracting and I have time to sleep in a little more workout out and shower later which helps with my overall well being. The few concerns I have for my learning are of course that online classes lack the full comprehension and understanding than online; it's more confusing or vague since no one is there to ask questions a lot or see the pacing of the class. Overall online classes have the advantage of comfort, time and hassle free of commuting but in person classes are superior in overall learning since labs are done better in person and alot more facisiting to learn from."
