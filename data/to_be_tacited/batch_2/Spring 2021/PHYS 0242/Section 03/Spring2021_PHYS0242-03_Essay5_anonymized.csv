2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2526,"this semester in the Physics 242 lab my greatest take away was that online lab work that is normally done in person can still be helpful to understand how these fundamental properties work and how to derive the correct analysis from using simulations of the different topics we learn in lecture and lab. All together the overall comprehensiveness of the class was very detailed and i spent many hours getting the work done on time for the lecture, the lab section was much more oriented to my speed i did complete and turn them in every week but the use of non deadlines was helpful for me not to rush through the material to get it done. I think this lab section has helped me with developing my skills as a student and i will be able to use my knowledge in future classwork."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2511,My greatest takeaway from this class is actually how interesting physics can be and how they apply to real life to make things work. Covering topics of light and lenses make me realize that my vision is terrible and I know why my glasses are shaped the way they are. Learning about the Carnot engine was a great topic too because it helps me come up with ideas for motors and engines in cars and planes which I hope to make a career one day. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,648,The greatest takeaway from this class is that I was able to have a great understanding of the topics from my lecture class. This will better help me excel in my future career a mechanical engineer. I take into account all the simulations that we have done and apply it to my future classes as well
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,427,"One big takeaway I got from this class was that i can always do my work by myself, but it is always better to work with my peers. Not only do you get reassurance when you're uneasy about something, but you also get to ask questions you might be too shy to ask an actual teacher."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2516,My greatest take away from this class is that I need to both manage  my time better and also need to learn how to prioritize because I put this class on the back burner about half way through the semester and now I have to play catch up because I didn't want to do the classes right away. unfortunately this might effect my grade negatively and I just want to say there was never a problem with the class it was always just how lazy online classes have made me feel.  Id also like to apologize for not being present for the last couple of weeks iv just been so stressed out with trying to catch up 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1052,The greatest take away from this class is learning the concepts well through the simulations. In normal classes we learn the theory through boards and visuals but we never actually get to see how they are practically. This is why the simulations help me cement the concepts we learned in class because even though we cant have access to certain equipment that would cost a lot of money we can simulate that and therefore learn from it in an effective way. The thing i liked about the simulations was that we got to play around with values and got to try a lot of what if scenarios really helping understand the topic and whats its tipping point and all that. Overall the class was set up in a way that was very helpful. We got to learn the basics and concepts for a bit in the lab and then try it out for ourselves. My take away from this class is learning mainly how the world works in a scientific way. What might seem simple like what makes things float on water is because of buoyancy or as the temperature increases the particles are moving around at a fast pace. Simple stuff like that makes you more knowledgeable about the world around you and is very fascinating.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2518,"I would say my biggest take away from this class and these classes this whole semester would be to manage my time accordingly with all the work I know I have due. I would say that this semester I did much better at do just that, and my grades and my stress levels have reflected that too. I feel like those weeks when you know you have a lot due at the end of the week, you usually tend to procrastinate to the last minute, and the last day your stuck doing hours or work. I have tried my best so that even though I have a lot of stuff due on say a Friday, when that Friday comes I'm only submitting all the work I already finished throughout the week. Especially with this pandemic, I find myself with a lot of free time. Just this past week I was cleaning my room up and I found my original Gameboy advance and I started playing some Mario because I already had all my work done. I feel like having that time to yourself for you to enjoy is crucial to maintaining a balanced life between school and fun. I only go out with small groups of friends now, and only when I have my work done. I don't really care if I'm home on a Saturday night, as long as my school work is done then everything else can come after. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2522,"My greatest take away from this class is that I was able to understand what I was learning for the most part. Normally I would be incredibly confused in labs, especially the in-person labs, but the simulations helped me understand the curriculum better. Last semester, I also took an online physics lab, but it was very confusing. We only had around five simulations out of the 15 weeks in class, so the time that we did not have simulations was very confusing. In this class, I enjoyed using the simulations because I was able to see how everything works on top of having detailed instructions about how to use them. I was able to fully complete my lab work with little to no confusion and I really liked that I did not have to attempt to do physical labs with no guidance and with materials that I did not have access to."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2515,"My greatest takeaway from this class mostly had to do with the structure of the class and my own engaging with the material. I really like this class format actually, I find the PDF way of doing labs, and the associated simulations to be very helpful with my learning and understanding when it comes to various physics topics. I also really liked this instructor being aware that we are all just going through it right now, and that he gave us leeway on when to turn things in, because we are all busy and just trying our best. I would have preferred to be able to choose our own breakout rooms, I did not like being randomly assigned them, as some rooms were very awkwardly and uncomfortably silent. I like talking out my problems."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2517,My greatest takeaway from this class is how grateful i am to have done experiments online like that. Although i was excited to do some cooler experiment that would have been done in person this is just as good. But by greatest takeaway wasn't solely on the experiments but how the class was taught really felt good. I felt listened to and was responded with genuine answers. I really dont have much more to add about the class other than it was very good and my takeaway was how i felt listen to if there was a problem or even if i did jave one someone in the class braught it up weather it was a lap question or homework question or whatever it was.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2523,"The greatest take away I have from this class, is that the professors are here to help you, not against you. In this course, I feel that the professor has been very understanding during this time. I can tell you the students really appreciate it. Coming into this course I was worried that I would miss something some week and not be able to make it up, and in this course the professor has been very flexible with due dates. I personally do not have the best memory and I forget due dates all the time or I mix them up with different courses. Not having the due date worry has been able to make this course stress free and I enjoyed learning the material in this course. I would say that is the greatest takeaway from this course."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2519,"I think that my biggest take away from this class is general grit. there's been a lot of times in this class where I feel very stuck, or maybe even unmotivated. motivation has been really tricky this semester, as I feel a lot of these online classes are pointless. it's overwhelming with all the school work I have to do while also trying to maintain my mental health. but realistically the only way I've been able to stay on top of my work is to persevere and to push through all the discomfort. It's ok to take some days to yourself, but you also have to stay on top of your responsibilities, so I guess what I'm saying is this class forced me to balance all my work, as well as my happiness. finding the balance is key."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2524,"The biggest gain from this class is that I have gained knowledge that I didn't know before and can use it in life. And most of the knowledge I learned here is related to my electrical engineering major, so I study it very seriously. This makes me feel that I have gained a lot of knowledge that I cannot learn in my life."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2514,"The greatest take away is all the knowledge that I have learned during labs.  I feel that it is difficult to learn online, but it has been really helpful with the way labs have been set up and with at the end having Ilearn labs that made it much easier to understand the information. I think I will use these things a lot in the future as an engineer. Another thing I learned not just from this class but all my classes was to be patient and ready for things to change, it has been hard with zoom classes, but teachers have done their best to help and make it easy for us to continue learning, it has been a huge help that teachers have adapted their classes to online to be able to better help students still learn and still do what they have to do. I know I definitely appreciate the transition. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2512,"For me the greatest takeaway from this class is all the new physics topics that I learned about, sure I will most definitely forget exactly how to solve some if not more of them in the future as they wot apply to me necessarily but still being able to have a general idea of more physics-related topics is always important in expanding my knowledge and continuing along the path of electrical engineering. Throughout the class, I was able to understand topics clearly as they were explained clearly in the lecture portion of the class which from there was able to take that to this portion of the class in order to apply and expand my understanding of these topics and truly get to explore how they apply to the real world through simulations."
