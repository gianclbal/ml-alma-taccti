2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2511,"I chose to go into a stem field because I love cars. My initial goal was to go into an automotive field as a mechanic but then I also gained an interest in aerospace so I decided becoming a mechanical engineer would be the best route to go. Going the mechanical engineer route, I can still land my dream job while maximizing my chances of getting a job because mechanical engineering covers a broad range of careers."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2512,"I want to go into the STEM field because it's where I truly feel that I will enjoy learning about it. I say this as both math and science are and have always been the main subjects in school that have interested in. On the flip side history and English, I've always dreaded and although I still technically good in those subjects, it's just not something that interests me. But besides that for some reason, ever since middle school the engineering field has always been interesting to me. I say this as when I got older and older constantly being asked about my future the first thing I always thought about was myself as some sort of engineer whether it building pieces for a computer to working on giant abstract building designs and making them work. All and all I want to go into STEM because it's where I see and want myself to be in the future."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2513,"My wanting to go into STEM was for two big reasons. One of the reasons was that my high school offered engineering classes. I took all three classes the school offered and really liked engineering from there on out. the other reason is that my brother is an engineer, so he would suggest a lot of the time to see if I were interested in Engineering. He was  a big driving factor to my interest in STEM"
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2514,"I have always wanted to go into the STEm field. I think it was in 4th grade when I fist decided to go into Stem. I was not exactly sure what part of STEM I wanted, fist I thought I wanted to follow a medical rout, so I can help people but then I started to take science classes like biology and I hated it. But then I took math classes, some really basic engineering classes, and I decided to follow the rout of engineering. I want to work in the bio engineering field so I can help people with engineering. I believe that with engineering I should be able to help people and be able to make peoples lives easier. I do hope to be able to work on projects that will make peoples lives easier and simpler. So I guess the main reason I want to be in the STEm field is so I can help people. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2515,"I want to go into a STEM field for a multitude of reasons, but chief among them is I think it suits me best. I have a desire to know how things work and why things are the way they are, and I feel that a desire to always know more and not being content with just being is a core desire of science fields. I do not have much desire to express myself or explore deeper themes on how we connect to one another. I also do not have much interest in history, or political science. I think STEM fields are the most interesting to me, and I can sustain myself in this industry."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,444,"I think I want to go into STEM field because I want to experience new challenges but also create a better future for myself and those around me. Being in STEM takes a lot of work and dedication and I believe I have that, even if I have had some setbacks in my STEM major I know I can learn from them. It will also benefit me in the future to have a good job that can affect the people around me if its figuring out a new cure or a new mechanism I believe it will benefit everyone. Being a woman in a STEM field major encourages me to break the barriers and gaps that there is and it can encourage other women and girls to pursue a STEM major."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2516,I want to go into the stem field because I believe it is important for there to be plenty of young minds doing important research in order for humanity to keep moving forward. I also believe that there should be more brown boys and girls that are doing math and science because it feels like there isn't enough representation in those fields. I want to be a role model for the next generation coming forward too because knowing that there are people who look like me and also have similar life experiences gives me confidence that I can be like them someday and that what I'm doing is possible. 
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2517,I want to go into the STEM field because I have always loved engineering. It has always interested me ever since I was in middle school. That's when I had a slight crisis because I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life highschool and college. It was a college fair of sorts that I had at school and seeing how cool Aerospace Engineers and many other types were was just breathtaking for me and since I loved math it seemed like the perfect route. Although I did initially want to be an Aerospace Engineer and possible work for NASA I didn't get into the college I wanted and San Francisco State didn't have that major. So i switched to my backup because i knew that if anything happened i would need a backup. Luckily I also love Civil Engineering and construction because I would have been very sad. So to sum up I want to be in STEM because that's just where my passion is at.
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2518,"I feel like the most concise explanation as to why I want to go into the STEM field is because of my love for cars and many things mechanical. I get fascinated by working systems that I have never seen before and I love to get my hands dirty and learn about them myself. For instance, many people will do loads of research before they decide to modify their cars, and that is a good thing because that can eliminate the need for trial and error because you are basically copying other people who built their car the same way that you are going to build yours. But that's no fun because I want to be different than the others. So, instead, trial and error is your best friend because I can experiment with different parts that others may say cannot fit my car, or simply will do nothing. From different motor parts, to different transmission gear ratios, to different aerodynamics, I have learned so much about mechanical and electrical systems simply by working, breaking, and fixing my car. Being a car enthusiast, you learn that it is very easy for you to copy other peoples style, and even vice versa, simply because there are so many enthusiasts in the world that enjoy wrenching on their cars just as much as I do. But, by trying new things and getting your hands dirty with parts that have not been tested before is the best part, because in the end it's all up to you if it will work or fail. So to sum up, the reason why I want to go into the STEM field is simply because I love to be hands on with what I am learning and I will not stop until I understand the concept being shown to me, which I think is a great trait for the workforce in the future. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2519,"I want to go into the stem field to give myself the best chance possible to live a comfortable life. I think that I have a good skillset in math, and the best thing I can do for myself is to choose a career that will generate a substantial income. I view work as work, it's going to be hard and tedious but it doesn't need to be my passion. my passion at the moment is music, and I'm still able to do that and enjoy it without feeling like i need to make it my life. I think that engineering is going to be enjoyable as well because I like to build things, and I like to solve problems, both of which are used in stem."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2520,"My entire life, I have always wanted to pursue a career in the STEM field. As a child, I initially wanted to become a doctor. When I graduated from high school, I changed my mind to an engineer. I still wasn’t sure which type of engineer, though. At community college, I chose biomedical engineer. Then, I learned that I would need a PhD to get a job in that field. So, I switched to mechanical engineering, but that bored me. I discovered electrical engineering after I randomly choose an electronics class. I took another, and another. Eventually, I switched my major to electrical engineering because I loved electronics. I enjoy it because I get to critically think and build things with my hands like a Morse code reader and a cat robot that avoids obstacles."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2521,"The reason why I want to go into the STEM field was because I initially fell in love with mathematics and mathematics has been known to be the queen of the sciences. I used to despise the other sciences but after coming to the realization that math is my passion, I decided that perhaps science as a whole is also my passion. I'm still unsure if science as a whole is my passion, but I do think it's fascinating enough for me to develop a passion for it, considering that sometimes I feel like I need to be a master at a subject in order to say that I'm passionate about it, when really just being interested in the subject is enough. This is why I chose applied mathematics as my major, because I wanted to study math but also study their applications to other fields such as physics, computer science, and engineering, which all literally fall into the STEM category. In particular, physics seems amazing as a subject, so it's very convenient that I get to study physics while being a math major since I'm able to get a glimpse of other sciences that were built on math."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,427,"To preface this my dad is an architect and he used to also be a general contractor, but ever since I could remember I really liked following him around and going with him to his job sites and what not. I really liked being bale to watch the process of seeing houses being made or just having additions put into them. Since I am a first generation person, I really wanted to do something that would make my parents proud (although they would be proud of literally anything I do lol) so i chose engineering. In all honesty I've never gravitated to something other than building and animals, but I knew veterinary wouldn't be for me considering I don't like bio as much, which is why I chose civil engineering. "
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2522,"I want to go into the STEM field because ever since I was little, I was always drawn to how things work, I loved building and bringing my ideas to life, and nothing else interested me as much. From a young age, I was already helping my dad build some furniture, fix things around the house, and buying toys that I could build on my own. In high school, I took engineering electives and went to STEM camp, and I really enjoyed every second of it; that was when I decided I wanted to build my career around STEM. I am the type of person to not really be that passionate about anything, but when I have an idea, draw it out, and design it using CAD software and use my 3D printer to bring everything I think of to life, it's like all my dormant passion becomes alive. This is something I really enjoy and I can't see myself doing anything else in the future."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,648,"I want to enter the STEM field because I like creating things and anything mechanical. Naturally that's why I am pursuing an Engineering degree. My goal is to work in Aerospace designing airplanes and aviation systems. I never really cared for Math, so It has been always a struggle since High School. But, I am willing to always learn and I think that is a vital part of wanting to go into the Stem Field. I look forward to expanding my mind throughout my career and never stop learning."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2523,"Ever since I was little I knew I wanted to be an engineer. I would constantly play with legos and build whatever I could out of the materials I had. I would take recyclable things and make houses to scale. I always enjoyed building and understanding the concepts that come with it. When I heard the term I knew I had to be an engineer. In high school, I got to go through an engineering program that ensured I was going into the right field. When people ask me why I want to be an engineer, I say I enjoy it. It has always been a part of my life. I will be a first generation college student and engineer in my family. I also would like to go into structural engineering for my masters as well. I will soon be applying for the scholar program at state for that program to start my masters my senior year of my bachelors."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2524,"As you begin to investigate what major you should pursue, you might find yourself drawn a STEM major. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) majors field of study. STEM majors of are diverse, challenging, and offer a wide array of opportunities.Pursuing a STEM major will allow you a wide variety of future opportunities after graduation. For example, pursuing an engineering major opens many doors; a graduate can seek a career in such diverse fields as chemical engineering, computer science, or environmental science. There are many different areas of specialization within any STEM major. When a student graduates with a strong undergraduate degree, she is preparing herself for any future changes in her chosen field. It is impossible to predict what the future holds. Consider Aerospace Engineering – from day one, students are immersed in hands on opportunities such as thermal energy, mechanics, and rocket propulsion. These experiences not only prepare students for the current workforce, but give them the tools and skills necessary to help evolve their field of study far into the future.Everyday life is constantly affected by professionals from STEM programs. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics play a role in everything from creating new ways to promote aquaculture to the design of a bridge by a civil engineer. Being on the cusp of modern technology and using a STEM education benefits the world and has an important impact on both local, national, and global matters."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,2525,"i wanted to go into the STEM field because not only are there so many career paths to choose from, I find most of the things we learn very interesting. It wasn't my plan to go into engineering, i think that it fell into my lap because I am surrounded by many engineers ranging from civil engineering to computer engineering. As a kid I always loved using my hands and building things with my dad. I was also told that I have half the mindset of an engineer which may sound bad but it isn't. my mom is a nurse and she says that her engineering patients are the absolute worse... because they fixate one one possible outcome and always have their head in a box (that isn't a bad thing when it comes to engineering bc that's how most things work) but also as an artist, my creative skills allow me to think outside the box and come up with different ways to solve a problem."
2021,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,1052,Looking back in high school my mentors son who majored in engineering became a huge inspiration to me because i always had an idea that stem is hard but he had a way with words that made me motivated to do it. If it wasnt for him Id problably be in film or cinema but thanks to him I found enjoyment out of this. Personally the beginning classes of stem are boring just because their there to set a fundation but as I progress they become more practical and more fun because you get to see what its actually like you just need to get pass certain humps to get there. out of all the careers out there this one felt right I honestly cant see myself in any other maybe nursing or some type of doctor but other than that stem is where its at and the world is progressing so why fall behind.
