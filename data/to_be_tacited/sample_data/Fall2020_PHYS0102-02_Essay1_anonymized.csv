Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1,"Reflection #1: Why Am I Here?   “Why am I here?” is quite a general question that can be taken in many directions, but I assume   that it is intended for us to make our connections to this class. For me personally, I am taking   physics 101 and 102, because as a kinesiology major it is something that we need to know in our   field of study. More specifically, my goal is to become a sports physical therapist and work to   rehabilitate athletes, so dealing with physics and its relationship with the human body is going to   be a big component of my job. Sports have always been a big part of my life ever since I was in   elementary school and I have played in a couple basketball leagues growing up. This fascination   with sports turned into an interest in health and fitness as well, which led me down the path of   kinesiology. Particularly, it was all the injuries that I have been through over the years that really   made me want to become a physical therapist and help others who may be going through any   injuries they may experience in their lifetime."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,2,"I am here because my future goal is to heal people. I am taking this course as a prereq for the   Kin major. I would like to become a physical therapist, specifically for athletes. I am very   passionate about sports and being in that atmosphere will keep me motivated and able to   understand the physical and mental struggles that athletes go through."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,3,"Reflection: At the moment I am feeling very stressed. I have a lot of things to coordinate such as school, my jons, and practicing soccer in my off time. My family has also been bugging me with orders and questions that I don’t have the answers for. It is not so bad though, I have no health issues and I just got a new tattoo. This school year has been quite an interesting one with having so much zoom involved in my everyday life now. I never imagined my first year at a university like this, but here we are. I hope the virus becomes more manageable soon and we can all pursue the things we like doing again. I feel like that would take a lot of stress off everyone’s shoulders and more money in their pockets hopefully. Being in the house this much is a struggle ,but again it could always be worse."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,4,"Holly Enrile PHYSICS LAB Reﬂection#1 Sept. 10, 2020 I am here because it is a requirement for my major and I think Physics is a really cool subject to learn. To have knowledge about the way things work and relate to each other is a powerful skill.  In general, I’m in school because I want to make my parents proud and break the generational cycle. I will be ﬁrst generation university graduate. I am also a mother of 2 who I want to set a good example for and that hard work does and will pay oﬀ. There will be many obstacles, especially during this time with all the stuﬀ going in the world today but with grit and growth mindsets, we all can persevere and get through it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,5,Karla Martinez  Why I am here?  One of the main reasons why I am here is because I want to help my family. I want to have the opportunity to have a stable job and be able to support my family economically. I am also here because I want to have the opportunity to finish college something that my parents were not able to do it because they didn’t have the money or the support. I want to be the first one from my family to graduate from college. I am also here because I want to be a nurse. I always wanted to study medicine and help people. Become a nurse has always been my dream job and I hope to make it real even though sometimes is hard to keep going but not impossible.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,6,"Why am I here? I am here in this lab because, honestly, there wasn’t any other lab that was available for me to take. But also because science has always been my favorite subject and so taking a physics lab interested me a lot more than other labs that were available. I am here at college because the career choices I want to take, require me to to get a degree in Biology and also, more importantly, because my parents have sacrificed a lot to make it in this country as far as they could have and they would want me to be better off than they are. And to be honest, I am here because there is nothing else for me to do besides work, especially because of the whole pandemic situation that is going on, this helps to further progress my study, as well as help occupy my time."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,7,Jose Castillo       Reflection     Honestly I’m only here because is part of my requirement for my major. Also part of it is   for my mom I’m only here because i’m just trying to make her proud and also make myself   proud that I can get a degree. Not going to lie sometimes I don’t feel like I can just because most   of the classes are hard and especially doing every class online makes it harder for me. Honestly   don’t even know how long i’m going to be here it really depends how much effort in time I   actually put in all my classes. Hopefully i’m able to graduated in 4 years just because I do want   to work for my master degree in the future I feel like it’s going to benefit me and especially for   my mom and family. Overall taking this class and so many other labs it’s not bad I mean i don’t   usually do good but it does help you learned new things that you haven’t before and that’s   something i’m trying to expend my mindset and what I can get out of in order to help me in the   long run.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,8,
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,9,"The reason I believe that I am here is to help people, I believe that I was gifted with an extreme   level of compassion for people and a strong desire to serve the populus I believe the best way   that I can do that is through medicine and learning about the body. While attending school and   pursuing higher education I believe that I can help people by teaching them the foundations of   healthy choices and habits and how to maintain health in order to achieve confidence in their   own frames. From a young age I always had a passion for health and fitness and this has   evolved into a passion for health and medicine later on in my life. My approach to medicine is a   holistic approach which I believe is the best approach because it doesn’t solely focus on   prescribing medication and sending people on their ways, rather it focuses on pushing health   and taking care of the person as a whole in order to ensure that I left them better then when   they came to me rather than just temporarily fixing one problem while inducing another one."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,10,"I am here because I am a pre-kinesiology major and it is a prerequisite for my major.  I am a pre-kinesiology major hopefully a kinesiology major next fall because I hope to be a physical therapist in the near future. I am taking this class because I am also in physics lecture and intriguing and it seemed interesting. I hope to get knowledge from this class that will better prepare myself for the kinesiology courses I will be needing to take next school year. I am trying to get all my general education courses as well as a few pre-requisite courses because I am also interested in getting a business minor, so I need to try to get everything out of the way as soon as possible to be able to graduate on time and hopefully get into a graduate physical therapy school."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,11,"Estefan Dinarte   9/10/2020   PHYS 102     “Why Am I Here”     I am  here because I would like to fu rther my knowledge and education. My major is Kinesiology  and Physics is a pre -requisite  for m y end goal of be coming  a Physical Therapist.  I also enjoy the  team - work an d bondi ng aspect s of lab because it is a great way to make new friends an d connections. Physics  will teach me interesting and useful knowledge like motion and behavior through space and time , and  the related entities of energy and force.  Being here is also important for my growth and development.  Without educati on and a diploma to show for it,  it is difficult to find a stable job and have that financial  freedom.  All in all, I am here because it is a pre -requisite but I also enjo y the ext ra knowledge to further  enhance my brain."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,12,"I think the reason that I am here is to complete my physics classes. I took the lecture last   semester and I did just fine in that class, although it sucked that I had to finish that class online.   That is what screwed my grade up last minute. Other than that I don’t know why I am here other   than that. I do like physics, at least basic physics, and if I were to pursue a higher level of   physics with trigonometry and things like that, my brain would honestly explode. But taking this   level of physics isn’t too bad. I’m excited to see what is in store for this lab. I should be able to   apply what I learned from last semester into this class and maybe help some people out if they   are stuck. 5 minutes to talk about why I think I am here.. Uhh, OH I would like to be able to   apply the labs into real life especially because I think this lab would help me in my major which   is Kinesiology. I think being able to apply that into the field of Kinesiology would be huge   because we study range of motion and the movements of the body."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,13,"I am in physics 101/102 to learn about physics, and how the natural world around me works. This could help me simply better understand every day experiences but ultimately will help me in my future career as a physical therapist. Under standing motion, gravity, velocity, rebound, etc. will help me safely help people rehabilitate using the movement of their bodies, and various fitness equipment. I’m at SFSU because I want a degree. I’ve been in the workforce on the recruitment side, and in the Bay Area I see how recruiters skim resumes, and if a degree isn’t on there, they go to the bottom of the pile. The few people who make it through on experience alone typically get paid less, and even more so if they’re female. I want a degree in kinesiology because I want to pursue becoming a physical therapist. What attracts me most about physical therapy is the job description includes many of the things I like and the skills I have proficiency in, as well as allows for my failings. I love working one on one with people, but I also have a hard time with doing the 9-5 gig. I need flexible hours. I need both structure and freedom. Clear instructions of what I should/shouldn’t do, but then to be allowed to do so without micromanagement. Point and case, my cat sitting on my printer glaring at me because he wants something from me. He thinks I’m here to feed, pet, or amuse him, at his discretion only."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,14,Why am I here? I am here in this class because it is a pre requisite for my major. I guess in the grand scheme of things I am just here on this by chance. I think I am just the sum of all these random chances and probabilities. I also think I am here based on my past experiences. If I hadn’t taken one speciﬁc class in high school by chance then I would not be pursuing the career I am right now. I also think I would not be here at this school to even be taking this class in the ﬁrst place. I think I am here from a combination of chances and choices.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,15,"I am here before of my family; I want to make them proud showing them my accomplishments and being the best, I can. Also, I am here for myself knowing the life I want to live and that I'm going to chase my dreams staying dedicated. Additionally, I am here because I want to major in Kinesiology and became a Sports Medicine Physician/Therapist or an Athletic Trainer for a Professional Sports Team. One thing that routed me to that career field was being involved with sports my whole life up until high school. In Science I really enjoy learning about that body and health of science because I feel in life your well-being is the most important thing to worry about. Really wish we could be in person because I am a hands-on learner, so I like actually like doing the experiments. Learning about that and being able to help another person life is success and providing for the community around."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,16,Milka Abdosh         Why am I here?     I believe that I am here because I want to be successful. I want to be able to support my parents   and have a career. Most people won’t want to take care of their parents but I believe I owe it to   them to be as money motivated and goal striving as possible. Taking this physics class is the   building block for my success because I need this class to graduate. I have been in school for a   while and I am looking forward to be able to start my career and travel the world (once the   pandemic is over).
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,17,Why am I here?     I am here because I have to be. I am here because I was careless. I am here because I   put it off to the last second. I am here because I made mistakes. I am here because I   want to do better. I am here because I am human. I am here because I put wants over   needs. I am here because I need to be. I am here because I should be.    
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,18,"Why am I here?   I am where I am due making tons of different decisions that all made sense at the time. Feeding   bad habits starting in middle school through high school, deciding to postpone getting a degree   after highschool since I didn’t have real academic interests, choosing to start in community   college to do general education classes. I used to think that there wasn’t a real place for me in   school and barely skated by in it, and now I’m making up for where I was before. At this   moment I’ve found things that interest me. Through learning about the body and how to get   stronger I’ve also found reasons to be more connected to this world and other people. By   listening to myself more I’ve been able to find a path to move forward on."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,19,"Week 3 Reflection:   Why am I here?     College is a place where you can further your knowledge and learn new skills. I’m here because I   want to become either a physical therapist or an occupational therapist. In order to get there, I   need to graduate from college with a bachelor’s degree. As a kinesiology major, I need to fulfill   many prerequisites and physics is just one of them. Physics is one of the basic sciences I need to   learn about since it is useful in understanding how much force a patient is able to exert or in   measuring a range of motion."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,20,"Patrick Bialy  Reflection #1  Why am I here?  	I am in this physics because it is a class I have to take to satisfy my major requirements. I am currently a Kinesiology major that recently switched from pre-nursing. I am pursuing this major because I have had a lot of experience with the healthcare industry, my mom being a nurse and my sister a doctor. During my countless hours volunteering at hospitals to the countless hours being admitted, I feel like I would be comfortable to pursue a career. I is a hard goal to achieve but hopefully my passion can drive me to my destination. I am currently at Sf State, in the beautiful city of San Francisco. I chose this school because of the city and the constant chilly weather. On my free time, I am a pretty avid photographer and the city is perfect for just that. This is why I am here."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,21,"Why am I here? I'm currently enrolled in both physics lecture and lab. I'm here in physics lab because I need to take this lab for my requirement for Kinesiology . Since this is a broad paper about why we are here, I'm not sure if we’re supposed to be talking about here as in physics lab or here as in what our purpose in this world is. But since I'm not sure, I’ll talk about both. As I mentioned earlier I’m here because I need to take physics in as a course for my Kinesiology degree. Now talking about in general, I feel like my purpose in this world is to make a positive impact on people’ s lives. One of the reasons why I feel like I’m here in this world is to spread love and positivity . I feel like I’m here to make the people I love and the people around me live their life to the fullest. Another reason why I feel like I’m here is to further my education and career . To keep striving at being a better person each and every day . Overall, I feel like I have many reasons and ways to answer “why am I here” but those are just a few to mention."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,22,"Austin Noriega   9/10/2020   Phys 102   Reflection #1: Why am I here?   I am here for a multitude of reasons. I think firstly that I had a good time learning   physics in high school, so I already had an interest in this so I can also complete my   requirements to graduate. But for San Francisco State as a whole, the reason that I   applied to attend was that I needed something different from the consistencies and the   same things that I had left in San Jose. Dorming at San Francisco gave me an   opportunity to explore more of the things around me, and myself. I went to college so I   get an education about the things that I will need for my future careers inside of the   business field. As a first generation college student, my passing through college is not   only for me, but for my family as well. I am here for my growth and learning so I can be   better than I was before this class."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,23,"Lishen Hu     Reflection #1     I am here to pursue and explore new options. Honestly, I don’t know what I want to do in life yet   and I’m here to find out. This is the first physics class I have ever taken so I am interested in   how it is like. The only thing I have experience with physics in it is tv shows. I don’t know how   this class will be online but I hope it is fun. Will there be any hand-on project or all these all   labs? So far, I am having fun with this class. I seem to understand what type of work we have to   do and what labs are. It seems pretty simple so far but I am taking a lot of classes.This class   seems fun so far experimenting with stuff."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,24,"Reflection  #1  “Why Am I Here? ” N. Velez      I’m quite literally here in this class because I took physic s before but  didn’t  pass with a  grade I wante d. The physic s class I previousl y took was Phys 111, and our tea cher was not great.  To put it simply, she could not teac h if her life depended on it. She had a very thick accent,  which made it very hard to understand her, b ut she was also very unor ganized , writing randomly  on the b oard and jumping around with her topics. I can go on for a while  abou t her sub -par  teaching ; to put it in perspective, the class st arted with about 50 students, and event ually it  trickled down to  about 15 by the 2nd half of the seme ster. I somehow still passed the class with a  D even aft er I didn’t show up for th e last three week s of class or the final , which tells me the  school threw a massive curve for the students . I’m not  happy with the D grade and think it was  unfair th at I got such a bad learning exper ience, so here I am taking Phys 101 /102 to replace it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,25,"Emily Pham     09/10/20   Physics 102   Reflection     I am here because I wish to learn more about how the world works in a way. I   didn’t realize it before but physics requires gathering lots of data which is pertinent to   many other scenarios. Other scenarios that require gathering evidence would be cops,   forensic scientists, and much more because at the end of the day you need evidence to   back up the claim that you’re making. Physics is so essential to us in even the smallest   ways yet we don’t even realize it because we typically assume that physics is such a   complicated concept about motion. However, the reality is that the field of physics is   quite versatile because it’s a mixture of using our knowledge/common sense with new   information to solve a question. I used to actually brush off the idea of doing anything   related to physics because I always thought of it as a confusing concept about how things   move or happen."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,26,Why am I here?  I think I am here because I am passionate about connecting with people. I try and make small connections and interactions as personal as I can in hopes of creating a bond that can create joy in my life. There is really nothing comparable to the feeling of just bonding with someone and feeling as though your two personalities are perfect together. Relationships are incredibly important to me. I have friends now that I’ve known since the 7th grade because we all value the strong bond that we have created together. Having people that I know I can rely on for anything at any time provides me with a sense of security that I feel is impossible to find in other things. The amount of genuine joy and fulfillment I get from existing in the same time period as some of my amazing friends and family really is what drives me in life… and I think that’s why I am here.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,27,"Elena Mena  “Why am I here”   I am here because this is a required class for my major. I am a kinesiology major and physics is one of the required classes to take. To be frank, I am not very interested in physics but I hope that changes by the end of the semester. I have heard that physics is not as hard as some of the previous science classes I have had to take for my major. In that case, I am very relieved. My intentions with this class is to actually learn and pass with an A. I am very dedicated to my studies. I always do the best of my capabilities yet I do allow myself to take a breath, when needed. I am passionate about my end goal with my degree but I do not think I am specifically passionate about physics. I have a general idea of the concept of physics but I am sure throughout this class, that will change."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,28,"Jordaan Render Phys 102 Reflection 1 Why am I here?  I am here because I want to receive a quality education around a new group of people and further my academic career as well as personal character development. I chose SFSU because it is a new school in a new city and I thoroughly enjoy meeting new people. I was born in Germany and grew up across the United States on different military bases. Moving around a lot made it easier for me to become an adaptable person and see the culture differences within our own country. I would like to use my background in a way that allows me to me travel and connect with many different people from differing cultures and really gain a broader view on life. I started my college career as a political science major because I used to aspire to be a politician, but later decided that was not the path for me. I subsequently chose computer science because the sciences have always been fascinating to me and I love building and overclocking computers, but after studying CS for a year and turning one of my favorite hobbies into something I have to work hard at, my passion started to die for that field. Luckily, I was able to easily switch to health sciences and I have been pretty content with where I am at so far. My current path is to become a Physical Therapist because I enjoy communicating with and helping people and as a PT, I will have many opportunities to travel for work. In conclusion, I would say I am here for a quality education and to meet new people from different backgrounds."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,29,"I've thought a lot about this subject to the point where I know too many different possibilities that it can drown me. I am a rather spiritual person I would say and I am also a curious one and for that reason I've asked a lot of different people a lot of different questions. I've studies with catholics, christians, jehovah witnesses, talked to muslums, mormons just to hear what they have to say. One of the most interesting versions i've heard was that we were all angels that lost our ways and we are living many lives in order to fix the mistakes that we’ve made and in the different life times that we live we are learning different lessons and once we've learned all our lessons that's when we can finally fully rest. I don't know how true that is but i thought it was interesting because if you pay attention to the things that happen around us then you can be really attuned to the things that pop up in your life and why. Molst people live without thinking a single thought and choosing different things that can shape their life and others in different ways. As for why I am here, I have felt that I have always been here for other people. I teach and learn lessons as I go as to what my purpose is. I think I'm still on my way of figuring that out as the rest of us are. And I don't think anyone actually knows a definite answer considering there is no actual difference between me and the next person we are still on this same planet. I'm not worried about the what happens next either because at the end of the day it is inevitable, and i try not to think about the what i'm supposed to do for now as much because it can really put you in a helpless state, so i'm just trying to trust my intuition and flow to where life takes me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,30,"Why am I here?     I believe that I am here to help others since I have always grown up taking care of my   grandparents and siblings. I always knew that I had a strong passion for inspiring and motivating   others to do their best, but I never truly had an idea of what career path I wanted to take. After   taking different classes in community college, I found myself very interested in the Kinesiology   field and I remember watching a short clip in class about the different career paths. When the   video showed what a day would look like as an occupational therapist, I was truly inspired by   her work and how much her patients meant to her. Right away, I did more research on what an   OT does and ever since, I continued taking more classes and hope to attend OT grad school   after I graduate with a BS in Kinesiology. I believe that I am here to also make my parents proud   and most importantly, to make myself proud. I also want to have a family in the future and be   able to take care and provide for them, so I want to have a good job that will help me become   financially stable in the near future."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,31,"Why am I here? I am here in Physics 102 to complete as one of my requirements towards my major. Even though Physics isn’t particularly my favorite go to subject, I am finding it more and more interesting as we move forward. I am here to accomplish the classes I need in order to be successful in my career which will be Kinesiology. I am here to learn about the body and movements in order to help others become healthier and stronger. I am here at this university to help me further my education and to be able to have bachelor’s degree to hold a successful job.

2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,32,I am here because I never took the physics lab portion of the class until now 2 years after taking   the course originally. I look forward to getting refreshed on some of the material that will be   discussed in class. I would like to say that physics was a bit tough for me back when I took the   course originally as I am not good with math. So one advice I would give is to study the material   outside of the class and be curious about some of the things brought up in lecture. You’d be   amazed at what can be learned. The physics course was an overall good experience as well as   I remember a lot of problems that were solved with the professor doing presentations.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,33,"The reason why I’m in this Physics lab is because I need the lab part of this course. Hopefully I’ll   learn something useful that I can use later in the future or present. I think labs are about looking   in depth after having a result or data in order to prove your answer, so by taking this lab I can   learn to elaborate more and expand my thoughts. It's also a new learning experience since it's   an online lab course where we get to use different methods."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,34,"I am here because this class is a prerequisite for my Kinesiology major. I don’t really know much   about physics and the last physics class I took was in middle school. I’m here because I want to   have an education and build my career/ find my passion. I’m here because I have to be. I’m   actually not sure why I’m here. I’m here because many people my age are in college working   towards their dream jobs but I feel like I’m just here. Sometimes, I have a quarter-life crisis and   I’m not even 25 years old yet. I’ve been having a quarter-life crisis since I was in high school.   People tell me that I’m still young and that I’ll figure things out soon but I don’t like not   knowing what’s going to happen in my future. I don’t even know what my passion is. I enjoy   going to the gym which is why I’m a Kinesiology major. I also don’t find other majors   interesting. I think I want to go into occupational therapy but I don’t know if I’m even able to be   accepted by a graduate school. I can’t see myself as anything and I’m just stuck or I’m actually   just not sure where I’m going or if I’m going down the right path. I’m kind of confused. I’m here   because my sisters are also here and they mean a lot to me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,35,"Why am I here?     I am here at school because I want to become a nurse, and that requires a license and degree. I   am currently a kinesiology major so I can transfer into the nursing program either here or at   another school. I feel passionate about helping others that if I could, I would want to be a doctor.   I love the excitement, the knowledge, and the help I would put towards others as a nurse.   The general reason towards why I’m here is because of my parents. They put me in this world   even though my mom always said she could have dropped me off at the fire department. She was   kidding. I love my family and my life, and I don’t regret being where I am at. I always wanted to   die doing something heroic and making my last words something a long the lines of “I got this”."

One reason that I am taking physics is because I need to for my major courses to   graduate and achieve my bachelor of science degree in exercise science and movement   science. After getting my bachelor of science degree in kinesiology, I plan to hopefully apply for   physical therapy school or occupational therapy school. My mind has not been made up yet if I   wanted to go to medical school etc. Since I am a personal trainer and have been coaching   clients in different populations for about 4 ½ years, I feel this is my passion and my calling.   Anything can happen though till I graduate so I do have time to reflect and process everything in   my mind to make the best decision for myself and future."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,37,"Why am I here ?     I am here in this class at least to gain more knowledge on a science subject that I am very  limited in. I want to learn more about how the world moves and the forces in it. Being a  kinesiology major we study the bodies and how they move. When a body is in motion many  forces are acting upon them. This class hopefully will help me understand those forces and  allow me to better help a patient. I really am I here because it is a requirement for my major  otherwise, I would have avoided this if I am being complet ely honest. So far I like the lecture  class because it has some real world applications. The lab I enjoy as well because we have the  breakout groups and they let me work with other students, makes me almost feel like I am in  class again."
