2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,151,"Even though I don’t plan on working in any physics-related fields when I get my degree, the problem solving we do in this class is essential to my career as a computer scientist. My goal is to be a successful problem solver; I want to be able to at least figure out what I’m trying to accomplish and what I might try to get there. Life is a word problem--especially in STEM fields--and being able to pick out what we already know and what we’re looking for is vital to moving forward. Classes like calculus are obviously important in Computer Science, but it’s often more useful for calculating final answers than assessing the problem and its implications. Math is basically useless to me if it cannot be applied to the real world, and physics is the definition of real-world math application. So, in summary, this class can help me to achieve my goals by making me exercise my critical thinking and problem solving skills."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,164,"I, like many others, have things that they want to do before they die: travel the world, learn how to do x, etc but it's all a matter of financial stability and making sure you have everything you need in the moment to get you there. At this point in my life, I just want to be done with school so I can start making money but also not rush through life at the same time. This class ""helps"" me just because it is something that I am required to take and by completing this class, it brings me one step closer to completing my degree and with that, my in general goal of life. Who knows, but maybe I will pick up something along the way that I won’t know I’ll need until I finally use it but for now, I am just set out to complete this class."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,173,"My goal is to study physics and get a degree in astrophysics. This class will help me achieve that goal because it will help me learn more about physics and get a better understanding of the subject. I also would like to work for NASA and physics is something you will definitely need for getting spaceships out of our atmosphere and land them back safely on Earth. I have always been interested in physics, so another reason I chose to take this as my field of study is because of curiosity and wanting to learn more."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,153,"My main goal is to graduate from San Francisco State with a Computer Science Degree, and subsequently pursue a job in that field. To achieve that goal, I must learn more about Computer Science as a subject and finish other classes to graduate on time. I feel as though physics and computer science relate on some aspects are similar. Both subjects are very analytical and require the use of methodical approaches to solve problems. I can definitely see this class helping me hone these skills, which will in turn assist me in my future career. In addition to this, this class will give me credit towards completing my requirements for my degree."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,159,"My goals in life and I guess for my college career is to, first get my degree, and secondly get a job were I can use my degree and thirdly, become engineer. With these goals it is definitely going to take a long time, but I have to persevere, and if this is a goal I really want pursue (which it is) I'm not going to quit. Now how can this class help me achieve these three simple but lengthy goals. First, by passing this class it will put me one step closer to completing my college degree, and all the information I learn in this class will be important in my critical thinking skills that I may need for a job in the future. One thing I like about physics is that you don't really need to know all the equations and rules to succeed, if you can think of the issue in physics practically and with common sense everything will make sense, and when you use common sense to solve these problems in physics, its basically problem solving at a basic level and that's all I want to do for a job. Lastly to become an engineer I'm going to have to learn an abundance of physics concepts and since this is the first class of the set, this class will be the stepping stone to all my goals that I want to achieve."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,168,My goals in life is to start a family and to start my career which can lead me to starting my family and this class is a step towards that goal. I am currently a junior shooting for a bachelors degree in civil engineering. This class will help me with that goal because I would be learning the fundamentals of physics and how they apply to the real world. By passing this class it would be bringing me a step closer to achieving that goal since it is a prerequisite for my degree choice and without it I wont be able to graduate. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,172,"My goal is to become a programmer. Programming can be fun and satisfying when you do something that was giving you problems. I've liked the feeling of this satisfaction ever since I was introduced to programming back in my junior year of high school. That's one of the reasons I got into this subject. The other being that it can pay very well if you are skilled enough. In order to reach this goal, I have to graduate with a Computer Science degree. In order to graduate with a CS degree, I have to pass all the classes required, and this is one of the classes. By passing this class, I am getting one step closer to my goal. I know the journey there will be VERY challenging, but I hope that I can make it out on the other side alive."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,174,"I feel like my goals are pretty simple. As of right now I’m just trying to pay my rent and get my degree. I’m working part time at a startup, so that’s half of it already squared away. In order to get my degree I’ve got to take all sorts of classes, physics (and the lab along with it) are a big part of those requirements. I find physics to be fairly interesting, but this class is a means to an end. I’m actually quite frustrated because my community college counselor told me I had the pick of physics or chemistry. So I took chemistry and then transferred and found out I never should have wasted my time on three chemistry classes. Now I have to stack my schedule to make up for missing these classes pre-transfer. That being said, I’m still grateful to be able to attend SFSU and work for the education I need in order to succeed in life, I just wish my community college counselor had known what they were talking about. Or that I could have had the foresight to not take their word for it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,160,"Weimin ChenMy goal is to be a computer programmer. This class PHYS Lab can help me achieve the goal be a computer programmer. In the computer program, PHYS knowledge is used usually to make the program. So the lab class is very important because the lab can help me more understanding what I learn in PHYS class and it is necessary to have this class. If you don’t have the lab or the experience for the PHYS, you would not understand how the knowledge that you learned in PHYS class work and why it is work. PHYS is necessary to learn in a computer science major. If I have great PHYS knowledge, it can help me become a better computer programmer when I graduate the college and work in the future. So, the class PHYS lab can help me achieve my goal. This is why I learn the PHYS class needs the PHYS lab."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,152,"My goals are to succeed in college, having a deep understanding of how to apply my skills in computer science to my career. Succeeding in this course can help me have a better understanding of how to apply these skills in a real life situation. Assume I have a job where I have to work with electronic engineers and physicists to produce software for something like AI drones: If I were to have a poor understanding of physics, I couldn’t make reasonable calculations in my code for how much power to send to the motors. The software I would write would need to have realistic parameters and would need to consider the physics of everyday life. I would need to account for things like gravitational acceleration and wind forces on the drone in order to have some semblance of stabilization. Working with those around me, I would consider all possible scenarios to keep the drone safely capable of self-stabilizing or following its own set path without crashing. I hope I can learn several important physics formulas and theories to help make a good product. That’s how I hope this class will help with my goals."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,157,My goals right now are to finish my school work and graduate with a computer science degree. I will then use it to accomplish my other goal of becoming a game developer. The way this class can help accomplish my goal is to allow me to take other courses that I need to. This course is considered as a prerequisite for many of the different courses I still have remaining. With completion of this course I would be able to take the next segment of the physics courses. It will also unlock various different computer science classes. For example once I have completed this course and the next physics course I will be able to take CSC 415. Once I have entered the game development field I can use the physics I have learned to help with the designs of the games I will create. I can use it to create the inner workings of the game.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,156,"My goal for the future is to work in the mechanical engineering field. Specifically, I want to work with cars because I ways around cars growing up. I loved building which sparked my passion for engineering, but with I fell in love with them back in high school. I always wanted to build a car from the ground up and now I want to rebuild a car back to a working state. Recently, I picked up a car that I'll be working on for a while now and hopefully through this class I'll be able to work on the physics side of cars when it's time. For example performance wise, I'll be able to see how the acceleration of the car is working with different parts that I put into the car or how I can reduce the drag of the car by calculating different methods I learn in physics."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,163,"My goal is to finish school and receive a degree so I can work and earn money to provide shelter and food for myself, and then I can live a happy and fulfilling life. This class helps me with my goal because it's required, and honestly physics isn't my strongest or most favorite subject so for the most part it's just that - a requirement. While I do find it interesting, it's not something I want to incorporate too much into my career later on in life, and my other classes also take up so much time that I can't exactly set them all aside just to find a way to enjoy physics more or use it to help me achieve more goals (unfortunately)"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,162,"My goals are to work in game development or software engineering. Physics plays a large role in game development because when you move the character across the screen have some of the same aspects as we do on Earth. If I wanted the character to move across the screen normally  I would have to apply gravity in the simulated game environment. If there were multiple characters and they are racing each other then I would need to understand their movements with a position vs time or a velocity vs time graph. Although software engineering does not have much physics involvement this class still provides skills necessary for the job. Problem-solving and attention to detail are skills needed for software engineering. In a physics class, both skills are practiced frequently problem solving is used as an approach to understanding the task given and attention to detail is used when we look at diagrams or graphs."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,161,"My goal is to pass all the classes, and graduate in time with a degree. My ultimate goal is to find a good paying job where I actually like to work, and the working environment is friendly. I think this class can help me prepare for other upcoming classes, and this class can give me knowledge about physics. With that knowledge I can carry it over to everyday life situations or carry it over to other related classes. Passing this class and gaining new knowledge is like the roots to my goal. Since this class is online it also provides me with extra experience because online classes teaches you to use your resources. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,154,"My goal is to become a game developer. My very first video game that I played was Tekken 2 on the original Playstation back in 2004. Ever since then I've been addicted to video games. I'm always awe struck by the worlds that can be created from lines of code. Worlds that range from the Tolkein like fantasy to Lovecraftian horror never ceases to amaze me. I want to be able to create a world of my own one day and share it with others.It may seem like physics and video games don't have that much in common but every video game is made from an engine. That engine simulates physics in the game. That game physics can be really similar to what happens in real life, it can be so similar that we can use some video games to model what would happen in real life, games such as Kerbal Space Program and City Simulator can model rocket paths and trajectory and everyday traffic. But I think the fun part about video games isn't modeling real life, it's creating your own set of rules and physics in that world. Maybe you want to create a world were gravity doesn't pull but push instead, or a world where the speed of light isn't the fastest thing in the universe, or maybe even worlds where we're not limited by 3 dimensions. How would physics  differ in those worlds compared to ours? By studying physics in our world we may be able to write video games with a completely different set of physics and that's what interests me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,150,"My goal is to become a Civil Engineer and maybe do something more on the design side of constructing bridges and roads, so I'm not sure If I'll want to get a masters in a more specialized area. However, I do know that physics plays a very crucial role in the engineering world. It helps a Civil Engineer be able to understand how just about anything works, and how they will get their structure to stand upright. Therefore, this class will teach me the basics that will set the foundation of my physics knowledge that will help me in my career. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,175,"My goals are to get a mechanical engineering degree and to get a job that is related to that field, preferably one which has hands-on duties as part of it.  I have always been a ""gear-head"" growing up, and was fascinated with engines.  I was also an avid Lego builder as a kid, and would spend much of my free time listening to music and building Legos.  I also decided to go into mechanical engineering instead of say, becoming a specialized mechanic, because I have always been curious about how the world works.  I was raised in an agnostic household, and religion has never been a part of my life.  When I first started college in 2015, I was planning on studying philosophy because I figured that would help to explain the universe around me.  I quickly learned that philosophy seems to raise more questions than it answers, and I am also a big fan of concrete answers that one can find when say, studying math.  After spending time working to save up money and figure out what I want out of life, I know find myself here in my first semester as a transfer student at SFSU.  I greatly want to be able to not only explain the world that we experience (I understand that quantum physics is its whole can of worms that doesn't fully agree with classical physics), and then use those tools to create engines or systems.  In my mind, a competent engineer is almost like a wizard in a fantasy setting; someone who can control the environment around them to create something that almost seems impossible.  This physics class will definitely help me achieve these goals.  It is setting up the framework for the rest of my education in the future, as well as beginning to explain the world around me.  Not only will this class help fill pre-requisites, but is establishing a frame of mind of how a scientist or engineer views the world, rather than your average Joe who can see what's happening around him, but cannot explain it mathematically.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,167,"Overall, my current goal is to complete my undergraduate education and to eventually learn the information that will help me succeed in graduate school if I choose to do that and in what I hope will be my future career as a mechanical engineer. My goal for just this semester is to succeed in my classes and prepare myself for the more challenging classes that I’m planning on taking in the coming semesters. In terms of how this class brings me closer toward completing these goals, my major has a lot to do with almost all aspects and categories of Physics and other branches of science as well as math. Specifically, Physics labs seem to go into more detail about real-world/practical applications of the concepts that are taught in Physics lectures. In other words, this class encourages further exploration into these concepts in the hopes that it will reinforce students’ knowledge and understanding."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,169,"My goal after graduating college is to try and find a job in the technology industry. I would like to create my own app or work for a big software company like Google or Apple.This class will help me work towards physics 2, another graduation requirement for all computer science majors. This course will also help me with future math classes that I am required to take by making other formulas easier to use and work with.In the long term, I am sure that computer science majors may also need some of the formulas learned from this course to solve other things along the lines of code in computer science. I want to be well prepared and alerted if anything along the lines of physics is thrown my way on the way to getting a bachelors degree in computer science. I also might need some important physics logic in grad. school if I plan to attend after achieving a bachelors degree at San Francisco State University."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,155,"Astaria PodestaStanley, RaePhysics 222-06September 23, 2020Reflection # 2 My goals are to understand and learn more about physical science, as well as fulfill a requirement for my degree. I've always had a fascination with motion and how it works, though I've always felt a bit discouraged to pursue it because math is not my strong suit, though I am trying to develop that skill so I feel more confident. This class will help me gather a set of skills and equations to help answer some of the questions I've had about motion and mechanics. Specifically in the sense of building things because I'm always getting weird ideas of things I want to make. This class will also help me achieve my goal in marking off a requirement on my list which will bring me closer to a degree in physics. Between the class and the labs, I already feel like I'm learning more about physics and the mechanics of the universe than I knew previously. I am excited to dive deeper into the subject of motion in two dimensions because I feel like that is where a lot of my curiosities come from and I wonder how many dimensions of motion are possible. With taking this class, it will also help me gain knowledge that will bring me closer to understanding the motions of the stars and the universe, which is my end goal since I am studying a degree in physics but majoring in astronomy."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,176,My personal goal is to be successful in engineering with the hopes that I can get a good job in the automotive industry. Physics is probably my favorite subject which I guess makes sense that I want to go into engineering. Physics is incredibly interesting to me so that really helps because It intertwines pretty deeply with mechanical engineering stuff. This also kind of brings up the fact that in the past it was pretty easy to learn the contents of a class and then just dump it out of my mind after that class was over. But now I’m getting more and more into the classes that should have more to do with what I plan on doing in the future so dumping it out of my brain is no longer an option. It seems simple enough but it will be a retraining my brain sort of thing to actually make myself retain the information I learn in this class and others like it. I guess it also helps that I will be taking a bunch of math and physics classes for my major that should build on each other.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,171,"I already took AP Physics 1 last year during high school, so I figured I would know a lot of the things we would be taught throughout the semester. Thus, I thought my goal would be to use this class to refine my physics skills so I wouldn't struggle much in Phys 220. I think there were only some things throughout the year I didn't learn already, so I'm not sure why AP Phys 1 wasn't enough to move on to the next level. Maybe it was for the best though, as a couple of weeks into the semester my work ethic plummeted. Like I mentioned in Reflection 4, I would lose track of time and didn't really feel any motivation to do work. I'm not sure what triggered it, I think it might've been a gradual shift. I can definitely use this as a learning experience though, and focus on being better next semester."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,158,"My goals are to graduate from college and also use that class as part of me learning how the world works. This Physics Lab class helps me complete one of the requirements I needed to get my Computer Science degree and it’s one of the core classes for my Computer Science major because it’s a STEM class and Computer Science is a STEM area. Also, this Physics Lab helps me give me some knowledge on how the world works. It was very impressive to find out that forces exist whether I was pushing a box or carrying objects. And also I can see the existence of velocity and acceleration on us, cars, and other objects moving."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,166,"Well, my goal is to be happy in life and be able to provide for my partner and I in the future, so I suppose this class will help me get a Bachelor's degree so I can secure a decently paying office job. To be honest, I have no idea how forces and acceleration will help me program applications or design web sites better, but hey it's a requirement for many computer science majors, so I guess there's some use to it. To be blunt, I'm only taking this class because I'm required to and I don't see much use in it. If it was just to fill an Upper-Division science requirement, I much rather take a Biology or Chemistry class because I'm much better at Biology and Chemistry than I am Physics. I suppose there's also ""critical thinking skills"" and ""problem solving and analysis skills"", though I've found I've mostly developed those through other methods besides school, as school tends to make me anxious and panic, causing whatever problem solving skills and rational thinking skills I posses to fly out the window."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,165,My goals are to pass all of my classes and to get my bachelor's degree in civil engineering. This class can help to be a stepping stone to help me reach my goals. This class helps to relate the real world to physics and all its many concepts I must learn to use out in the real world once I get a job with my degree. This class is very useful for me learning things that are very important to know for a civil engineer. It fascinates me how the whole world revolves around physics its the basis of everything we use in our daily lives and that is why it is so important.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,170,I'm an engineer I need to understand physics its the underling thing that my major is based on this class should be my first introduction into how the world interacts with its self it's like fundamental for almost any stem major and is something I enjoy over most other classes this makes its level of importance to me really high
