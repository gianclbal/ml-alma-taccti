2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,169,"Concept: Position vs. Time & Velocity vs. Time  What is the difference between these two concepts?  The idea of position vs. time and velocity vs time are very different from one another. The position vs time describes the motion of an object over a period over time. A graph can easily depict the time in seconds plotted on the x-axis while the position of the object can be shown along the y-axis. The slope of this graph reveals the most important information about the velocity of the object. The slope is formed during its motion. A constant slope of this graph reveals that it is moving at a constant velocity.  On the other hand, velocity vs time is the speed at which an object is moving at a given time and whether it is slowing down or speeding up. A graph can show the time plotted along the x-axis and the velocity per seconds along the y-axis. Objects that move at a constant rate have a straight line. The slope of the graph reveals the acceleration of an object.  The concept of position vs time and velocity vs time comes up in our everyday lives often and we may have not even noticed it. Every day, millions of people are driving on freeways with their cars. The concept of position vs time is related to the speed of a moving car. The position and time and velocity of time comes up when a car stops at a red light, and then accelerates when the light turns green. This concept goes over our heads as we probably didn’t think about it before taking this course."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,173,"The concept I chose to talk about is Forces, which include free-body diagrams and Newton’s laws. The information from learning Forces is applicable to people’s lives because we are constantly dealing with them. We gain the knowledge of how things move and why they move the way they do. Without knowing what forces, we are would never understand why we need seatbelt when in cars. The reason we wear seatbelt is because someone figured out that an object in motion stays in motion unless soothing stops it. So, let us say that you are driving and then your car hits a tree. The car will stop, but since you are not part of the car, you will continue in that line of motions, and that’s why we have so many safety rules when it comes to driving. So many forces can be explained in just driving alone. Forces like friction, normal and gravitational. Another example that many people will see of forces is moving a box. They will see friction force when pushing on the box. Everything in our planet and those outside of it have different forces acting upon it or exerting force on something else. Like the sun and all the planets and other objects orbiting around it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,150,"During these past few weeks, I have learned a lot, reviewed, and touched up on topics that I was originally taught in my A.P. Physics high school class. A concept that was covered in class these past few weeks would be the direction of acceleration and velocity and how they affect an object. If the direction of the velocity is opposite the direction of acceleration, then the object is slowing down. Therefore, if the direction is the same for both, then the object is speeding up. This relates to real life situations. For example, if you are driving at a constant speed, and approaching a stop sign you will let go of the gas and press on the break, which will result in the vehicle to decelerate. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,161,"One concept I found interesting over the past week was Newton's second law. If a rock and a feather fell from the same height with no air resistance which would fall first? Both of the objects would fall first because there is no air resistance which means that the object is only acing on gravitational force. This information can be useful to society because it is one of the Newton's laws. Free fall is part of Newton's second law. Newton's laws are the reason why we understand motion, and motion plays a big part of people's everyday life. One example of the second law used in everyday life is when you are pushing things around. Let's say you are pushing a car and your friend is pushing a van, by Newton's second law you should have more acceleration than your friend because your car has less mass than the van."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,163,"Question: Can a penny kill someone after being dropped off of a very high building?This is a question that randomly has popped into my head as a kid, and I never really thought about it again until our recent lab where we dropped coffee filters with pennies and recorded the rate at which it fell. After this recent lab, it became much more apparent that it's pretty easy to find the terminal velocity of something especially a common (small in size and mass) household item. Obviously thinking about something on a scale of dropping a penny off a skyscraper isn't exactly something I can test and find a real answer for, but I can guesstimate. We can use the data that we also used in the lab today, to find terminal velocity of a penny (not with a coffee filter) after a certain time. m = 2.5g, g = 9.8m/s, a = 2.85cm^2, drag coefficient = 1.17. Given these, the terminal velocity is somewhere between 18-22m/s, which is very very rough and estimated (I could have also done it wrong)"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,167,"One of the topics that have been covered so far is friction, the resistance of motion between two or more objects in contact. In last week's lab, friction was explored through the use of a simulation that allowed the user to change some of the variables in a situation where a man pushed an object on a surface. Friction is mostly intuitive except when it comes to the differences between static and kinetic friction. Static friction is the force that is responsible for grip and preventing objects from sliding on surfaces while kinetic friction is the force that acts to slow an object that is already in motion and sliding against another surface. However, after overcoming the force of static friction and putting an object in motion, the applied force acting on that object is more than is required to keep the object in motion at a constant speed. This is the result of kinetic friction having a smaller magnitude of force to overcome than static.An important application for these concepts in the real world is the production and design of tires for vehicles. One of the challenges in choosing and creating a material to be used in tires is balancing how well it grips the road with how long its tread lasts before having to replace the tire. The general relationship is that the more friction between the tire and the road, the shorter the lifespan of the tire. Something else to consider is that the designers of tires for automotive applications are more concerned with kinetic friction between the tire and the road because car tires are spinning while the car is in motion. Designers of tires for airplanes that are meant to help slow down the airplane during landing are more concerned with static friction than kinetic friction."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,160,"ReflectionI want to choose the position, time, and velocity that is the concept what I learned this semester in the PHYS Lab class. The question is how can I used this principle to make the group and then compare different roads to find the best way to walk to the end. This is what people usually did in people’s lives. This is important for people who are the driver and the programmer used the principle in the map application that can have the best way to let people become more convenient. I can use the position vs time, and velocity vs time graph anywhere and anytime in my life that is how this information might be generally applicable to people’s lives and/or how this information might be used to benefit society. For example, I used the position vs time graph to collect two data about two ways to drive the car to the beach. One way is 20 Kilometer and 40 min, the second way is 25 Kilometer but use 35 min. So, the way that I choose is second because it is faster than the first way. This is an example of Velocity and the position used in people’s life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,176,"We recently went over what frictional force is and how to find it, how it works and all that. A question that came to mind when we first started that chapter was what would happen if there was absolutely no frictional force. At first it might seem like something great that would make things so much more efficient for things like race cars or rockets that the engineers of those things are always trying to find ways to overcome to make them more efficient. But the more I thought about it the funnier the image became because all that would happen is you would probably not be able to go anywhere because as soon as you started to walk or something it would be extremely hard to make yourself stop. Cars would also be even more dangerous for the same reason of having essentially nothing to help you stop or slow down. It would be like being on ice at all times except worse because even ice has some friction. So I guess friction is really important mostly at keeping us safe. Friction is really what allows us to do our everyday activities. A theoretical friction-less world is great because it simplifies things for us but in reality it would be really inconvenient."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,166,"I'm going to be real, most of the concepts we have covered in class I have seen no practical application for- only theoretical and mathematical application for. I don't have any particular questions about the concepts covered in the class or labs. Physics just isn't that interesting to me and I know it's crucial for engineering, but I find most of it to be dull, tedious, and like a glorified math class. I'm only taking this class because it's a major requirement. My major is computer science, but I'm more interested in the virtual aspects of it such as software, coding,  game design, and web design. Also, in nearly all my classes, I find that I’m not really engaged with the material since it doesn’t seem to matter to me. I think quarantine is likely contributing to this feeling, but it’s exhausting pretending to care about something that you don’t. I’m just looking to pass the class. You could argue that I'd have a sunnier outlook if I made more of an effort in engaging with the class material, but I don’t see the point in putting time and effort into something that I don’t care about and I’m not passionate about. I do care about passing. I do care about getting a degree. But I’ve been doing that just fine by just doing the work I’m told to do. I’m taking 7 classes this semester- I don’t really have the emotional or mental energy to do much more than that."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,154,"In chapter 4 we learned about projectile motion. In the projectile motion section all our examples have to do with us ignoring air resistance. Our our problem is set up in a way such that air resistance is negligible. How would we model projectile motion if air resistance isn't negligible? How would our kinematic equations change if the projectile thrown had enough time to reach terminal velocity? In real life everything that has been falling long enough will eventually reach terminal velocity, but in our projectile motion examples they just continue to accelerate until they hit the ground. The kinematic equations are modeled after constant acceleration. And we know that air is the same as friction in the way that it acts to in the direction opposite of motion. Also the bigger our velocity the more impact friction has in slowing down the object in motion. There will be a point when the object is moving fast enough that the force of friction is balanced with the force of gravity and the object stops accelerating and moves at a constant velocity.This is very useful to know because nothing on Earth falls without air resistance. If we want to know how long it will take a sky diver to reach the ground knowing the relationship between air resistance and a free falling object is crucial. And the terminal velocity of sky divers would change once they pull their parachutes. This is also useful for a space shuttle landing on Earth. Since they also deploy parachutes to slow their acceleration in order to stop."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,152,"Explain how position, velocity and acceleration correlate and include an explanation on how they can be used together in real life:	Position over a time is considered the most basic thing we can observe and measure from a system. Based on our understanding of velocity, we can construct several instantaneous velocities for each instant on the timeline. Record that and we have velocity over time. We can use the velocity over time to find acceleration in the same way we found the instantaneous velocity. Plot that info with time and we have acceleration over time.	In real life, a car company may test a vehicle’s capabilities in different weather conditions by doing practical testing involving the concept above. Imagine doing a test on an off-roader’s maximum acceleration in muddy conditions that would regularly be slippery and difficult to drive through. Engineers could do an initial test by recording the vehicle’s position through a muddy course and use that information to find its velocity and acceleration over time. After gathering the information they could adjust certain power delivery and suspension systems to better suit the conditions. They would then test again to prove their independent factor’s efficacy in increasing maximum acceleration in muddy conditions."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,171,"I'm not sure if the prompt is asking for a literal way you can use physics to improve everyday life, or how you can apply it in a metaphorical sense. I decided to go with the latter for this reflection. I think that the ideas behind balance can be applied to our own lives as well. By putting things at different distances from the center, you were able to balance the see-saw. Similarly, by giving different levels of effort and importance to difficulties, as well as things we enjoy, we can have balance in our lives. For example, when it comes to difficulties, we can look at them based on how much it would benefit us to do them, how much time we have, and how much we'll have to struggle to get it done. In this scenario, something relatively easy to do such as taking out the trash will have higher priority, while something that will take longer to do such as cleaning the house will be given lower priority, but still worked on over time."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,164,"In a general sense, people in every day life could look into active forces when moving or carrying objects around. By doing so, they may gain a better understanding as to why certain actions will make their lives easier, especially when looking at it ergonomically. Obviously people have a basic knowledge of friction, or so I would hope, but it would help knowing every little nuance to help with making the job easier than it has to be. It is very broad to say forces but I mean the obvious ones like friction, gravitational, etc. side note: I spent a good few minutes and just can't think of anything at the moment"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,175,"How do satellites stay in orbit around Earth?Satellites stay in orbit based on two concepts: gravity and velocity.  The satellite is constantly falling towards Earth due to gravity.  However, they do not fall out of orbit due to the velocity that they maintain in a direction that is perpendicular to the gravitational force.  Due to these two forces being applied to the satellite, it maintains a constant state of free-fall around Earth.  This is aided by the lack of atmosphere in their orbits.  The lack of drag that air creates allows the satellite to maintain its initial velocity when it first entered orbit, therefore it can maintain its state of free-fall.  Because there are roughly only two forces being applied to a satellite in the form of gravity and the velocity of the satellite entering orbit, we can calculate the rough trajectory of the satellite by adding together those two vectors.These concepts of physics are extremely helpful for humanity at large, as satellites are indispensable to modern society.  Without satellites bringing the world together almost instantly through cellphones and GPS, the world would look a lot different.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,155,"Astaria PodestaStanley, RaePhys 220-06October 7, 2020Lab 6 ReflectionThe concept I chose was actually the one we just worked on in lab 6. Though I don't understand it quite as well as I wanted to, it is the most applicable to daily lives. This concept involves drag and velocity and the effect air resistance has on it all. This can be applied to so many fields. The first that comes to mind is airplanes and space travel. One of the biggest parts of air travel in general, is building a machine that can effectively and efficiently travel through air and its resistance in order to reach greater heights or even space! Anything from the shape, to the weight and material can all be factors. Which is why space crafts are shaped like they are as well as the noses of airplanes. This is a topic I would love to know more about as I dream of different flying creations sometimes. I do find it fascinating that certain shapes will break through air resistance and tension better than others. Are there any other shapes out there we haven't thought of that would work even better than air travel? I hope to find out in the future some day."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,168,"You ever wondered why an object changes motions and accelerates or what's the cause for it? That cause is when one or more forces act on it, and this is explained and proved with newtons second law, the laws of motion. Don't get it confused, an object can have motion with no forces acted on it but the forces is the cause in changes of motion. This is called a net force, a net force on an object is the vector sum of all forces acting on the object and acceleration is due to the net force. This information is beneficial and is applied in our daily lives, for example pushing a car is easier than pushing a truck with the same amount of force is because it has less mass which results in a faster acceleration. To simplify that by saying the heavier the object the more net force is needed to be used to alter the motion of that object. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,158,"The information about the change in motion called acceleration might be generally applicable to people’s lives because every day, we, the people, wanted to move around the world. And so, if we’re at first relaxing and we want to get up and go out of our homes to walk around interesting places, then a change in motion called acceleration is needed by having ourselves move from our own relaxing places into going out of the house to explore. If you want to travel by car, then you need acceleration using the accelerator pedal in order to move your car to other places. In the simulation of the lab, you increase the velocity of the man by acceleration if you want to move the man to the house very fast. And then you slow the man down when he reaches the house by decreasing his velocity slowly to zero by acceleration."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,151,"I decided to explore the question, “How is static friction different from kinetic friction?” I chose this topic because I find it interesting that objects often have different values for the force of static and kinetic friction. In lab 5, we used a simulator to observe the effects of friction on an object’s motion. I noticed that when you want to move the box from rest, you have to apply a force of at least 126 N. However, once the box is already in motion, you only have to keep applying a minimum force of 95 N. This is because static friction pushes the crate in the opposite direction of the applied force with a force of 125N, whereas kinetic friction pushes the crate in the opposite direction of movement with a force of 94N. So why are these two values different from each other? Why does friction come in distinct kinetic and static forms?When you push on an object to move it, the static force increases to prevent movement. The object will not move until your applied force exceeds the maximum static friction value. Static friction wants to keep the object in place, and it must be overcome by an applied force to move the object. In chapter 5.8 of the textbook, they show that the force of kinetic friction on a moving object is usually less than the object’s maximum force of static friction. Static and kinetic friction often have different values because there are typically a lot more forces that work to keep an object stationary than forces resisting the object’s movement once it is already in motion. So once an object is already in motion, you have to apply a smaller minimum force to keep it moving than you initially need to move it from rest."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,157,"With our knowledge on how to describe an object’s motion, how do people use it within their lives or how does it benefit society as a whole. By being able to determine speeds of an object through this knowledge, do cops use this to determine speeds of cars that are going too fast. For instance the cop can use the information that a driver is driving down a highway from point a to point b and it took the driver a set time to arrive at point to calculate the speed of the driver. With it, the cop determines if the driver was being reckless and going at a speed that would be a danger to those around them and take action to prevent him from causing harm. Or he can determine that the driver’s speed is fine for the road that he is on and continue to watch for other drivers that could pose a threat to other drivers on the road. In our daily lives we can use this information on object motion to protect ourselves from danger. We can determine the amount of time and distance we will need to brake and avoid hitting any other object that is around when driving. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,153,One of the concepts we covered that has always stood out to me is that of gravity. The question that I formulated is as follows: Does a projectile's acceleration decrease or increase in an area such as the moon?From the text we know that the only acceleration acting on an object in projectile motion is due to the force of gravity. We know that the magnitude of the force of gravity is lower on the moon than it is on Earth. So we can draw the conclusion that a projectile would have a lower acceleration on the moon.This information is integral in the cases of researchers and astronauts. Astronauts must be prepared for the different type of gravity that takes effect on the moon. It is also important knowledge to retain for researches and scientists when dealing with hypotheticals regarding movement or travel on the moon.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,165,"I choose projectile motion and I want to find out when the velocity and acceleration vectors are parallel and perpendicular. so my question is; As a projectile thrown at an upward angle moves in its parabolic path, at what point along its path are the velocity and acceleration vectors for the projectile perpendicular to each other? At what point are the velocity and acceleration vectors for the projectile parallel to each other? From my chapter 4 summary in section 3, the book states that Projectile motion has to deal with a trajectory that is always in the shape of a parabola curving downward. if we assume that the free-fall acceleration is constant it is 0 in the x-direction and -g in the y-direction. From this, I can conclude that the acceleration will always be pointing downward. Now all I have to see is when the velocity is pointing rightward so that it is perpendicular to the acceleration. Velocity, as we know it is when it is in effect its vector, is in the direction of the motion so, therefore, it is always pointed either to the left or right in projectile motion so from that we can conclude that the velocity and acceleration vector are perpendicular to each other at the highest point. We can also conclude that these vectors will never be parallel since velocity is always pointed in the x-direction while the acceleration is equal to negative gravity which is in the y-direction."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,177,"Considering the concept of a free body diagram can help with multiple things on a day-to-day basis. When doing any sort of manual labor, it can be useful to think about what factors are working against you. If you can minimize the number of things that are working against you and maximize the number of forces working with you, the easier and more efficient."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,172,"Question: How big do parachutes have to be in order to make sure the person lands uninjured on the ground?There are many factors that can influence air resistance. For example, the shape of the object, the density of the fluid, the velocity of the object, and many more. This is generally the reason why a piece of paper would fall slower than a pencil. The shape of the paper makes it so it picks up more air as it is falling, compared to the pencil. If air resistance was negligible, both objects would hit the ground at the same time. We saw this with the bowling ball and feather in a vacuum chamber. In terms of parachutes, they have to be the are generally circles or rectangles because they cover more surface area. Although they are circles or rectangles, they are never flat because they wouldn't be able to pick up enough air to slow the person down, so all parachutes are curved so they can pick up lots of air. In terms of what size should they be, it should be big enough to overwhelm the downward force of gravity. As the person slows down, the air resistance will also decrease until the skydiver reaches a terminal velocity."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,162,A concept that I choose is the forces and newton’s law lab. A question I came up with is how does the net force affect the motion of an object? Net force affects the motion of the object by determining the speed. When there is a low amount of net force the object does not move because there is not enough applied force. When there is a higher amount of net force the object begins to move and accelerate faster until it reaches its max speed. All of these are dependent on friction. If there were no friction then it would only take a small amount of net force for the object to start moving. This information might be applicable to people’s lives because we move objects around every day. If you were shopping for groceries and needed to move the box from one side of the store to the other you would think about the applied force needed. Another example relating to net force and friction would be a car. The car travels on a road that has friction and there needs to be a net force before the car can start moving and accelerate.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,159,"The concept that I want to talk about in this reflection is probably from Lab 2 where we worked on position versus time graphs. I guess a question that I have is how can I use these principles of position versus time in my daily life and how relevant it is to me a physics student. Well looking back at this lab I think I originally said that these principles can be used in my everyday life to find the rate at which I can make a sandwich or how fast I can get out of my bed and into the kitchen, but I feel like I could apply so much more with what I learned here. And I guess what i'm trying to say is that position versus time graphs can be applied anywhere in my daily life and there isn't really a limit to what they can't represent. And I would also say that these graphs and looking at the relationships it has with acceleration and velocity is super relevant to me as a physics student because one can apply so much concepts do it, like calculus concepts of derivative and integrals, how each graph reacts with acceleration, velocity, and position, and so much more."
