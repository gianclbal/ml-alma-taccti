2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,167,"Overall, classes switching to an online format made it more difficult to stay motivated and to have the same degree of concentration on school work as I used to have before covid. However, after being in this position for several months now, I have learned that the best way to counteract the above issues is to make a routine and stick with it. By this I mean have a consistent sleep schedule, eating schedule, and dedicated portions of each day to work on assignments. Personally, I have been on a similar routine to the one I had when classes were in-person and I lived on campus which has helped to prevent bad habits and falling behind on school work. Another problem that I hear other students having is procrastination, but I have found that I have so much free time that I almost never have anything productive to do besides school work, so I usually complete things early. Lastly, in my opinion, online classes usually are not that bad and pretty bearable, so I'm not very concerned about my learning, but i'm definitely looking forward to things going back to normal. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,163,"Coming into the Fall semester knowing it's going to only be online via Zoom and iLearn, I assumed this semester was going to be terrible for my grades and somewhat ruin my positive outlook on school. Surprisingly, I've been doing pretty okay in all of my classes, and most importantly I am very happy with school online. Sure, I haven't really made any new friends like I had hoped to, but I have had way more free time than I would if I had in person classes on campus. Many of the classes are cut shorter because it's easy to get the required information across to the students, and we are then given more time for us to spend actually studying the material and doing homework rather than trying to fill a time block because we all showed up in person. Because I get more schoolwork done, I also have more time for my internship (which is also remote). All in all, I think I'm learning a lot more than I would if I was going to class in person. I should make myself go outside more though..."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,166,"Onilne classes have hindered my learning and honestly, my self care is very minimal. Taking 7 classes this semester, I don't have much time for self care. Though, it's not a priority for me anyways. The wellbeing of my loved ones has always been more important to me than my own wellbeing. I do what little I can, such as picking one day a week where I don't do any work and I take breaks in between assignments. That's about as in depth as I'm willing to go with strangers. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,169,"Online classes have impacted my learning in a negative way. I truly miss the real-life interaction of being in a classroom with other classmates. I don't really like online learning because sometimes zoom sessions aren't the most affective in my opinion. It is easy to get distracted at home while staring at a computer screen for multiple hours in your room at home. In order for me to take care of myself and maintain focus, I try to get enough sleep and rest before joining a zoom session. I also try to be more active and do physical activities rather than stay inside near a computer or screen where I spend more than half my time during some days for zoom. The only concerns I have about my learning is that I might slack off or lose focus and forget or miss an assignment. I try to keep track of everything I must do before each due day or by the end of the week to make sure I don't fall behind."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,176,The transition into online class was pretty difficult especially since it happened halfway into only my second semester so I was still pretty much getting used to college in general. It also freaked me out because my first semester I was put into an online class unknowingly and I did terribly in that class because it was online and I had never done that so I was pretty scared how my grades would turn out going fully online. At the end of that semester my grades weren’t too bad but they definitely could have been a lot better. I also noticed myself losing a lot of motivation towards the end of it which made it pretty hard. Going into this semester though I have been really trying my hardest to stay on top of everything because I think I personally need to be inside a classroom to really focus because it's so easy for me to get distracted when I’m just at home so I have to try extra hard to get myself invested in classes. To make sure I don’t go crazy doing this I have been trying to stay aware of when my mind is just fatigued and I’m no longer putting in quality effort into my work to just take a step back and chill even for a few minutes. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,152,"Online classes have several positives and negatives. In my experience, although learning online is possible and I’m capable of it, Many departments fail to restructure their courses to better fit the style of learning that results from online classes. In particular I notice that too many classes still have midterms and finals. My math and physics courses have neither of those, but both seem to still engage me and make me learn the subject matter.I’m frustrated with several departments not restructuring at all, whilst expecting students to pick up the pieces. In my discrete math class (a computer science course) we have finals and midterms and tests that put too much pressure on students and emphasize memorization over deeper understanding of subjects. Other courses that haven’t been restructured have far too much homework and studying required to be applicable for online classes. So right now my mental health is right on the edge of being in bad shape. Thankfully, I’m particularly good at noticing times when my mental health is low and reminding myself of taking breaks. The stress of school seems to just stack up more and more, but I’m ready to complete this semester’s courses and move onto another 2-3 semesters of online school."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,150,"Online classes have been a bit of a challenge to switch to from regular in person classes. I feel like it's a bit easier for me to slack off and not do my assignments on time, just because I'm not in a school setting and it's easier to ""relax"" which unmotivates me. It's also really easy for me to ""not go to class"" because I can just have my zoom on but not really pay attention. However, these are things that I can improve upon so I can be more successful. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,155,"Astaria PodestaStanley,RaePhys 220-06October 21, 2020Reflection # 4Online classes have greatly impacted my learning. To a degree that is pretty disappointing. I feel like I'm hardly absorbing any knowledge and just trying to make it through the semester. Everything i've learned so far I absorb for a day and forget  the next day. It has had such a profoundly negative impact on my learning that I am sad to say I will be switching degrees. From astrophysic to something in biology. I no longer feel confident enough in the amount I'm learning to proceed on this long and arduous path of mathematics and physics. It just doesn't seem realistic to try and continue when I feel like i'm learning so little. I am a very hands on in person learner and staring at a screen for 7 hours is really upping my levels of depression and anxiety. I'm trying as best as I can to match the amount of stress I'm feeling with self care, but with how little time I have to myself and how much time I have to spend on a screen it's been hard. I'm getting more headaches and blurred vision. It's really bringing down my morale and making me uncharacteristically unenthusiastic for school. I am a person who loves to learn so this is very sad for me. I'm still in the process of finding what self care feels most helpful right now but it all feels like a blur. I just want the semester to end so I can stop stressing about online classes for a moment and really make an educated decision on what degree I should switch to since I can no longer confidently continue this one. I never felt this unsure in an academic setting before and it is frightening, disheartening and discouraging."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,161,"Online classes has changed my learning completely. Online classes has made me a little lazier, however it has taught me how to do research on subjects and help myself learn the material. Due to online classes I feel like I have more time to spend on one subject, and I have more time to spend on studying for a test or a quiz. Online classes definitely has its ups and downs, and the way I take care of my self so I don't overload on work is I either workout in my garage, play video games, or watch anime. By doing these activities I usually take my mind off of the stressful work. By doing these activities it also helps me prepare for any work that is assigned to me because after the self care session I feel more refreshed and ready."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,158,"Online classes have impacted my learning because unlike face-to-face classes, I won’t really be able to meet any classmate face-to-face. Meeting classmates face-to-face is better than meeting classmates online because I can express myself even more when I meet classmates face-to-face than in online, where I have a very limited amount of expressions to have, even though I can still show my face online. I am still fine with online classes because I don’t need to prepare myself a lot when I have to go to college for classes. All I do is just stay home and just watch the online lecture. There are other classes that are asynchronous so that I could do the assignments at my own time. For self-care, I just relax whenever I need to relax and eat snacks whenever I need them for my energy or in case, I’m still hungry. There are no concerns for my learning and my well-being recently."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,170,online classes hurt me a lot I need the interaction of a classroom or else I get unmotivated the fact that I have work helps me keep up a routine and I have taken up working out to at least keep myself active during theses times it's just something I'm going to have to get used to during this time and its something that my grade is going to take a hit for because of my lack of motivation for school at the moment 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,168,"Classes being online this semester hasn't affected me to bad thankfully but it for sure made my learning experience more difficult and less enjoyable and entertaining. What i mean is due to being online ive been on the same set schedule for majority of my classes and the learning doesn't really feel like learning its more like im doing busy work just to get a grade. The classroom interaction isn't there since we are on zoom calls and thats where that feeling is coming from. Regarding my well being, im doing ok its just frustrating trying to juggle 4 different classes that are all online due to the wide variety  of due dates which leads to a lot of stress for me. Im always needing to double check if the assignment I turned in went through all the way or what assignments are due a certain day etc. Im hoping next semester since it would be the second time around of online classes it will be a better experience. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,160,"The online class made me felt bad because it is hard to learn if the professor doesn’t have the lecture class and just has the video to teach me. For example, in Math class, calculate 2 is very difficult, and then it also is the online class. I am very confused about what the math professor describes math knowledge. It made me watch the video on youtube and other websites to understand what I need to learn. But the online class doesn’t bad only. I have more free time this semester and fewer exams in the online class. I am worried about my next PHYS class because this semester PHYS 220 doesn’t have the exam but the PHYS class must have an exam. It will be hard and I am very difficult to pass that class. I am pretty relaxed this semester online class. I am trying to encourage myself."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,162,"Online classes have made it more difficult to learn. I feel that it is more difficult as a student to absorb information online than in person. Sometimes it also feels like I’m a robot because I am on my computer around 8 or more hours a day. Some concerns I have about my learning is what important information will I be missing? A lot of the online classes have cut out some of the material from the course because there isn’t enough time to teach it to students. Some things I have been doing for my own personal care is trying to get more sleep and taking some breaks and looking outside the window. I feel that receiving assignments with time flexibility has been a good impact. For example, a professor would say the assignment is due in one week. But they say they will accept it a few days after the due date without point deductions is beneficial for students because sometimes the workload is a lot. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,159,"Coming into this year I thought the learning experience was going to be a little similar to the spring semester, in terms of how my teachers impact my learning and the level of work we were supposed to do, but I feel like there has been way more work and they expect us to work harder because we are at home. In my opinion they should have kept the same workload as the previous semester because we are all still adjusting to work on zoom, so unfortunately it has had a negative affect on my mental health. What I have been doing to keep my mind clear and proactively keep a good mindset was by writing out all my tasks on my calendar and making sure that I take breaks between classes.in the future i pray that the workload will get shorter, but we all know its going to get more challenging from here."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,165,"Online classes have impacted my learning in a weird way, being that this is my first semester at a four-year university as a transfer student I've had to learn a lot of new things that are different than the community college system. It has been tough not being able to go out and actually attend classes in person but I have learned to live with it. The only reason I like remote learning is that it gives me time to figure out how I am going to move up north since I am in Southern California. The only concern I have for my learning and my well-being is am I getting the full potential out of lecture and lab and for my well-being is am I staying healthy."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,172,"I feel like online classes have been pretty hard this semester. Last semester, when we transitioned to online, I didn't really have any troubles at all. This semester, however, feels completely different. This has been the most stressful semester for me. Right when the semester started, I already wanted it to end. Maybe I feel this way because one of my CS professors is making their class harder than it usually is because we are online, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me. He said the reason he is doing this is because we are online and have access to the internet for the tests, but he proctors us on zoom during exams. The first midterm he gave was so hard that maybe 80% of the class wasn't able to finish it. Enough about that, I have been going for walks when I feel stressed out, and I also sleep to help better my well-being. Even though this semester has been very stressful, I am trying to push through."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,164,"Online has been nice in that I don't have the really do much to be in class but at the same time, it has made me even lazier than I was when we had in person classes. Personally, since I'm a CS major, I don't really mind the online atmosphere. Most of the time, I wouldn't have approached the prof in person anyways to ask questions. Obviously the material for classes like this have to be changed a bit but overall, I'm indifferent about this. The biggest thing happening to me now is that I do no movement. Before I had to walk from class to class but even then, that was the extent of it. Now, I sit in front of my computer for pretty much the whole day every day."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,151,"Online classes have definitely impacted my learning for the worse, which I’m sure is true for many other students right now. It’s weird because everything feels like homework, so it feels like I’m always in school. I also absorb information much better being face-to-face with the teacher, so it has been difficult in many of my classes to watch a Youtube playlist and hope that something sinks in.One thing that I miss is being able to plan fun things for myself as rewards for doing well in my classes. Now that I can’t see any of my friends due to COVID restrictions, it’s difficult to recharge my social battery and lighten my mood. I am definitely concerned that I’m not learning as much as I should be, or as much as I would be if we had in-person classes right now. It has also kind of felt like the apocalypse for 8 months with COVID, the fires, civil unrest, and the election. Definitely harder to motivate myself to finish coursework when I’m worrying about other things that I have little to no control over.For self care my dog has been taking me on walks everyday. She’s pretty much the only thing that gets me out of the house regularly, besides grocery shopping."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,157,With the switch to online classes since the duration of quarantine I find that the overall quality of my education and ability to learn has dropped. I notice that teachers feel stressed as they are adjusting to a difficult time and how that has affected their overall teaching. It becomes an increasingly difficult task for them to keep students motivated and focused on what to learn as their students are surrounded by one distraction after another. Even being on the pc online I have different applications that are readily available that I can use at any point in time that take away my focus from what the teacher is trying to explain and have students learn. It becomes very simple when it’s merely just a click away. I find that some courses have become purely learn on your own as well as the main teaching method is just watch a video on the topic that the teacher didn’t make themselves or read the textbook to learn the material.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,153,"Online learning has definitely been a learning curve for me. There are benefits to it; I enjoy not having to deal with commuting and getting extra sleep time. However, I feel as though the negatives outweigh the positives. With online learning I feel as though deadlines are harder to keep track of, lecture is harder to pay attention to, and motivation is much lower. To help with keeping track of things, I have started writing in a planner, which helps to visualize important events. As for motivation, this is something I still struggle with. I have found that exploring new hobbies has helped improved my drive, but I still have periods of time where I completely lack motivation to work."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,154,"I don't really like online classes. I would rather be in class in person. It's easier to ask for help, ask classmates for advice when I can see them. Now with classes online, I barely talk to my classmates. No one really say anything during lectures. And everyone logs off after lectures. I understand most have other classes to attend, but it would be nice to talk to some classmates on their thoughts of the lecture to get their opinions or to find out where everyone was confused or stuck on. I have no idea when we can go to in person classes, but I hope it's soon. For selfcare I am getting the rest I need between work and class. I take breaks between homework sessions and I exercise. There's really not much I can do during a pandemic. I would like to go to the movies, the beach, see my friends, but everyone is staying home not seeing each other. I'm just doing what I can in this situation to make sure I don't go crazy."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,171,"As is probably obvious from my work ethic during the semester, I found it very difficult to sit down and focus on doing any assignments. Something about being home all day made me lose track of time and I would often forget assignments were due, or find it difficult to have any motivation to do them. I think the hard deadline definitely helped though! It also served as a good review for my physics final that's coming up, haha. I've also found it difficult to maintain contact with many of the people I was friends with in high school. I went from talking to them daily during the school day to only talking to most of them maybe once every couple weeks. One thing that has definitely helped keep me sane is calling my close friends through facetime and discord. Because we take similar classes, I can ask for help on a question or for them to clarify something. More importantly though, I enjoy just talking to them about whatever is on our minds. Sometimes we'll play a game together, other time's we'll all be listening to music while studying whatever we need to. In a way, it helps keep me connected to those I care about most."
