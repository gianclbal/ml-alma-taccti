2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,172,"My greatest take away from this class is that physics is hard, but if you incorporate some other activities then it can help you learn better and have a bit of fun. When I first registered for my physics class (PHYS 220 and PHYS 222), I was nervous because I had a friend say physics was pretty hard and that just made me worry more. After my first week of classes, I thought it was going to be impossible for me to pass both physics classes because I wasn't understanding the material at all because it is hard for me to focus for online classes. As the weeks passed and the more labs I did, I began to gain a slight understanding of the material, which was a lot better than before. Because my PHYS 220 class and PHYS 222 class are, more or less, usually studying the same topics for that week, I was able to do the lab and gain an understanding and for things I didn't understand, I just went to my PHYS 220 office hours to help. So even though physics is still a subject that I struggle with, I am glad that SFSU makes you take 220 and 222 concurrently because it definitely helped me a bunch because there was a balance of labs and textbook stuff."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,171,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that physics is present throughout our daily lives. For each of the labs summaries, I was able to come up with at least one way that the physics concept could apply to real life scenarios. I think that's the main reason that Physics is my favorite subject to study. It's easier to imagine how a spring works or how a car makes a turn than it is to comprehend something like bonds in chemistry or the intricacies of the human body for biology. The summaries really helped me think more about this concept. By thinking about the concept in a real world scenario, I was able to more easily comprehend it when it came to in class work. I'll definitely continue using this strategy in future physics classes."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,162,"My greatest take away from the class is learning independently and making applications to real life. In a normal lab, I would normally work in groups. But since this is an online class I have learned how to manage to do labs independently and managing my time as well. This class also encourages me to think about how I would apply something to real life. It makes the class meaningful since I think about the material learned. In other classes, most of the time I would mindlessly do assignments and wouldn’t really think about how the material learned can be used outside of class. Also, I think this class is the only class outside my major class that has applications to my job. Since my major is computer science, I don’t really use any of the general education art classes or English classes I take. But I do use physics for game development when coding."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,166,"Oh boy, my greatest takeaway from this class? I really do not like physics and I am going to be glad to be done with it. I definitely prefer the purely digital, software side of my major. Honestly, I'm just taking this class because I have to. If I didn't have to take Physics for my major, I wouldn't. I'd fill my science requirement with something like biology or chemistry, that I actually like. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,158,"My greatest take away from this class is that these labs at least gave me the knowledge I need to know how physics worked, even though we don’t have a hands-on lab a lot due to the pandemic. I really enjoyed the online labs that I’m given a lot through this class. They are usually easy for me to complete and the simulations I used in the lab are interesting. The only hard part throughout the labs is that sometimes I have to solve complicated math problems using various methods and formulas. But overall most of the parts of the lab are easy for me to navigate, even though some labs are very long to complete."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,169,"This class has taught me a lot over the course of this semester. Physics has a lot more numbers and calculations than I really knew about before taking this course. There is a lot of calculations and actions occurring in the background of real life situations that I never really took in consideration before taking this class.I have also learned that in-person classes don't even compare to these online lab simulators. I feel like the class would've been more fun and experimental if we were in person working in groups and doing these labs together in person! The simulations are okay for me but it just doesn't feel the same as an in-person lab experiment. I also miss how the instructor was able to demonstrate the lab to us before we would attempt it on our own. This would give us a perspective of what we could expect going into the lab.Overall, this course has taught me a lot. I have enjoyed it and learned a lot."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,155,"Astaria PodestaStanley, RaePhysics 220-06November 4, 2020My greatest take away from this class is that physics is not as intimidating as I initially expected. I thought it was going to be a lot more complicated equations that I didn't understand and lots of me being really confused. While I do get confused at times, I find myself understanding more of how each equation works slowly. I am also finding that I am looking at the world around me differently and how physics ties in with many many things. Another take away I have from this class is that having confidence in my answers really helps the outcome. I am the type of person who constantly second guesses my answers and over complicates equations. Here it is more straightforward than math classes I've taken in the past. It has been nice to have an understanding instructor as some classes and labs I've taken, I've had instructors who wee reluctant to answer and help. It makes the experience so much better and easier to learn when having an instructor who will start from step one. That is what I appreciate the most about this lab class. It has given me hope that I might be able to continue in physics."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,152,"The biggest impact I’ve experienced from this class is the understanding that work should be done piecemeal. My experience with online classes totally changed my view of them. Previously I would’ve told you that online classes are way easier than courses in person, however now that I’ve experienced around a full semester of them, I’ve come to the realization that they’re much harder than real classes. I honestly didn’t anticipate the degree to which time management and other independent study habits would impact my success in classes, compared to classes in person. I’ve learned to set up a system which allows you to complete all of the work for a class at a reasonable pace, all while keeping up with my other classes. Being able to pace myself and control my class material is a pretty good way to put these into practice."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,161,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that you can learn about physics and how it works through stimulations. I always thought to learn about physics you had to be in class in person and do labs. However, I never imagined that you could learn about physics through stimulations such as the ones we used this semester. This semester really gave me a different view on learning, and I learned how there are numerous stimulations I can use to learn about physics. For future reference if I ever come across a physics question that I don't understand I will use the stimulations to help me.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,160,"What was my greatest take away from this class?In this lab class, I learned a lot of things that made me understand what I learned for PHYS 222. I love this class. It has many simulations that can help me do the lab to know how PHYS's knowledge is and work. I can understand how  PHYS happened in my life and why that happened. So, the greatest take away from this class is made me understand why it works like this and how it works and make sure by PHYS simulation. It is interesting for me to learn in this class by the lab. I love lab exploration every week because it made me understand what I learn clearly.  It also opened my world view in my life. I am interested about what the world is and what happened when I have motion every day. There is my greatest take away from this class."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,157,My greatest take away from this class was a reinforcement to what I had learned in my non lab portion of my physics course. The simulations let me experience what I learned in the other course and have a better visualization of the concept. We get to see the concepts happening before us making it more interesting to learn and overall more enjoyable experience.  It provides me more opportunities to discuss the concepts and ideas we went over with my classmates as well. If I feel like I am confused I have others that are learning the same topics as me that I can ask for help.  
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,167,"I would say that my greatest take away from this class is the importance of making and then testing predictions because, more often than not, concepts in physics are not as intuitive or straightforward as they initially seem. For example, it seems reasonable to assume that momentum is conserved based on the same or similar factors that result in energy being conserved, but this is not the case. I would argue that making this incorrect prediction actually works to improve one's understanding of conservation because it eventually leads to the right answer as well as why the prediction was wrong. For this reason, I appreciate all the lab exploration assignments requiring predictions before testing them with a simulation. Most if not all of these eventually led to a greater understanding of not only the real-world applications, but also the math that proves how and why things behave the way they do. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,150,"I first learned the material that is covered in this class in my high school AP physics class. However, I feel that this class definitely helped broaden my knowledge on these topics and go more in depth through the lab experiments. I believe my greatest takeaway from this class would be that I truly understood what I was taught in labs, and summarizing it all at the end as well as the post lab knowledge check really helped. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,154,"My greatest take away from this class will be developing an intrinsic understanding of classical physics so I can use that to solve problems in real life. Sure everyone can just memorize equations and recognize patterns of when to apply those equations, but that's kind of boring and cheating. Even if I don't do well in this class. If I can get a better understanding of physics and how it interacts with the real world it would be a good take away for me from this class. It would also be helpful in real life situations if I can apply what I learn into a skill set I can use. I think most people taking a math or physics course are just trying to memorize the equations and when to apply them and I think that's going about it the wrong way. It's not really learning. If everyone can develop a fundamental understanding of what is being taught then learning would be a lot more fun."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,175,"I believe that the greatest take-away from this class would be a change about how I view the world around me, as well as a new outlook for my classes going forward in my academic career.  I have noticed that between this physics class and my other STEM classes that I am taking this semester, the way I view my environment has changed.  For example: when I make a cup of coffee in the morning and pour a spoonful of sugar into the hot coffee, I think about the interactions going on inside of the cup and why that is.  I also have a new outlook for the classes that I will take in the upcoming semesters.  This most important thing I think I have learned is that I shouldn't fear formulas and explanations that use crazy notation or look weird.  Despite being foreign to me, the math itself behind it is very straightforward.  I just have to get used to the unique notations that are used, specifically in physics."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,153,"Through this course I was able to go more in depth into concepts that I had learned about previously in high school. I felt as though the simulations, while not ideal, did a good job of illustrating these concepts. In particular, I thought that the lab for projectile motion was the most intuitive. This course has also helped me organize my thoughts regarding labs more clearly, and helped me relate my findings to real world situations."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,168,My greatest take away from this class are newtons three laws of motion. They are a huge take away for me because we use these laws and witness them on a daily basis and without them we wouldn't be able to describe the relationship between a body/system and the forces acting on them as well as the way the body reacts in motion with response to the force acting on it. This class helped me further my knowledge on those laws and apply them to the real world and gave me a better understanding as a whole to newtons ideas. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,159,"This class was very informative and fun while it lasted, but I wish it were in person because I learn better that way.After taking this class I would say my greatest takeaway from it would be all the lab interfaces and how important it was for my understanding of these physics topics, without them I would definitely be doomed because I need some hands on or visual representation to help me learn. I would also say that the lab for week 5 was my favorite and really showed me why I liked physics because it was simple to understand and you could use common sense to solve most of the problems. Lastly another take away I had for this year in general is that it's good to plan out your assignments for the week so that you stay on top of it otherwise the work will start to pile up and then things will start to get harder."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,165,"What was my greatest take away from this class? I would have to say my greatest take away that I took from this class is that online lab courses aren't putting my education at risk. That is my first thought before I took this class was that I won't get the full experience of being in a laboratory course which is a given. However, I do not feel that my learning was mitigated from taking this lab course from home. I learned a variety of concepts that will help me throughout my educational journey and I should be grateful that I can still pursue my degree during these tough times."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,176,"I think I was able to gain a lot from taking this class. There were things that I remember learning from high school, so some of it was good to refresh my memory on what I already knew but there were also a lot of more in depth things for each topic that I did not learn in high school. But other than the actual contents of the class I was also able to learn a lot. This was my first time taking a lab/lecture course and I was also taking this with a chemistry lab/lecture so I was really pushing my limits. I think I was still able to be pretty successful but I probably wouldn’t want to do that again in the future unless I absolutely needed to. I have taken an engineering lab but it was just the lab with no lecture so it was a little different where these labs were more material heavy."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,164,"It's hard to say what I will take away from this class cause it just feels like another class that I have to get through. But I guess if I had to say, this class shows you how you can finish your work early and just not have to worry about it later in the week. This is the one class where I feel more inclined to do the work early. Maybe because it is easier than my other classes but there is just this urge to get it done early. When I look at my other classes like my coding ones, I may have a decent understanding of the subject but I cannot for the life of me want to start early and not stress about it later on. I just wish that that feeling was strong enough to motivate me and change my general habits but that’s just human nature."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,170,that I need to keep up with my work this semester has taught me i need to be able to motivate myself even if i don't want to do something i need to get better at looking at the big picture of thing if i keep going in and stay on track i will get to where i want to be and i will succeed this is just something I'm going to have to drill into my head and understand.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,163,"My biggest take away from this class, as well as the other classes I’ve taken this semester, would be learning how to do classes completely online. It’s been really necessary for me to learn how to keep a schedule or calendar on when my classes are, keeping updated with assignments, and reaching out for help. If I’m considering the content of the class, I think a lot of the labs have helped me get a better understanding of physics that happens in everyday life. I’ve never taken a physics class before so connecting our labs to real situations in the world is what has helped me both understand things that may seem like basic motions in real life, and also helped me understand important concepts in physics that may relate to my math classes and hopefully to my future career in computer science."
