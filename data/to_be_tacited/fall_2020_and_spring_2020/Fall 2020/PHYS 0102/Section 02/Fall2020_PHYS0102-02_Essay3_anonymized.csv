2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,27,"Samantha Elena Mena  When life gets too challenging, I tend to get really overwhelmed. I am my harshest critic and that does not help me out when I am stressed. I always try to prevent myself from getting to that point, so I get really hard on myself when it does get to that point. Recently I have felt this way. I have picked up a job this semester and I am trying to run a small business. Due to my jobs and school, I have been feeling really overworked. Around the half-way mark into a semester is usually when my drive tends to decline. My work ethic is not at 100% as it usually is at the beginning of a semester. I constantly have to fight that lazy part of myself and the mean discouraging part. I always get out of that funk eventually and find a happy place when I can healthy work."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,7,"Jose Castillo   Oct 8, 2020     When life get challenging I ultimately give up. It doesn’t give me hope. It’s probably   how my mindset is. I tend to change that by being around with people who are working with   there life and actually maintaining a lot better then from where i’m at. It does get difficult form   me most of the time because I sometimes give up quicker then most other people. If something   doesn’t go as planned then I just end up losing that drive or motivations but I know life is not   suppose to be easy so I just keep that in my head and try to figured out another way to do better.   Honestly right now i’m trying to do better and it’s challenging for me with all these zoom classes   and covid and just gave me a new wall I have to overcome. These pass semesters i’ve been   fucking up and mostly because that’s on me I don’t commit and I don’t ask for help when there   giving to me and I want to change that. So I started taking deep breaths sometimes listen to   music, exercise and just clear my head and I just try my best to push myself even if it’s a little   push just so I can do better things I want to see new result in my life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,25,"When life gets challenging, I take a step back to just see exactly what things are   going on and to take a breath. How can we even start to fix problems when we   don’t know what they are and what is causing them? I would take a deep breath   and start prioritizing the problems to avoid wasting time and so that I wouldn’t   end up spending too much time on the least important problems. I’ve noticed that   it helps me to take deep breaths to avoid myself letting my emotions get the best   of me and just give up. There’s been so many times where I’ve been struggling in   school that I wanted to just give up because I let my emotions get the best of me   and make me think that I have no way to move forward. However, after taking a   step back to think rationally and reach out for help, I was able to solve the   majority if not all of my problems. It’s good to be independent and solve your own   problems but that doesn’t mean that we must always bear every single burden on   our shoulders until we crash."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,29,"Reflection #5 	When life gets challenging for me it's usually because a lot of stuff is happening at once. When this is the case it is a big struggle. I fight within myself to make sure I don't give up, something that nobody can do but me, and that's really hard. When my mind isn't in the right place and things just keep going wrong and adding up it feels like i'm trying to swim against the current, and it makes me question and overthink everything, like if what i'm even doing is even worth it. I'm a first generation college student and it's really hard because my family doesn't know the struggles I go through to balance that and a job that I only have 1 day off from. When things start going crazy and just thinking about the things i need to do affects me i really try to take care of my mental health in that moment because if i dont there won't be any way of making it back to normal."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,18,"What do I do when life gets challenging?     I have a history of ​   ​ distracting myself when situations feel challenging. I always have to   fight against the bad habits that feel most natural to me, but since deciding to take school more   seriously I have been more aware of how to make changes. I get the most benefit out of   keeping an eye on my sleep schedule, chunking assignments into parts so that I don’t get   overwhelmed, and staying social with people close to me. Concerning school I sometimes have   to remind myself why I’m going through it and building up excitement for the material, so I’ll find   some subject matter that gets me interested. Having a physical planner or schedule also helps   me stay organized so that I’m not just relying on information floating around in my head."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,15,"When life gets challenging the number 1 and most important rule that I have for myself is to never give up. Life is obviously not easy it comes with work to be successful and to get to the point where you want to be in life. There is always going to be barriers and bumpy roads to get pass. To get pass I that I just take a break on a task I am doing for a little just to refresh my brain and feel relax/comfortable. At first hand I try to take on things myself because it is important for me to learn how to navigate in life myself before looking for help. If it does come to that point, I will use my resources that I have access to for support. Also, another thing that is find an alternate way if that is possible because something that get challenging have more than one approach to the situation. AT the end, it matters how you made it and was able to preserve through the tough times that were in the way."

I also try to look at things in a positive point of view and only focus on what I can control. When it comes to education, work, or life in general I will become aware on what’s challenging and go forward about the situation as best I can. If a break is necessary, I will take one. Stopping and reﬂecting is key to making changes because I will be able to make sure that I’m traveling in the right direction. I will also ask for help and seek someone who has overcome a problem similar to mine."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,5,"Karla Martinez  Phys102  10/8/20 ""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" For the past year and half life has gotten way more challenging than ever for me, I been through a lot and before all that happened life was already challenging but what my family always tell me is that everything that cost us so much hard work and gets more challenging will be worth it at the end than things that comes easy and I do believe that. Whenever I feel that I am failing in life I get up and I keep fighting for it. Whenever I feel like I am giving up I always remind myself all the hard work I have done and all I been through and that I been through worst moments in life and that nothing will stop me now. I do believe that whenever life gets challenging that moments makes us stronger and prepare us for whatever comes next. I always look for something positive whenever I am feeling down."

Challenges can motivate us in ways we have never known, but there are times when you must ask yourself if the challenge is worth it or if I am going in the right direction. When I come to the conclusion that this challenge will help me grow, I put my head down and power through to get it done because I know in the long run I’ll gain something from it. If the challenge is too much for me to attack on my own, I will seek help from my peers or someone more experienced in the field. If the challenge is something that is not helping me grow, then I cut my losses and find a new venture to tackle."

When life gets challenging it is very difficult for me to get my head straight, I stress a lot and   sort of loose control and will probably break down and would want to be left alone. What I have   managed to do in order to feel productive during a challenging moment is to have a busy   schedule and just dedicate it to working, when I do that I feel like I'm not wasting time and   earning money. But when I’m alone I try to reflect on my life and see what choices I can make in   order to get back on track, I also try to heal mentally by writing poems or doing arts and crafts or   maybe rearrange my room to see different perspectives. Life has its ups and downs but we just   have to learn how to control it which is hard in the beginning but throughout time we learn how   to manage."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,37,When life  Gets challenging I like to try and find smaller pieces to the problem. I try not to let the  world overwhelmed me  but I am human and sometimes that does happen. Instead of looking at  the whole challenge as a big picture I find little things that I can accomplish in that challenge.  It's still a work in progress of trying to get better at not letting life get too overw helming for me  but I am definitely a lot better at dealing with the challenges of life . when life also goes  challenging I rely on my family An d my friends to help me through any difficult times that I am  having. We can't always do everything b y ourselves b ut we can outreach to our loved ones . I  also like to listen to music to try and distract myself from any of the overwhelming feelings I get  when facing any challenge.  WORD COUNT 154
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,31,"What I do when life gets challenging is, I do a lot of self-care. Whether that be listening to my favorite music, taking a warm bath, eating my favorite meal, playing with my dog or hanging out with friends and family to distract me from these challenges. I do all of these things to calm me down in a way and to be prepared to face these challenges head on. And I know through these challenges that I will have the support from my family and friends to lean on, so I know any challenge is worth getting through."

2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,13,"I will address this as if you’re talking about something awful. First I feel. I usually feel frustrated, angry, anxious, worried, confused, or lost. Then I think of ways to fix it or overcome the obstacle. I stop and think about what the possible choices and outcomes are and weigh the pros and cons of each. I pick the outcome I want and a few that I wouldn’t mind, and work on a strategy to achieve them. Then I vent. I call my friends or family and I talk through it. I tell them what’s going on, how I feel about it, what I think are the potential outcomes and the strategies I have thought of. I ask for feedback. They’re always supportive and are all really intelligent and highly experienced people in various realms. Talking with them usually cements my decision, or reveals new possibilities in either outcomes or strategies. I also will do research and get a better understanding of the situation and potential factors, and to talk to people who have expertise in whatever area it is in. I’m never hesitant about asking for help. Lastly, I try to keep perspective. I usually use something in the same category as an example. I think about it historically. I’ll look at my past and go, have I ever run across this before? How did I feel about it then? How did I handle it then? Where did I go wrong or right? What can I learn from that experience? When I think about that incident, how does it make me feel now? Do I still feel (not think) the same way about it as I did then? Are those negative emotions strong now remembering the past? The answer to those last ones is always no. So, I can conclude that in the same amount of time in the future, how I feel now will be a distant memory that I won’t be able to actually feel. That usually allows me to calm whatever feeling of anxiety, anger, frustration, etc. that get in the way of me thinking clearly, and analytically that are potentially stalling my ability to tackle the problem. I set out a plan, with some contingencies and then just push through, because I know that in a month, a year, a few years what ever this challenge is will be irrelevant.  If it’s just something unexpected that isn’t awful, but rather a new experience I tackle it almost the same way but with positivity. Like it’s a fun game to be won, or puzzle to be solved. I enjoy the process of learning and growing. I find it invigorating, exciting, and fun."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,3,"Reflection #7     As this semester has been one of challenges and new experiences I have definitely had time to   reflect and observe how I deal with them. Typically I deal with my issues similar to most I feel   like. Most of the time it’s finding what the issue is, taking time to process it and find a solution for   it. If there isn’t a solution I try to accept what has happened and move on. If the issue is too   much for me to handle I usually ask for advice from the peers around me and try to take their   advice as fuel for a possible solution. I am a fairly quiet person so most of my issues are dealt   with by myself. Even though others may not agree I actually think this is a really good way to   build mental fortitude and become a stronger individual, preparing you for when tough times   come around again."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,34,"Pamela Li   Phys 102.02   10/8/20     What do I do when life gets challenging?     When life gets challenging, I reach out to a friend that I know I can vent to or I just go to bed   and try to forget about it. Although, sometimes I ponder on the stressor a bit too much and end up not   being able to sleep. Struggles of an overthinker. Sometimes, I would isolate myself in the room and   avoid talking to anyone. I also watch youtube, Netflix, or Kdramas to try and keep thoughts out   temporarily. I try to distract myself from the situation. I also am more motivated to do homework or   study if life gets challenging for some reason. Probably why I packed my schedule very well this   semester, although I do get lazy and there are some things I don’t enjoy doing. I’m doing two   volunteer work and I have a part time job. One of the volunteer places I work with is Asian Health   Services and it’s online. I am basically a part of their phonebanker team and it’s kind of draining   talking to people when you’re tired. There might also be chances where you might get a rude   response but we are allowed to hang up on them. I need at least 20 hours for one of my class and I’m   really not enjoying it. Another volunteer place I’m working with is at BEST Physical Therapy. I’m a   PT aid volunteer so I get to move around a lot which is nice. The clinic is slow and it’s a lot more fun   than being a phonebanker. As for my job, I’m a teacher’s assistant. It’s an online position so I have to   prerecord my videos and have one on ones with the children (hasn’t started yet). I’m just trying to get   the 20 hrs done for Asian Health Services as fast as I can."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1,"Reflection #3: What do I do when life gets challenging?   Whenever life starts to get challenging, I do a few things to keep myself on the right track. One   of those things is taking time to focus on my breathing when I start to get overwhelmed or begin   overthinking. I found that this is a good way to combat any type of stress and anxiety, as it gives   the mind a chance to take a break. Sometimes I just take a good twenty to thirty minutes to just   lay down in a quiet environment and take a combination of normal and deep breaths. This really   helps to ease my mind and when I get back to whatever I need to do, I find that I am able to be   more productive. It is basically meditation and has helped me a lot throughout college when   things start to become stressful and overwhelming."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,19,"When life gets challenging, I just move on or at least to move on. To me, I don’t see why   dwelling on the past and struggles will do me any good, so I try to “ignore” it or don’t think too   much about it. But when it comes to challenges in school, I try to reach out to professors or   fellow classmates for help. Every challenge has a weakness, and all I have to do is find it and   solve it. I always try to remember, it is what it is."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,26,"Reflection #3  When life gets challenging, I am not ashamed to say I am quick to cry. I feel as though taking time to just get out all of my stressed and strained emotions provides me the space to move forward in a better mindset and be ready to make whatever changes necessary to handle the issue at hand. I also think that doing self-care during challenging times is really important. There is nothing more relaxing to me that a nice hot shower to ease my muscles and lighting one of my favorite candles. I also think ice cream is the answer to everything, so that always helps. Overall, I just really like to stop and remind myself that I am only human and sometimes things happen that are out of my control. I may not be able to fix everything all the time, and hopefully one day I won’t feel like I have to. I enjoy just being able to click the restart button on myself, and taking the chance to just breathe and move past things."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,32,"When life gets challenging luckily I have friends and family that I can seek out to for help or   advice. Living far away from home for so many years has taught me to be patient with life and to   work hard in order for things to fall in place. At times we may feel like we are stuck or down   because of a certain situation and when this occurs I try to not over worry or have it constantly   in my mind because there are other things in my life that need to get done. I say this because in   the past I have let a certain situation get in the way of things and it’s almost as if my priorities   were all wrong because of one situation. However, once you learn how to deal with that   situation everything tends to become better. Nowadays when I am feeling stressed or down I   communicate with friends and family and not even necessarily about what is bothering but more   about catching up. Also a gym sesh never hurts the mind and body."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,10,"When life gets challenging I try to take a break and slow down so that I can recharge. Sometimes I usually just take a nap and don’t worry about any of my work, other times I go outside and work out until I am ready to work again. Know that I have access to Amazon and other shopping outlets I usually look for things that I don’t need but I’d love to impulsively buy items I may not need."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,23,"When things get difficult, I try to make a plan on what to do. I also like to be in a room by myself   and just think. I think it really calms me down and I think it's not the end of the world if I don’t do   that assignment. I also just push through it by drinking alot of sugar and staying up the night. I   usually like keeping thing to myself and eventually deal with it one at a time."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,22,"Austin Noriega   10/8/20   PHYS202   Reflection     When life gets challenging, there are many things that I like to do to decompress.   One of the things that I like to decompress is walking outside. I really like getting to   experience nature and just walk to ease my mind.  One of my favorite parts about   walking outside is watching the sunset, it is one of my favorite things to watch because   it is really calming. I also like to play video games with friends when things get   challenging. There is a sense of calmness that eases over me when talking with the   people I like and it really sort of refreshes me to keep doing what I am doing. There is a   sense of focus that comes with listening to music when working on my tasks for the day   and it seems to really help me focus and stay grounded in my work without trying to do   anything else."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,9,"Reflection 3   When life gets challenging I used to cripple under the pressure and scrutinize everything that I did to get myself to that point this was when I first started college when I began my journey into adulthood because I saw that as a place where I had to take responsibility for all actions and at the time that meant if messed up it’s because I didn’t do something right and I would get down on myself and eventually just give up under the pressure that I mounted up for myself. However with time came more experience and with this experience I began to learn more and more about myself, nowadays when life gets challenging I no longer buckle under the pressure but rather take a step back if necessary and access my own situation, then I begin to take steps to control what I can manage and begin to make a plan to ease my mind because when life gets challenging for me is when there are too many variables and I begin to lose sight of what I am actually capable, so planning helps me to better reprioritize and reorganize to give myself a timeline of what my best predicted outcome would be for me because I believe challenging times are times that come and go and I try to set myself up to navigate that period as best as I can."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,12,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?""     When life gets challenging, I feel like I take a lot of time for myself just so that I do not feel in   a rush or in a state of panic. I think that is the best way for me to handle when things get   challenging and things end up not going the way I want it to go. I also tend to take a break   from things that stress me out like school or work and I just try to relax and when I feel   ready to take those challenges head on, I will come back and do what I need to do to get   luck back on my side or just straight up complete whatever needs to be done. If I don’t take   that time for myself, I feel like I put my stress onto other people and I think that is really toxic   so I deal with things that challenge me on my own. I’ll talk to friends as a way to destress or   binge watch something on netflix to take my mind off of these stressors. Something that   never fails to bring me the confidence to tackle anything I need to is to get a haircut (unless   I already got one) because it brings me confidence in how I feel, therefore transferring that   confidence into something productive."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,30,"When life gets challenging, I usually like to take some time for myself and do yoga while   listening to some music. Whenever I do yoga, I get the chance to just self reflect, think about   how I am feeling at that moment, and just check in with myself. I think it’s important to ask   yourself especially when you’re stressed, ”Did I eat today? “Did I get enough sleep last night?”   “What’s causing me to feel stressed lately?” “What’s something I can do to make myself feel   better right now?” Taking a moment to pause from everything really helps lessen my anxiety   because I’m in a space of just myself and my thoughts. Also when I listen to some of my favorite   music/artists, I feel really good about myself and it always puts me in a better mood whenever   I’m having a bad day. Doing karaoke with my sisters also makes me less stressed because it is   something my family and I love to do!!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,2,"One thing that I do when life is challenging is working out. I grew up playing soccer and it taught me a lot of life skills. How to problem solve and how to work hard. Life is like a wave and it will never be easy. However, when you work hard to get through things or past them, that is another life lesson to add to your pocket. So, working out is what I like to do to destress and take my mind off of things, but also thinking and trying to find ways to solve my problems."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,35,"What do I do when life gets challenging?   When life gets challenging or when I have concerns on my mind, I talk to myself a lot                                     and hash it out. Sometimes I’ll bring my dogs into my room so I have someone to look at and                                         talk to. I’ll explain things or imagine arguing with people, or just picture scenarios. It’s not really                                   therapy but it helps a lot. When I have a lot on my plate, I have to tell myself to just try my best                                                 and do what I can to get it done, that way I can look forward to the end of the week. I am not that                                                   motivated so I end up doing a lot of tasks last minute, which is terrible. What I need to do is                                           remind myself of the stress that I put myself through when I slack off like that, and know that I                                         don’t want to go through that again."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,36,"When life does get challenging, I notice I tend to overthink, insecure, and stress a whole lot.   When I do start to feel stressed out, that is when I know that I am getting challenged and that it   is just a time in my life I have to get through in the moment. I overthink usually about the   situation and think negatively. I know that is bad to do, but it is kinda a way for me to cope with   things when I am stressed out. One thing, I learned as you get older is that it is not bad for you   to talk about how you feel to friends and family. They are your support system! The good thing   is I don’t dwell on it too long and I just keep on going. Everyone experiences their own   hardships or challenges in life, but that is how it’s supposed to be. We learn, adapt, and build   ourselves up from these experiences to be the best version of ourselves."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,20,"Reflection #3  What do I do when life gets challenging?  	When life gets challenging, I resort to doing the things that bring me the most happiness. One of those things is photography. I’ve been taking photos ever since I was little. It is a hobby that brings me comfort and happiness. Whenever I feel overwhelmed with life, such as school and stuff, I usually just mess around and edit some photos, or just leave the house and go take pictures. Another thing I resort to when things get challenging is music. Music helps me unwind and look at the bigger picture. Whenever I have many things to do, I look at it as a whole and always get overwhelmed. It’s good to take it piece by piece. So, I just resort to hobbies that take the stress away. That is how I deal with challenges in life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,21,"Reflection #3   What do I do when life gets challenging?   There are times in life where you feel like everything is perfect and going smoothly but   on the other hand, we experience times where it feels like life is totally challenging. Personally   whenever one thing goes wrong for me, for some reason it feels like other things pile on top   making the situation feel even more difficult. When I am experiencing rough times I try to   always stay positive and optimistic and look at the brighter side of things. I tell myself that things   happen for a reason and life is challenging me right now to see if I can fight through the   struggles and be a stronger, better version of myself. I personally am a strong believer that   everything happens for a reason so when life throws us in a terrible direction, there’s a purpose   behind it. It’s to challenge you to see if you’re able to get through this and learn and grow from   the hard times. I also like to practice self care and love so when I do feel super overwhelmed and   like nothing is going the right direction, I do things that I enjoy. I distract myself from whatever   is making me feel stressed and focus on things that will relax me and make me feel at ease. Some   of those things include listening to podcasts, reading books, listening to music, working out, etc.   Although we all experience hard times in life, it is okay to cry or feel emotions because it is a   natural part of human beings and sometimes feeling those emotions help us feel better."
