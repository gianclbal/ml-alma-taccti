2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,35,"I was raised in an in-home daycare because that was my mom’s career, and my dad also worked at home too, in our garage as a Filipino martialartist instructor. My mom taught me patience and kindness but taught me important lessons by not spoiling me, and if I wanted something, I had to figure out how to get it myself. I learned to save a lot of my money as a child. I rarely ask my parents for anything such as money, mainly because I am lucky enough to still be living with them without them wanting me to pay rent. Seeing so many homeless people in San Francisco, my parents tell me to help if I can but be blessed with what we have."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,15,The values of my family have helped me navigate through college in a huge way because it means a lot and they have support me through my whole life. Thats is one of the reason I wanted to ensure an education route for myself because I want to make them proud being successful. The motto for my family is to break the cycle because of things they didn't get to achieve through there hard lives they had. That quote sits at the back of my mind and that is what I think about within everything I do .
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,2,"The values of my community and background have helped me in man ways. I grew up in a town where everyone knows everyone and that is what I found to be important to me. Now, everywhere I go, whether it is going away for college or starting a new job, I believe it is important to know your peers and find people that you can truly rely on.I apologize for the late turn in! I just realized I forgot to submit."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,26,"One shared value within my community is perseverance. It is really important to us to finish things once we start them, I think mainly because we're trying so hard to get rid of the negative stereotypes that cloud people's judgement of us. I have worked incredibly hard to make sure that I finish college, mostly because it is genuinely what I want to do, but also because I know that I would let down my community members if I did not complete what I started. I want to make sure that I keep climbing the latter of success so that my kids can have a better start in life than I did. I hope that this way of thinking that constantly encourages the accelerated start of future generations will eventually level the playing field and help ease some of the tension throughout the world."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,22,"Growing up, many of my family's values that were passed down to me were based on integrity, academics first, and to care for others as much as I care for myself. This applied in a college environment made me very schedule oriented and helped me focus on the assignments that I needed to finish. It definitely made me want to also focus on my own endeavors as well as I pursued the different avenues that college offered, both in social and extracurricular activities.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,24,"I was raised up in a relatively loving Christian household, and we hold our Christian values very close to our heart. No matter where I go or how far I stray from my beliefs, I tend to always find myself going back to God, whether it be during hard or lonely times. During school, depending on God to give me endurance and asking him to get me through the burn out helps and he always gets me through. I recently asked Him to help me get into the Kinesiology major, which is impacted, and I was nervous because I really needed to get in or else I would be in limbo; there would be no other classes for me to take. However, I gave that issue to God, and I let myself relax knowing He would take care of it. Honestly, I almost forgot about it and next thing I know I'm getting an email congratulating me on getting in. God really is good."

2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,23,"The expectation of my family is to go to college. Currently, I don't really know what I was to do in the future and kind of lost now. I am a only child of an immigrant family so I feel that there is a large expectation for me to succeed. I am just taking my G.E. and my pre req for my major but I not that passionate about it either. I just hope one day I find something I am really excited about."

2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,5,"The values of my community or my family It has helped me to navigate through college by helping me to become more responsible, strong and independent. Also, not giving up and keep working hard to achieve my goals. My family always taught me to be thankful for all the opportunities I have in life and seeing how hard they have worked helped me to work hard in college. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,7,"Reflection     I guess in a way my community does play role guiding me through college, just because   I grew up here almost my whole childhood and I know most people who live here didn't have the   opportunity to go do college or honestly the opportunities that I had. Is not a bad place but it   really does give me a sense were I can try finish school support my mom and hopefully get her   a house one day. And knowing the degree I'm trying to get would help me by helping my   community. My family does play a huge role when it comes to navigating through college   because I'm not just doing it for my benefit but for my family, I wanna give them a better life and   just repay them back for everything they done for me growing up."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,31,"Reflection #4My family has been my biggest supporters throughout college. I am the youngest in my family, so my older sisters and brothers know what it has been like to move away from home and be educated at a higher level. Knowing that I can message or call them at any moment for any problem or concern has helped me to get where I am today. I want nothing but to make them proud as well as myself. With going online these last 2 semesters I have only been provided with more support than ever. I am so thankful for them supporting me throughout this journey and I don’t know where I would be without them. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,20,"Both of my parents are from Poland and moved to the United States in pursuit of a better life. I was born in 2000, so it took me a while to fully appreciate the opportunities I was given due to the big sacrifice my parents made. This gave me a very strong push to finish school and make my parents proud and not waste the life that they worked so hard to provide me. They did not have access to the opportunities or the education that I am being given so I intend to go as far as possible. I can not understand the position that they faced and why they worked so hard to provide me the best life that they could."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,9,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college because it has equipped me with the tool of humility and integrity, this has allowed me to present my full self in all my work and this has helped me because it has helped me learn in college rather than just going through the motions of school. I actively participate in my learning now compared to when I first began college becuase I was not confident in who I was and by continuing to grow every year I have begun to understand that while I may not benefit 100% now the knowledge that I gain from college itself will be valuable in the sense that I get a greater world view and this view is one that is bigger than just the classroom. By maintaining my integrity in my work and humility in the sense that I don't know as much as I think day in and day out will result in my learning alot more than I thought which is not something that I would have said when I first began college."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,13,"How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?  The fact that my family values education has an impact on my own belief that being educated is something to strive for. The community of the workforce also values those with an education more. This is expressed through wages and desirability, people with more education get paid more, or are more likely to hired over people who do not. Society as a whole value knowledge, which comes through education as well as experience. People with higher levels of education are more likely to have more knowledge and are treated with more credibility. All these motivated me to go to college. As far as sticking with it and succeeding, the values of both American culture and my family, that if you put enough effort into something your can succeed at it, has helped my sense of confidence and self-efficacy. My family has appreciation and possession of curiosity, which makes it fun to share what I am learning. This also has the"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,27,"Samantha Mena  Yes my family has been my main source of inspiration and motivation to keep pushing through. Especially after the pandemic hit, I have had to move back in with my parents. At ﬁrst I did feel like I failed at “adulting” but quickly learned that a lot of my peers are going through the same situation. Ever since moving back in, I have developed a stronger bond with my parents that I did not have before. We have been more reﬂective with each other and the topic of my future is often the main subject. They have pushed me to keep my head up these past weeks as I have been having a tough time. My father often reminds me of my strengths and where my mind should be focused on. My boyfriend speciﬁcally reminds me of my values and provides some stability in my life. I tend to be extremely hard on myself and my boyfriend keeps me in check."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,18,"I don’t know that I’ve been a part of any larger community which helps navigate college. My family has always told me to take education seriously and they provide resources so that I can have a comfortable life outside of school but never gave me any lessons on how to make the most of it since they never had higher education. The people I surrounded myself with in highschool tended to be more focused on self destructive behaviors and didn’t really pass anything on to me either. Once I got away from those environments I could look back and remember individuals who I knew were diligent, and try to recreate what I thought they did in my own life, which is still a practice I’m doing my best to follow. That’s not to say my family didn’t provide me with other life lessons but for school specifically it’s easy to feel like I'm navigating blind."

2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,8,"Within my major, we have a fantastic community that helps and supports others. This is unique to our school. The same major at other universities do not have the same type of supportive community. I know for sure that my work would not be as good if the community as there is."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,19,"One of the values that my family has instilled in me is to stay humble. With this in mind, I   remember not to let things get to my head and kept me grounded. It allows me to work and   communicate better with fellow students. When I was younger, I was someone who liked to   work independently because I did trust others to do the work to the standard I wanted and I   thought only I could do it correctly, but the values that my family taught me started to teach me   that nothing can be complete if you do it by yourself. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. And the   whole point of working in groups and others is to teach you how to communicate with others. If   you don’t like something someone is doing, let them know so they themselves can improve. It’s   all part of the process."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,37,My community and my family have helped me stay motivated and my schoolwork by always believing in me. They always have taught me never to give up on my hopes and dreams in to work harder when things get difficult. Everyone in my family has a college graduate so therefore it rubbed off on me that I would be going to college. They have always motivated me to shoot for the stars so that one day I can create a life for myself and for my future family. I don’t always rely on them for my motivation since I am on this journey alone. But they definitely help me when times get tough.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,11,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college by providing constant support whether financially, emotionally, or physically. I am constantly pushed to become the best version of my self, thanks to my family. I still have lots of aspects that can be improved but I'm proud of where I'm at right now. College can be very difficult at times and the support of others helps me succeed and exceed expectations. Navigating through college has become somewhat ""easier"" because I've learned to become independent and ask for advice when it is needed. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,10,My family always pushes me to do the best I can academically. The friends I’ve made have always excelled in school and have pushed me to do well. My parents have never pushed anything upon me and backed me up on all of my choices. Most of my friends have chosen a major involved in healthcare and I’m sure I have been influenced to pursue a major that is related to the health field. My girlfriend has also influenced my choice of pursuing a minor in general business at SF State.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,30,"My family has helped me navigate through college because they want me to strive and achieve my goals. They give me some pretty good advice and tips for when I actually get a real job and things to keep in mind when doing school. Even though sometimes they can be pretty opinionated and judgemental on the decisions and choices that I choose for myself, they still somehow end up accepting what I choose. For example, my parents really wanted me to pursue nursing just like my sister, but knowing myself, I cannot see myself in 10 years from now as a nurse. I explained to them that I have other passions in life and am curious about trying new things and although it took awhile for them to accept (even still to this day), they are still proud regardless of where I am now. I'm currently a Kinesiology student planning on doing occupational therapy and my family is pretty excited and eager to see what the future holds not only for myself but for my other siblings as well! #supportivefamily <3"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,3,"My family values are fairly simple but very effective when considering how they apply to school and the work that must be done. Possibly the most important value that I’ve been taught by the people around me is determination. Since a child I was taught that I am not allowed to simply “give up” because I feel out of my comfort zone. This gave me the ability to really buckle down and push through the copious amounts of work and classes that are on my daily schedule. Another important value that I’ve learned is generosity. This is something my family constantly reminds each other of and are constantly trying to give their time in order to help others, even if it’s something small. This applies to my school life because it has taught me to always provide help for someone in need whether it’s tutoring or just a partner to support them in their work. This often provides me with a new found friend and a person that can support me in a time of need as well."

2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,32,There are plenty of things to value from family. For starters I value my parents for giving me all the support and help I have ever needed. Also I am grateful for the sacrifices which they have done to give me a better life. It is not easy to move to a foreign country and make a better life. I think that is one of the primary factors that have been pushing me to excel in college and life. They're grind doesn't go unnoticed and I am just hoping to return the favor one day by making them proud.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,14,"my family has been my roc my entire life. My parents have taught me to be kind a nd generous and I think that has translated to many other aspects of my life. And I thin my brothers taught me how to be patient and nurturing. I think even though my friends have always been there for me, my family has been my constant especially through some of my rougher times. I think now that I am older and can better understand my parents way of thinking, I an even more appreciative to have them. in college, I am motivated to make them proud and that is how I have gotten by. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1,"Reflection #4   The values in which I was brought up with have helped me a lot with navigating through   college and being able to overcome any type of obstacle that may come along the way. Growing   up, my family always taught me to be a hard worker and to stay consistent with everything I do,   even if it gets tough. These are some of the values that stuck with me as I got older and has   translated well going into college. When I first entered college two years ago, it was definitely   overwhelming as I was not used to the new environment and the workload was a lot crazier, but I   remembered how I was brought up and the values that have surrounded me all my life. The way   in which my family raised me and the values that I learned along the way are what shaped me to   be who I am today, and it’s definitely what has helped me a ton throughout my college   experience."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,4,"My parents and grandparents migrated to the US from the Philippines in the 70's. We are first generation citizens of the family. Many of my cousins had a hard time in school and most dropped out of high school. So it is really important for me to break that curse and graduate college. It will make my parents and grandparents so proud because it is their dream for their children/ grandchildren to become successful. This is the reason why they came here to the US because it is the ""Land of Opportunity"". Also, I have children of my own too so I wanted to set an example for them to follow. That even though I am older and in college, I still did the best I can to finish this race. It takes alot of hard work but in the end it will be worth it."

THers been a lot going on at home as you can imagine so im glad that the question today was about family because it allowed me to reflect personally about my family life and dynamic. Ive been blessed with parents that care strongly about my college successes and have always pushed to do my best. School; online has had its ups and downs for me, in particular I've struggled w having to get used to working around all of my family and having to get used to everyone quite time. On top of this my mom ha doctor visits for her eyes and a lot of times I have to take her to her appointments, that's something that I am very involved with."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,25,"The values of my community or family helped me navigate through college by reminding me of how important perseverance, hard work and patience is. You can’t expect to get anything done if you’re always wanting to get to the results immediately and don’t want to get through the “work” part. The thing is that you must work and have faith that your work will pay off later on whether in a subtle or very direct way. We tend to not realize the smaller rewards of our work because we constantly expect a big gift that would show up right in our face. If I always gave up on something that I failed at then I never would’ve been able to even get past the first year of school. Thus these values really helped me build a foundation to navigate through college. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,36,"The values I have learned from my family and community has helped me not only navigate through college, but also has helped me navigate in life. These values that I have learned from my family have shaped me into the person I am today. Without those values, I believe I would be a whole different person and probably would see things differently or react to things differently as well. The values from the community have taught me a whole lot on how to deal with people and also understand how society works. Few of these values I have learned from my parents is 1) treat people the way you want to be treated, 2) think positive/be positive, 3) give more than you take, 4) Work hard, 5) surround yourself with like minded people. These values have helped me pinpoint how to navigate through college, life, and how to connect with society as a whole."
