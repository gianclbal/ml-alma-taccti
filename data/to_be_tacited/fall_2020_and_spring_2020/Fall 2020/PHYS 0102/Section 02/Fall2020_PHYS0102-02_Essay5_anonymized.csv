Normally, I would have a lot of pressure from my family but they have been very understanding. I am very grateful as I am aware others have been impacted by the pandemic far worse than I have.

Professors provide feedback on my work and give me advice on how to improve on assignments which I can utilize with other situations if they tie in. Resources on campus help provide me with any info I need and there are many organizations and clubs that assist me with that. Whether I'm confused with my future, graduation, degree requirements, etc there are also counselors that can help assist with that as well. Personally, I feel like I have so much support from my family and friends. They are always there to give advice and feedback if I ever need it and provide their opinions when I ask for it.

2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,4,"Reﬂection 5: What resources do I have to support me? 	 It all depends on what we are talking about. If we are talking about Academics, the resources I have are my colleagues, professors and counselors. From experience, I know that I wouldn’t have made it this far in my education with out the help of my colleagues, patience from my teachers and advice from my counselors. I actually learned this more and more through out my college years. You have to ask for help if you need it, asking questions is critical to get better understanding of anything.  	 Personal resources I have to support me are my husband, family and friends. If I had to be a student, mother and an employee all by myself, I don’t think I’ll be able to. As they say, it takes a village to raise children, alone is a big responsibility. Sometimes I have a really hard time with my mental health, my anxiety and maybe depression. Having my people to count on is really important."

They do their best to provide me anything I may need in order to succeed so that I   can make them proud. Another resource that I have that supports me are my friends. Even   though they do not necessarily pay for my tuition as big of a resource as my parents, they   help me keep my sanity and are always there for any help I may need with school or any   personal problems. As much as I overlook my professors as a resource of support, they are   a good resource of support. Especially building a personal connection will often reward you,   because not only will you have someone to conversate with outside of the classroom they   will check in with you and give you an edge over those who don’t care to make a connection   with their professor. More opportunities will be presented to you through professors   because they have the authority or connections to make those happen."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,28,I have quite a few resources that can support me. One of the bigger ones is my grandmother who is allowing me to stay with her during this whole pandemic.

I know that no matter what part I am in my life, they’ll be there for me and support me as much as they can. I also have my sisters who are very supportive.

I appreciate them for providing the time and space for their students to get help if needed."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,15,"The resource that I to support me academically is the two productive programs on campus EOP and Metro. Both of these programs both support me in a huge way when it comes to college they have been there since I have got accepted into SFSU. They have went further and beyond to help me set up a successful education plan over the years. Also, when it comes to the class schedule they both are very supportive in helping build that semester by semester so that you are set up for success.

2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,26,I think I actually have a really strong support system between my partner and my parents.

Another, would be my family because they support me and make me happy all the time. Without them I feel it would be hard when I am on the low. Other resources I have is google or the internet because the internet has made education easier for me or easier for me to access things I want to know about or learn about! If you are at school, you should look for your counselors or advisors to help guide you through your college journey. They have been helping me and I think its well worth getting the help they offer. They helped me with resources to where I had understanding of which classes to take or even what to do for my career."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,20,"I have quite a bit of resource to support me on my journey through college.

2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,25,"The resources that I have to support me are my family, my friends, my connections from the programs that I've attended back in high school and the Metro program here at SF State. My family supports me by offering me support when I'm at my lowest points and providing food and shelter for me to simply put all of my attention into my academic work to ensure that I will be successful. My friends help me by relating with me to our struggles in school, they help me with schoolwork vice versa, and it helps to have someone to rely on if you don't understand the material and you're unable to ask the Professor. The connections from the programs are the people at CPMC Pacific Campus where I completed my internship, they can help me by setting up more opportunities for me to volunteer to get more hours. Lastly, the Metro program helps me by helping organizing my classes so that I can take the necessary classes and avoid wasting time. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,31,I have a good amount of resources that are able to support me. Most of my teachers offer office hours so if I am struggling with an assignment or not understanding what occurred in lecture I am able to go and talk to them. My second resource is the TASC center offered here at SF State. It is a tutoring center and I am able to sign up for an appointment and be offered tutoring even while being virtual. It is a huge help knowing that I am not alone while we face the challenges of being online.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,3,"Reflection #5   Manuell Kariuki   I feel that I have many resources that I am able to use to suppor t me. School staff is a   great example to start from. The many teachers, staff, and eleven student tutors provide a great   amount of assistance for issues that I have in school. Thi s involves issues in and out  of the   curriculum as well. I’ve had to contact and wor k with couns elors and administrators alike in   order to facilitate my transfer requirements and ot her needs. Anot her source of suppor t I have is   my friends and family of course. They help me in more ways than I can count, but the most   important thing to me that they provide is just someone to talk to.

2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,30,"Some resources that I have to support me academically are my school advisor/counselors, professors, and fellow classmates. There are also a lot of resources on the SFSU website that I typically first go to whenever I have a question about something. Sometimes I will also email the school if I need more clarification. Also, I have some close friends that I talk to to help me academically since we both have the same major. We hep each other out whenever we are confused about things such as what classes to take, what assignments are due, and anything else that comes to mind. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,35,"Academically, I havn't felt the need to reach out to my councelors or teachers lately but they have made it clear to me that they are there for office hours if I need it. When ever I did make appointments with my councelors, they always got back to me to arrange an appointment and check in with where I am at and where I should be on graduating. In my personal life, I have those around me that I care about and that care about me, like my friends and family. My parents and I are close but we get into feuds because we're all petty and stuborn sometimes, and I have a few friends that I'm tight with and can hang out in person with."

As a US citizen, a woman, and a student. I have a great network of family, friends, and my partner whom I trust to have my best interest at heart. Most importantly I have myself.

I have my intelligence, my knowledge, critical thinking, problem solving skills, and past experiences to draw from. I have my desires, ambitions, determination, and sense of self-preservation. I have put effort into building a strong sense of objectivity about my own perspective, as well as any situation I am in. I know that the combination of my personal experiences are unique to me, but that every individual experience has been experienced before by other people, past or present. The human ability to endure hardships, survive and heal is a common thread to our species and I am no exception. I am the greatest resource I have. "
