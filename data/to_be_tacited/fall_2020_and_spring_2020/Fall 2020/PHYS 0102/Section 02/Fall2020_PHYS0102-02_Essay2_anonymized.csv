2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,18,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""     My goals concerning school are to be able to provide for myself and have a career that I feel   connected to. I’d like to become a physical therapist or strength and conditioning coach. Beyond   meeting the requirements for a degree, taking this class helps me to learn about basic principles   of physics which can help to explain why certain movements or exercises could be more   beneficial to prescribe in different contexts of treatment. Being able to reason these things out   and explain them well is an important part of the job I’d like to have."

2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,20,"My goal in life is to become some type of healthcare worker, probably a nurse, but time will tell. Most of my family is in healthcare so I kind of want to pursue in those footsteps, but I also have a passion for it. My overall goal is to be well off financially so I can be able to travel the world and take photos. To be honest, that is what I want to center life around and visit as many places as I can. The healthcare field will provide me with good benefits as well which is a good plus in that career. Above all, I want to enjoy life and make fun memories."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,27,Samantha Elena Mena My main goal for this semester is to have a perfect report card. I would like to have all As. This specific class is helping me achieve this goal by my professor being accessible through zoom and email. I already had an issue with one assignment that could have potentially affected my end goal for this semester. My professor reached out to me and made me aware that there was an issue. This was helpful as a student as I feel like other professors I have had in the past would have left me in the dark. I was able to resubmit and got an A in that assignment. One surprising quality this class has helped me achieve my goal was the due date for assignments. This was unexpected but it has helped me remain organized this semester. I have been able to keep track of and space out my assignments throughout the week. This has helped me refrain from being overwhelmed and I can rely on my assignments being due on Sundays for this class.

2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,4,"REFLECTION 2  ""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?"" My goal is to get my Bachelor’s in Kinesiology and get in SFSU’s DPT program to become a Physical Therapist. I want to specialize in Pediatrics or working with Veterans. I am a Massage Therapist right now and I love my career. It is a very rewarding job. I am able to help people reduce their pain, stress and/or anxiety. I feel like Physical therapy is just a very advanced version of what I’m doing now. This class is helping me achieve these goals because I am learning about how things work, like how the life cycle of energy works. I can learn how body mechanics really work, diving deep about how the whole body works. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,35,"My goals for this class is to pass with an A, while understanding why things move the way they do. I can apply this to my major, Kinesiology, and to dive deeper, it can be applied to biomechanics and personal training. My goal in life is to become a nurse, but I am getting my Kinesiology degree along the way and would like to work in this field while perusing my nursing degree. they're both health related so I understand that I will appreciate them the same. The materials I learn from this class can be applied to teaching physical fitness and the physics of the body. It's good to have an understanding of this subject even if you're not entering to the field."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,32,Current goals I have include graduating this upcoming spring and trying to land an internship somewhere in a physical therapy workplace setting. As of right now I am currently attending PT and am actually trying to apply at the same place I am doing PT at. This class helps in reaching my goals by refreshing my memory on some of the important topics that are covered in physics. A lot of concept and ideas that are in physics I have actually applied to in other classes I am currently taking (anatomical kin) I am glad to be taking the course as looking at these physics problems makes me think of certain exercises I do in PT.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,2,My goals are to do my best during this time and while being online. I plan to earn grades that will satisfy myself and allow me to go further into my education. This class is helping me by staying on top of deadlines and applying what I learned into my major.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,30,"My goal for this semester is to pass all of my classes with at least an A because occupational therapy programs are competitive, so I am trying my hardest to push through these last few semesters at SFSU the best I can. This class can help me achieve my goal by learning more about how physics can relate to how the human body moves. Currently, I am having a difficult time adjusting to remote instruction and find that it is more hard to concentrate. But, I will try to continue being as motivated and confident in myself by taking a few breaks every now and then, going outside to get some fresh air, rereading chapters, and going back to recorded lectures/graded assignments so that I have a better understanding of the material being taught to me especially for this class. Labs are being taught online so I feel that I’d have to put in extra time and dedication to knowing the material since I’m not physically inside of a classroom and doing the lab with my lab group."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,11,"My goal is to become a musical artist. While that's in the works my backup plan is to receive a Bachelor's Degree in Kinesiology and eventually become a physical therapist. This class helps me achieve these goals by interacting with my fellow classmates, as well as problem solving. Physics extends well into our everyday life, describing the motion, forces and energy of ordinary experience. For everyday living, all the technologies uses the rule of physics. This is important for getting a closer understanding on why things work how they do, which in the end, can help achieve personal goals."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,3,"Reflection #2   This week was another challenging one. My work schedule has been kind of inconsistent as I had to make some changes because of the tournaments I had last and this weekend. This is why I had to miss class today, because I had work until 2. I also broke up with my girlfriend of five years today. These reflections sound a bit sad but my life is fairly normal for the most part. Good things that are going on are that my mom had a successful surgery and is recovering fine. I am also playing in a soccer tournament for $1,000 this weekend so fingers crossed. Sorry I am turning the lab in so late It’s been a long day."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,36,"I have many goals in mind that I want to achieve during my lifetime here. My goals at the moment is to finish this semester with a better understanding of physics and with good grades with my major kinesiology classes. With physics, this will help me in my other major kinesiology like biomechanics, physiology, anatomical kinesiology etc. This class will help me understand different laws that will correlate and help me understand with my major which is Kinesiology focused in exercise science with emphasis in movement sciences. Since I do want to get in to Physical therapy after my undergraduate, I know this class will help me prepare for that as well since each class I take usually guides me to the right direction and gets me prepared for harder classes moving forward. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,25,"My goals are to graduate college and getting into the nursing program. To do that, I must graduate with a Kinesiology major so that I can graduate with a health degree and find work while I join the Masters program for nursing. However, the nursing program isn't the only reason that I am striving to get a degree in Kinesiology. I am also interested in exploring the Physical Therapy field, I find it very fascinating to help people regain usage of their limbs after suffering an injury. It signifies that there are more than one way to help people, sure, you're not actively rescuing them from death but you're helping by assisting them in going back to the life that they had before the incident. This class is helping me through the fact that it is a prerequisite which means that taking this class would help me move along my journey to getting my Kin degree. From this class, I learn how important it is to gather every bit of data, how to organize them correctly and the most important part is that I learn about motion. How objects and our body move, what causes it to move and what stops the motion. It's something that no one really takes the time out to think about but it's actually really important to us. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,1,"Similarly to what I mentioned in my last reflection, my goal for the future is to become a sports physical therapist and work to rehabilitate athletes. This class is helping me achieve that goal in a few different ways. Firstly, it is fulfilling one of the core requirements I need as a Kinesiology major. Most importantly, this class is teaching me the foundation of physics and how it applies to the world as well as our bodies. This will play a significant role in my career, because I will be working with individuals who want be able to move in the most efficient way in order to perform in their sport as well as those with injuries or movement dysfunction. Overall, this class will allow me to obtain the knowledge needed to understand how physics applies to the human body and how it affects our movements."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,26,"My biggest goal right now is to graduate early. I went into college with the mindset that if I worked hard enough I could maybe graduate in three years. Now that I am actually here, I am confident that I can complete everything I need to do within the amount of time I have. This class is fulfilling one of my GE requirements, but I am really happy that I chose this one out of all other possible labs because I really do love physics. When I first took physics in high school, I was terrified of all of the math that had to be incorporated into our lessons. But it turns out I am actually really good at understanding those concepts and ideas, and the math that goes along with it just works. I am really glad that college so far hasn't been just taking classes to get things over with. Each class I have taken has taught me so much about what I am capable of and what I can do when I work hard. I think that if I am actually able to accomplish my goal of graduating in three years I will be really proud of myself, considering I also survived a global pandemic while working two jobs. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,29,"My goal is to be a physical therapist and help people get better, in order to do that I have to take this class. physics is necessary for kinesiology because we have to understand movement and how it affects everything. physics is in everything especially in the kinesiology world, because a lot of it is also sports-related and the physics behind the sports movement can help you know what muscles are being used during that motion. It is important for me to do good in this class so I can know how to use physics for these purposes and move on to the other classes that I need to take. I want to attend grad school and eventually maybe open up my own practice that also does other natural healing things there like reiki."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,31,My goals in this class are to be more educated about physics and how it relates to my major kinesiology. My goals with my major are to finish college with a bachelors degree in Kinesiology and become a physical therapist. I want to help others get stronger and feel better about themselves. Just starting my second year in college I have been focusing on applying and getting into the kinesiology program and taking baby steps towards my end goals
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,17,
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,33,Reflection Week 5:     My main goal in this Physics lab class is to try to understand the material and apply it to my   current lifestyle since I’ve noticed physics takes part of our daily lives in the most small ways. I   also need to start keeping up and do my assignments since I've already begun to slack off but I   just have to organize myself.     This class has helped me view science from a different perspective. As a kin major our bodies   have a lot of force and strength that is used all the time in various ways now the part that makes   it somewhat difficult is the math part but i just gotta review and read.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,19,"My goal is to understand and learn about the basics of physics. This lab class is helping me by providing ""hands-on"" activities to help me further understand what was taught in the lecture. Even though everything is online and isn't really hands-on, they are still activities that can help me comprehend the concepts. My major requires understanding Physics so this class is definitely needed."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,15,"The goals I have in life for myself career wise is to graduate at San Francisco State University majoring in kinesiology. After college, I Plan to pursue my dream job as a Sports Medicine Therapist or an Athletic Trainer. Hopefully, being able to land with a professional team over the years as well has always been a dream job. Also other goals being  the first in my family to graduate college and make my family proud. I want to be able to set an example for my younger brother who looks up to me the most. This class is helping me achieve these goals learning one of the most important topics of kinesiology which is physics. Physics is apart of one of many science courses that is require to be taking for my major. Being able to learn these topics for my major is a plus because I will be more familiar with terms and certain example that is used."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,16,Being a student at San Francisco state university has helped me want to achieve my goals even more by providing good resources for me to achieve it. My goals in life are all over the place and that’s because I like having options while trying to reach my destination. One goal that I have is to work in a hospital or a sports clinic so that I can gain experience in first hand knowledge of being a physical therapist. I want to work in a hospital setting in order for me to get familiar with the surroundings it has. The next goal I have is to be able to get my masters degree in hospitality management in order for me to be able to manage a hospital. I believe this class will help me achieve my goals by the structure it has to help me become a more intelligent person in my field of medicine. I believe physics can help broaden my goals and give me better understanding of science. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,24,"My goals right now are to be able to do my homework without falling behind in classes or feeling too overwhelmed. I feel like every time I want to take a break I just end up stressing because I always think ""I don't have time for a break"". It's really unfortunate, I might as well not have a social life at all at this point to be honest. I just want to be able to finish my tasks with time to spare, but it always feels never ending; like I finish one thing but then 3 more things are piled on, and it gets frustrating and tiring. In one class I actually missed the due date for a prompt write for a book we read, and we're already supposed to be done with book 2 but I haven't even gotten the book or started it or know what it's about because I'm still stuck on the first book. School has seriously sucked the joy out of reading. I used to love reading, would finish entire novels in 3 days, but now it always just feels like a chore."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,14,my goals are to become an occupational therapist. this class is helping me reach this goal because it is a requirement for my degree. it is also helping me by teaching me the fundamental physics that I need to understand when I apply it to the body. I think part of the reason why I find physics difficult is because there are so many factors that need to be accounted for that I just don't think of. but I think this also shows that when I do become an occupational therapist is need to take in every single factor that might help or hurt my patients 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,21,
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,5,My goals are graduate from college and get my masters in nursing and be able to have a stable job so I can help my family and have something stable for me too. This class is helping me to achieve this goals by learning and if I learn then ill will be able to take other classes that are requirements for me to graduate. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,23,"I don't know what I want to do in the future. I am taking this class to explore new things while completing my G,E, I have never really taken a physic class before, Currently I think this class is pretty fun. Some of the labs are very long. I think the most importation skill that I learned from the lab is learning how to draw graphs."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,37,My goal is to better understand the way things move and the force that is inflicted on our bodies in daily life. This class helps me understand the different forces that are always active but we can’t see
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,8,GoalsOne point of feedback is that there is no text box other than the comment box here to give feedback in. The only other feedback I have is the labs seem too long because there is both a post-lab check and a  summary for the lab. These seem redundant or could be combined in some way.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,7,"One of my goals is to actually understand the meaning and the concept because I know what I'm learning on here is going to benefit me to my major classes. Another goal is to pass as well, my previews classes I haven't done so well but I'm trying to do different this time so that I do well. So far this class been helping me achieve my goal because is straight forward, I'm learning more from coming to lecture to the lab and it just well organized that I'm able to turn in my lab report. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,10,"My goals in life are to graduate college then go to a physical therapy program that will one day let me own my own business. This class will help me prepare myself for harder physics courses in the coming years. I am really striving to ace college and move on to the possibility of enrolling into UCSF's physical therapy program or move to Southern California to complete the rest of my academics. After this semester I will need to take two biology courses in the Spring of 2020 and some general education courses to apply to become a kinesiology major at SFSU. One of my goals while at SFSU is to minor in business even though I haven't taken any business courses, I will try to take as many over the Winter and Summer break, whether that be at SFSU or a community college."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0102,--,2,28,"My main goal in life is to become successful and obtain the opportunity to cause direct positive impact on people's lives. This class is helping me achieve that goal by providing me with fundamental knowledge in physics that I'll need for when I further my education in grad school. As of now I'm still undecided between PA or PT, but both fields would require me to have knowledge of at least basic physics principles. I really just want to help people and not be overly consumed with wanting money or material goods and I believe happiness can be achieved through proper balance of all aspects of life. Also, I've noticed that altruism gives me happiness as well. Something about making other people smile feels right. I think that's why I chose healthcare. I want to cause more of those feel good moments."
