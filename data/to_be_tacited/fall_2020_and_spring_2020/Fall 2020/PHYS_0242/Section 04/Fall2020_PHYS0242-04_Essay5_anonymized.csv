2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,207,"My greatest takeaway from this class is how the curriculum from the lecture applies to real life. This is due to the various situations we tested and the plethora of simulations we used. This lab also helped me realized that it is difficult to use pure physics and simulations to replicate real life. This is due to our simulations assuming a perfect system, while in real life a variety of errors can occur, such as human error. Despite this, we can still use these calculations and concept to predict real life, we just need to account for these phenomena. Overall I heavily enjoyed this lab despite it being online, so thanks!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,212,"My greatest take away from this class... That is a good question. Where do I begin. Do I talk about the staggering concepts taught in the week of Harmonic motion or the bending lights in the topics of refraction and reflection. There are many things I took from this class. Was any of it valuable? I guess I wont find out until I get a job and have a family and get my first house. The question we should really be asking right now is not what my greatest take away from this class was but what was my favorite moment in this class. ""Why?"", you may ask. We should reflect on what our favorite memory in this class was because thats what we really are going to carry with us in the future. The days spent on Discord with my peers as we all laugh about how the silly the simulations are and work through the post-lab knowledge checks; the stressful nights in the first several weeks when labs were due Thursday night; the feeling of helping a friend understand and solve a problem. Maybe I could just merge the two questions together and give an answer to both., My greatest takeaway from this class is to really make the most whatever your situation is even if its not the most pleasant. I complained a lot about being online and not learning anything; however, now that I look back, it wasn't that bad. Maybe I didn't learn much but I had a good time relating with my peers. Very unique situation we are all in this semester. Its going to be very different moving forward. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,219,"I think between learning about fluids and learning about waves such as light, I would say that learning more in-depth about waves would be my greatest take away from this class. It has been the most interesting topic to me throughout this lab, especially learning about how waves travel through a given space, how light reacts through specific mediums, how waves affect each other when they interact, etc. I can definitely see how learning and understanding these concepts as a student will help me in my potential future career field of innovation in technology. Light is such a common source of energy that can potentially be used for so many daily functions especially if we consider sunlight and solar technology. I also want to work on projects that positively impact the world and taking advantage of renewable energy is a huge topic of discussion in that area. So as you can see, understanding light better will definitely help me in the long run as well as learning about waves in general and how they can be utilized in innovative products."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,224,"This semester was pretty challenging for me since it's my first semester at SFSU, and also the first semester online.  Being responsible for a family while taking 12 minimum required units is not easy. Before the beginning of the semester, I was wondering how I'll be able to deal with all assignments, quizzes and exams. The secret behind that is organization. Organization is the first factor that helped finishing this semester with good grades. Not only that, but it facilitates my task for being a responsible of my family. The second take away in this semester is patience. It's always easy to give up, but what would we achieve if we do so. According to my experience in life, most successful people are neither  the wealthiest, nor the smartest, but those who tend to be patient and persistent, and this is what I confirmed during this semester. In this class, I was really affected by the professor. The professor was really flexible and that really helped my a a lot. so my take away from this class is that flexibility makes people more interested to deal with you. Although for some reason I didn't have chance to work in group but I believe working in group really facilitate the task and makes any process faster. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,223,"Despite the challenge of being online classes, I believe that I am taking away a lot of important concepts from this class. I feel like I learned even more than in previous laboratories. I believe is because I actually got to do the entire laboratory, not by myself, but like I actually read through the entire paper and answered all the questions. Also, I was with two guys who really supported each other instead of letting someone behind. We actually made some good connections and helped each other throughout the semester."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,206,"This class was probably the most important part of being able to understand this physics course, especially considering how we are all pretty much new to online learning. Even though we never got to meet up in a regular classroom/lab, the attention given to the students was matched. This lab helped me in being able to grasp much better the information from the topics that we were discussing in our lecture class, the simulations that we were given to work with worked perfectly in providing us a visual representation of what we were reading in the textbook. I think that the greatest take away from this class is that there are many ways to learn to learn physics...even in the most unconventional ways.    "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,222,"My greatest take away from this course is that it helped me strengthen my understanding about the various topics we discussed during the lecture component. In particular, this course helped me improve my ability to visualize light,sound, and liquid as a wave. Additionally, this course has helped me visualize how light, sound, and liquid might behave if they were to pass through a medium and or a slit. Another take away I gained from this course is that I developed a greater understanding about my strengths and weakness when it comes to group work. I prefer to work in a group of 2, because I find it's easier to progress as a unit that way. I noticed labs typically went pretty smooth when I had a chance to read the questions ahead of time, so perhaps the issue is that keeping pace with my group members becomes a bit more challenging in groups of 3 or more, when I haven't had a chance to prepare ahead of time. Overall, I really enjoyed the course and the way in which the instructor presented the material."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,201,"Looking back on this semester, I would say that my greatest takeaway from this class was how convenient online labs can be. I had never realized how realistic and easy-to-use the online simulations are, and I was quite intimidated going into the class because I was expecting it to be much harder to navigate. I am looking forward to doing labs in the future because I think that when taken concurrently with lectures, they can be very beneficial. Labs allow us to see the material in a different way than lectures, as well as provide more material to review and practice. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,221,"This class has been helpful for my understanding of physics. Many of the concepts of 240 have seemed very abstract. Though we are using simulations, it still feels somewhat as if we are working with our hands. This helps bring the concepts down to earth. Before this class, I have never had a good understanding of energy waves. This was the concept that I feel I came around to the most. This type of lab has also been very helpful for me to visualize the things that I am learning. I hope to move on to continue physics in many of the same settings. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,204,"My greatest takeaway from this class is the material that I have learned in conjunction with the physics class 240. This lab has helped to understand the material a bit better than I would have if I were just limited to class time and homework since the simulations show the examples in better detail than the textbook. The labs weren't difficult for me since the lab exploration worksheets meant that guiding through the procedures were easy. Another good thing was the freedom of time I got to work on the course since hours during the lab were flexible and the due dates were extended by a day half way into the semester. This meant that I had more time to learn the material and manage other classes. Because of this class, I believe that I have done well in my physics class and I hope to carry this knowledge with me forward into other engineering courses."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,198,"My greatest take away from this class is confidence and belief in myself for understanding topics that I previously would have felt that they were too difficult. In the past I have been a huge self doubter and avoided tasks that I felt like I was guaranteed to fail. Physics would have been on that list before. With that confidence, I learned different methodologies on what works with my learning style. For me, many of these labs were straight forward and had quality simulations that allowed me to view what I was learning each step of the way. How I can incorporate that in other learning environments is to start with the basics and build off of them. This could mean taking notes of an overview look of what I am learning and then dive into the specifics after I can see what it is that I am trying to accomplish in the learning. Also, the collaboration in this class showed me that I truly do best when working in a group. In the past I have leaned towards wanting to work alone. This caused me a lot of stress because the moment I got stuck I would feel overwhelmed and possibly give up. Being able to bounce ideas off of folks was helpful. Even when none of us understood it was still reassuring because I felt like we could conquer that topic as a group through research or resources."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,217,"This class was really important in my understanding of the concepts for physics 240. The lecture didnt really do a good job explaining the subjects and concepts that were important for each chapter, and being able to see them here and get ""hands on"" experience with the experiements was really helpfull. I think that my greatest takeaway from this class was the last question in the summarys for each lab where i needed to figure out where in life these concepts were used practically. this would help me understand that process better and get a better appreciation for the subject of that weeks lab."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,202,"I think the most important lesson I learned from this class was to be less hard on myself. I think because the class was pretty flexible and we had an understanding instructor, I learned that I didn’t need to beat myself up over small mistakes. I just needed to try my best, and sometimes all you can do is put in the effort even if it’s not perfect or even good in the end. Because the lab explorations were graded purely on participation and effort, which made up the bulk of our grade for the weekly labs, I didn’t have to sweat the small stuff and I think because of this I realized I didn’t have to be so hard on myself. I’m just very harsh on myself and I judge myself on very high standards, and it is hard to learn how to forgive myself for mistakes and relax a bit. I think the format of this class and the environment kinda helped me get a bit closer to being more kind with myself and just trying my best even if “my best” isn’t objectively all that great. Obviously it’s still my goal to do good work, but sometimes even just doing work at all matters."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,214,"Since the beginning of this semester, we covered topics like Fluid statics and dynamics, Thermodynamics; kinetic theory of gases, Simple harmonic oscillators, Wave motion, Geometric optics, and wave optics. Each topic gave us something to remember by the end of this semester which we can apply in our future classes. One of the biggest takeaways from this class is how we handled most of our lab via online simulations, which made me think that no matter what the situation is, we are able to adapt and move on with it. This made me change the perspective on online learning and how it made my learning relatively easier. We were able to save time and effort because we don’t need to adhere to certain times to enter the lab or to move from one place to another. We were able to perform many experiments that were easy to control with less human error. The above mentioned points have been the biggest takeaway of the virtual laboratory."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,220,"My greatest takeaway from this lab was learning about wave dynamics from multiple sources such as water, light, electrons and sound. It was cool to see how similar these materials behaved although they are quite different in material makeup and size. I definitely have a better grasp on how patterns form with these materials and how to alter their transmission to get a desired effect. I think this could be very useful in developing communications systems or performing signal processing in the future. I got a brief glimpse of what it takes to assess power in my intro to engineering course and was all based on wave functions so it was helpful to be introduced to it here.I am also interested in surfing so I am excited to apply my new skills gained here to pick out surf spots in the future. We do not have many places to choose from in Northern California that are accessible and surfable but am looking forward to bettering my choices to pick out the prime waves. I have a better understanding to how incoming swells will combine and create waves on our beaches."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,203,"My greatest takeaway was learning more about thermodynamics and sound frequencies. Using the simulations with the sounds and measure each frequency that came out was very helpful for me. I learned more about the definition entropy which is a measure of how evenly energy is distributed in a system. Also, the first law of thermodynamics is a version of the law of conservation of energy and is usually expressed as (delta)U= Q-W"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,213,"The greatest takeaway from this physics class is that everything comes in waves. It doesn't matter if its ocean waves, light waves, electrons or real life examples such as rushes in the coffee shop or feeling close to someone then falling out. It seems like everywhere you look waves are everywhere. I also learned about the different kind. Transverse vs longitudinal. then there's other waves that travel depending on the kind of stuff its made of. Light doesn't need a medium but it slows down though anything except a vacuum. Another kind of wave is the mechanical wave. this is when sound travels through a medium or heat travels through conduction. This reminds me more of other kinds of waves and makes me question what other waves should be called. What kind of wave is it when gossip spreads through a city? or the wave that people show up all at once to the coffee shop? Anyway this phys class appparently has me trippin on some stuff I guess I had never thought of. Furthrrmore, springs travel in waves too. and if everything acts like a waves, what else also acts like a spring too? I'm pretty sure everything  because every kind of material has at least some amount of linear elasticity. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,205,"My greatest takeaway from this class is a couple of things. One being that it is very much possible to make friends over zoom. I went into this semester expecting to not meet any people but instead, the breakout rooms really helped me meet people. Fortunately, I was paired with people that actually wanted to talk and enjoyed the subject as well as cared about putting the work in. The other takeaway being that it's best to go to class and get my work done on the spot or else it is just way too easy to procrastinate online work. Not only was it really helpful to force myself to go to class but doing the work with others very much enriched the learning in my case. Hopefully, I get paired up with good people in the future but if not Ill have to figure out how to navigate out of that. I will definitely not take in-person classes for granted anymore but at the same time its probably easier to switch partners over zoom rather than in person. This is all the takeaways I learned apart from the actual science we learned"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,218,"Partaking in this course this semester is really interesting because it was my first year as a transfer student to a university, so I did not know what to expect as a newcomer to this school. This lab has taught me that the labs can also be interactive with the simulation software just like you would experiment in the lab, however, of course it does not beat the actual lab experience but to be able to switch it up from simulation to labs on paper was not bad for me at all. Im glad this lab was not as overwhelming as it could have been and for that, it made my semester a little bit easier to bare juggling the amount of all the other courses. thanks for going easy on use during these strange times."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,211,I can honestly say that I can take away a lot from this class. I have tried so hard to stay caught up during these rough times as we are all moving forward. It’s been a tough last part of this semester dealing with many family emergencies due to covid. I hope and pray that we can all make it to next semester stronger and happier than this year. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,208,"In this class, I learned about how physics concept takes place in our actual living because there are many things are physics related.  For example, I learned why thermos so important in our lives.  Since we know that thermos are related to heat, we basically use heat in everyday due to our heater and cooking.  If we do not have any heat or physics related materials, we are not able to survive in this world.  Moreover, I felt like learning temperature is a fundamental thing for me to dealing with cooking because we want to know what the temperature of the food is.  To sum up, temperature and thermos are the two biggest take away from this class and there are many examples related to these two big topics.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,200,"My takeaway from this class is that a department can do a really good job at transforming their in-person format of the class structure into the remote learning structure that we have been forced to participate in. For some odd reason, it may or may not be specific to this course, the simulations that we have used for each weekly lab have been really informative and visually helpful. I think it may do a better job of a physical lab, only because of the animation and the toggles you can use to view values. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,210,"The greatest takeaway I had from this class was gaining a further understanding of some key principles that happen in my life as well as relating to some topics within my major. For example, the research that I do for my undergraduate project is observing rock samples in thin section under a microscope. We study these rocks optically by observing them under polarized light. When first being introduced to operating the microscope and trying to figure out what exactly I was looking at was pretty overwhelming. The way some of the rocks refract light is quite spectacular and spinning the table can resemble a kaleidoscope. This was my first time really using a microscope for extended periods of time and I was not really aware of how they worked. I only knew that they magnified things and allowed you to see small things in higher resolution. This lab offered a lot of visually stimulating and interactive lab simulations. I was a bit weary taking a lab course online but was pleased to see that each lab had some sort of interactive simulation supporting it."
