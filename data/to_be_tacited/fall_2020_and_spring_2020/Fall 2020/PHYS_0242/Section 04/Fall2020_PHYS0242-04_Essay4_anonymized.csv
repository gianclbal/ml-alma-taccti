2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,210,Online courses have had a detrimental impact on my mental health and my learning. I have lost a lot of motivation to do my work and attend my classes. it just isn't the same feeling to learn from a computer screen and requires a bit more dedication to stay focused. When I transferred to SFSU I became really involved in my department because I loved being surrounded by my peers who were studying the same thing I was. I spent a lot of time on campus and the study room in my department became a second home to me. I am not doing anything special to try to maintain my mental health. I have just spent a lot of time sitting around at home. I do have a desire to finish my schooling so I will still be finishing my work but it is mostly to just check the box rather than to improve my learning. I don't really know what can be done to improve the situation as the damage as already been done. COVID has really ruined my senior year by forcing me into a learning style that isn't effective for me and has prevented me from going on multiple fieldtrips that would have provided me valuable field experience.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,205,Being in an online school has been both beneficial and harmful at the same time. Harmful in the sense that I don't have the same kind of excitement for topics like I used to and because of this I have found it very hard to go to zoom meetings. Now I just get all my work done without the lectures and learn close to the same amount to when I did go to lectures because of how distracted Id get. It has helped because I have recently opened a business and this leniency has helped me be productive with my time in other ways that have benefited my business. I'm happy that we're doing online school next semester because I will still have time to focus on my business while attending classes but I do miss being excited about school the way I used to be. But who knows if I would even be that excited again because of how focused Ive been on my business. Ive gotten used to online school and being at home a lot so I think its pretty normal now.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,198,"Online classes have been much better than I had expected. Most of my professors are organized and clear on expectations, assignments, and due dates. Those attributes help me manage my time better with it. As far as self care goes, I haven't been as active as I used to be. I feel like this is contributing to my stress levels. I've found that since I am ""at the office"" all day I procrastinate on things because 8PM feels just like 1PM these days. That reduces my time to spend outside of school stuff creating an imbalance that I am trying to fix, especially for next semester. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,218,"Since Ive been doing exclusively online classes, the way ive been learning is pretty different, In a weird way you would think that solely online learning would be a benefit but to me things are slightly harder, usually I would be able to go to office hours easily to discuss a topic and since I am an engineering major the questions I need answers to require me to build devices and if you are lost It can be extremely overwhelming.what I try to do for selfcare is to go do something I love for a few hours to relieve some stress in my school life, and do the best mentally to stay in the game and on the grind."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,201,"Online classes were definitely a difficult format to adjust to, especially considering that the pandemic occurred when I was transferring from my previous school to San Francisco State. This gave me an added layer of difficulty because I was already struggling with administrative things like picking out classes and getting important documents and paperwork turned in. After taking remote classes for two semesters now, I have concluded that some classes may end up being easier or harder with zoom and online learning than otherwise. Because the content and material is the same, it comes down to the organization of the class and the setup in which we turn in assignments and take exams. There are some classes I have that are very difficult to keep track of because teachers are unreachable or the instructions are vague, while other teachers are on top of grading and communicating. I have tried to make it easier on myself by staying overly-organized by writing down and planning my schedule. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,215,"Online classes have affected my learning greatly because it is extremely hard to focus in an online setting. I am also concerned that I'm not getting the one-on-one attention I need in other classes because office hours are limited. Some teachers do not like recording their classes, which makes things hard to review sometimes even with notes. I also have concerns that I am not getting the proper experience I need with labs because I am not doing things hands-on. This may be a problem later in the future since I don't want to do most of my degree online which could be a problem."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,200,"Online classes have had pros and cons to it. I have not had to commute and i get to hangout with my dog all day. Makes it easier to squeeze other activities throughout the day in between academic stuff, and i think that is helpful in my self-care itself. Although i feel like im managing online classes well, i know that i am missing out on a lot of meeting new people and possibly learning quicker and learning more because thats what usually happens when you stay on campus and work with outher students in student centers, etc. I recently checked out mentally for like the weekend and i think that is good, but its only poissible if you prepare for it, and i was lucky enough to have a lot of assignments done and no exams coming. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,207,"Online classes have impacted my learning significantly. I have more or less fallen out of love with my major/school in general and will be taking next semester off to figure out what I want to do now. Despite passing all my classes I still feel as if I have learned nothing/not much over the course of this semester. Despite these negatives, I believe it will be a net positive in the end, as it is better to have this realization sooner rather than later. For self care, I have been getting outside on my days off of school/work and going to parks and reading. I have just bought a book about the history of various shades of colors that I have been enjoying. I also play video games with my friends almost every night so that I can continue having social contact while maintaining a safe environment. I think that in the future it is better to postpone things until they are completely ready to be done, rather than halfway trying. This semester I felt that some professors were ill prepared for this semester, despite having all of summer 2020 to prepare. However this is just my experience, and I am sure there are other professors who handled the change well. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,222,"I'm really enjoying online learning so far. Mainly because it takes away the stress of commuting to and from campus, but also because it has improved my ability to take quality notes. I'm pretty happy all my instructors are uploading lecture videos this semester (when appropriate). Last semester I took a really difficult engineering course and the instructor refused to upload lectures. This made an already difficult course even more difficult. Fortunately, I passed the course by the skin of my teeth.  Speaking of close calls, this semester seems like it is going to be another one those 'close call' type of semesters. I have this one instructor (for 2 different courses) who is indirectly having a negative impact on my mental health. This instructor's courses are extremely demanding, and meeting the deadlines he assigns often causes me to have to make sacrifices in other areas of life. That's where the mental health thing comes in. I should also probably mention I'm taking 7 different courses this semester. This is my first time taking more than 5 courses. It's a lot for me to juggle, but fortunately the online environment is helping me to be a bit more productive/organized. And also, this class being well structured helps alleviate some of the stress."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,202,"Online classes really affected my learning because I had to work harder to stay on track and stay motivated. It is so, so easy to fall behind on schoolwork and to miss classes and miss assignments when everything is online because it just doesn’t feel real. I feel kind of removed from my own education because I don’t have the in real life, in person aspect of classes which would normally motivate me to stay on task and not fall behind. The bright side of online classes is that my social anxiety feels lessened now that I don’t feel pressured to talk to my classmates and be sociable and make friends. I always found that intimidating so I like that I don’t feel as pressured to do that now. This is a double edged sword though because I don’t feel as connected socially to my classmates in online classes, and I know when we transition back to in person classes my social skills will be rusty so it will be harder to readjust to that."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,213,"Online impact has positively effected me. I actually really enjoy this set up because there's no need for commuting, no moving out and paying expensive rent, and I still get to live at home. I like to make my own schedule, instead of having to spend all that time driving to school. I have a nice coffee shop I go to for about half of my classes. I have a system down where I pretty much do one or two classes from home then do another 2 or 3 classes on the patio of the coffee shop. This makes me feel somewhat that im going to actual school since i physically move. This coffee shop also happens to be the shop that my mom owns so I get half off drinks. This is also good because I already rack up a big bill by the end of the month as it is, i cant imagine paying full price just to do my homework and classes.Other than online classes im doing good. I just finished an engine swap on a car ive been working on since june, got it sold, and tomorrow im buying a different car, a 1986 jaguar to be exact. For that reason i did this lab on tuesday night. Im living life and enjoying it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,225,"How have online classes impacted my learning? I definitely have become a lot more lenient on myself when it comes to doing work and due dates. Now that I am at home, my school work is not my main priority as taking care of chores in the house, cooking, and cleaning, as well as in general maintaining my mental health despite being indoors and dealing with the constant headaches. It generally isn't good for me and I do have to stop myself from working until exhaustion, unlike back when I had attended SFSU pre-covid, where I was free to do my work at my own pace distraction free in my apartment. I had definitely taken that for granted but I do feel like taking care of myself takes up a lot of time that I could be studying. Overall I have become lazy at that.I am not sure about any methods to how to better support me as you guys are already doing an amazing job, but I think it isn't the responsibility of staff to choose who makes friends in these classes. However, I have made friends with a few people in each of my classes, and our shared experiences have definitely helped me realize that I am not alone in this. It has motivated me to try harder, and work towards a common goal. This semester is definitely hard, but i think that I will be harder."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,219,"I've experienced some positives and some negatives with online classes this semester. With teachers who have been already tough in the past, I feel like it is much harder to learn from them virtually (going off feedback from students who are retaking the class). Especially for labs where we benefit from physically experimenting in labs, we don't get that same experience. We do what we can with what we have though and using simulations is great to understand things conceptually.Some new forms of self-care that I've developed since the summer are meditation, breathwork, and positive affirmations. Some forms of self-care that I've continued from past semesters are listening to music and doing stretches and exercises.It's incredibly hard for some to stay motivated for online classes. I think especially for those who are enrolled in engineering classes where some professors are naturally not that great at teaching, it's been even harder to learn from them virtually. I started the semester with a great mindset but some teachers underestimate what students are going through right now. Don't get me wrong, school isn't supposed to be easy and teachers shouldn't be too lenient but most of my teachers assign more schoolwork as if we have extra time since we're learning virtually. I'm in college because I am here to learn and in all honesty, it's degrading when school becomes even more of a stressor in my life on top of every other thing happening during this pandemic. It's harder to learn when your mental space isn't where it should be. So it's been a challenge but I guess we just have to live through it and learn from it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,203,"Online classes definitely impacted me in a different way than doing classes face to face. It may be a negative impact on others but it has been very positive for me. I live in Sacramento so I don't have to wake up at 5 am every day to drive 3 hours to school and lectures are now recorded so I can rewatch them as many times as I want. I don't really have any concerns about my learning since I am still getting educated with online notes and lectures. We are honestly very fortunate to have the internet at this time because if this pandemic happened say 50/60 years ago, it would have been harder to go to school."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,217,"Online classes have overall been pretty convienent, Theyre easy to get to, i can sleep up to the class, i can eat during class and since i dont need to commute to school i can take a lot of classes early in the moring. another sweet thing about them is that i can reference the video when i need to if i missed something or didnt understand the material. the biggest issue is that i sit around to much and have developed some back problems. some other issues that are more of a minor problem than anything are that its easier to lose focus and get distracted. I am using a gaming computer right now and the idea that I could just hop out of class and start playing a game is pretty tempting. Also my cat seems to enjoy distracting me when i am in a class, right now hes laying on my mouse pad so i cannot use my mouse when im in class and i cant move him because california law states that a cat in rest cannot be acted upon by an external force. anyway just to go over this again. online classes are more convienent for multiple reasons but they are easy to be distracted from and sitting around so much isnt good."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,206,"At first, I really didn't like the idea of having online classes because there seemed to have been too much confusion and there were a few changes on how we were going to be learning. For example, some teachers just posted up pre-recorded lectures on iLearn and if we had any questions we had to email them and try to explain about what part of the video we were referring to for our question and then wait for a reply...if we even got any. Then there was those who only meet online so the students could ask each other questions and never really gave a lecture on the course. So it was a little hard trying to find the balance and being able to adjust with the new ways of teaching. I tend to go for drives around town to just get out of the house but without potentially exposing myself again to the virus. It helps clear my head and I get to enjoy the outdoors for a little. I was used to commuting 3-4 hours a day to get to and from campus so it was a relief in the sense that I could just login into my class from my computer but it was also a sudden change in my lifestyle. My only concern about my learning is if will it continue be as frustrating with some teachers or if will they actually go through some training from the university so that they are able to teach courses in the STEM fields. For my well-being, I think its going to leave a positive impact considering the amount of sleep I can now get without having to worry about waking up three hours before a class and then driving an hour in traffic and then bart to SF and then take the bus to campus...and then the same to get back home.      "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,221,"Online classes have been difficult for me. First of all, the lack of structure makes it difficult to maintain a good schedule with proper time management. Also, something about the distance separates us from the learning environment, as we don't talk in person.It is very helpful to be able to do some things asynchronously. I also feel that the work load has been reduced to focus on understanding of concepts.Self-Care is something that has been changing throughout the semester. Its been very helpful for me to maintain a regular schedule of exercise and sleep throughout the week. This keeps my mental health together and is very helpful with my school work as well.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,204,"The online classes have not impacted much on my learning. My self-care is fine as I now have more time to spend during the due to not having to commute back and forth to school, something that would take about 3 hours total out of my entire day. I do not have any concerns about my learning as I think that teachers have accommodated a good bit to the conditions and have adjusted they're procedures just fine. For my well-being, due to having some quick rotation between my classes and not having to move between buildings, I have been able to save even more time during the day. With more time, I have been able to enjoy some more of my hobbies and have been able to relax a bit more over the past year. Part of me hopes that we can continue this style of teaching for a bit longer. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,211,"Online classes have impacted me dramatically due to not being able to be more engaged as usual. I hope that we can go back to having class in person again as it has been difficult for myself to stay motivated, safe, and happy. I hope that I was the only student having a hard time this semester because I don’t want anyone to feel the way I felt the past couple of weeks. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,208,"As this pandemic period happens, it was a difficult and frustrated time for me because I have not had any experienced with online teaching, but I used to have an online last semester.  This virus limits me to interact with classmates and socialized.  In order to adjust the system faster, I took notes and asked questions in class and went to different office hours the professor hosts.  I try to do as much as possible to keep me to learn something through this new learning system.  Sometime I felt like I lost some motivations on learning because I am not able to have joy in these online classes.  Online classes are not as active as live classes meeting.  I very hope to get back to the campus quickly and I missed live lecture very much. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,214,"Online classes have their own pros and cons. Especially when it comes to engineering classes. We have to lab remotely which we have never done and it changes the way how we learn the lab materials. We had to get used to simulation ones and the interaction with the class part is not much effective when it comes to remote learning. But after getting used to the simulations, it was relatively easy but still, it was a different experience than the usual lab we had so far. On the other hand, remote learning gives me the flexibility and it decreases the time I spend traveling. I can use that time to take care of my additional work. As far as the safety measures go, I followed the usual guideline that provided by the health officials by wearing masks and gloves when I go outside and used hand sanitizers whenever I can to reduce the risk, and also I try to stay at my place instead of going out much. As I mentioned above, I have both pros and cons from remote learning."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,224,"I would say that online classes are a sword of two edges. It's always good to meet new friends and have face to face interaction with people, however, with online classes we are missing all that. With online classes I feel that interaction became ""black and white"" in other words, it became more about  trying to understand what's sent to you in a video and doing homework, and this makes the process of learning kind of boring. In the same context, labs that are usually based on sensations and visuals became less advantageous with online classes. In contrary, online classes have given students the flexibility to study and do other things in parallel. It also cut the cost and the time of commute, and that very helpful especially for international student or even students who live far away from the campus. finally, I feel like online classes have sharpened our management skills since we now can do lot of things in parallel with studying. Personally, I like the online classes and I wish if they last for quite while.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,220,"Online classes are interesting. I am thankful I don't have to commute to class and really enjoy the flexibility. I would push myself to attend classes in person if they were offered right now but am thankful we don't have in person classes at the moment. Again this is especially helpful considering I am working full time in addition to going to school.As far as learning goes I think I am doing fairly well. I am succeeding in most of my classes with an A. The iLearn system really helps in tracking my assignments. I do my best to complete them during class time because I need to work outside of class time. When we have small break out groups I think I learn the most since I am working with a team and we troubleshoot the labs or homework together. I wish more students would share their screen during our regular class time since I think we all benefit more when we interact with our instructor. Although I am typically the only one sharing my screen there are moments when other people do share and I think that is helpful.My self care strategy is getting outside when I can. I have been overloaded and haven't been able to get out and surf so miss that. I also try to stretch, do yoga and workout as much as possible in between work and school."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,212,"Online classes have made it difficult to communicate with classmates and work through problems together like I used to in the library when we had class on campus. Also, I just feel like I am not learning as much because there is not as much drive to perform your greatest in class when you just take notes from your laptop during lectures. For self-care I am trying to exercise daily with consists of lifting weights, surfing and yoga occasionally. I am concerned that I will not be prepared enough in the field of engineering as I would have been if we had class in session because we are not having any hands on activities. All my assignments are just PDF's that I submit, I cannot see handwritten marks on my math computations and usually do not get feedback or comments that tell me why I was wrong or what I could have done better. It defiantly is difficult for us all during these times and we have to work together against this virus. It makes me feel better that it is just not me going through this and it is the whole world."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,223,I kind of like online classes because all the time I spent on traffic I can use it to study or do other activities. Although I have had more time to study I am not performing as well as I did before in the classroom. The thing that is making my grades look bad is the exams and quizzes because I feel confident with the material but when we do the exams I do not perform well. This worries me because I might get low grades because of these exams and quizzes although I know the material.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,199,"I will be totally honest here and i hope i can count on you regarding confidentiality. I really want to know how a class' lesson plan is structured because it is very unfair to be paying the same amount of tuition as i would being on an in person platform, teaching myself, and trying to hunt down my professors via email when wanting to make up an assignment with a valid issue. I am paying the same amount of money to teach myself at home. I am considered a full time student with 15 units which i thought would have been a smooth ride this semester. I set a schedule for me to do school work from monday through friday. i wake up early to start at 8 am and take breaks in between for a snack, lunch etc and try to end between 5 and 7 pm. I did not overwork myself trying to get assignments at 11:30 pm for work that was due at midnight. If there was something that was assigned to me that had to do with a subject that i was TAUGHT and not have to really dig deep into a book to learn for countless hours then i will gladly do my best to finish that assignment before the deadline. I do not appreciate spending more time than need be on a single topic when there are more topics to be learned. I also do not appreciate when a professor lectures on a topic using a slideshow with about 25-30 slides and only goes through about 3-5 when the rest of the slideshow can be useful. This professor lectures twice a week for an hour each day and i have this professor for two classes. I do not agree with his teaching methods or his way of arranging assignments that are so lengthy and it is homework grade heavy. I have not learned a single thing from this professor in either class i have them for. They either zooms by the lecture or is not clear on what he's teaching. Oh and they have not yet responded to my email from a week and half ago regarding making up assignments missed during my sick time leave. Again if i am assigned homework with topics that are not taught to me, i will not seek a way into self teaching when the bigger picture is that professors are still getting paid for the nonsense they are teaching in the little time and it always bites us in the behind(don't know if i can curse here, lol) when being tested on certain topics. Knowledge has lost its meaning with this ongoing system and i guess grades are way more important. The biggest concern i have is wasting time semester after semester when i have to retake classes for the reasons i have given above. I am taking care of my mental health and not stressing over the material i have to learn because i can see that a mere grade represents a student more than the knowledge they gain.."
