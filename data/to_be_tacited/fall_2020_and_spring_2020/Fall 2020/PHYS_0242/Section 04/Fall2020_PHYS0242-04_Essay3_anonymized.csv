2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,218,"What I keep thinking about throughout the semester is the very first topic we discussed inside the lecture and that was about buoyancy and pressure, and the way the pressure of a system is used inside hydraulic lifts for cars and how the pressure of a gas going through a piston can create useful work for car engines. I think it is really useful to know how these concepts work because you could apply them to projects that you are working on.  Also you never know what situation you could be in that would require such knowledge, especially with buoyancy if you are fishing on a boat. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,198,"A concept that we have learned that is applicable to peoples lives and benefits society that we have recently covered is simple harmonic motion. How I correlate this subject to benefiting people and society is how this information is utilized by engineers to ensure the safety of the people. The first thought that popped into my head was the swaying of the bridge in Tacoma, Washington that swayed severely in the wind that could have caused the death of many people. This error was helpful though, as it identified an issue with the resonance. In the case for the Tacoma Bridge they did not consider resonance as a factor and the amplitude did not experience dampening. I see this being extremely important in an indirect manner for the majority of people. A person who has not gone through physics may not even consider this when driving over a bridge however without the application of this knowledge by civil engineers we would have many bridges collapsing or we would lack the opportunity to connect different land masses making transportation difficult or impossible."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,207,"A concept we recently covered in class was phase changes due to thermal energy change. To calculate this, we need to use the formulas Q=mc(delta)T and Q=m(Lf). We use Q=mc(delta)T for instances where the temperature is changing but no phase change occurs, and Q=m(Lf) for when the phase of the material is changing. This is due to the temperature of the medium not changing when it is changing phase, as all the thermal energy is put into changing the phase instead of changing the temperature. It is also important to note that the variable (Lf) changes depending on what phase the material is changing to/from. For melting/freezing it is latent heat of fusion, while when it is condensation/boiling it is latent heat of vaporization. The variables for latent heat and specific heat capacity (c) also change depending on the material being specified, as it is specific. These equations can be added/subtracted from each other in sequence to determine each of the variables, as conservation of energy normally applies. These concepts can be applied to almost any closed system. For instance, determining at what temperature the atmosphere of Mars must be raised to so that it is inhabitable and the ice melts. Or, more simply, at what final temperature your drink will reach after adding a certain mass of ice. It can also be used to predict/prevent the failure of materials on important things, such as the hull of a spaceship. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,201,"Can you explain how things get hot or cold in depth?When something gets hot or cold, it is actually the transfer of energy either leaving or entering a given system. If something gets hot, it means that energy has been transferred to the object by another source, while if something gets cold, energy is being taken out of the object or system. For example, if you put pasta in a boiling pot of water, energy is being transferred from the boiling hot water to the pasta, To reach thermal equilibrium, the pasta will continually heat until both reach the same temperature. The same can be said for the opposite effect. If you leave a cup of boiling water outside in a very cold environment, the water will eventually meet thermal equilibrium with its surroundings by turning cold. In this process, the water is losing energy to its surroundings, and as a result, will end up cold. The many appliances and machines that we have in our household are all capable of this energy transfer, but we don't really think about it other than the resulting change in temperature. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,213,"One concept that stuck out to me in from this course is the thermodynamics unit. This is where pv diagrams and turbines were covered. This section of the class is very important to my degree as a mechanical engineer because of the almost daily uses for it. As a mechanical engineer, theres a couple of options I’m considering pursuing with my degree. One option is going into the gas turbine industry where I could create jet engines for large aerospace manufacturers. Also, it’s possible I could work on turbines that filter natural gas out of the earth. There is a local company near my hometown that I could get involved with. The other major option is the combustion engine manufacturing and design territory. I’d love to improve the gas engine in cars and trucks and make them more efficient all while making them more powerful. Another way I’d like to do this is by electrification of some sort, but I feel like that is beyond the scope of this class. This unit makes me think of more in depth ideas that I could someday improve the travel industry or the day to day car industry."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,212,"One of the concepts that I though was interesting was when we learned about springs and the simulation that went along with that lab. Different masses of the objects made the spring go faster or slowing which increased or decreased the angular frequency we found. I could easily change the weights of the blocks to find the different frequencies and there was an area to watch how the kinetic energy, potential energy, and frequency changed. Also, in this lab I noticed how when the object was at equilibrium with its displacement the kinetic energy was at a maximum. The spring simulation could be used in our daily lives when it comes to automobiles or toasters even. Simulations could help society as whole if an individual does not have to take the time to write out the work instead a visual approach would give more accurate results when it comes to computing large math problems. Bigger cars need bigger springs and are going to have long period and therefore smaller frequencies. Smaller more light weight Formula 1 race cars have complex suspension systems while remaining aerodynamic. When designing these cars the manufactures use similar simulations to help test out new designs without wasting materials."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,204,"A question that I have is: In wintertime or cold weather we can often see a layer of ice floating on top of the surface of the water in a pond or small lake or even some sections of ocean; but in general we know that solids are denser than liquids: so how can this happen? The answers is:Between 0 and 4 degrees Celsius, water will actually expand as it cools, making it less dense than the water below it. Because of the lower density, when the surface freezes, the resulting ice will end up less dense than the water below it. The molecules of water are able to form more stable hydrogen bonds by locking themselves into position. When the molecules are not moving, they are not able to form as many hydrogen bonds with other water molecules. This leads to the molecules not being as close to each other and reduces its overall density. Ice also has pores that space inside the ice, causing its density to reduce and its volume to increase. You can verify this by using the buoyancy force and measuring the new volume with lower density of ice over water water. This information is useful because it will help determine adequate temperatures for traversing over lakes and help regulate environments that depend on sea life for food. This information is relevant because it is what we learned from our discussions on temperature in our main class and from some examples during our lab."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,210,"For this response, I would like to talk about some of the physics behind my most recent obsession, Formula 1. Formula 1 is a high-performance motorsport where every little factor is accounted for to try to shave off those precious seconds on the racetrack. One factor I would like to talk about in the different tyres that are used throughout the race. There are 3 different tyres that can be used on a race weekend. Each tyre is made of a different rubber compound. The soft tire provides the most grip with the downside of having s shorter lifespan. On the reverse spectrum, the hard tires can be on driven on for much longer but do not provide as much grip as the soft tires. This difference is due to the different compounds used in the making of each kind of tyre. The tyre compounds are made of different rubbers that have different hardnesses as well as different specific heats. The tires are heated throughout the race due to the downforce exerted on the car's aerodynamics as well as the abrasive contact the tyre has with the tarmac. Tyres are always big talk each weekend because temperature really plays a huge role in the performance of the tyres. They must be kept at an optimal temperature for the desired performance. Teams heat up their tyres with heated blankets to maintain a warmer temperature until it is race time."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,199,"I have honestly questioned almost every topic about this class. The only two topics that i thought were interesting and i may use in the future are heat and the First Law of Thermodynamics. All other topics i think may be useless to me. I understand that this is a physics course with a visual aid of a lab section but i can guarantee that most of these topics will be relevant to my field of study. i have engineer mentors that have never talked about using gas properties, sound waves, or Maxwell Boltzmann Distributions. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,220,"The concept I am thinking of today comes form our heat lab post knowledge check section B. The amount of water required to cool the iron is low in comparison to the amount of iron. The temperature change in iron is greater than the temperature change of the water.So my question is: could we create a container that uses water and a chiller to cool the containers contents? I have thought about creating a product like a brief case or a lunch box that contains water and a chiller that could insulate the container and keep the contents cool. Have you ever had gum in your car and found that it melted on a hot day? Or have your chap stick melt? This happens to me pretty regularly. So my idea is to have a case filled with water and have the case made of thin stainless steel with a metal lining that has another material with a high thermal conductivity, such as copper, that is hooked to an external block of encased copper that can act as the thermal sink. Then this would be encased in silicone to prevent any electrical shock. When this cooling case is plugged in heat can be taken out of the water to cool the case. You can plug this into your car lighter to run it while you're driving. Then when you park in a hot area the case will be insulated for a period of time to keep the items inside cool. Again this could also be applied to a lunch box to keep items cooled in there as well. This is more of a luxury item but could be used in medical applications for transferring organs or blood or samples in a biomedical research lab."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,221,"Harmonic motion seems to be the building block of more complicated Physics. More specifically, understanding waves of light. I would be very interested in learning more about the time between the first radio transmission and the internet. It seems that the necessity for science has been brought about by the need to communicate quickly and effectively with one another. These revelations have also done a lot to shape our society from socializing to military practice. This specific knowledge is important to me because I am working towards a career in the STEM field. It would be very cool to work on communications which all of the world continues to value."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,224,"When I was young, I was wondering how ships and boats do not sink despite of their heavy weight. There are two main forces acting on ship that is floating in calm water. The first is the weight. The weight force is directed downward starting exactly at the center of gravity of the ship. The weight is defined as the mass of the ship multiplied by the gravity. However, if the weight is acting downward, what makes the ship floating. There is another force that interfere, which is buoyancy. Buoyancy in this case is defined as the horizontal component of the water pressures on units of area at the bottom and sides of the ship. The buoyancy force acts in opposite direction than the wight. The boats sinks until the two opposite forces will have the same intensity and cancel out, and this results in the ship floating."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,214,"What will be the relationship between the pressure, volume, and temperature when it comes to ideal gas? Well Gas laws explain how gases behave according to the change in pressure, volume, and temperature. PV/T is equal to a constant so that when the volume is kept unchanged and the temperature is increased the pressure of the gas will be increased as well so that the constant value will not be changed. Similarly when the pressure is kept unchanged and the temperature is increased then the volume will be increased. PV = K is when the temperature is constant the volume of a given amount of gas varies inversely with the applied pressure. When the pressure increases the volume decreases and vice versa. One of the real-life examples would be, driving increases the temperature of the tires, and, therefore, the air inside the tire warms and expands. When you measure the pressure of the tires at the time when you have just driven the car, it will be high. However, in cold weather, the pressure of the tires will be lower."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,200,"One concept that was covered in lecture in the past few weeks was that materials have a thermal expansion. So, one question would be, “What would happen if thermal expansion were not taken into account when constructing buildings, or any other sort of structures?”. Well, looking back into our previous lectures, it will be found that under a specific temperature, some structures can experience some serious problems. If thermal expansion were not accounted for in construction, such as a train track for example, then it is possible for buckling to occur if the materials that make up the railings reach a certain temperature. So, when considering thermal expansion, one must know the value for specific materials and take that into account when they make their calculations. In doing this, the structure will be able to function whether the materials will expand or not. This concept is present in our everyday lives very often. It benefits our society by making sure our structures are safe and functional under extreme temperatures, specific to the materials used. Other ways that this concept is helpful is when constructing bridges to prevent buckling as well, electrical wires all over the world that need to hang low so that the rubber does not crack, and more entertaining purposes such as hot air balloons."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,205,"Regarding the Maxwell Boltzmann Distributions, I was wondering if you could predict the way different fluids and gasses react under different pressures and temperatures. When going through notes  I noticed we could predict the different speeds at which particles of different sizes will move under different temperatures. The smaller the particle, the fast it is able to move, and when you have a larger particle in the same environment, it will move slower. This could be due to Newtons laws which dictate that the greater the mass the slower the speed due to the difference in forces it takes to move different weights. I wonder if another reason for this is that the smaller particles are able to move faster because of their size and ability to maneuver through other particles. This allows them to move further which subsequently allows them to pick up on more acceleration while the larger particles are constantly being hit from all directions. Based on the fact that more small particles left the container when we opened the box, I would think this is semi-proof that small particles move faster due to their ability to weave through other particles. This information is probably very valuable for engineers working with pneumatics and hydraulics. They could use different gases and fluids based on how they react to temperature and volume."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,202,"What is simple harmonic motion? The idea may seem too abstract, but we use lots of objects in our everyday lives that rely on this concept. Simple harmonic motion applies to objects that oscillate or move back and forth in a periodic way. The position over time can be shown visually as a cosine graph, and in real life we see the object oscillating back and forth between points in a repetitive way. Anything that has a spring or a pendulum moves in this fashion. Many commonly found objects such as grandfather clocks or swing sets, operate using simple harmonic motion. Sound waves also are an important real life example of simple harmonic motion."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,217,"The question is: could a container that holds a perfect vaccume float in an atmosphere?the question could be looked at as a simple boyancy question and comparable to a balloon with helium inside it to determing its boyancy in the atmosphere. the difference is that there is no mass of gas in the container compared to the lighter mass of a balloon. using the boyancy equation this can be found pretty simply by taking the volume of the container, the density of the air it is in and the local gravity we can find the total force of boyancy, then we would need to find the force of gravity on the container which is the opposite vector of the boyancy force. the difference would be the net upward force of the container. since there is no gas in the container there would be no mass of gas to take into account and the only thing to account for is the mass of the container. this idea of a boyant balloon of a vaccume would theoretically be the best case scenario for any amount of volume when calculating the max possible bouyancy. one of the issues that arrise from this question is finding a container that can hold a vaccum and still be light enough to float. for example if we took all of the air out of a balloon and tried to have it hold a vaccum it would collapse because of the outside air pressure. the same would happen if there is no air pressure, like in space. the balloon couldnt hold a vacuum regardless because the balloon itself is pushing to return to its original, small, volume. so the balloon is not the best example. a metal sphere would work since it is a rigid structure, but then we would need to find the total volume that it would need to hold in order to float, and as the spere gets larger and the volume increases, we would need to increase its thickness to prevent colapse. so that might work but its a lot of work. in reality there isnt a good container that can hold a vaccum and still float in atmosphere."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,225,"Is it possible for sounds that are are travelling at different speeds to have the same frequency?This question came out of my curiousity for frequencies that come at different speeds, such as the one that we have performed in our lab. In our lab, we had agreed that the frequency and speed that the sound had were constant, but that the amplitude was not constant since it exhibited a dampened oscillation shape when graphed on a pressure-distance graph.What I have found is that I must find out first if it is possible for sounds to travel at different speeds. Sounds are only possible because it is energy that travels through a medium -- that is, a space where molecules can interact and therefore transfer and transmit vibrational energy. Therefore, sounds can travel through different mediums: the most obvious and conventional examples of different mediums is how sound travels through air and through water. So it is possible that sounds can travel at different speeds, therefore we can ask the question of if sounds travelling at different speeds to have the same frequency. I believe this is possible because the frequency of a tone can be described as f = C / λ, where C is the speed of sound and λ is the wavelength. Therefore, we can describe it as:f-1 = C-1 / λ-1, f-2 = C-2 / λ-2. where  f-1 = f-2.Thus, if both speeds of sound are the same, then the wavelength must be the same. This is obvious. But, if the two speeds of sound are different, then the wavelength must be different also--this is where we can say that sounds travelling in different mediums can have the same frequency.This may not be useful in everyday life, but it may be useful for the study of physics and electronics engineering where a frequency may need to be kept constant through an array of mediums. I can imagine it can be useful in surveying, where electronic equipment is used to measure distances. Where there is temperature change, there is also a change in the speed of sound. Therefore, it may be acceptable to adjust the wavelength accordingly so that the frequency of the wave is consistent throughout different temperatures."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,208,"In my physics class, I learned how temperature is converted in F and C.  We understand temperature is an important factor for us in our daily life because we have to considered what temperature it is going out.  Not only temperature is exist in normal lives, it also exists in objects.  By giving a temperature to an object, it produces temperature to the object.  Sometime we use F as the unit for temperature, and it is easier to covert C and F.  From the formula of the conversion, we know the factor is 5/9 and add 32 at the end.  This is how we convert F to C.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,223,A concept that I think is so interesting is the Archimedes principle. Archimedes' principle is so basic but it has a huge impact on our lives. Even though Archimedes' principle is very basic not many people know about it or what it implies. What the Archimedes' says is that the volume of the object submerged in water is equal to the amount of water displaced by that object. Weight and depth do not affect the amount of water displaced by the object. I believe this principle is very important to us because if it did not exist there would not be boats that could help us transport things across the ocean. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,216,"Does the buoyancy of an object depend on its material? In a way, yes. If an object weighs less than the volume of water that it has displaced, then it is technically buoyant and will be able to float in the water. When somebody says that something is ""generally more buoyant,"" it means that it is typically of low density, because, as long as the object as a lower density than water, it buoyancy will beat its gravity. Buoyancy itself is a quantity derived from gravity, similar to weight. The magnitude of the buoyancy is always equivalent to the weight of the water that is displaced by the object's volume. So, does the buoyancy depend on the material? Sort of. The volume of the object directly informs you of the buoyant force that the object will experience, however, this doesn't mean in common terms that the object is ""buoyant,"" generally, buoyant in laymen means that it floats in water. If an object floats in water, it means that its buoyant force is greater than its gravitational force, which means that the object has a lower density than water. In the laymen sense, buoyant objects are generally those with a density lower than that of water."
