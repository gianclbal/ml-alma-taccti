Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,198,"I grew up in a small town named Scotia, CA. In order to live in the town it was required that you worked for the Pacific Lumber Company. My dad worked for the mill so we lived in that town of less than one thousand people. As ownership of the mill changed, so did its practices and the activities of the mill - causing its demise. I’ve seen many former mill workers struggling to make it because they lack a degree. This leads to my story of working in the banking industry for ten years. It was the time that the bank transitioned its sales to be from products and services to only convenience services. This included online banking, bill pay, mobile deposit, and more. I realized at that point that we were selling our jobs to the computers. I decided that I would go back to school to ensure that I didn’t fall into the same trap that many mill workers did. I ended up choosing STEM, specifically Electrical Engineering, for a couple of reasons. One, I have always been a techy! I enjoyed learning about computers and the basics of coding. Second, I see this as an opportunity to make myself marketable for my entire working career. As the world transitions to more automation there is going to be more jobs that require the skills that I am currently learning. Third, I want to be able to make a difference in the world. I feel that the skills that I am acquiring can be used to help people all over the world. One example that is working in villages in places like Mexico to make an efficient electric grid. I want to be able to provide electricity to places so that they can have hospitals, schools, and access to the technology that we do in the majority of the United States. So here I am (:"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,199,"i want to go into the stem field to put my mind to work. I enjoy and love the mathematical, experimental aspect of the stem field. The way my mind intertwines with the work put into a experiment sure is fascinating. I have been exposed to the construction field and other than the scorching sun, it is a very exciting environment. Making measurements for certain 2x4 lengths is very intriguing.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,200,"I went into the stem field because I wanted to try it out, and then I realized that I kind of enjoyed math, which lead to me continuing to stay in the field. I find that it is very fulfilling to create things or put something together, which is another reason I joined stem, and choosing an engineering field specifically. I still want to continue into the stem field so that I can keep learning new things and working towards earning a degree in stem. I have found that being in this stem community is very beneficial to me, in making friends and meeting new people who will help me grow as a student and as a person. Although it is harder to do that in the time that we live in, there are still ways to prove this to be true."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,201,"I had initially gone into STEM because I am good at it and thought that it would be a waste not to, but as I progressed into my major, it has become more clear that I am actually interested in the subject matter and I enjoy doing well in it. I grew up obsessed with comic book movies, and seeing real world applications of the technology in these films is also very rewarding and interesting to know that the concepts and studying in my classes can be combined and reworked into something that can truly benefit society. I am still dreading the difficulty of my upcoming classes, but I am ready for the challenge and hope to come out on the other side much smarter and ready to apply this knowledge for good. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,202,"I’m in this field first of all because I fell in love with astronomy. I loved learning about the stars, planets, Earth’s atmosphere, dark matter, the search for intelligent life...all of the subjects in ASTR 115 I just completely fell in love with and I thought, I could study this for the rest of my life. So that’s the first reason I decided to major in astrophysics. In addition, in general there’s something I’ve always respected about the STEM fields, and that’s the search for knowledge with pure motivations, for knowledge’s sake alone and not for other greedier motives. Obviously capitalist greed infiltrates scientific inquiries the same way it appears in any other field, and I’m not trying to put the scientists of the world on some noble pedestal. But most scientists are in their fields not for money or selfish reasons, but because they have a pure interest in their subjects and they want to learn as much as they can, and share that knowledge with others. Not to be cliche, but I think learning is one of the things that makes us human, and I respect and want to be in the STEM fields because of that."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,203,Why I want to go into a STEM field is because engineering is something that interests me the most. I honestly didn’t know what to do for the longest time but I found an interest on cars and I would like to work for a good car dealership and fix cars. Math is also the easiest subject for me to understand since I practiced math problems a lot as a kid so I had an advantage over the other subjects I’m not as good as. STEM majors are pretty hard but as long as I study enough the classes shouldn’t be too difficult to learn and I can be a good handy man knowing about how all things that surround us are made. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,204,"I wanted to go into the STEM field because I just happened to be a bit more proficient at the course material than other subjects. I was able to handle the course work during middle and high school, and the subject matter made was more practical and made more sense to me than other subjects. I knew that I wanted to go into engineering but I didn't know which specific field until I entered college where I just chose Mechanical engineering. Even if I switched to another field, I would still need most of the earlier courses anyways, so I was confident in my choice. I am hoping that I will be able to full grasp the material so that I won't have to look back on my college days and wished that I had put in more effort or tried harder. I am also hoping that I can understand the world around me a bit better and that I enjoy working in the STEM field so that the work I put in towards my major wouldn't be a waste. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,205,"Originally, I wanted to go into the STEM field because I grew up in a workshop working with my hands so I thought I wanted to learn the physics and science behind it all. Once I interned at the exploratorium I was set on becoming an artist engineer. These people would use science to create incredible visuals and more to reach another level of the artform. The thing is Ive always liked math and science but I never really had a clear path of what I wanted to do with it all. But recently Ive ventured into starting up my own food business thats based around my culture. Molcaxitl gives me an excitement nothing else gives me, and even though I grew up around a workshop, I can cook way better than I can build. So now Im a Bus major with a Mech Engr minor since I didn't want to throw away all that hard work and also because I love the subject!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,206,"The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is because it's a place where I can potentially help improve the world through the engineering aspects. Including also the fact that we live in a place well known for innovations in the tech industry. So for me, that would allow me to be part of the workforce and be able to find a job in this area. I want to be part of the new young generation of engineers going into the industry with new ideas and better technology usage to improve how fast a project can be completed. It's also something very motivating for me to be a first generation in college and the first to be majoring as an engineer so that continues to push me to continue being in the STEM field despite how challenging this field is.    "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,207,"Personally for me, I am pursuing a career in the STEM field due to me enjoying building/designing objects that serve a purpose in life. I also care greatly about the environment, so when I learned that I could get a job at which I design technology to function on clean energy/get to work with renewable energy, I knew it was the career for me. I am also not terrible at doing math and thinking logically, so this career choice seemed like a no-brainer. I hope one day I get to create new, clean technologies that not only benefit the general population, but the environment we live in as well. Another bonus about the job is that hopefully I'll be earning enough money so that I can support my partner and they will be able to pursue whatever they want in life without having to worry about money. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,208,"Since my major is Electrical Engineering, it requires me to take most of the STEM classes, such as physics, chemistry and math.  In this field, I think that there are many interesting things could happened.  Since science is with us everyday in life, and we could discovered them based on different principle.  I find out STEM field actually can get in touch with some cool materials in lab, such as motors, generators.  These two things are always exist in our life, but we are ignoring them every time they show up.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,209,"Why do I want to go into the Stem field?      The reason why I want to go into the stem field is because engineering intrigues me. More specifically Civil engineering intrigues me. Since I can remember my family has always been in the construction business so whenever I look at structures, I imagine how they are built. Also, currently I am working as a drafter and it is the case that I often see my designs come to life. From things to pergolas to houses, I just love being able to understand how and structure is design to withstand certain loads and meeting certain design criteria. At the end of the day, engineering has always been an interesting topic to me so the reason why I want to join the stem industry is because I want to discover more about engineering."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,210,"There are a few different things that guided me into a STEM field. When I was younger I enjoyed maths because it came easy to me. Science was also a much more interesting class to me than English or history. When I was a junior in high school I attended an occupational school for where I learned digital media. I enjoyed the class but it wasn't something I saw myself doing as a profession. I was more of a critical thinker than an artist. After high school, I ended up attending a community college where I didn't really know exactly what I wanted to do. I bounced around in majors starting off with business. After struggling in an accounting class I felt that I wanted to major in a science. I then declared a major in Psychology and realized that it was not really the subject for me. During the summer quarter, I took an Oceanography class and just fell in love with earth sciences. We were really able to collaborate with our classmates to help each other along and I really enjoyed the field trips. I saw that this could bring the opportunity a balanced work-life in and out of the field."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,211,"The main reason I want to go into the STEM field is because it is really interesting and very useful in our day to day life. The STEM field is a bit more detail oriented and difficult compared to many other fields that are offered. Though it is difficult, it is certainly going to pay off. I am pursuing my Civil Engineering and starting out after college will be at least $60,000 which is really high compared to what I am used to now. My mother always made myself very interested in this major because she is a Civil Engineer as well. She got her degree from University of California, Berkeley. She also showed me around her job site a bit which was very cool to see at a young age. I didn't really know what I was getting myself into when I first started studying the prerequisite classes for Civil Engineering. I am very glad that I stuck with it and am almost done. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,212,"I wanted to go into the stem field because my great grandfather was a Civl Engineer and I have always looked up to him. Also, as a kid I have always loved to build and fix stuff and I knew I would be happy if I was able to continue doing this as a profession. I want to know how to design buildings and cool infrastructures that the public can use. One of my main goals is to be able to build a house with a swimming pool on one of the floors because that would be awesome! It would be nice to have people over and be able to tell them how you designed and constructed such a beautiful house. Furthermore, I want people to need my work and designs for projects to help the community out. I love to know how the way stuff works in the world and make new technological advancements. I heard in one of Elon Musk's podcast that within the next 10 years he wants to start building tunnels underneath the Los Angeles freeways to make traffic better, and that would be a cool project to work on. I hope to succeed in the stem field because I know the competition can be tough, but I am glad the rate that companies hire engineers in constantly increasing each year."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,213,"Since I was young, I have always had a passion for cars. As I got older, I started to realize the complexities of the machine and all the different aspects of the industry which only made me more fascinated. I then started building plastic model kits and eventually began to work on real cars. Since then, I’ve enjoyed learning the different facets of engineering and the technical pieces that follow. I entered college with extreme certainty that this is what I wanted to do and fortunately for me, this feeling has only been solidified. As I progress through college, I see the other fields of engineering such as materials civil, etc and I see that they’re all connected, and also interesting. Now that I’ve learned a bit about the engineering field, I’m excited to apply what I’ve learned to design a new kind of car engine, which is what I want to do with my degree when I graduate."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,214,"Engineering is something I wanted to do since I was around 14 years old. Putting that aside, the STEM field is a quickly growing and high paying area that is a great direction for any students. When I started studying my undergrad studies, it took me some time to get used to it. I got stuck in some problems for a few days before I figure out how to do it. It will be frustrating but, when you know that you figure out a way to do it, it’s a different feel and genuine goosebumps. Then the obvious reason is the pay. Going into STEM isn’t just a great way to get a job. It’s also a way to get a high paying job. Another thing I like is the challenge in the job. STEM field needs critical thinking every day, and it will keep the day more challenging and fun."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,215,"I want to go into the STEM field because I want to start creating stuff with my own hands. I have always been interested in how stuff has been made as a child, and I think it would be very neat to make machines that can do the work for other people, just like what I saw as a kid from T.V shows and museums. In particular, I was always fascinated by the giant machines that would route balls all over a tank through rails, air pressure, and other things because of how many moving parts there were. Also I was interested in the factory machinery inside of food plants because of how complex tasks were automated by the machines. I also would like to work for a lab but I need more experience and connections before I think of doing so. I know of a friend who got into a lab after graduating so I hope I can follow their example if I try hard enough. I do know someone who works inside of a lab and I hope to get into the internship program for it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,216,"I want to go into the STEM field because I want opportunities to work in a field where I can learn interesting things about the world. I am a biochemistry major because I love learning about chemistry; the molecular world has always fascinated me. The appeal of making a decent amount of money and being able to consistently challenge myself to learn new things has drawn me here. I tend to enjoy helping other people learn chemistry and also enriching what they do know, so I may end up being an educator because of how I love to learn about chemistry and help people. I've been tutoring at Skyline for about 5 years now, and I intend to keep working there indefinitely, so I may just use my B.S in biochem to garner more opportunities there. I'm having a good time putting to productive use the things that I've learned while also being able to interact with many different individuals."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,217,"Brandyn ByrnesReflection #1Phys 242-0409/08/20""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?""I want to get into a stem field for a couple of reasons. The first is that I want to develop a better understanding of the world and use that knowledge to create things. The second reason is that it is really interesting and useful to know a lot of the stuff that you would learn when getting a STEM degree. The final reason is that it pays well.All of these reasons kind of link together. There is always going to be a demand for engineers no matter what. Someone is going to pay well to create something, and it is pretty fun to be able to come up with an idea to a problem that someone has and be able to take that idea and create something tangible from it. This is a super quick overview of why i want to get into the STEM field, engineering in particular."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,218,"I guess my STEM journey started when I was of very young age, since I was a little child I have always been interested in science and learning about nature and the natural laws around them, as I grew older I started to get into physics and biology so by the time I was in high school I knew that whatever I wanted to be had to do with one of those subjects. so I went into college with wanting to be a astrophysicist but I was also really interested in actually making devices and not all just theory and teaching, I decided to switch my major to mechanical engineering and really enjoyed it, so I never looked back again."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,219,"STEM includes technology and I've been very interested in technology ever since I grew up. I think you're able to impact the world in a specific way through STEM and that's where my interests lie when I think about what field I want to work in as an adult. But I really do have a lot of respect and appreciation for each component of STEM: Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics. Science includes so many naturals laws that at one point would seem mind-blowing but now have been accepted as truths. Technology has helped humans advance in our existence. Engineering has helped solve problems and fix or develop solutions. Mathematics is such a fundamental concept that helps explain other fields and is complex yet very respectable on its own. STEM is necessary for the future of mankind especially with all the complications that we as humans have caused on the Earth. If we end up being the cause of the destruction of Earth, we will move elsewhere like to Mars."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,220,"I am going into the STEM field to try and address problems that are facing the world today. With a changing climate we have impending crises in the ocean, water supply, habitable living space, and food supply. There are also various geopolitical consequences that will result from these emerging situations, e.g. the Arab Spring revolt, melting of Arctic Seas and possible new avenues for conflict with opening of ocean territory. I have some reservations and doubts about what we can do about these things but I know for sure I cannot effect change if I can’t support myself where I currently live, in the Bay Area. So a big piece of this is to find independence by gaining an engineering degree and then once I have gained that independence then can work towards addressing these many issues. I think that the Engineers without Borders program looks like a really cool avenue to work in once I make it to the level of a practicing engineer. With all the wildfire activity in California, perhaps there’s an engineering solution that can help us address the excess of 20 million acres of fuel load."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,221,"I chose to go into the stem field after many years of lollygagging through college. After years, I have been inspired by some speakers as to the influence that a scientific education can have. Truthfully I don't know exactly what I want to do though I am led to believe that a BS in physics can lead to quite a variety of well paying jobs. I also have always been better at math and sciences than my other studies. I have had some academic struggle when I was young and now have found a path that feels fulfilling. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,222,"After reading the question prompt, two responses came to mind- job opportunity, and role model. From what I understand, the US is currently going through an industrial revolution, and if you don't work in STEM, then there's a chance you will get left out out of the job market. One of the reason I chose this degree is because it allows me to segue into a number of other career fields, and I find comfort in knowing I have that option available to me. So to summarize my first point, more job opportunity implies more stability. The reason I included the phrase, ""role model"" is because people who come from my social-economic background generally do not end up working in STEM. At first I thought I was because most of us don't have an interest in STEM, but overtime I've started to believe it's actually because most of us don't get exposed to STEM. The way I got exposed to STEM is kind of an interesting story. The short version of that story is that I grew up kind of poor, joined the military at 18 years old, used my VA benefits to go school after I separated from active duty, went to art school for a few years, took a class where we learned to develop a mobile application by leveraging preexisting GUI's, and that was the moment when I first got exposed to a little bit of STEM. If you would have told high school me that I'd be 2 semesters away from graduating with a BS in electrical engineering, I would never have believed it, mostly because my grades were terrible, but also because I had no idea what STEM was back then. So to summarize my second point, I want to encourage people to take an interest in STEM because it can be rewarding and if you don't do it then there's a chance you will not have a job in the future."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,223,"I want to go into STEM because I have always wanted to be someone important. However, one of the most important reasons that led me to want to go into STEM is that I feel that there is a need for more Latinos to be part of STEM. I believe that if we can get enough people from every background to be part of STEM, we might reach some kind of stability for everyone in all these important jobs.  Another big reason why I want to be part of STEM is that I want to get to build houses, buildings, highways, etc. Also, it must be really cool to be able to experience all these new construction materials or anything related to it in first hand. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,224,"the reason why I've chosen to be in STEM field is because I'm facinated by math and physics, although am not excellent. One more reason is that am not too much into leterature or medical fields. I also like engineering because my father is civil enginner back home. he used to take me to construction sites and that really grabed my attention since i was young. I feel that enginnering sharpens our skills and makes us more efficient in term of finding solutions for different kind of problems."
