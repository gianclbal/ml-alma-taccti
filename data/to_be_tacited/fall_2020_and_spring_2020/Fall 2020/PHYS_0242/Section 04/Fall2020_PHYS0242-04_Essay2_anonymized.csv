2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,200,"My goals as of now are to stay ahead of my assignments and study diligently. In my experience, while it is nice to relax when you are on top of all your assignments, the room for relaxation can disappear in an instant. This is especially true in the learning format that we have today, and for the unforeseeable future. It has already been one month of classes, and I have just now finally got into the groove of getting assignments done and getting familiar with the structure of my classes. being familiar with the structure of each individual class will assist me in being successful on a week to week basis. In the bigger scheme of things, my goal is to graduate without any setbacks and continue my pursuit of a career in engineering. This class will definitely assist me in that by practice of writing reports, as well as learning key concepts of thermodynamics that may eventually help me in some way or another."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,223,"My goals in about a year or so are to graduate from college in December of next year with a bachelor's in civil engineering. However, before that, I am planning on getting an internship or find a job related to my major to gain some experience so when I graduate I will have something to offer to the place I might work at. Right now, I am talking to my mentor from Richmond Promise about finding a job or an internship she said she will be talking to one of his friends to see if he could hire me or give me an internship. I think this class can help me achieve this goal because is a required course and actually a lot of the topics covered in class will be useful to navigate in the work force. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,213,"This class covers thermodynamics, relativity and many relevant physics concepts. I will hopefully be graduating soon and entering the workplace as a Mechanical engineer. This means much of my job requires extensive knowledge of the physics concepts covered by previous classes as well as this one. My favorite part of mechanical engineering has to do with car engine design and testing. If I had the chance to work in that field, I would need to know a lot about thermodynamics and heat transfer. This class will help provide introductory details to that market segment. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,217,"Brandyn ByrnesPhys 242-04 Reflection #209/23/20What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?My goals are to learn more about physics and apply them to everyday life, also to graduate with an engineering degree from SFSU, and find a job that i can enjoy and live off of until I retire, and buy a plane. This class will help me achieve these said goals by allowing me to gain a better understanding of physics and see how it is applied to everyday life and it will become a building block that i can increase my knowledge on further with will result in me passing these classes and hopefully getting a degree and then ideally getting a job that i won't be lost in and understand they concepts that apply to that work. Then by extension I will get paid and that will let me buy a plane."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,215,"My goals is to fully understand physics as a concept so I can apply it to my work as a mechanical engineer. All these physics classes have been preparing me with concepts of observations of how things in the world work. Engineering acts as a way to use physics to our advantage or to find a way to lessen its impacts to achieve a goal. This class teaches me the fundamentals of heat and energy transfer and concepts involving gas so far, which may help me design machines that require those concepts such as vacuum tubes and other related things. All in all this class is just a conceptual stepping stone for me to become an engineer."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,221,"I have been considering working on climate change in my career. It is evident that this topic is much more complicated that the general public seems to acknowledge. Thermodynamics is of course a very important, if not the most important physical part of this field. Mostly, I would like to study the changes in the ocean, and how it is affected by the climate and vice verse. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,212,"My main goal is to become a Civil Engineer and this class will help me reach my profession because I will be able to get a BS in Civil Engineering at SFSU. It might take a few years of working alongside engineers before I become one myself, but I am excited for the journey. I have made a lot of friends along the way in classes and I hope I get the chance to work with other intelligent people. What we have been learning in class is definitely going to be useful for me in my future, and I am interested about the topics we will continue to learn throughout the semester. I think this is my last physics class at SFSU and I am kind of bummed because I actually have really enjoyed the physics classes I have been taking. The material is interesting because it relates to the real world a lot more than Calculus and other math courses I have taken. I hope to be able to use a lot of what I will have learned in this class in my field."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,204,"My goals are to hopefully understand the material in this class to the point where I could easily answer any questions about it once the semester is up and with enough skill to be able to teach someone else. This class is helping me to achieve these goals by having only one class section so I can spend the rest of the week working on other classes and reading the textbook and materials for this class before then. In the session, the teacher has multiple teacher assistants that, along with her, are able to answer any questions that I have. The lab also helps to reinforce any material that I have learned by thoroughly questioning me and making sure that I know the material well enough to think critically about the experiments. I am hoping that with enough weeks of going through this process, I will be able to get a good enough grade in this course and the lab, and move on easily to other courses."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,203,My goals are to complete all my class requirements as a mechanical engineer and get my degree to pursue working with cars. This class can definitely help me achieve these goals because physics is very important when working with cars and other vechiles. Buoyancy is important in boats as I put in as an everyday example and now learning about heat and gas properties. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,224,"As an international student, my first goal to achieve is to obtain bachelor degree in civil engineering. Life in United States is pretty challenging especially for international students, moreover, especially for international students who are responsible for their families. During my presence here in USA I have learned how to be responsible, and this is one of the goals that I was targeting 5 years ago. now my only focus is to get my bachelor degree and try to apply for an entry level job that might help me improve my CV. After getting my bachelor, and having some work experience here, I'm planning to go to one of the Gulf countries like Emirates or Qatar, and it's there where I want spend my life. For this class, it's one of the major requirements, not only that but it also give me a closer idea on how different physical phenomenon happen. It also improve my critical thinking in physics. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,198,"One of my main goals coming into the semester was to always be up to date on what my classes are covering. When I fall behind it seems as if I suffer a downhill spiral that impacts all of my classes. I have began to reach the point of falling behind in some of my classes so I am reevaluating my goals to make sure that I don't continue on this trend. My first goal is to commit to visiting office hours when I am unsure of what is going on in my class. I feel that communicating with my professors will help me by getting great advice on what I should be focusing on or tips/tricks for the subject. As well as going to office hours, I am trying to be better about asking my peers for help. I feel that often times I don't want to burden them with questions when they have their own workload to focus on. However, I must at least see if they are willing to designate a few minutes to help me. I think that this class is helping me with my original goal of not falling behind. Specifically in physics 240, I often have a hard time conceptualizing what is happening just by reading. This lab class makes me think about the topics more conceptually which helps me understand better."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,207,"I have multiple goals for the foreseeable future. One of which is deciding what I want to do as a career. I used to love engineering, however with the corona virus, everything going online, and other factors, I have lost my passion and motivation for school and engineering. This class will help me figure out if I do still enjoy physics/engineering, or if I need to find a new career path. At this time, nothing really interests me, so I need to figure out a new plan for life soon.Another goal I have for this class is I hope it helps me understand the contents of the physics class better. So far, it has aided me greatly in understanding the content of the course. However, there are certain aspects of the physics course I am struggling to understand completely, and I believe that this lab class will make that no longer an issue. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,201,"My main goal right now in my life is to graduate from school with good grades. I think that this class can help me achieve those goals by providing the opportunity to do well and get a good grade, which will contribute to the overall goal of graduating. Labs are also helpful because the information is usually pertinent in other classes, and so if I do well here, it may translate into other classes that delve into the same topics. Graduating with good grades starts with developing good study habits, and labs are a great place to achieve that. The structure of a lab depends highly on time management and organization, so doing well in this could show results later in my other classes."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,218,"My goals for a very long time was to be in the stem field, even though my role in the stem field changed at least 3 times I still have never thought of a life without doing some sort of scientific or engineering research. That being said, I am a electrical engineering major and I hope to one day be able to work on various robotics or even nano-engineering. So far learning the material in this third course of physics has not been fun yet, but i know the material I learn in thermodynamics will help me with my engineering."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,210,"Currently, my goals are to finish school and graduate. As things have moved online I am starting to struggle with keeping myself motivated. Not being able to go to campus and interact with my peers is quite the setback. Lab courses such as this one can help achieve some sort of interaction with classmates and others. This class is also helping pave the way for online lab classes. Unfortunately, it seems that learning in an online environment is going to be the norm for a while and we need to be able to transition and make it more efficient. In the future, I would also like to teach, and being able to provide an online space to learn that information would be very beneficial. It is difficult to find a way to teach geology virtually when it is most beneficial to be in the field. Some of these virtual physics experiments could show what might be possible."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,216,"My goal is to graduate with a degree in biochemistry. This is the milestone that I've been working for in school all the way up to this point, and I want to do what I need to do to achieve it and then reap the benefits from having it. School has been a long investment for me and I'm looking forward to taking a break after finally completing it. I'll be looking for a healthy job to enhance my life with while doing other good things for myself, it'll be a beautiful time in life. Within my career, I hope to explore many different molecular structures. I love learning about how molecules interact with organisms in a physiological sense, and I'm always thinking about what the conditions would be for the healthiest possible human(varying based on genome). I hope to optimize my own health one day, and perhaps having more and more education will help me do that."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,206,"One of my personal goals is to be able to be part of some type of project that is able to help the world be more environmentally friendly. For example, earlier this week we saw how Tesla was able to come up with a different way to produce batteries for their company, in a more efficient way both economically and environmentally. However, in order for the people who helped make that a reality they had to have some sort of familiarity with chemistry and physics. As we all learned in the previous class about electricity and magnetism, this physics class will allow me to continue growing my interest for physics in order to have a deeper understanding of how to be able to solve real world situations that many people see as “it just is that way”. I want to be able to explain to myself why what just happened, actually happened, whether it's the trajectory of a ball at a certain height with wind or simply why an airplane is able to fly. Or how we can reinvent the way we do things now.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,208,"My goal for the next five years are to pursuit my college degree and try to minor another major, so then it is easier for me to get hired after college.  I understand there are things that we can not expected and lot of challenges for me while I am trying to get my degrees.  As I get both my undergraduate and minor degrees, I want to get into a company that can offer me a stable income in my life.  As long as that income can make me survive, then basically i am very satisfy with that case.  In order to achieve all these goals, the first thing I need to do is try my best in all my classes and get good grades.  If there are struggles in some of my courses, I need to seek help immediately.  I want to learn as much knowledge as I can during my college because this knowledge might be helpful for me in the future.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,219,"Well, I am assuming that since this class is part of my coursework as an electrical engineering major, that many of the concepts we learn in PHYS 240/242 will be relevant to my future job prospects. Since I want to work in the field of innovation and emerging technologies, I hope that I can look back on this time and know that the foundation of knowledge that I have established as a college student inevitably helped me better understand relevant methodologies.One of my other goals is to be a lifelong learner and to accumulate as much knowledge as I can. Classes make that a bit more difficult with assignments and tests and all the stress that is put on a student, but that's unfortunately how it is. Aside from that, this class will give be a better understanding of how the world works not only at a conceptual level but with a deeper understanding of not only ""what"" is happening in a given scenario, but also ""why"". I am actually pretty proud of this since as someone who likes to share knowledge, it would be easier for me to share more when I have more to share."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,202,"One fear I have about the future is that I’m going to end up in a job I can’t stand simply because of money. It happens to so many people and I really don’t want that to be my life as well. My goal is to find a job that I enjoy, that I actually want to do, and I think being in this class is a small step towards that. Learning about what interests me about physics, and what doesn’t, is helping me figure out what subsect of the astrophysics field I would want to be in and build my career in. This class is also a prereq for my major so hopefully the major will help me land a job I like, and this class will help me get my major. That’s the plan anyway. Fingers crossed."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,222,"My academic goal for this semester is to strengthen my understanding about concepts I've already been exposed to.I've already taken all of the lecture courses that are required for my major, so this semester I am completing all of the labs I've been putting off. I'm glad I put them off because it makes it easier to identify gaps in my understanding. The first exposure was pretty rough, but I'm finding that the second exposure is much more pleasant. This course can help me develop a solid foundation for my physics knowledge. I feel pretty confident about the mechanical component, and the electrical component, but I still need a little work when it comes to thermodynamics, and I need a lot of work when it comes to sound and lenses. I'm looking forward to improving those last two the most. Hopefully we have some cool simulations so I can visualize what's going on."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,214,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?My short time goal, for now, is to graduate with a good GPA. PHYS 240/242 is one of the important class itself and one of the requirements for the classes I have to take to graduate. Physics in general help us understand the things that happen around us. It deals with fundamentals and helps us to see the connections between seemly disparate phenomena. Even the recent principles we learn so far in this class, such as the properties of the ideal gas, fluid dynamics, force, pressure especially hydraulic pressure, and now the first law of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics deals with the study of energy, the conversion of energy between different forms, and the ability of energy to do work. As a student, who likes to be an electrical engineer, learning more about heat or energy is really important for me to understand the concept. Knowledge of thermodynamics is required to design any device involving the interchange between heat and work, or the conversion of material to produce heat. So, for all the above reasons and more, I believe that this class will be very useful for me to achieve my short term and long term goals."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,211,My goals are to achieve as much knowledge as possible as I move to getting my bachelors degree in Civil Engineering. I think thank this class can help me achieve that goal because I need this class to achieve that bachelors and I also want to become smarter by obtaining all of this new knowledge. I have been able to obtain more knowledge moving down each semester as I take new classes. I think that there have been new topics discussed in this class that I haven't learned before which is great because this gives me a greater understanding compared to people that haven't taken these classes before. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,199,"One of my goals is to become an engineer and do the best i can to support grade school students and perhaps undergrad students to get the proper support, motivation, and financial needed. I am thankful i had a roof over my head and food on the table for me to get by day to day. What i aspired to have was more of a lending hand to clear up what i needed to get done and not get caught in troublesome situations i could not surpass by myself. I did not have a tutor to help me with my reading, writing and comprehension and my parents were not able to help because they cannot speak the language. I excelled in math and I love all the twists and turns when manipulating an equation. To this day i cannot stand writing unnecessarily useless, lengthy papers. I also cannot stand taking unnecessary classes and doing unnecessarily hours of work. It is a waste of my time honestly, but at this point there is nothing i can do. When i get to a comfortable spot in my life while working as an engineer i will do my very best to be there for students that will be in my shoes. i was not very fortunate to have access to internet or a mentor/tutor. How this class can help me achieve this goal is by providing less work and clear work for less of a grade. I can speak for myself that i am not learning anything on this online platform, and was barely learning in classes where workloads are a norm. Knowledge over grades."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,205,"I recently switched from being a mech E major to having it be my minor. I made business my major to aid me in the new business I'm working on but because I love math and science more than I love accounting, I figured I would keep doing engineering in one way or another. This way I could also continue studying engineering if I ever want to go back to school and change careers. But if I were to go into engineering Id love to be an artist engineer and this class could be quite useful for several types of projects. since being an artist engineer is quite unpredictable, it's probably best that I build myself a strong foundational understanding of physics and science. I also spent a lot of time working at the Exploratorium alongside artists engineers and it was quite inspiring to see that it is possible"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0242,--,4,225,"My goals in this class are pretty much the same as any goal that I've had in any other academic course really-- this is to strive in the best of my ability, and also to do whatever I can to do my best academically. This would include a lot of resources, and a lot of willpower.. But most mportantly, I think, it would take a lot of time. I think spending time in learning the actual material and learning the actual concepts in this class would be good for me in order to better comprehend and better understand what we are going over in the labs as well. This would probably help me in the long term, where these skills would transfer onto my other academic endeavours as well, but at any rate, this is what I think my goals are in this class."
