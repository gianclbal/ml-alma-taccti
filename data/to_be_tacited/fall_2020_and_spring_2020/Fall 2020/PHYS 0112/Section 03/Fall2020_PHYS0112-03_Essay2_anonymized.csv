2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,545,"My goals at least for education goals at the minimum to graduate and get my diploma. I hope to get a 3.0 gpa, but college has been really rough at least when its online. Before we transferred to online only I was doing fine I was turning in all my work on time and I was able to understand the material a lot of more easier. And if I didn't understand it getting tutoring was very easy. It has been rough to be online only but I think I will make it. Barely though I hope my gpa won't get low by too much when this year ends. This class has been helping me by trying to give me a somewhat real experience by giving us simulations on how physics works. While I do dislike the labs that we do because we have to mess around with the simulations and write down what we get it does help me learn because when we change something small it will make a big change."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,784,"My end goal is to attend medical school and provide for my family. It’s a long journey ahead and I am grateful to be where I’m at now. I wouldn’t be here without the support of my friends and family. My overall goal is to get through all of my required classes, such as this physics class, with success, so that I can obtain a higher education. I aspire to be a pathologist and hopefully be affiliated with the CDC, but that means I have at least ten years of school ahead of me. So another goal that I have is to remain consistent with my passion and motivation, so that I can further obtain these goals.This class is helping me achieve these goals by fulfilling another GE that I need but also fueling my desire to learn more about science, I love all fields of science and I am excited to be a part of this class."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1324,"My goals in this class is to learn and be able to connect physics into my major. I am majoring in Environmental Science. Once I graduate I hope to get my masters in toxicology or work at a National Park. I know they're two different routes but I love both of those fields and would be happy to do either or. I plan on taking a few years off and working in a National Park and a few years in the future going back to school and get my masters, that way I am able to live out both of my dream jobs. These are my two goals and I hope to become successful. I hope that this class gives me the knowledge I need to input into my career. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1316,"My goals are to get my B.S. in Biology with a concentration in physiology and then apply for graduate school after. In order to get to where I want, I must take a year of physics with lab to satisfy my requirements. I’m not great with math, but I will try my best to do well in this class because although I won’t be using much calculus in my daily life, I know that I will be using physics to make sense of things. I also want to do well in this class so that I have a strong foundation for when I take physics 2. Everything that I am learning now is useful information for the future and I am very grateful for that. I do get lost in the new material sometime, so to counter that I will try to join the office hours when I can. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1321,My goal is to achieve and pass this class with an A. I know since physics can be somewhat tough for me I need to study hard to achieve my goal. The reason why I set this goal is that physics was always challenging for me when I was in high school because it can get really confusing sometimes so I decided that this time I will study hard to earn an A so I can take Physics 2 with Calc math although my math is not my strongest suit. I think that physics can be something that I can improve on so I think if I worked hard enough this year I can pass physics with a good grade. So this time for my Goal is to understand Physics better and pass with a good grade. To achieve this I think I would have to study hard for upcoming tests and quizzes by studying hard by myself and listening in lectures. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1315,"Currently my goals are to finish my lower division courses so I can move on to upper division courses for my major (marine biology), and to to volunteer or get an internship related to my major. The biggest way this class helps me is it is a required course for my major, so that knocks it off of my checklist of courses I need if I pass. It is also a prerequisite for a few classes I need to take. Beyond just graduation requirements, this class gives me a better understanding of physics through application, so I can know how to apply different physics concepts. By actually working with simulations and graphs it also helps me understand the physics concepts much better. This class also helps me have a better idea of how to work with simulations and record the data from the them."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1335,"My goals for this class is to really master the basics of physics so that I may be able to have a career in the future with physics. Understanding and being able to master basics is an essential foundation for any career and without those basics everything else on top will be confusing and harder as time goes on. I really want to take the knowledge I learn in physics to even be able to change things in my everyday life like making my hobby car faster with physics or even being able to understand why certain things in my car are able to work because of physics. I think all hard subjects always rely on the basics and as I said before, mastering those basics is essential. I want to learn the harder and deeper sections of physics so making sure I leave this class confident about everything I learned then that makes my intentions and goals a success. Even if this class isn't about difficult subject matter I do understand that everyone must start somewhere so I’m excited to start here and have this be my beginning."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1323,Right now my goals have changed from since we last wrote about them. I think I want to do as well as I can in this class so I can be as well prepared for the next semester I have of physics. I think this class will definitely help me achieve that goal. One thing I do want to say is that it would be super helpful if  the labs and lectures could line up. I realize this isnt an easy thing to do because all the lecture professors teach at a different pace.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,550,"My goals are to not only graduate with the required credits to get a degree in Zoology, but specifically for this class, I want to come away with at least a B so I can move onto the next steps in my degree requirements. I'm interested in the concepts of Physics simply because you hear a lot about the rules and laws of physics but you don't really dive deeper into them unless you.... have a physics class. and in my case, I haven't yet and this is my first one. So far Im very interested in what we have learned so far, so gathering a further understanding and passing my quizzes and tests I hope won't be too difficult."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1322,"My goals in life are to basically make money. To achieve this, I plan on becoming a dentist. Going through school right now, in order for me to apply to dental school, I have to take all these science class pre-requirements before applying. So in taking this class, I am furthering my journey towards my goal. The reason I want to make a lot of money is because I want to be able to support my family. How physics is currently helping me is, it will help my understanding of math because although I am going to become a dentist, I am still a finance major who needs a really strong core in math. And by constantly doing problems that require a strong base in math, it furthers my education and knowledge. This lab is also aiding me in passing my lecture physics class. Since my class is really far behind learning the topics before heading into lecture really help my understanding."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1331,"My goals for this class is to be able to keep up with the labs and come out of the labs confident in what I just did. However, during the past 2 weeks lab has been really stressful for me. I feel like instead of coming out confident I just come out even more confused. I don't really like the fact that we go into breakout rooms for 2 hours because no one really talks at all and it feels like class is over. It's also hard because sometimes I wont get some of the questions and asking for help in breakout rooms seems really awkward. I think what would help me to achieve my goals for this class is to work on the labs as a whole class rather than going on breakout rooms. That way it most of us can get a clear understanding of the labs. It would also be so much easier to ask for help."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1334,My goals for this week in class is to turn in all of the lab. I have really been struggling on making sure I complete all parts of the lab and I really want to improve in that area.This class helps me with that goal because it allows me to work on parts of the lab during class as well as work with other students to help me understand the material. I really hope that I can improve in this area so I can be more prepared for the weekly quizzes and also have a better grade in the class. It can get hard fro me sometimes to complete all of my work for this class because I have other assignments for other classes that I have to complete. But I believe I am catching on to the balance of it all. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1313,"I feel like my goal here in this class is to deepen my understanding of physics and get myself closer to mastering and remembering these subjects for a long time to come. By doing so, I will be ensuring a spot in society as an educated, well rounded, and overall knowledgable person. I want to be the kind of parent in the future that will be able to help his kids with their homework, and by studying physics I will understand most of the other subjects and at least have an idea of how everything around me functions. This way, my understanding of the world will become more broad and my quality of life will follow and increase. I have also expressed before that I am here because this subject is a part of my studies towards becoming a med school student. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1314,My goal for this week is to stay on top of all my assignments for this lab and also the lecture part. This class is helping me stay on top of my work because when we are in breakout rooms I am able to get a lot of the lab done. This helps because it makes less homework to do throughout the week. Last week I was able to finish the main lab portion and only a couple of the other assignments to do outside of class so it was nice to have most of it done already and not worry about it later on.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1336,"I’m still not entirely sure what my academic goals are, and so that’s what I’m trying to figure out this semester. I’m fairly certain that I will be majoring in either Environmental Science or Biology, both of which require physics – biology requiring Phys 121/122 As well. I’ve taken chemistry, organic chemistry, and most of my other prerequisites, but for whatever reason I’ve put off taking physics for as long as possible. The one upside of quarantine/remote classes has been all of my increased spare time, which I have found I’m using to get more homework done than I have in the past. That was not the case back in spring, when I struggled with the transition to online learning, but now I think I am refocused and re-centered on academic success and tackling all of my remaining lower division classes."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1333,"I feel that I don’t know what my goals are. I feel like after 3 years of being in university I should know now, but I mostly just want to graduate with some degree in a biological field like Biology with a concentration in microbiology. I feel that this class could prepare me by preparing me for future math courses and possibly even letting me learn about physics applications in the real world so I can use it in future employment. I want to do well, and I believe that I’ll achieve this goal with determination, perseverance, and hard work. Through hard work in the physics lab, I can understand formulas, graphs, and other physics concepts and eventually learn to apply them elsewhere. I know that it won’t be easy so I’ll just have to persevere. I guess another goal I have is to find out whether I want to work a career in the sciences or not, and I’ll just have to wait until the end of the semester to decide whether I like my current major or not. I’m sure I will like the sciences though, as I’ve never wanted to do anything else."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1328,"My goal for this class is to pass it with an A and make sure I understand all the concepts. I plan on doing this by reaching out to get help whenever I need it. I can do this by asking my lab partners, study groups, or asking the professor if I have any questions. I am usually able to keep myself motivated to do the homework, but this semester is a little difficult because I am new to the iLearn format, but also because I have to adjust to doing my labs online. It's hard to stay motivated to study when I'm not physically in a learning environment like a classroom or a school library. Doing work at my house/room makes me prone to being distracted."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1327,"My goals are to hopefully pass my courses this semester and continue my progress towards degree completion. After that, I hope to get into a masters program and study orthotics and prosthetics. And then after that I hope to be able to work for the air and space physiology squadron. This class is helping me achieve my goals because it is a prerequisite for masters programs. This class is also helping my understand physics concepts that I can apply to my future career field when learning how to create prosthetics and orthoics to help people regain movement and function in their lives. It will also help me when working with (hopefully) the air and space physiology squadron and learning how the body responds to high altitude conditions in aircrafts. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1319,"Yesica Onofre FletesSeptember 15, 2020Reflective Journaling #2            I have many goals both short term and long goals that I know I will accomplish. One of my short goals for this semester is to receive good grades in all my classes, I am currently enrolled in bio 230 (lecture and lab), chemistry 215/216 (lecture and lab) and lastly physics 111/112 (Lecture and lab). Yes, it has been a challenge since they all have three-hour lab classes and all lecture. Another short-term goal I have is to graduate from San Francisco State in a year, receiving a bachelor’s degree in biology with a concentration in physiology. Lastly a long goal is to hopefully attend medical school and become a pediatrician. This class has been very helpful up to now since you are very understanding, and I feel like all your assignments are always well detailed and allow everything to be every clear. I hope this semester to keep going as great as it is now but if for whatever reason something occurs, I will reach out to hopefully come up with a solution."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1317,"My main goal for this class is to refresh my memory about what I have learned before. Since I took phys- 111 two years ago, some of the knowledge has been forgotten and I have to relearn it. This class is helpful, because we have like 3 hours every class to share ideas with other people. I think this will help me achieve my goal."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1332,"My goals this week are to catch up from not being able to work over the weekend and turn in the labs and homework/quiz from the lecture. On Tuesdays I am in class all day from the morning at 10am until 930 pm at night so it is a very long day and since I only have 15 minute breaks its only about enough time for me to try and eat something/get water/stretch/use the restroom. I wish I had more time on Tuesdays to work on all of my classes while the lectures and labs are still fresh in my mind, but unfortunately I have to do it on other days. My goal is to prepare myself over the weekends and Mondays to be ready for Tuesday with questions for all my classes and my assignments submitted so I am not trying to rush in between classes (I haven't been doing this but sometimes when I get overwhelmed this happens). Making the labs due on Saturday/the weekend is helpful because then I have Saturday to catch up on anything that I wasn't able to finish. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1330,"My Goal when it comes to my career as they become a massage therapist and hopefully work with athletes. This class helps me attain this goal as it is a prerequisite. But now taking the class I can see how the body moves and what forces are needed or apply. It gives me a reason why things are being done and I am able to explain that. It’s not something that just happens, there is science to all of it now. When someone gets hurt I can show and explain to them what is going on. The forces applied that might of caused them to injure their arm or knee and find a way to correct. Physics allows us to improve our movements to get the most out of it. The best example would be in football we think it’s just the arm doing the work. When we break it down we see that the twisting of the hips gives us extra torque to throw the ball further."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1312,My goal is to become a fish biologist and watershed researcher. I hope to help save wild populations of fish along the california coast as well as other native species. By taking this class I am gaining a better understanding of basic physics which can help me further my knowledge of earth sciences. This class can also help with understanding fluid dynamics and how water works in our world. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1320,"David Botello Prof. Hossain PHYS 112-03 September 18, 2020 Reflecting Journal #2 	My goals are to learn the properties of physics, complete this course and the lecture with a satisfying grade and move onto the second part of physics (121/122). By learning the properties of physics, I am able to apply them to everyday life outside of class. There is physics everywhere. Once I complete all physics courses, I would be able to take other courses needed for my major. With all courses completed, I would be able to graduate. This class is helping me achieve these goals because the instructor provides helpful information and lectures to better my understanding of physics. The labs have also contributed to my learning, I have been learning more and more about physics. The communication between my classmate and I are also helpful because we help each other out when we have confusions and work together on problems."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1325,"My goals are to complete the requirements to become a biochemistry major and get my degree. Then I want to attend medical school! This class is helping me by achieving my requirements to get there. It also gives me a broader perspective of science since my major focuses on a lit of biology and chemistry but not on physics. Also, I have to take both calculus classes to complete my major requirements so physics helps me to understand the math course. Also, vise versa because after my calculus class I have my physics class and the courses are very similar because physics has a lot of math in it and calculus deals with a lot of shape and motion. Taking both courses teaches me a lot and again this is not where my major focuses but it helps me to get where I want to go and all of this information is very useful in any stem major’s success. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1337,"My goals for this semester are to pass all my classes, turn it all my assignments on time, and joining study groups. I would like to join a study group this semester because it is something that I didn't do last semester and I believe it will benefit me by helping connect with other students that are similar or in the same situation as me. I believe this class is going to help me achieve these goals because we do a lot of group work and I feel like that is a good way to connect with my peers."
