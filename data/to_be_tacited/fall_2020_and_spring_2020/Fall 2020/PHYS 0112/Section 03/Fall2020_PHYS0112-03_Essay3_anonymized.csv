2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1323,"When life is challenging I turn to my friends and ask them for advice. Some other things I do are just relax and take some me time, like watching shows and playing games. So far all my classes are easy except for Organic Chemistry, which has been giving me the most stress, but luckily I havent been too stressed out from it. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1331,When life gets challenging I end up having a complete mental breakdown. sometimes I have two. I end up praying to god to give me strength so i can keep going because i tend to just give up easily. I believe that if you manifest things it will come to you. so I recently started doing that. I keep a positive attitude and just hope for the best. My destiny will eventually lead me to where I need to be in life. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1314,"So far this semester has taught me that I need to manage my time more wisely. Some weeks are better than others so it feels like I have everything under control then out of nowhere I feel myself to be overwhelmed and stressed by the workload I have. I think I need to get back in the groove of looking up the material I have to study, homework, and lectures the a few days the week before a new week begins. That is a solution that might help if I do not get lazy and just stick to what I think might help me out more."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1332,"When life gets challenging, I like to look back on my past experiences and remember how I persevered in times of adversity and the skills that I learned by overcoming those challenges. Especially at tough points in the semester, I like to make sure I have everything planned out with a to do list, due dates written down, and specifics color coded in my planner to make sure I don't forget to do an assignment or study for an exam. Things that help me during these challenging times are taking breaks for myself like; a walk around the neighborhood, a long shower, eating a good meal without being on technology, meditation, and more self care activities to give my mind a break. I like to check my planner frequently to stay on top of things and hang out with like minded people who are also motivated and on top of their assignments and goals. This semester I have been struggling a lot with being in isolation and my mental health. This has caused me to fall behind on assignments with a lack of motivation, which I never usually do, so I have been struggling with that, but I am working on overcoming these challenges and learning more about myself. I know that I will be able to use this experience and these struggles and learn from them for the future. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1312,When things get difficult I tend to shut down and get overwhelmed. Ive been able to identify this when it happens and take a step back to see what I need to do in terms of priorities. Taking a minute to understand what I need to do and when I need to do as well as making a list helps me a lot. Once I have a list or a goal I can usually follow it until it needs editing or I have completed it. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1334,For me when life gets hard I relay a lot on my faith and have to remind myself who I am in Christ. I also try and practice self care to keep my mind and body in good health. I sometimes can forget how much progress I made over time and have to remind myself that times will not always be this challenging and as long as I continue to work hard I can get to where I need to go in the long run. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1333,"When life gets challenging, I am not sure what to do. They say that time heals all wounds, but I'm finding that, I don't exactly have all the time in the world. Eventually, I have to just keep going on with my life. An RA in the dorm building that I lived in my first year at San Francisco State told me that, I can't just keep running from my problems. And, I kind of realize, whatever problems I have, I have to eventually realize that I have them and work on them. If whatever is challenging is something I cannot change, I should still keep going, even if it's hard. If I let challenges in life stop me, I won't overcome them. Life is too short to waste significant amounts of time worrying or being down about things I cannot change. Sure, those things still make me sad, but I believe challenges in life are normal, and are meant to be overcome, or lived with in spite of them."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1324,"When life gets challenging I like to stop and think why I'm having a difficult things and think about them. Think about them in a way that helps me relax. First, I'll think if the reasons why I'm having a hard time, are fixable by me. If so, i could do soemthifn in order to not be having these challenges and overcoming them. The other thing I do is if they are not in my capabilities to be fixed, then there is nothing I can do so I should not let it get to me and stress me out. I think challenges are good because they make me think and help me become stronger. If I am feeling very overwhelmed I like to take a mental day for myself and be lazy at home just lounging around watching my favorite shows with my boyfriend. I feel at peace when I'm hanging out with my significant other watching our favorite tv shows and eating our favorite food."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,545,"What I do when life gets challenging when it’s either personal or just  school/work related is I just don’t care. I just don’t care what happens  and I just try to ignore most of the stress so I can do what needs to  be done. Because on how I see it is if I start caring and get stressed  out or get depressed that’s how it gets worse. And it will only make  what you are trying to do harder for yourself for no reason. And at  least for me it works most of the time, although there are times where  that fails and that’s when it’s really bad and I can get it out of my  mind I try to do something it could be any task. Such as watching videos  taking notes on lecture slides online. Just so I have something to do  and keep my mind from getting stressed or depressed."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,550,"When life gets challenging for me I try to solve my problems through the means of how likely things are to happen in the future. By that I mean, I think about how likely I am to stick to a certain method, or if my work or time is valued in what I'm doing. So when something challenges me, I figure out how to tackle it without taking the most losses on my end. As long as I can accomplish the task, that is the goal. So I get less sleep, spend less time on things I like to do, find shortcuts/alternatives to help my workload, etc. I'm a bit of a problem solver If I do say so myself. But lastly, my mindset is, the world is out to get me so I expect less in the first place so I'm not surprised and I prepare for the worst."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1317,"The challenge we often face is that most people will focus on the wrong things in difficult situations. In my opinion, there are two places that make people more vulnerable in difficult times.First, almost everyone tends to focus on the external environment, rather than the internal resources that you have to master the challenge. Yes, losing a loved one is painful and there is no problem; caring for an older adult or managing a full-time job, commuting and caring for a family with children are all very difficult. These things are very challenging, but they are also the embroidery of life itself. Love, care, and friendship are our values. Loving the people we love is a very meaningful way to participate in life-even if they are painful and exhausting."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1330,When life gets challenging I like to sometimes reflect and see if I could do anything different to make the situation less challenging. Also sometimes I do breathing exercises and yoga to put myself in a better state to think of solutions possible. I believe that a clear mind can work much better than a mind that has a million things that they are thinking about. Putting myself in the best situations to make up for the challenging situations that I might be in.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1320,"I may do many different things when life gets challenging. Depending on the scenario, I may act differently. For example, if we were discussing in terms of school, when it becomes challenging, I usually take a break and distract myself because sometimes my brain gets fried and I become overwhelmed. When I get overwhelmed, I tend to lose focus and dose off and not take the assignments seriously. So, I would pause and distract myself a little bit. I may use the restroom, eat a snack, go on m phone a little bit, ask someone for some help (whether being a classmate or instructor) or work on something else. If we are discussing in terms of being challenged in general, I sometimes like a challenge. I would use my resources to complete my task. I would also ask for help from others including my friends, family, instructors, or someone who I know (who knows these skills very good). I do not usually give up until I reach at a certain point. That certain point includes not receiving help from anyone, online resources do not help out, consistent multiple attempts. This rarely happens but I am not really the type to give up."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1321,"When life gets challenging you to push through it because if you stop then you will stop trying your best. You have to push through when life gets challenging because it is like a roadblock to being successful in life. Not everyone has easy lives where there is no challenge in it. Everyone has roadblocks in their life that can change who they are and what they do. When life gets challenging you just have to push through it because it makes you who you are and sometimes I've had those challenges where I think that I cant push through it but in the end, I end up pushing through it and making it back on the other side. The challenge can be hard but when you make it through you will feel better and happy that you have passed through a challenging obstacle in your life that will define who you are. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1336,"I think I have been getting better about managing my stress and anxiety when life gets challenging. At the start of the pandemic and lockdown, I think I was too given to despair and giving up on my schoolwork when things looked difficult, which resulted in me failing a few classes this past spring. Lately, I have been able to distance myself from those feelings and focus on the present, and the things I need to accomplish to mitigate that anxiety and despair. I think before I would let overdue work pile up, which then would just result in a compounding of my academic despair -- I'm doing my best to stay on top of all of my assignments, which has been helping a lot."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1337,"When life gets challenging for me I keep on going because I believe life is always going to be throwing them to you whether you want them or not. Having a challenge thrown at you can be difficult most of the time because sometimes they can make you feel lost, but I believe that if you feel lost its just life telling you to make a different or new  path for yourself."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1313,"When my life gets challenging, I turn to my creator. I read the Quran and I pray my five prayers with full attention and full reverence. That is always my first step because that is the step that quickly takes away my current pain and worries and rids me of those negative emotions, then I make dua and wish for the best for my family, myself, my people, and all Muslims, then all people. Then I get to work. Because that is who I am, a problem solver. I will not let things keep me down for too long. What helps me also is reminding myself that this life is meant to be a test, it is meant to be challenging. It is rewarding to accept your reality and love it for what it is. Once that mindset is acquired, you start looking at life differently and end up finding so much more beauty and content in the small details. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1316,"When ever I feel like I'm drowning in work, I give myself a mental break. I love music so I have expensive audiophile headphones that I would put on and just drift away to a different world where I can forget all my problems. This seems to help me when I'm stressed from school work, but luckily for me I'm not someone who stresses that often. However in the few times that life has hit me with challenges that I felt I couldn't handle on my own, I would look towards my mother for advice and help. My mother is one of the smartest people that I know. She is super calculating and knows how to read people and their intentions so well. She is widely respected by everyone on my father's side of the family. My mother always has the final say in any family decisions regarding my father's side. I hope that sheds some light into how intelligent and respected she is. Whenever I've hit any roadblocks, she makes herself available no matter what she's doing so that she can help her favorite son with anything he needs. I'm her only son so I need live up to her expectations."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1328,"When life gets challenging, I try to do either two things: do something to distract myself or try to face the problem head-on. I usually try to fix the problem first, but if it is a certain situation or decision that I cannot immediately act on, I then try to distract myself to either wait until I can fix it or keep my mind off of the problem until I do not think about it anymore. Either doing activities that I already like doing such as watching movies or drawing help, but I also try to do something new so I can turn my worry or stress into excitement. I also like to spend time with either my pets, family, or my boyfriend to help keep my mind off of my worries because it's easier to deal with a problem if you're not facing it alone. When I'm alone (like most people), I tend to just spend time by myself thinking about things that could end up with me worrying about things I know I shouldn't be."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1319,"Yesica Onofre FletesReflective Journaling #3""What do I do when life gets challenging?""            There are multiple things that I do in order to make sure it doesn’t affect my life. I am a very emotional person everything seems to quickly hurt me emotionally. Therefore, one of the things that I first di is go talk to someone about what has happened to me. I feel like if I talk to someone it helps me calm down and reflect on what has just happened. I also seem to mediate I feel like it helps me calm down. I also like going on walks or runs just to get a clear mind I often feel like I need to have a clear mind to even try and resolve the problems because if not I seem to just go in circles and I think negatively about everything, That is what I need to fix I feel like I need to always think of all the good things when things go wrong just because I feel like things will never get better thinking negatively."
