Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1312,I am here so I can learn more about physics and fulfill requirements for SFSU. I wouldn't take physics if I didn't have to but I think I will learn new problem solving skills and techniques to deal with mathematical equations. Once I am done with school I hope to help with research on coastal fish species like salmon and steelhead to help conserve and restore the wild populations we have observed before. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1313,"I am here because I have a goal. My interests and life experiences have ended me up here. And I am very proud of where I have gotten. It is not possible to satisfy all of our needs in one lifetime and be truly happy, but what we can do to get super close is to find a purpose. And I am here because I feel like this is where I am destined to be. This entire journey of premed will one day, with enough work and dedication, will end in me becoming a pediatric surgeon. I am here because I know that there are people with similar problems to me that will need help in the future and I want to make sure to be a lending hand for all of them. I am here because I will be needed to save someone's life one day. Kenan Mirou"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1314,I am here in this physics class because it is a requirement for my major. I am a KIN major so I need this course as a pre-requisite for some of my other upper division classes. I have taken physics in high school but I did not do so well. I am hoping that this time around I can do better than I have in the past. I have been having trouble with getting use to this new online platform because I am use to in class sessions. I have taken online classes before but they were nothing like how they are now. But other than that I know this class will be hard and I just have to be open to making more time for my studies.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1315,"I am in this class because it is a requirement for my major and a prerequisite for several upper division courses I need to take. I am a transfer student, and my major is marine biology. I have not taken a physics class since high school but I am hoping this class will be a good refresher without being too difficult. I assume it will not be hard because it is the lab for the introductory physics course. I am also taking this course at the same time as another lab course which could be a good thing because they may go somewhat hand-and-hand, but I am hoping the overlap does not get too confusing. I usually like science courses, usually biological science courses, but hopefully this physics course will be fun, I am looking forward to some of the labs."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1316,"Why am I here?I am here because of my passion for the medical field and my wanting of continuing education. I used to be an EMT. I loved that job so much. Working that job made me feel so whole and like I had done something with my life. I felt as that I had made a change in the world and impacted so many lives already. I wanted to become a paramedic next. However after we dropped off the patient at the hospital I would probably never see that patient again. I wanted to know the outcome of my patients. So knowing that, I changed my career to nursing. But again after a year of that I realized I wanted to do even more. So why am I here? I’m here at SFSU as a transfer student to get my B.S. in Biology with a concentration in physiology so that I can apply for medical school or dental school after. I really want to be able to make a change in people's lives. As a doctor, I would be saving lives, but also get to see the progress with my patient. As a dentist I would be owning my own private office and I could help patients of lower income. My parents own a small business and they always help people out when they can’t afford it. I’m inspired by my parents and I hope to make a bigger positive impact in other strangers' lives. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1317,"Physics is a basic science aiming at studying the basic laws of material structure and movement in nature. It is also a discipline of importance to other disciplines. It is the foundation of modern civilization. Since Newton's epoch-making treatise on the mathematical principles of natural philosophy, physics has been an independent discipline. It is a discipline that studies the laws of nature. We find the laws from the chaos of nature, use the laws, and then explain all phenomena of nature. TV, mobile phone, computer, Internet. 2, modern medical equipment CT, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), X-ray (X-ray pictures), etc. 3. Cars, high-speed trains, planes, ships, warships, etc., are all based on physics. Anyone who intends to do any kind of technical work needs to understand the fundamentals of physics, and thus the fundamentals on which our modern, high-tech society depends. And physics also promotes the development of human society. I think the reason why I am in this class is that I hope to learn more physics knowledge. Because we have a lot of physical knowledge in our life, so it is necessary to learn physics. Another main reason is that this course is a required course for me, because I need to get credits from this course to graduate"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1318,"Why am I here?  This question is quite broad… however, it will approach it as… Why am I here in the physics class?  Well this is a class I require for my major as a cell biologist. This class will help me graduate and eventually help me on my future to become a Clinical Researcher either in UCSF or USF or Genentech. I already took physics classes in Spain but I am required to take physics for my major. Maybe because most of biology student tend to have a path in medicine and they need physics to understand maybe some biomechanics, similar of how medical students need to know calculus to understand and learn how to read the ECG waves. Physics are important for a lot of everyday live problems, from driving a car to skiing. That is the reason why I am in this class."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1319,"Yesica Onofre FletesSeptember 2, 2020Reflective Journaling #1""Why am I here?"" I think everyone has a different purpose to why they are here today. I often question myself how different my life would be or how it would my life be if I was not who I am. I know that many times we battle certain obstacles and we question why us, but I am a stronger believer that everything happens for a reason and only the strongest soldiers are put for those battles. I have set my goals and priorities straight; I prefer to stay home and study rather than to go out because I know in the long run all the studying is going to pay off. I will graduate from SFSU with a bachelor’s in biology with a concertation in physiology. I know I want to help sick children; my goal is to attend medical school and become a successful pediatrician. I want to do something I have passion every day, I think that being an intern during high school helped me find that passion.  I think my purpose is to help others just because I always tend to do that. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1320,"David Botello 09/01/20 Reflective Journal 	The main reason why I am taking this physics course is because it is one of my prerequisites and requirements for my major. My major is General Biology and I am not sure what career path I am choosing yet. I have taken physics in high school and I am hoping it would be similar because it was fairly easy and fun. I would say that my previous experience in physics was fairly good and understandable. Although, I took physics a couple years ago so I would need a refresher on some of the material. The labs for physics are extremely useful in my opinion because they give me a visual representation and they give me a better understanding of the topics. I am not sure how lab would operate during online classes but hopefully it would be great. Other than that, I am hopeful that most of the material would be familiar and I would succeed in this course successfully."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1321,"I am here because I am going to learn about Physics and why it exists. I also need Physics for a prereq for my major because it is required. I learned physics back in high school and it was ok not really in-depth but I did really enjoyed physics when I was in high school. Hopefully learning physics again would be easier but I don't know since this is a college-level class. I also like to learn physics because it is more hands-on than any other science in my opinion. Physics to me is the study of how things move and how things interact with each other such as gravity and forces. In high school, we mainly learned about Newton's law and what forces are. We also learned what the law states and mean and did science experiments based on them. Hopefully in physics lab we get to learn more in-depth about it and learn other interesting topics in Physics besides the basics. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1322,"For this question, there are many ways that I interpret it. Why am i here in this class? Well honestly, I am here because it is part of my pre req requirements to get into dental school. But the other way i interpret it is, Why am i here on this Earth? I think I am here because I was born. I do not really believe in predestination or that we are here for a specific reason. But my current purpose on being alive is just to enjoy what life has to give me. I want to have as much fun before I die and that I am going to do everything I can to remain on that goal. And for me to do that I have to make money. Although money isn't what will lead me to happiness, it allows me the freedom to do whatever I want. And the idea of being free, and doing anything that I want is the main purpose of me being here. And if I can change a few people's life at a certain moment in time then so be it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1323,"Why am I here? I guess Im just here to fulfill my requirements for my major. I havent really put a lot of thought into what Im really doing, but I guess I want to do something in the STEM field. As of now I was thinking about doing forensics after I get my degree in B.A Chemistry. I guess Im just here to try and set myself up for success and live a relatively comfortable life. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1324,"I am here in this class to fulfill a requirement for my major. I am majoring in environmental science, I choose this major because of my love for nature and this planet that we live on. I want to learn more about this beautiful planet and how it works. We as humans have been treating it bad in the past years and I would want to have a career in something to which I am able to give back to earth and help heal it. Although I know just me as 1 person I cannot do much, but I hope to achieve something in which generations after me could continue doing and we hopefully help heal earth one step at a time. I would also love working as a park ranger and protect our national parks which sometimes get disturbed by us humans by leaving trash, not being cautious with fires and more. I would love to retire when I am older as a park ranger and live in a national forest.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1325,"I am here because I am a biochemistry major and physics is a part of the prerequisites to meet this major. Also, in my opinion, physics, biology and chemistry are all intertwined with each other. It seems like they would not be because they are all different subjects but all of science is connected. Even though I am a biochemistry major, whenever I take physics I learn so much about every day life things and it makes my biochem classes make more sense sometimes. Physics explains motion in my opinion, and motion has everything to do with our lives every single day. With physics I can explain why a ball drops when you let go or why it doesn’t move if you do not touch it. Although these things already make sense to a non science major, it is still valuable to learn this information and to know when to use it when necessary. This class has a lot of value in many ways and I am glad to be taking it. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1326,"Sebastian Johnson   PHYS 112.03   9/1/2020     Why Am I here?     I see this as a very existential/broad question, why am I here in the class or why am I here   in general. I’m here in class because I want to learn more about physics and further my education   in S.T.E.M. This class is one of the classes I need to gain my biology degree or transfer. I plan to   transfer to UC Berkeley with this as one of my classes. I’m here at SF state because this   university has a great biology department, I want to leave because what my passion is-   neuroscience, SF state doesn’t provide that major.   For the more existential point of view, of “why am I here?” I feel I am here to create   positive change in the world, to have an impact on others. I already have plans to create a   program to help black students in a way that hasn’t been thought about previously."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1327,"I am here in this class to meet prerequisites for orthotics and prosthetics masters degree programs. I am here at SFSU because I want to get my Bachelors in Kinesiology, because I always wanted to live in the city, and because it is close to my military base. I am here to hopefully make a difference in the world and help others. I am here to experience, to feel, to do, to live life as fully as possible. I am here to make the most out of every opportunity and to experience new opportunities even if it is out of my perceived comfort zone. Biologically, I am here because of my parents, but I choose to stay here because I want to be here. I intend on living through it all- the good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1328,"I am in this class because it is one of the requirements for my major. As a biology major, even though physics is different from biology, I think learning about all the fields in science is helpful in understanding the world. I did not take physics until early on in college, and a lot of what I learned helped make sense of what I learned over the past few years in biology and chemistry. It might not be directly related but biology still has some physics in it. In understanding animals for biology, physics can help us understand how they move and the factors that affect it, such as weight and gravity. One common example of how physics is relevant to us is how cars move. It is related to some of the topics we have already discussed in class, such as velocity, acceleration, and distance."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,784,"I am here in this class because it fulfills my major requirements. I am also here because I love science and learning about it. Physics is hard because it contains math and so much more, but I have been told that that is the fun part of it. I am eager to finally get a better grasp of understanding physics and seeing how it can be applied to our outside world. I hope to master this course as well as the next required physics course, so that I can hopefully tutor other students that are struggling in stem, just like I am. Stem can be such a difficult field and a lot of valuable information is gate-kept, which is not fair to a lot of students, especially first-generation students. I hope to change this and by advancing my education, I am further able to assist more students in various different fields, such as physics. My major is microbiology but I love learning about different fields of science and will continue to do so."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1329,"I am here firstly because this class is a prerequisite for my degree in zoology. I don't believe that that is the entire reason I'm in the class, however. I am taking this class, and every other class, to expand my mind and gather the mental tools to make sense of the world around me in a rational way. I'm a first-generation university student so I'm mostly just grateful for the opportunity to study and see the world through so many different lenses. I like to learn new concepts and apply them to other fields or concepts that create a deeper context and more connected mind-map of ideas, because I think ultimately most things are related or connected in some way. I'm no philosopher but I think physics might help to make sense of that thought because it is, after all, the study of the laws of nature."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1330,"Why am I here? I am here to give back to the world. I feel at my best when I am able to put myself aside and help someone feel happy or get better on whatever the task is on hand. I have so many things I want to be able to do for my community and hopefully for the world. I want to be able to be remembered when I die from more than just my friends and family. I want to be remembered by everyone I am hopefully going to help in my life. I want to also be able to set up my family for success, I continue to put all this pressure on myself because i know I can achieve the goals I have for myself. I want to make my family, friends and community proud cause if this year has taught me anything is that a smile and positivity goes a long way."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,550,"Why am I here, I feel I am here to further my understanding of Physics to qualify for my major of Zoology. Aside from that, I'm here in college to better myself for the future and hopefully find a career that not only pays well but also I enjoy a lot. my life has led up to college and I have been looking for career paths I could actually see myself working in. A stepping stone into the major of biology is a better understanding of the world and its laws first before diving further into the life that inhabits the earth. My hopes are to come away from this class with a passing grade and with a better overall understanding of basic physics seeing as this is the first physics class I have taken in my life. I want to be able to truly feel like I belong in the STEM field and to do that I need to understand the maths that are required for STEM. With the support of my teachers and peers, I will come away from this class successfully. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1331,"The reason why I am here is because I want to pursue my dreams of becoming a pediatrician. To me getting an education is really important. I don't want to struggle like my mom did, and im hoping to re pay her back for everything that shes done for me. I also love working with children so being a pediatrician is what im looking forward to for my future job. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,545,"I am here to take this class because it is required for my Biology  Cellular and Molecular major. I need to take Phys 112 and more Phys  after that. Other then that I've actually never taken physics in my life  before. In high school I took biology and forensic courses instead of  physics course. So because of that I am very new to physics all I know  about physics is that a lot of it has to do with math which I am somewhat  comfortable with and I know there are formulas that I will need to understand what they do and how to apply them to a problem. As for my math skills I took calculus 1 a year ago and barely passed it with a C and algebra 1 & 2 two years  ago which I had no problem with, although I'm going to be a little rusty with my mathematical skills, but I  think I will be fine hopefully."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1332,"I am here because I plan on going to medical school after I receive my bachelor's degree. I have been working on my prerequisites since my freshman year in addition to my major coursework. Since I'm working on the prerequisites aside from my major courses, I have been taking overload courses since starting college. I normally take between 18-22 units a semester. I find this challenging as I am also working (sometimes 2-3 jobs), but I enjoy the challenge and I know it will get me where I want to be. This is my first physics course, so I am nervous with how it will go as the lecture portion appears to be moving quickly (or maybe I'm still trying to settle in). "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1333,"The question, ""why am I here?"" is a pretty deep question. I don’t know if this question ponders why we are alive today in this world or why we are in this class. I think I’m in this class because I want to get a degree in the sciences, but, I ultimately don’t know if this is really what I want to do. Science has always been something that I’ve had a great interest in, which is why I’m currently a biology major. I haven’t taken a great interest in any other subject, really. Why I am here, on earth, I don’t know. I’d like to think that I have the answer to that, but the reality is I don’t know if I ever will. Though, I think it’s okay not to know the origins of life or why we’re here. What matters is that we still live life in a moral and ethical manner. I think life is rather short, so we should use our time with it wisely."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1334,I feel that I am here to make a difference in my community where ever that it. I believe that God created me for a purpose of creating compassion. I feel that I am learning as well as teaching people compassion and understanding that everyone has their own challenges and that you cannot compare people. I realized that I am prone to making mistakes and that these mistakes help me teach others as well as grow stronger. I am very happy that I am able to encourage my community and provided a safe space for people to be vulnerable and not feel judged.
