2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1321,I think that there are a lot of resources that support me through my school year. My family can support me if I have trouble with work because some of my siblings already graduated from college so they can give me resources to help me as well. I think that another resource that I have to support me is the teacher's office hours. Office hours are a good resource in supporting my learning because it allows me to ask the teachers questions if I have trouble with them during lectures. This is really useful for upcoming tests or test questions that I got stuck on which can help me improve my learning ability.  Office hours are really nice because it allows you to ask questions if you didn't have time to ask during the lecture. Sometimes lectures could be hard to understand so you can ask clarifying questions to help improve your learning.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1322,"With being at home and doing school online, a lot of my resources that the school has supplied to me has been limited. But the resources I do have are internet and my computer so I am able to do my assignments. Some other resources I have that have always been there is google. With google I am able to supplement my learning because online classes are sometimes incredibly hard to comprehend the material. Another resource that I have is my parents. While being in college, this is not something I am use to having because they do not live close to my college. Having them helps a lot because they are always there to help if I have any problems. My teachers have also been trying to support us more because they understand the stress and hardships of online classes and I feel they are more of a resource now than they were before."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1316,"The resources that I have to support me is my loving family and my friends. I also have my ipad which is really useful for my classes as i'm able to write on the pdf slides. I don't know how I would get through these labs if I didn't have my ipad to write on the labs and draw the diagrams. I would say that my ipad is one of my main resources. My professors and utilizing office hours is another main resource that I definitely use when I need the extra help to understand new material. I am lucky to have such resources to help me get to my goals. My family and friends are very supportive of my education and they support me in wanting to reach my goal of wanting to be a doctor. Since I know they are supporting me, It gives me motivation to carry on and try my hardest to reach that goal. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1331,"When it comes to resources I'm pretty sure I have a quite few. The most obvious, the internet. I also have EOP to support me which they actually help a lot. especially with tutoring. There is also the support from advisors, however I get really intimidating to even approach their office hours because I get scared that they will tell me i am doing everything wrong, and I would hate to start all over. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1314,"I have quiet a few resources to help me get passed this lab course. The most helpful to me are committing my time to show up to the lectures and participate when given the chance to and utilizing the people in my class. another helpful resource that I use sometimes are youtube videos and other video usage that are available. Lastly, I can probably use office hours best to my own advantage."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1333,"I feel that I don’t have many resources to support me. I feel that a physical copy of a book would be much better than an etextbook, but I don’t own a physical copy of a physics book. I think that I mostly rely on the PDFs of the labs to really learn. Then, if I feel that I need clarification on a topic or problem, I can ask in class or email a professor with my question. Additionally, I can also ask a classmate during the lab’s breakout rooms if they know the topic. Another resource I guess I can consider a resource are the in lab simulations. The in lab simulations are accessible through the links that are indicated in the various labs. These simulations can provide a visual representation of various topics and example problems given in the lab and are a great visual aid for visual learners."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1328,"In terms of education, my resources to help me in my learning are iLearn and my professors. Because of the remote learning situation, a lot of the information from the classes are readily available online, such as the syllabus or zoom meeting recordings. If I forget what an assignment is about, there is a good chance that it might be on iLearn with instructions. I also communicate with other students so we can remind each other of due dates and any questions we have for each other regarding the material we are learning about. In case I have any personal issues or questions that cannot be answered by what I see on iLearn, I know I can either email my professors or set up a Zoom meeting with them during their student office hours. I know that there is also a tutoring service and support classes for science that are meant to help me succeed. Although I do not personally need them, I know these resources are there for me to take advantage of whenever I need them."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1325,"The resources that I have are my books and the notes that I take from class. Also, one of my aunts is biochemical engineer for a company but she deals a lot with mostly physics. She also has books that she has given me from her college days to help her understand the information so it helps me to understand the information as well. My family is really supportive of my schooling and whenever I study or whenever I am in class, I always have a quiet place to go to so that I can focus better. I also have the specific book for this class, and when I do not understand something that we learned in class or that I watched from the video, I am able to go back to the chapter in the book and reread it and take notes. This really helps me especially when I go through the problems in the book because they also do a list of knowns and unknowns for every problem. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1315,"Most of the resources I used are from the physics lecture. The workbook provided is somewhat helpful. It is a lot more helpful when I use it to follow along with the lectures. The lectures being posted as videos after the class is done is also very useful, and it is what I mainly use to review and study while doing homework or studying for the exams. I also use the textbook a lot for the homework for the physics lecture. The textbook is probably the most helpful resource readily available, it usually has the answers to what I am looking for. There are also several internet resources I use if I can not find the answer to something through the textbook. These sources include random Youtube videos and webpages. I also sometimes ask my friends for help on the homework, but most of their knowledge is pretty limited."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1335,I honestly feel like I have a moderate amount of support because my work is flexible enough to let me take classes at whatever time I need but when I need help on homework or understanding a concept it can get more difficult. I think it feels a lot like I'm on my own in terms of school work because I can't afford any tutors and there's no one there to help me when I need it. no one in my family has taken physics or remembers it if they have so its really up to me to try and figure out how to pass. When I do ask for help on work it feels like the help comes in late because not everyone is on the same schedule and its hard to get someone to help me at that moment. It really does feel like it's just me and google trying to figure out how to pass this class but I guess thats what online courses consist of anyways 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1320,"One of the many resources that I have available for me are my instructors. If I have any confusions or questions about the topics, material, homework or any general questions in the course, I would attend office hours, ask in the zoom meetings or simply email them. My instructors usually reply quickly so that is a good thing. Another resource I have are my classmates. I always check in with my classmates with any questions or concerns about the class. Sometimes we end up having the same question and we ask the instructor. I can also research online to find the answers I am looking for. The main and useful resources that I have access to are my instructors, classmates and the internet. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,784,"I have numerous resources of support to help me. The first resource would be my family and friends. I am also fortunate that SF state offers tutoring, academic advising, counseling, and much more. The only downfall to this is that these resources are not the easiest to find since they are not known about very well. I do have confidence that our school will advertise these resources better in the future and I am grateful to know about them and often tell my peers about these resources, so that they can find the same help. Without any of these resources, I would not be where I am at today.I know other campuses may offer even more resources due to the amount of money that they bring in and although SF State is not the top campus, our students have quite a success rate given what we have. This proves that ultimately the student is the one that has to be motivated to find the right resources and take advantage of them."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1332,"Some resources that I have to support me are my friends and family, my boyfriend, my professors, my therapist, and my psychiatrist. My friends, family, and boyfriend have been my biggest supporters throughout my life and college experience and I know I will always have them to turn to with anything that I need. My professors are also a great resource for support when I need more assistance in a class or for finding other resources offered on campus that can help me. At the beginning of this semester I reached out to CAPS, the counseling service offered on campus and they connected me to a therapist and psychiatrist when I began really struggling with my mental health. They have both been so helpful to me this semester and are helping me overcome my challenges. I wish more students knew about this resource and felt comfortable reaching out to them when they need it. Some other helpful resources that I like to use that aren't other people are websites like Khan Academy where I can get extra help in many different subjects as needed. I also like to take time to focus on myself when possible, so doing a workout while following a youtube video, doing yoga, going for a walk, and more things like this are also resources that support me. Being in nature and getting sunlight always helps to rejuvenate me and give me a little boost of much needed energy."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1313,"Throughout my academic journey, I have experienced regular ups and downs. But sometimes, things can get challenging to a level where I need to depend on a source of support to keep myself from dropping the ball. I always start with my father, he is my primary source for life advice and support. He can also help me with some academics since he has an engineering Ph.D. and masters. Then, if I see that I need help on something more specific, I turn to my classmates. Usually, I have a person in every class that I exchange course info and deadlines with throughout the semester. If both of us could not figure something out, then I reach out to my professor's TA or my professor directly if they do not have a TA. These sources are the most important to me in terms of my academic life. In terms of my mental state, well that is kept well by the beautiful connection I have with Mariam, who is someone very special, and my prayers to Allah that can take me out of any state of mind where I feel stuck and hopeless. Those are my sources of support. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1336,"Luckily, I have lots of resources at hand, although admittedly less than I did pre-pandemic. When I was going to community college, I never fully took advantage of the resources available to me, I rarely went to the tutoring center, and I didn't really go out of my way to form study groups. In a way that might be a good thing, since it prepared me for the isolated learning that the covid pandemic has necessitated. Lately I have been relying more heavily on Khan Academy, which has been pretty helpful for both this class and my calculus class. Outside of academics, I am lucky to have the support of my friends and family, all of whom are relatively close by, and healthy."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1312,"I have a lot of resources that I can use to help me whether that be from SFSU or friends and family. I took a SCI class to help with physics this semester and it helped a lot with the actual work and studying but also served as a place to talk with other people and get to know some faces through online learning. There are a lot o resources through SFSU as well like tutoring, mental health support, financial support, etc. and that what part of tuition pays for so they are resources for students to take advantage of. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1324,"I have plenty of resources to support me. My resources are fully available to me whether it is online or in person. I have resources available through the school websites. Which comes from a major resource, the internet itself. The internet is such a big resource to me in my school and personal life. The internet has so much to offer, I could look up just about anything and everything that you would think of. I fully take advantage of it and the other resources that are handily available for me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1330,"I have a lot of resources at my disposal, some thing that’s really good about living in the year that we live in is having access to the Internet. The Internet has access to pretty much any questions that we may have or at least references to where we can find stuff. The Internet is much faster than in years past and we also have access to the people that didn’t have Internet would use like a library, we can access pretty much any book or text book. We also have access to tutors or any expects in almost any subject. Countless websites or videos can get us the help that anyone may be looking for, there really is no excuse to not finding the help we need."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1327,"Resources that I have to support me included: my peers, professors, advising, counseling, clubs/groups, tutoring, HPW/Mental health Services/etc. However, it is not so much what is available to me, but more of the quality of which is available to me. I find that there has been a lot of people that I have come across this semester that simply do not put in as much effort as I had hoped they would. I also find that some professors I have/had at SFSU are not so helpful when it comes to the wellbeing of their students. I also it find it difficult to access some of these resources considering the times we are in and how there are more people also trying to use the same resources so access is limited and when you finally get someone's attention it is short lived because they have to get through a hundred more people behind you. As far as groups/clubs/programs/etc. I find that people are there to get a good line in their resume's rather then actually caring about the people that seek out their resources. So really, to answer the question- yes, I know my resources, but no I do not feel like they ""support me."""
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1323,Some of the resources I use to help me are the internet to be honest. I think the internet is a great way of figuring out problems that you dont understand. I know theres always office hours I can go to if I ever really need it. I also tend to ask my friends a lot who've taken the same class. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1319,"Yesica Onofre Fletes December 10, 2020 ""What resources do I have to support me?""I think I have many resources in order to support me. First of all, I have two professors both being John Brewer and yourself. There are also two teacher assistances from my lecture class. I also know there are still tutoring services to help through zoom from the student services. I also know that I have my classmates that are a great resource. There is a study group discord that is there to help others who need it. I also know that there are also office hours for both John Brewer and you. I also think that other resources that I have for myself are class notes and class recording from my lecture class. "
