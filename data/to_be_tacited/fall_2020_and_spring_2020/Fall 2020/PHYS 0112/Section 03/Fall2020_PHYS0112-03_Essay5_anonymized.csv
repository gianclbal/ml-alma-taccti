2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1320,"Reflecting Journal 5            The values of my family have guided me through a great college experience. Both my parents did not attend college. Both my parents came into the United States about 30 years ago to have better opportunities for my siblings and I and for themselves. Knowing that my parents sacrificed so much motivates me to continue college and make them proud. That is what my parents would want. All my family members also support me in many different ways. I would be third person in my family to go to college. All of my siblings have gone to college and graduated with a degree. Graduating college is one of my goals. The community that I grew up in also navigated me through college by many factors. Everyone in my class, school and friends talked about attending college, what school and what they are studying. So, being in that crowd influenced me to attend college as well. My teachers, advisors and mentors played a major role in assisting me in a guidance through college"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,545,My  community and family don’t really help me too much navigate through  college too much. But what I guess what helps me get through the hard  times in college is thinking how much money my parents are wasting for  me to be able to be here. Failing means wasted money. I would have to  take the class over again. And just giving up college for the whole year  would be expensive for my parents and they would get really mad at me.  So just the thought of failing classes isn’t an option (at least  willingly and giving up). I have to try my hardest to pass. That’s what  my parents always tell me when I talk about my classes and I’m worried  about failing them.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1330,"My family has instilled the values of togetherness, hard work, and helping others. I try to make friends with different people who might look a little shy or don’t have the social skills talk to others. I know it can be hard to do so, so I try to make that effort. When I work with others I try to be assertive and carry my load and sometimes bring people along if I have to. Sometimes you get in groups and people don’t do their work as early as you would like to or people in your group stay quiet and have no leadership, but I was raised to rise up and lead and it’s something that I do when I work in groups. I’m thankful for all the values instilled in me by my family."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1324,"I am the oldest grandchild and the first one in my family to go to college. My family came from Mexico in order to have a better life and their values that they hold, their sacrifices that they have done, push me to do my best in school and to reach high. I am able to use our family values in a way to inspire me and push me through college. I hold them up high and use them to encourage me when I doubt myself and to push me when I feel like I can't do it any longer and want to give up. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1321,"In my community, I have gotten a lot of help navigating through college like what classes to take and what classes to take first. I think that my family has helped me a lot and supported me and my way through college. My sister in particular gave me some useful tips navigating through college and what classes I should take first. She recommended me to take all my GE classes before taking classes for my major which is what I am currently doing right now. She also helps me maintain my stress levels since everything is online learning. I really like how helpful my sister is by helping me navigate through college and she has helped me every time I asked for it. I think that with the help of your family and the help of your community navigating through college could be tough for them. This is why I am lucky to have a sister to help me navigate through college as well as my friends. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1331,"My whole family is hispanic, and in a hispanic household there aren't many opportunities that are just handed to us. Unfortunately we aren't as privileged as others. My parents dont have values, but what helped me navigate through college were their stories. My parents never finished middle school, and basically had to work at a really young age to get to where they are at today. They always tell me to get an education that way I get to study what I want to be in the future so that I don't have to suffer the way they did. Having the opportunity to remove my parents from poverty is what helps me navigate through college."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1323,"Definitely growing up in an asian household it was expected for me to go to college. Aside from that I wasnt really affected from their influence and kind of just did my own thing. If anything the people who affected me the most were my friends. I talk to them the most about everything happening and they give me a lot of their own opinions or advice to things I might be uncertain with. Some things that might also help me would be if I branched out to more people at sfsu, but at the same time its hard to do that right now because of the pandemic."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1312,My parents both graduated college and highly value a college degree because of how it can help me later in life. They emphasized studying whatever I find interesting but what I do study won't define what I do later in my career its more important to learn about how to adapt and educate myself. They are always there to help support me through anything and always have suggestions on how to handle different situations. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1319,"Yesica Onofre Fletes December 10,2020 Reflective Journaling #5""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?I think throughout my whole college career my values have not changed since the beginning. Ever since I started college, I tried my best to put myself forward over everything especially since Covid started. I have always and the support from my family and I’m so happy. I’m so glad that I have their support since I know that many people do not have the support of their family members. I know that can be really hard since college is really hard and stressful. My family supports me since I am the first-generation student. My mother had me when she was eighteen and my father abandoned us when I was a child. Therefore, I feel like my mom has pushed me a lot to where I am at now and honestly, I’d be really lost. My values are to respect peers around me in order for me to be respected. I think that people how respect others are respected i think that if I respect my professors, they are going to respect me. If I show integrity I will only benefit myself, since cheating has no benefit. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1334,My community reminds how far I have come by encouraging me and supporting me on my journey to college. My family supports me so much through their uplifting comments and always support me when I feel I can not make it through college. They remind me how far I have come and how I have faced so much adversity and still made it through. Without the support of my family or community I would not be able to make it through college. I appreciate my village so much. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1316,"Values that I hold are that hard work and perseverance through hardship goes a long way. My parents are some of the hardest working people that I know, and that hard work has translated to success. I want to be successful in what I do, not only for myself but also for my parents. I want them to be able to proudly tell their friends about what I do for a living. I’m also a huge car guy. I’ve had so many BMW’s because my dad is super into BMW’s. I want to someday buy him a nice supercar, but also I want to buy myself nice cars too. My parents spoil me, and I hope to one day spoil them too. My parents are definitely one of my biggest strengths. I wouldn’t be where I am right now if it wasn’t for their support. My girlfriend is definitely one of my biggest motivations to keep trying in school. She got her bachelor's degree in Bio and started grad school at 20, and that’s something I find so inspiring. She pushes me to be the best student that I can be, so I can’t let her down either. I also need to be a good role model to my little sister, because I’ve noticed that when I started working as an EMT she just wanted to work too, and when I went back to school, she stepped up her game. If I make it through grad school, I know it would be a huge inspiration for her to also try her hardest. I’m so lucky that I have so many resources, from friends and family that help me stay encouraged to always try my hardest and keep persevering.                            "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1313,"If I was to pick the best thing my community has taught me while growing up it would be to always stay busy. Always find something to work on. A person who is working is a productive and positive person that benefits everyone around them and does not have time for negativity or drama. This is one of the hardest things to uphold on a daily basis but I see the great benefit in it and I can see where it can lead me in the future, therefore, I am not giving up on it no matter what. Also, both of my parents have PhDs and masters degrees and they always tell me about the times when they felt exactly how I was feeling, and that it is very common to feel very lost in some classes and do very well in others. That is why we pick careers in life, it is because some of us are naturally into certain things which makes us learn more ansd more about them and master them and make a living out of doing them everyday. But in order to get there we need to acquire some very good general knowledge along the way to make us a well-rounded person because no one wants to be a one-dimensional version of themselves. This is what my family and my community have taught me. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1314,My family has helped me navigate through college by being very supportive from the very beginning. they understand that I am always busy from school and work and that it is hard for me to make a lot of time for them but they believe in me to get through it. I do not feel any negative emotion or anything from them but there concern on how well I am doing given that I will be the first in my family to graduate college so it would mean the world to them and myself to finish.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1333,"I don't know how to say that the values of my community have helped me navigate through college. I always felt this pressure like I needed to succeed but I'm intimidated seeing how poorly I'm doing and I see how well others seem to be doing. I feel that university has been very difficult and I don't really know people within my major which makes collaborative things like studying for exams with others difficult. Yet, I still don't give up because I think that I might have a chance. I know that there are some university students who gave up but there are also those who have told me that they wanted to give up, but now they're close to graduating. It hasn't been easy for me but I still push forward, knowing that there are others who struggle academically but still succeeded. I just hope that at the very least, I'm like them, in that I struggle but succeed."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,784,"The values of my community have helped me navigate through college because I come from a single-parent household and a low-income neighborhood. Witnessing my family's struggles, as well as our neighbors has motivated me to work as hard as I possibly can, so that I can later give back to the community that raised me. I would not be where I am today without the values my mother instilled in me and that was to always work hard and keep a humble heart. There are more values of course, but these two values I keep in mind the most often. One day I will be able to support my family, donate to my community, and teach my children the same values that I grew up on, and nothing inspires me more. Since I intend to become a doctor, I will also teach these values to students I mentor, so that younger generations will keep the mindset of working hard, but still remaining kind."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1328,"One of the strongest values from my family and culture that have helped me navigate through college is our strong sense of work ethic and responsibility. This is important because it helps me get past the days where I have little to no motivation to do anything. I always make sure to complete my work on time and keep track of my grades. College is the harder version of K-12 education and you are expected to be responsible for yourself and your education. While this may help me feel more like an adult, it also requires me to carry the responsibility of keeping track of my own education. These values are also useful during the times we are assigned group projects or simply group work during class. Having a sense of responsibility helps me focus and get my work done in a timely fashion. Although it has been harder to gather the motivation to keep pushing forward due to the completely online learning environment, I am still trying to get my work done on time."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1322,"With my family being a mix of 2 different cultures, american and chinese, it has shown me multiple sides to how people live and how the values differ drastically with culture. Because of this dynamic family values that I have grown up with, it better helps me understand other's people culture and viewpoints. Since we meet so many more people in college with many different backgrounds and viewpoints, it makes it easier for me to understand why they have these viewpoints instead of being ignorant about their beliefs. I think this is the most important part of college because, as we enter our new stage of life and we start building connections and start forming connections that will continue for a long time, the understanding of our values and respecting that of others is an extremely important skill I have learned from my multiple cultures at home. As for my community, they were extremely tight nit and extremely closed off to the world and being in college has completely changed those views."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1325,"My family, especially my mom is really into the concept of organization. She believes that if someone is organized in their life when it comes to their schedules and their rooms, etc, that it makes things easier for them. That is what I keep in mind when I am doing my classes. I always have my notes organized and all my notebooks with their correct books. I always have agendas for each day and have all my due dates for my homework in one place. Another value that we have is hard work. My community believes hard work can get anyone where they want to be, as long as they put the honest work and energy into it. This semester I am taking 9 classes and they are all science and math classes in order to fulfill my major requirements. It is a lot of work but if I stay organized and put in the energy, I will get it done. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,550,"I think my community values of struggling in America because of my skin color and the main goal being survival has heavily pushed my school thinking. So far with my college experience, obviously I want to do well in classes, and in the classes I'm adept at, I do well. But for the more difficult classes it comes down to survival. How can I best do well in this class while also tackling my other difficult classes. I try to find ways/shortcuts on getting better handling the information. Quizlets, memorization, understanding the types of tests the teachers give out and what their goal is for what they want us to learn and how. Should I focus on this class less and just pass to do well in another? Etc. I find the optimal way of success and shoot for that. As African Americans as well as other colored Americans have to fight 2 times as hard for the same others have, I have to fight to survive in college, and so far that has been working."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1317,"To successfully graduate from my college, my family play a significant role during this journey. To begin with, the value of my family focus on persistence, which it means that no matter what I am pursuing, I must complete even though getting trouble in the path. As well, my family always be my side where they give me support and guidance. Their support inspires me to be confident to pursue my dream and I do not feel confused in difficult times as they are like a light to shine in the dark. For instance, I have set up my goal in achieving my bachelor degree with A+, and my family encourage me all the time, and give me suggestion and guidance if necessary. Thereby, the value of my family helps me a lot in navigating through college from the perspective on inspiring and assistance, where I believe that I will get through all courses with my best effort in college."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,3,1332,"The values of my community and family have helped me navigate through college by teaching me perseverance, grit, integrity, and hard work. I have learned that it is okay to make mistakes because that is how we learn and no one is perfect. I have learned how important education is and how blessed I am to be able to receive education. Reminding myself of how luck I am to have been given the opportunities that I have helps me persevere and remember what I’m working towards. I want to make my family and community proud and I hope to give back to both of them with my education. "
