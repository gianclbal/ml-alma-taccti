2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1461,"I hope that with this class I will be able to understand how physics is applied to our everyday lives and how important it is. My goal is become an optometrist so physics is heavily involved in how light is refracted in the eye to form a electrical signals that are assessed by the brain. By understanding the properties of light and how it acts, I can have a larger understanding of how to be a better eye doctor. Usually, most people have vision problems because light is not reflected properly within our eyes. If we can understand how light refractivity works through physics, we can better understand how to assess visions problems. This is done by hard contacts that change the shape of our corneas to better refract the light where it can be assessed and improve our vision in the long run. This actually applied in glasses as well since the lens help adjust the angle of light to improve our vision. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1450,"My small goal right now is to pass calculus... This class along with the main lecture unit is actually going hand in hand with some concepts in calculus, such as average velocity and instantaneous velocity. The labs that we've done so far have helped with providing a visual representation of some familiar math problems from calc and with experience on how to tackle these problems. Another goal of mine is to figure out what I want to do in life. I'm currently a 2nd year majoring in Biology and I think I want to go into Biotechnology? Or the medical field? No idea! I don't have enough experience to go off on to know what I like and don't like. I guess this class crossed off physics because of how much math is involved! I actually considered being a physics major when I was in high school because I found the concepts in physics easily understandable but it's kind of difficult now that I'm in college physics. I don't really like it anymore. As for a long term goal, I would like to have a job after college that I'm happy doing. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1471,"My goals in terms of my academic career tend to be very fluid, meaning that there are straightforward achievements that I want to personally reach in regards to the courses that I am taking, but on the other hand there are goals that I want to experience that have no correlation to academics itself. I want to learn and deal with the struggles of learning complex material, because I believe that if i fail something, regardless of the setting that I am in, I see that I can benefit from the failure, and grow into a more stronger and smarter student and person as a whole. This course in its form, is teaching me to think critically, and understand complex problems with the help of my colleagues. It is teaching me to trust in myself in everything I do related to my academics, and everything I do outside of that. It is allowing me to grasp a new perspective on the course, and the development of my character. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1455,"In general, my goal in career would be to become a chiropractor. For my major, I need to take this class in order to graduate college. It's helping me get one step closer to my future career. In terms of long-term goals not related to school, I hope to try to workout everyday and stay active throughout this pandemic since all of the gyms are closed. This class doesn't really help me in that goal, but it does help me analyze on some things regarding certain workout activities. In terms of goals nearby, I would like to graduate college with a clearer understanding of Physics and the ways that it can help me out in my field of work. It's going to take a lot of practice and experience, but I'm sure I'll be able to get through it. I think this Physics class would help me think about things outside of the box, so I'm hoping to take that and apply to my profession."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1448,"My Reflective Journal #1 addressed my goals and why I need this class perfectly.David Olinger 09/17/2020Physics 112Why I am in PhysicsThe reason for me taking a physics class is simple and pretty straightforward. It is a basic stepping stone in order for me to graduate with my Major of Biology (Concentration on Cell and Molecular) from SFSU. I need to take 2 semesters of physics and pass in order to move forward in my journey. After I graduate from SFSU I will then apply for medical school to become a pharmacist at UCSF, which is the overall and main goal I have for myself! I am fascinated by the job and I want a career I can look back on and feel proud of my achievements."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1468,"My goal is to become an OB one day and a way this class is helping me achieve this goal is because I’m going to need this school in order to get into medical school, because it is a requirement to major in biology. Plus, I might need this type of information to be able to do my job once I become an OB. The things I'm learning in this class are going to help me with my career. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1460,"My current goals are to just finish college, get a degree, find a job that I like, and be happy. This class is helping me achieve these goals because it is one of the prerequisite classes that I need to take in order for me to graduate and finish college. It also helps me with my physic class in general. I tend to not understand lectures, but when I do the labs, I understand the lesson better. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1474,"What are my goals? Well, this is kind of personal and a tiny bit off topic, but it connects...In the last year I have been sent to treatment away from my family and I wanted to die. I had overdosed, which was what got me to treatment. Since then, I have grown so so much and I am sober and I have put my life back together.My family trusts me, I got into sf state as a transfer with an application that got appealed, I have an amazing job that I enjoy where I make good money, and had been living with my boyfriend from the program. The part that changed though, was me and him broke up and I am currently couch surfing at a co-workers place, but the point is that I had to plan what I wanted for my life and what I would do on my own, rather than keep thinking about how I would support his future of medical school. I realized in literally the last two days what my dream is, and that is to work at a wildlife sanctuary or rescue organization in Africa or Australia. That has always been my dream and passion but I lost that in my dark period, and hadn’t been able to get that back in over three years. As I said in the first journal, zoology is my major, and I honestly applied with that when I didn’t feel a connection to anything, because I knew it was the one thing I had always connected to the most in the past. I feel like that spark has been ignited in me, and I know this probably isn’t what you expected. And, I won’t be sharing in class, but this is my genuine flow of consciousness reply to your question. It’s not my fault you ask the deep questions haha. Anyways, to the last part, this class for one helps me get the GE I need for my major, but more than that, I am genuinely interested about certain things. For example, I was talking to a friend about how I have “a hunch” that time travel has happened, and they replied “and what evidence do you have?” So, I looked up evidence of time travel and actually ended up finding real theories such that if you circled a ship around a black hole and went back to earth technically you would have time traveled because the time would be different when you went back. Anyways, it doesn’t necessarily fit my “goal,” but I have lots of curiosities and interests that learning about how things work satisfies. Also, physics touches on another kind of intuition that I am not used to, so it is pushing my ideas and thinking processes."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1446,Ones of my goal is to be able to graduate from my bachelor degree. The second goal that I have is to become a better general practitioner where i can treat patients and really identify their illness. Also another goal that I have is to help my family by giving them a better life and a better support in when they never had it . The last goal is i have is to hve more time management to manage with my assignments This class is helping achieve this goals by knowing how the energy and the matter is being used in the types of machines that I will use in the field of job that I will have.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1467,"My goals are to succeed in college and then do my best to obtain my dream job as either a Vet-tech or a veterinarian. This class is helping me achieve these goals because in order to succeed in college I need to pass this class in order to get credits for my major and then finally graduate. And after I graduate I need to either get more experience with working with more animals or working in a vet hospital to see the Veterinarian's work hands-on with them. And then hopefully from that experience and grades from SF state, I would like to go on to vet school and become a veterinarian. I would love to be a veterinarian because I have always loved animals ever since I was younger. I didn't have a pet for the longest time but my friends had pets and I always loved being with them and walking their dogs. I actually worked as a dog walker for my friend's dogs for a year or two. So to be able to work with them as my job would make me very happy and content. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1476,"In the short term, my goals this week would be to get my shit together and submit ALL my homework that's due. I got into a slump last week and I've not been getting anything done. Outside of homework and school, I also need to do some housekeeping, complete my FAFSA application, and start running again. Basically, my goals this week and for the rest of the semester is to get disciplined again so that I can get shit done. I've been slacking and lacking and I'm setting myself up to fail again so I'm to put a stop to that today. This class is helping me achieve these goals by helping me start back up. I've missed most of my classes this week so attending lab today is helping me get back in track. Hopefully from here, I can just keep myself in check and stop wasting so much time."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1472,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""I will say like many others I have many goals some unclear and some concrete. One of my goals is to get more comfortable with others. I am usually a very shy individual. although I'm not too fond of this online virtual format I will say I've talked to many more classmates than I would usually. I think this because we are having similar issues and can relate to this new environment. communicating with others especially in my classes helps a lot when I don't understand something, but also it makes me feel a sense of community like we are all in this together. When we used to be in person I would have just not talked to anyone (maybe like 1 person). Another goal is to stay on task while doing homework a lot of the time I have to help my siblings with homework and/or zooms, and so I have a hard time going back to doing my work. this class helps with me managing my time, by extending the due date to Monday and having a lot of time during class to finish the lab exercises."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1462,My goals for this semester is to learn how to learn these topics assigned by my professor in the comfort of my own home. I also hope to communicate more with my classmates so that I am able to work together when needed with the help of others in order to further understanding of the topics. I believe that this class will help me achieve these goals by assigning challenging yet lenient to go over these problems with the help from my peers and professor. I will also ask for help from the professor in order to understand and complete my assignments. With the assignments that are mostly simulations will help me understand the concepts since there is something visual to grasp the topics from and the simulations will help me playing around how the different variables affects the other variables at play. I hope to make sure to keep up with my assignments as well for this semester and hope the professor will be lenient with assignments as well. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1477,"My goal is to pass my science classes with a decent grade because I know that taking biology or physics can be a hard subject to understand. Biology can be very intense since it contains a lot of information towards the human system, animal, and plant. However, in physics it’s more about solving problems using acceleration velocity, measurements, and several more. Therefore, I want to be able to comprehend using the scientific methods for each topic in order to compute my answers correctly. We (as students) tend to have trouble expanding our own ideas to what we are trying to prove, and recognizing our own work. In this class, it’s helping me achieve these goals by going over each question at a time whether it’s about graphing points and listening to what other students have to say. Sometimes students are ahead of others where they can explain it to you differently by giving out hints. Also the teacher has given us time to ask questions whether we do or don’t understand this specific problem. For instance, many students have trouble plotting their numbers in a formula and using the correct unit. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1473,"My goal in life is to become a pharmacist and have enough money to help support my family, friends, and girlfriend. I feel like by declaring my major into Biochemistry and actually picking a profession I am interested in, it can give me a more drive and motivation to push forward and mature. My purpose in life was to always share positivity and never give up in situations where I can excel in. Being in a Filipino household, there is always that expectation of one of the kids to have a successful career, I feel like by doing that, it can help my brother pick any job he wants and have time with it. My goal is to actually move out by the age of 25, be financially stable, and have children at the early age of 30s. In terms of how this class is helping me achieve these goals, I would say that this is just one step into a big journey that is long awaiting. Also, I never took a physics class in high school or college, so this would be very exciting to help with my kids in the future and also myself."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,103,"My goal is to finish my bachelor degree in biochemistry in 4 to 5 years. Your class can help my goal, because I need this course first before I take other difficult physics courses and it is a prerequisite requirement which I need to graduate. Also I want to take this class to improve my critical thinking, learn how to solve unfamiliar problems, utilizing scientific methods, stabilize my basic knowledge of physics  and work in diverse groups to explore different thinking and ideas when dealing with hard problems, because I feel like this will help me get a better understanding of physics. Physics is a challenging subject, but I feel that as I practice I get better at solving and figuring out the problems; therefore, I do believe physics is a necessary subject and I've developed a liking for it. In addition, I believe that my understanding of physics will be helpful in the real world and future careers, because as I learn more about physics I can apply it to situations when needed."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1453,"My goal is to graduate from San Francisco State University with a BS in Biology. I do not know what I will do after that as I am taking these things one at a time. I like to study biology so that's why I chose to major in it. As for this specific class I am here for the physics requirement for my major. Personally I like the any science as there is a lot to teach people. I also like finding answers to problems I face daily, and I like to find answers to things."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1478,"My goals in life are to earn my bachelor’s degree in Biology and become a Physician’s Assistant after finishing the program. I want to do this and have wanted to be in the medical field since I was young because I feel that I have been called to help people and I would love to save people’s lives and be able to live a financially good life while doing so. Originally as a kid, I wanted to become an anesthesiologist, until I figured out that it costs an absolutely obscene amount of money to do so, having to attend medical school full time and to complete a four year residency, all before you even start your job. This class is helping me achieve this because it is a prerequisite for my major and is further developing my academic skill for subjects in the field of science, engineering, and math. I really like that I am able to take this course because physics was always a subject that I was interested in, but never had the opportunity to take."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1458,"My goals overall as a person is to be content with what i have and with what i do. One goal i have set for myself is to graduate from SFSU and then get into medical school. I always had the goal to become a pediatric doctor or surgeon ever since I believe was the start of my high school career. I've always liked working with kids and helping them and being a mentor for them. I would love to make their lives better by healing them up and giving them a better life. See medical school can be tough to get into and honestly the only factor in my goal that is really my goal is, making kids happy. So if its not a doctor or a surgeon, i want to make some kind of positive impact on their lives. This class is helping me out by fufilling my pre-req for my major."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1457,"Trying to define my goals is very difficult and vague to determine. I have many goals in life, some more specific than others. If I were to give an overall life goal it would be to travel the world. I believe every person has a right to explore and experience the very ground, soil, and, dirt we walk on all around the world. This class in a way is helping be achieve that goal by getting me one step closer to a good paying job. With a good paying job, I will have the sufficient funds I need to fulfill my traveling goals. I was supposed to go to Japan at during the winter of this year but due to the pandemic we are forced to reschedule. My goals in life are not defined by how much money I have to spend or use and I hope everyone has a chance to travel the world as well."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1454,"My goals are to be successful in life. To me success is defined by having a stable job in order to support me and my future family. This class is helping me strive for success by giving me opportunity to learn important aspects in life. Besides gaining knowledge that could benefit me in my future career, I learn about responsibility from having to email the professor about my schedule and concerns and by having to work independently through online learning, and learning how to interact and work with new people. I hope one day I am able to work within the science field possibly research and by taking this class, this class is helping me familiarize myself with science material whether or not I will use such information in my career or not. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1475,"My goals in this class are to learn to adapt to the learning style of this class dynamic. I want to be more on top of completing these labs, I just realized how to write on a pdf without using xodo free trial. My goal is to do work more efficiency and actually understand the material. In usual lab classes I feel the pressure of always rushing to finish the work, but I want to actual understand it. I need to work on time management because there is a lot more work online than there was in person. This lab class helps me with my own visual learning style by using the simulation and drawing out the graph or problems. This class is pretty long so another goal of mine is to stay alert the whole time. I do have a class right before it so as long as I'm prepared before I sit down and get on the computer I am good. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1459,"My goals for this class is to have fun, learn, and get a good grade. My ultimate goal is to get a bachelors in biology and this class is helping me because it's a requirement and it's another step towards that. Aside from my degree, I do genuinely enjoy physics and this class teaching me more about that. I also really like doing hands on stuff which is perfect for doing physics labs, although I'm not able to do that now, I do still enjoy the labs. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1449,"my goals are to learn more about physics and how it is applied to our daily life, and to also to take this class for a graduation requirement. This class is helping me achieve my goals, because like previously state, i want to learn how physics is applied to our daily lives, and I feel that this class provides me with a different perspective on how things our done on a daily basis with physics kept in mind, such as just walking, or driving a car or moving and picking up an object, physics is applied there, and this class helps me keep that in mind, also taking this class will help me fulfill my goal of completing this class for a graduation requirement"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1463,"One of my goals in this class is to try to get out of my comfort zone when it comes to break out rooms, so I won't be scared to share in my future classes. Another goal for this class is to pass with a good grade and to understand physics more. My main goal is to try to understand physics and the concepts better and this class is helping me because of the break out rooms. When everyone is participating, I am able to understand most of the concepts better. This class is helping me because when I am in my normal lectures for physics, I don't really understand what is going on and coming into this class I am able to ask question to my fellow peers who do understand the concepts better. In order for me to get a good grade in this class, I am willing to do all the labs and do good in the work. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1470,"So I have many different goals that I haven't really fully set straight if that makes sense.  I want different things, I am just unsure what which path I want to take.  I do like the idea of getting into research with microbiology and staying with that, getting a PhD in microbiology and running a research lab.  I can also pursue a medical degree of some kind like a physician assistant or full on medical school.  I haven't decided because I want to finish my bachelors degree before I make a final decision.  All in all yes this class is helping me achieve my goals because which ever path I take this class is needed to get to my goal."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1456,"My long term goal is to become a physical therapist and another goal is to be content with whatever my future self ends up doing. Becoming a physical therapist is not easy and it shows by creating so many requirements for the students to do. I like to be realistic and honest with myself with this because I don't to be blindsided by reality. Another goal is to stay consistent with working out. When I say working out, I don't mean power lifting or anything you see in the movies. What I mean is jogging, a couple push ups here and there. I would like to stay relatively active in my life so that it doesn't come back and bite me in life. This class helps me reach my physical therapist goal because it is a requirement. This also allows me to learnt the physics within the body. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1479,"My goal in life is to become much closer to God and to improve my iman and get closer to my deen. Iman means faith in Arabic and I noticed that when my iman was getting weaker, my life was becoming miserable and harder. I used to be a very religious person and would care a lot about my religion and iman. I made sure everything I did was dedicated to God. And back when I was a junior in High School, about 2 years ago, I made a lecture in front of my class about Islam. A lot of people challenged my beliefs and thankfully I was able to come back and provide proof that my beliefs were indeed true. But then there was a lot that I did struggle with answering and making a rebuttal since it had to do with Physics and Biology. So I was very much interested in them because we Muslims believe that God was never made and nothing has ever created him. So God was just always there and decided to make life. A lot of people who studied physics always told me that it wasn't possible and the only thing that was in space was atoms since the beginning of time and were always there. Then there was a chemical reaction and that created the universe and then the big bang. I tried to help them understand my standpoint and that something had to make atoms for them to be there and they used what I said against me and said that God had to be made in order for him to always be there. So that always had me thinking and stirred up my thoughts and really made me dive into the science behind Islam and I was knowledgeable enough to participate in debates against people who claim that Islam isn't true with the assist of my religious group. And this class is helping to get one step closer so that I can enter higher physics and so I can possibly get into Astro and Quantum Physics."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1464,"A bit from what I said before, enrolling in this class is getting me closer to my ultimate career goal as well as preparing me for certain steps I need to take. For example, taking the DAT which has a physics portion so it is crucial I am present in class physically and mentally. As well as stepping out of my comfort zone I usually steer away from courses that have math involved because I consider it my weak subject so I hope being here will help me change my mindset and make improvement in physics and math. I find being in this class has made me feel more comftorable with the subject so far and getto view math from a different aspect. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,559,"My goals are to learn how to understand with remote learning. It's been a little difficult in some classes because in order to really understand something you have to go to class and put in at an 2hours of homework and studying. Sometimes I have no time with all of the assignments that are given, I feel like I didnt have to much homework when we had in-person classes. This class has helped me engage with people when we go in break out rooms. That has helped me rech my goals with understanding inremote learning. Although, some days no one talks or participates in the break out rooms and thats what makes it difficult. My second goal is to pass all of my classes with A's. I can achieve this goal by attending classes, going to office hours, asking questions when I have a confusion and turn in homework on time."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1466,"My goals in life are to have a stable job and work in healthcare. I really enjoy helping people and I believe my greatest strength is patience. My goal in this class is to understand physics more. My mom hated physics with a passion in college, so I am curious to see exactly why she might have hated it. I like it so far, but maybe that will change in the future. I found in this class so far that there are many forces at work in our lives, and it is fascinating to see the little details that involve such mundane things we might see. Sometimes labs can be long, but I still find them challenging in a good way, and the problems really help pick at my brain a little. This class also helps me achieve a requirement in order to take other classes according to my major, and makes me see the world in a slightly different way. Normal force, gravity, and other forces work on many objects and it is interesting to try and see vectors everywhere. I actually just watched an episode of an anime where a demon's powers actually involve vectors! He is able to control people's bodies and the directions that they move in by stabbing them with forceful arrows. I actually found it really interesting; if you would like to see it, it is episode 9 of Demon Slayer, and I think you could also find it on Youtube if you search up Demon Slayer Tanjiro vs. Yahaba (Arrow Demon). Just a warning that there is probably animated blood, though!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1447,"What are my goals?My goals for this class are to learn the material thatI am presented in front of me. I think that every lab or lesson helps me understand what I want to do with my major. Every question and answer has a meaning.How is this class helping me achieve these goals?By doing the labs and participating with my classmates in doing the work helps me achieve those goals. Not only by doing it but also repeating the process over and over again so that I implement it in my work later on for future use. I think that with every future lab and lesson that we get, it’ll ultimately get myself and everyone else in the class ready for our profession in the future."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1452,"One of my goals is to have a wider understanding of physics. This class is helping me achieve these goals because I am learning a lot in this class than I ever learned physics in Highschool. Learning physics in highschool was really confusing and hard. I feel like in college, professors really care about our education and understanding the materials in their class. Another goal is to have good social skills, organization, and time management. This class is helping me communicate better with my peers in breakout rooms. I feel like building social skills is important because it is to communicate with people in my future career. I want to become a Pharmacist, with good social skills to communicate with patients. Organization and time management are important as well, especially when school is online, so I want to improve. I am hoping to learn more in the future in this class. "
