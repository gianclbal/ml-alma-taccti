2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1457,"I have many resources to support my studies and I. Mainly through iLearn I have access to office hours through all my teachers and the resources they provide me with vary on the class. By myself I usually use the internet as my resource to get through school, you can find textbooks and a multitude of different resources to help get the support you need. I also have my peers as a resource to lean on when in a difficult situation for classes. We usually help each other out to get through the material if one of us is confused or missed something during the lecture. One always has resources they need to help get them through their courses, they just have to reach out and get it. I also forgot to mention that the professor themselves are a resource in their own way. They help clarify any issue with material learned and provide guidance in the right direction."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1468,"I dont really understand the question, I don't if you meant to put, ""what resources do i need to support you?"" Anyways from what im trying to understand from your question is what are resources that you already have to support use, which is you give us feedback on our assignments which will help us improve and another thing you have is that you have office hours. That helps a lot because in case we ever need help in our labs. Another resource that you already have is, you answering back our emails and answering any questions we have. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1471,"The resources that I have today consist of many materialistic and emotional things. I have quite a few of, but the main things that I rely on are my textbooks, youtube, and notes that I have taken down in order to better understand any material being taught to me in my many lectures that I have to attend each week. In regards to emotional, I have my family and some friends to care for me when things go south. I am not one to show emotions unless it is something that is directly effecting me, but I do show empathy and pain just like anyone else. I just tend to disregard feeling emotions that make you mad, because I always try to be positive no matter the outcome of a situation. When I need something to help me, it is usually my dog buck, who is the happiest dog in the world if you just give him a head rub, and play with him. I believe having something by your side for some emotional support is great, and it sure is a good thing to have. Academics can be rough, and sometimes it is always acceptable to take a break every now and then for the health of yourself. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1455,"In terms of resources, I have my family and friends that support me in whatever I choose. My family’s a great resource if I have any questions about life such as school and work. My friends are a resource to me when it’s something more personal. When it comes to academics, I like to use the resources on campus as a tool to guide me through college. If I’m at work, my manager is a resource when I’m confused about something or have an issue with a client. I like having people around me to support me because it makes me feel less alone and more understood what I should do next. It feels amazing to vent to my best friends and for them to give me some advice about the issues that I’m going through. I have yet to utilize all of the resources in school, so I do plan on looking at other resources to help me in my future goals in school."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1446,The resources that I have to support me while being online school  is that I have two classes that helped me with me with my normal lectures class . Also another resource that I have is I attend to touring for help for my classes so I can get understand and be able to complete my homework assignment Also I can be able to be more prepare for my midterms and final exams. Another resource that I have is that I watched videos on YouTube and Khan Academy  when I don't understand and I am really stuck on the question I look videos that seem similar to the question that I am really confused on. The other thing that use a resource is that I tried to look at my notes that even though sometimes they are useful because based on the writing of the teacher it not clearly written. I use all this resources so It could help me succed in school and pass all my classes with good grades.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1472,"One resource I have is academic relationships I have, when I am confused or just need to vent about school, I have people with who I can do that with which is very helpful and nice. another source that is helpful is my lab, my PI is very supportive and there for all of us, the labmates are very supportive as well, they want to see the undergrads and everyone in our lab thrive. Another resource that helps me is my sci class for chemistry, they really go into depth and I find their explanations very clear, and better understood  (personally) than my actual chemistry lecture. Because there are grad students in the lab I work in, they help us  (undergrads) find out the many resources and opportunities they took and their journey giving us more insight and ideas of what different routes we can pursue. A resource I wish I had and would've been very helpful is a sitter for my little brother because he has classes too like me it's hard for me to be present with him in his classes and mine. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1458,The resources i have to support me are my family and my friends. When im stuck or confused or lost i know i can count in my family or friends to help clear things up for me. Another reasource i like to use is the internet because i can just look something when im really stuck and look at a video on youtube so that I can see how to do the problem with explanation. One last reasource i like to use is studying the notes that i took from class so that i can review for a test or quiz the best that I can. I also like just taking a break sometimes and relaxing so that i can give my brain a break.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1474,"What resources do I have to support me?Hmm, well first off I have a best friend and a therapist and some people I talk to. Normally, though, I don't go to other people until I know what's going on, so I am probably my biggest support, which is good and bad. It is good to rely on myself, but not as good when I get really overwhelmed. But, I am good at advocating and reaching help when I know I am struggling with something on my own. Overall, not day to day, my mom has always supported and helped me and that one is obvious. I terms of school, I think SF State has really good and approachable teachers. You're probably the most I relate to out of any teachers so far, so I always feel like if I am stuck I have you as a source. That goes for other classes too, like I feel support just having weekly Office Hours just in case things are slipping. But, yeah that is pretty much what I think of in response to the prompt. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1478,"To support me, I have many resources that I can utilize when I need help or things otherwise just get tough.  For homework help, I can look to resources like youtube to help show me how to complete a problem I may not understand. I like youtube as an educational service because of the vastness of search results and the entertainment aspect of it that one can expect, but most of all since it is a video recording, it is easy to go back to learn information that I may have missed. In addition to this, I know that all of my professors off office hours that I may attend if I am struggling with a concept that they are teaching. Office hours are most beneficial to me in the aspect of one-on-one time (or at least a smaller, more focused group) with the professor so that I may ask all the questions that I avoided asking during class so as to not appear stupid to my classmates. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1460,"For educational purposes, the support I have or can get is by emailing professors for help, anyone on campus, or asking classmates for help (depending on situations). At times, I would figure out things myself by looking them up online to see if there are credible sources out there to help me.For emotional support purposes, I tend to keep it to myself but if I can't handle it on my own, I would talk to someone about so some of the weight can be lifted off my shoulder. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1450,"Some resources that I have are my family, the internet, and my friends. My family has always been there to help me with everything throughout my life such as driving me to school, making me food, buying school supplies (like my laptop which I appreciate every day). The internet is also very helpful. Whenever I have a question about anything, the internet almost always has an answer. Lastly, my friends are very supportive too. The most useful site for me right now is derivative-calculator.net because it solves every problem that's in my homework now The other day, I was seriously struggling over calculus problems involving derivatives with natural log (ln) and two of my friends stayed up until 4am guiding me through problems and even providing practice problems/examples to help me understand."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1453,"""What resources do I have to support me?""Currently I have a couple of resources that are able to help me when I need it. I rely heavily on my parents for living costs because I go to school full time, and hopefully will be able to be somewhat independent from them a couple years after I graduate. I also rely on my friends for social needs. Honestly as a college student it is important to have people being able to support you or even animals because college can induce a lot of stress into peoples lives  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1463,"The resources that I have to support me are counseling, tutoring, and office hours. I have not yet met with my counselor, ever since we had to go on virtual classes. I haven't gotten a chance to make an appointment with my counselor. When I get the chance, I am going to make an appointment with my counselor so I could talk to them about the online classes. I am not a big fan of online classes because I tend to get behind on the work. I could attend tutoring whenever I need help but I don't really need help with anything right now but instead I need help with not procrastinating so much. Office hours are also useful resources for me and it also gives me an opportunity to support me when I have questions about the lab or anything. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1448,"The resources that I have to support me is my parents, friends, me, myself, and I."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1467,"Resources I have to support me are my family and friends mostly. Without them, I would not have been able to succeed as much as I have in my academic life. They are always there for me through the bad and good times. I would be devastated if I didn't have any friends to support me, especially in college right now. When I was a freshman last fall I was worried I wouldn't make any friends at college since not many people from my high school were going to SFSU and the ones who were I wasn't close with. But after the second week of school, I was able to become friends with a small group of people who I am still friends with now. And we support each other through our screens as much as we can even now with social distance. Some other support I have is my boyfriend, he is always willing to hear me vent about the things I am stressed about and even helps me with my homework even though he is taking different classes at a different college. Which means a lot to me. Another resource I have is my cat. I have had her since I was 10 and I love her so much. Whenever I am feeling stressed especially right now I just take a break and pet/play with her. It does make me feel better. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1449,"there are many different resources that support me in different situations, such as school, financially, emotionally, etc. for school, some resources that support me would be my professors, them holding office hours is one very important resources when I have questions for them, as well as the school's resources for academic tutoring and other things. Resources that support me financially would be my family, especially my mom and dad, they have always been there for me financially and always work so hard to provide not only myself, but also my siblings with thing s we need to get paid for, especially things for school and such. And some resources that help me emotionally would be my family and friends and even my boyfriend, all those people are there for me when I need it most and they are all very understanding and caring, an without them, emotionally, I would be lost and probably sad all the time. There are many other resources that support me in life but those are some few that come to mind. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1475,Resources I have to support me is support from my family and close friends. I can always go to people if I am feeling overwhelmed or stressed. A few of my professors are very supportive when it comes to having to babysit my nephews during class times I communicate that with them. I feel like I can always ask questions. In the night that is my best time to do school work  due to everyone being asleep and having alone time. I do have a neighbor who has taken science classes so I can always ask him for homework help. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,559,As of right now the resources I have to support me are office hours and my sci classes. Although it’s still difficult for me to understand when I ask questions over zoom because it’s not the same as being in person. My sci class has helped me with the worksheets and mock exams that they give. They also have helped me find scholarships and programs for major which is really cool. Other than that everything has been very difficult. I used to be in the library or tutoring to make sure I really understand the material. The change of scenery also helped I wasn’t just in one place the whole time. Now being stuck in one place has been difficult because I start to get comfortable or my family always need my help. It’s been rough to be honest. They support that I’m in school but what they don’t understand is I need time after school time to study outside lecture hours. And then I feel bad and I go and help them with the baby but then I get behind. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1454,"I have many resources that I could use to support my needs. Whether it is emotional, mental or physical needs, I know that my friends and family is always there to help me if I ever needed their assistance. When its comesto resources to help with my success in education, I know I have the teacher's help when ever needed and their office hours that they provide. Online also has many resources that I could use to help with my learning, from youtube to khan academy to and tutor-like sites.  The main resource I tend to utilize would be my friends and family because doing work is very exhausting so having them around would always help rejuvenate my mental. From having interactions or maybe help for some work, they help me progress in my work and in life.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1462,"Currently the resources I have that are supporting me financially are my parents, they support me in every way possible for me to have everything ready either for school or a place to stay, have food on the table etc... I also have resources from my teachers for them to guide me through school if any circumstances occur, they are very understanding with everything if you let them know. I also have emotional support from people around me like my friends which is really helpful in times of need, and which I am very grateful for. Overall, I am grateful for all the resources I am receiving at this moment because I know someone like me is very priveledged to gain these things, and I also hope to be the same to others as well. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1470,I have lots of friends to fall back on when I do need them for anything that does happen.  I know I can count on those guys for when I need them.  I also go to the internet a lot for problem solving on things that I can't figure out.  I do try to do a lot on my own.  I do prefer it that way because I actually end up being the one to support other which I actually very much enjoy and find it fulfilling.  For me that's the best support.  I find that when I help others that I also help myself and that I feel better the more I help others.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1456,"Some resources that are around me are my sisters that live in Pacifica and Oakland. They help a lot with groceries and just staying over if I need a quiet place to study or take my exams. Sometimes my apartment can become too loud and I can't focus as much. There was another resource at school that I used before COVID came in. It was the gator groceries. This really helped me be able to conveniently get food because I was too busy balancing my classes, internship, and job. But since that isn't really an option anymore I have been able to go to local food banks to get groceries. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1447,"I like to try new things that allows me to experience than I already have. It's as if I feel completed, i believe that I am wrong because there is so much more to explore out there. At the same time I like to hone good habits that makes my life easier throughout my life time. Good habits are important for me by creating my best self it keeps me moving forward.My mental well-being also needs to be nurtured. Everyday there will be something that will disturb us enough that it will fluctuate the direction in which we are going mentally and emotionally. Allowing yourself to take some time out of the day collect yourself, breathe, and by doing so it replenishes your mind and spirit which sustains your mental health.Pursue your dreams no matter what. In the end you will soon realize that the end is never the end and that there is more than what we can see in front of us. Accomplish your dreams and do more with that dream in the now."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1476,"I've always been fortunate enough to have many sources of support. While they are not ""resources"" per say, my friends and family have always been a source of strength and comfort in times of distress. Outside of that immediate circle, I've also had my colleges be a source in the form of tutoring centers, food banks, academic advisors, and most recently, the Mental Health Services at SFSU. Some help with homework, a quick and available snack to eat when money's tight, and someone to talk to who could understand what I was struggling with when no one could have been nothing short of great help to me and my well-being."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1461,"The resources that have available to are my professors and the internet. I found that, often than not, I heavily rely of online resources and classmates in order to understand my course material much more than my professors. For some reason, it is much harder for me to reach out to my professors over my classmates. I would rather utilize these resources since they make me feel much or comfortable. There are many times where reading online resources has significantly helped me understand my course material much more than, if my professors explained. The same goes for my classmates. If I need a deeper understanding of a subject, for some reason, their explanations helps me exceedingly. Maybe it is because we are both coming from the similar backgrounds. I do try to reach out to my professors when I can but, it is sometimes much more accessible to use to internet or text a fellow classmate. Professors also sometimes take around 24-48 hours to respond. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1466,"I believe I have many resources at hand, such as resources that could help me in my classes that are offered to me. There are teaching assistants and office hours that are provided if I chose to use those resources, which I am very grateful for. Online resources, such as Youtube videos, really help me as well, since I do find myself struggling in certain concepts.In addition, my family is always there to support me, and I am very grateful for that. My parents have always supported my decisions, as long as I am working towards something. They supported my decision to go to community college, and still supported me when I hadn't quite decided on my career path. My friends always help me as well, since I can always rant to them and they're always there to listen to me if I am going through a tough time. My boyfriend is also a great resource for when I need to rant or when I want comfort as well."
