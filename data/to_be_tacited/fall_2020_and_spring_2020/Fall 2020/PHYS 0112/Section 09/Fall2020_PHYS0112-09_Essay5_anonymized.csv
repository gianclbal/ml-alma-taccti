2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1447,For one I used to live in San Francisco area and to have to comeback and re-familiarize myself again was a little hard but I have a family member of mine who goes to San Francisco State that helped me naviagte enough to understand where I am going. Having support is always a must for me because it helps guide me on my journey to where I want to be. I haven't really been involved with too many people outside of family due to our circumstances but I've met a select few of people to help me with any questions for classes.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1466,"My parents have been super supportive of my decision to go into community college out of high school from the get-go. Some of my outside family and family friends haven't been very supportive and have criticized me in the past behind my back to my parents, and I am very grateful to my parents for standing up for me. They would always say things like, ""Oh, Vy is going into community college; how bad did she do in high school""or ""Why does she want to become a nurse rather than a doctor; my son's becoming a doctor and it's a much better career..."" (My goal back then was to become a nurse, when I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do in life). My parents were always encouraging me and giving me suggestions to see what I wanted to try and do. They understood how hard it was to decide on a career for the rest of my life, and I appreciated all the help they provided. My high school was super competitive in terms of academics, so I would always say back then that I was going to community college because I didn't get into ""midtier"" colleges and I wanted to push myself in community college to transfer to a really good college. But in reality, I had no idea what I wanted to do in life, and I needed more time to figure it out. I think as time went on, I learned to accept that everyone has their own timeline of how they accomplish goals, and it doesn't really matter when I do things either. *Sorry haha I feel like I always rant about my time in community college, but I did learn a lot throughout my time there :)"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,612,"Some of the ways that my family has helped me navigate through college has been by always having my back. I am very grateful to have my family's moral and financial support that enables me to attend a 4-year university. My parents did not have the opportunity to attend a 4-year university, so they were really excited when I had begun applying to universities. However, they initially wanted me to stay in the city by applying to San Diego State, but I knew that I needed to leave town so that I would be able to have the opportunity of growing as a person outside of town and outside of my comfort zones. Since attending San Francisco state, I've been able to meet so many unforgettable people and go to exciting new places that would have never occurred had I stayed in San Diego. I really truly loved San Francisco State and I would not trade my experience there for anywhere else, but unfortunately this pandemic has robbed me a full academic year of learning and experiences. I am praying and crossing all of my fingers with hopes that Fall '21 will be different and I'll be back on campus soon!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1457,"Values of my family has helped me navigate through college by giving me endless encouragement and the fact that I want to support them in the future. My whole life my family has encouraged me to do my best in school and it wasn't until I reached college where I started to actually listen. College is the starting point of your adult life. With more and more responsibilities piling up as you get older, the more you realize that getting through college and making a good career out of it will help you get through those rough times in your life. My family has done so much providing for me and raising me to be the best person I can be, and the least I can do is do my best in college and help support them in the future."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1449,"I think the values of my community and family have helped me navigate through college in good and bad ways. When it comes to the influence of my community, I would say that it has challenged me to take on more risks and way more challenging classes and in general, just getting out of my comfort zone, my community has helped me see the person I am when things might not go the way I want it too but that just puts up for a challenge and helps see the great things I can do. When it comes to my family, my mom and my sisters, they have greatly influenced me to step out of this community and take a bigger step to go to a 4 year university and to try my hardest to achieve my goals of what I want in life. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1473,"My family has helped me navigate through college. I guess more so it was my cousin (who went to SFState) and my friends telling me to join clubs (I joined KAP last spring). Joining KAP has made me so much comfort and out of my shell because I am usually shy and since I commute to SF, I do not have that much time to hang out with people. My cousin really also has really encouraged me to be more communicative and has shown me around school multiple times. I do like the luxury of driving home and being with my family because, at the end of the day, they bring me so much happiness and so much joy and laughter. Also, my girlfriend has helped me a lot and has always put me on check (vice versa) with getting schoolwork done and turning it in on time. Also, I feel like having divorced parents, can be very tiring but they are the best and keep me sane!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1461,"I think that the values of my family have helped me tremendously throughout college. I was taught to always to be respectful to anyone regardless of their occupation and status in life. This has helped me build closer connections to everyone around me since they know that I respect them for who they are rather than their title. Growing up in an asian household, I also had to adapt to many challenges as I was growing up. So, navigating college was not as difficult as I expected since I had those life experiences before. I was able to cope with the stresses that came with attending college and was able to fall back on my family as support when I needed to. This also helped me give others advice on what to do if they were having trouble too. Building connections with my peers is what made navigating through college much more easily. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1478,"In my life, I was set up as going to college being the only option for my future. I suppose that to my parents, it did not really matter what I did, but I was GOING to college. The philosophy for them was ""We did not put you in private school for 8 years for no reason buddy."" I suppose that this did result in a bit of pressure on me, but for as long as I can remember, I have always wanted to be a doctor. While I have always been a pretty good student, I have also had issues since I was young with concentration. I am pretty sure I have lived my entire life with ADHD and just have not ever been diagnosed. This has always been something I have had to fight against in my brain and I have always felt in some ways that I was a step behind the rest of the class because I have to mentally slap myself to stay on track and stop being distracted by ambient noises when the class is taking an exam. Online school of course has just added another layer of difficulty to this, but I continue to fight. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1458,"The values of my family and friends have helped me navigate through college in the way that they have all built me up to never give up on myself. They are all able to see a light in me of success that i do not see in myself and they always tell me that. My siblings are very hardworking and that has motivated me to be just as hardworking and accomplish all my task to the best of my ability. My parents are also hardworking individuals who worked hard to be at the place they are today with being immigrants, so that motivates me even more to work super hard to become who i want to be and get the career that i plan to have. When i am confused i just think about my family and friends and remember how hardworking and motivated they are so it gives me that extra push that i need when i am confused and lost."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1446,The values of my community helped me navigate through college by having financial resources for especially me as I identify as a Hispanic  college student so I  can  succeed in college and be able to  get a degree. Because I had to overcome many obstacles in order to be where I am right now. My community has struggles really hard in order to have good resource to provide me  as a student so I can access to many things . My family have helped me navigate through college by supporting me when I really need their help on. Also my family has guided me through a good path that will take me where I want to be at and be able to help my family at.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1472,"my family and my younger siblings are what motivate me, I want to show them how you can reach for anything that you dream to reach. Growing up I didn't know anyone in STEM education, so I hope to be that representation for my siblings. Something my family told me and my older sibling is that we are going to save them, which now that I'm thinking about it, is a lot of pressure put on us. other than that my family and friends are very supportive and encouraging of me and my goals, so that's nice I am also in a lab and they are also very supportive and want to help me and the undergrads succeed. Most of the people in my lab are graduate students and so they were in my shoes, so their input and advice are very helpful, and it is also nice to know that there are people who care about your success."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1479,"Values in my family are held really high and school is one of them. This semester has took a toll on me because of COVID and how it affected everyone. But as I remembered why I was doing it and thought to myself why I don't want to make the same mistakes as my relatives, I persevere through everything. And something my cousin, who is the same age as me, and I did was promise that we were going to be the examples and the role models for the remaining family members and our young relatives to look up to. As of right now, we did a lot of great things like him meeting Joe Biden and having a meeting with him and how we both go on religious trips with our mosque and do 10-20 minute lectures. So the values of my community and family did help me a lot."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1471,"The values that both my community and family uphold to the highest of standards have really assisted me in finding my way through college a lot, because we all know how difficult it can be to be thrown in to a world where it is rugged and unforgiving at such a young age. Having values and standards motivated me to do better in all that I do, regardless if it is academic related or not, I uphold these values because I want to honor my community and family through success because they're both deserving of it after all of the sacrifices that were made in order for me to be in the current position that I am in at the moment. I went to San Francisco State University because I wanted to make those who have helped me through my hardest times that I appreciate and want to honor them through the process of college. Education and learning is valued heavily, and it's purpose is to teach how priorities and powerful that privilege can be. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1450,"My family pays for my tuition because they want me to have a good education and to not worry about having to work for money (during school). My parents always tell me that education is very important and should come first before most things which I guess is the reason why I try to not disappoint them because that'll make things awkward in the house. As for navigating, most of the concepts that I've been learning in college are kind of difficult so I don't ask my parents for help when it comes to that stuff. Nevertheless they have always supported me no matter what or how I'm doing in school. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1454,"Knowing my values is something that is important and difficult for myself to figure out. I always ask myself what are three things that I value the most. And with a deep thought on the question, I try to not be and general as possible. Three things that I value the most is growth(regarding change in one self, maturity or mentality), time and family. Growth has helped me navigate through college by always reminding myself why I'm at college. To get an education and to learn more and building on myself. I try to move away from my highschool/past because I personally feel like a lot of potential to grow into a better person. Time is important because everything takes time to get a result. Being patient and being aware of time has helped me organize and manage my stress a lot more efficiently. Family is also important because they will always be there for you not matter what and they will always help you when in need."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1452,"My community and my family actually helps me navigate through my college. At times I feel discouraged because everything is really stressful and hard, but with the support around me, I manage to pull through. As of right now, I have my future plans and career all set, I just need to focus on the present to achieve it. I am confident but at the same time, I am scared because I do not know what will happen in the future. I just have to believe in myself, and to believe in myself, I have to learn how to face my problems, by not pushing them away. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1468,"The values I have in my family is more about how my mom is how she expects me to continue going to college and passing with straight A's (which is hard), she thinks it's all like in high school which it isn't. The way I navigate through college is more based on what my mom wants, because she has made it very clear that she has always wanted for at least on her children to go to college (which I am) and graduate from there (which I hope I do), and in a way I'm her last opportunity to have that goal for her because my 2 brothers (who are older than me) have made it clear that they don't want to do college. I let the drive my mom has to navigate the way I go through college because I want to be the only to make her proud and finally have her be able to say that one of her children went to college. I try my very best in college for myself but also for my mom because I'm trying to become an OB and since I already told my mom that, she spreads the news to everyone and I really don't want her to look dumb to those people, so I'm trying my very best to make it happen for the both of us. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,103,"My family values education, because they believe education is a way out of poverty and to success. So as a young girl, I’ve always had expectations to follow and make my family proud since school and grades are a significant deal to them due to them not being able to finish school when they were young so they want me to do the opposite of them so I won’t have a hard life. Their values help me see that to be successful I need to pursue a higher education and don’t “turn” out like them. Even though their values do affect me, in a way I already knew that I wanted to pursue a higher degree, because I know that I can not learn more about science majors like biochemistry if I didn’t go to college. Even so I do admit that their values to me are kinda like a double edge sword. Sometimes I do feel pressure and question myself if I am doing enough or have I achieved those expectations my family and others have for me. However, overall I am happy that I personally chose to go to college, because I know that it is the best choice for me in the future."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1467,"The values of my family have heavily impacted and helped me go through college. Both of my parents and extended family have encouraged me to go to college to get a degree to help me in life. Especially with my dream of wanting to become a veterinarian which most definitely requires much more schooling than other jobs. My dad in particular inspires me to succeed and get through school because of his story. He is from El Salvador which is a tiny country in Central America. He grew up very poor. He only had access to the education around him where he lived which isn't as good as it is here. And he wanted to go to college but when he just started to, a civil war began which put his life in danger. So he decided to come to the US in order to be away from the war and to get a better education. He knew no English and had to dedicate a whole year to learn it in order to take the classes at the community college in San Francisco. But once he knew the basics he started taking the classes he wanted in order to be able to start working as soon as possible. And now he works in a high position, a construction manager. So he really inspires me to do well in school. Because if he could start from nothing and end up where he is then so can I. My mom's story is a bit different but to make a long story short she grew up here in the US. Upstate New York to be exact. She went to school and got an art history degree but she doesn't use her degree at all now. She works for a drug company called Abbvie which is mostly known for cancer treatment drugs. I don't know her title but she reviews patients' treatments and documents the clinical research being done on them. So what my mom has shown me is that life can change and you may not do what you set out to do which is ok. So that's where my inspiration to go to/stay in college comes from. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,559,"My values of my family have helped me through college by telling me it’s okay to fail. It sounds weird but failure can be a good thing. At first when I heard that in my high school avid class I was confused because I thought once you fail it’s over. But that’s not it at all. It’s about learning from those failures and getting back up to try again. I’ve had many failures in my life but my first failure in college was a big deal. My first semester I ended up on academic probation. And when I found this out I was very disappointed in myself because I let my parents down. But they told me that it’s okay next semester ask questions, don’t be afraid to get help. And to ask about tutoring services. And that’s what I did! The next semester I was off academic probation which felt like a great accomplishment."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1455,"My family has helped me navigate through college by giving me advice whenever I needed it. I’m the youngest out of 7 siblings, 4 brothers and 2 sisters. All of my siblings have gone through college and have experienced all the hardships that I have. When it comes to classes, I would ask them how they chose their classes and when would be the best time to take them. In terms of extracurricular activities, I would ask them what clubs and organizations they had joined and to hear what it’s all about. Their values of college were the same as mine. I wanted to make sure that my studies were a priority to me, but I also wanted to make some amazing memories throughout college. I don’t really see a point in putting so much effort in my academic life and not my social life. I believe that there should be a balance of both."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1456,"The values from my family has always been about learning to do the same amount of work even when people don't watch you. My grandpa always told me ""People rest, I do extra"". I was fortunate to have this kind of advice throughout my entire life and it got me where I'm at. There are times where I sometimes don't do a lot of work because I sometimes get overwhelmed but another value that my family had was to learn how to forgive yourself sometimes when you know you are working hard. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1464,I was taught how to be encouraging and engage with my struggles. I don't think I was ever challenged until my freshman year at San Francisco State. I wasn't sure what to expect from college but the values I had learned were useful when I was dealing with the stereotype threat I had experienced my freshman year of college. I was a women in stem and the male to female ratio did make it a bit intimidating at first. The value I had learned taught me to bring down those barriers and work through them. I now appreciate those values because it gave me strength to be able to pursue STEM. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1463,"The values of my community and family have helped me navigate through college because they have helped me so much and motivated me to continue my education. They motivate me by letting me know that I can do it and that it is possible. I am a first generation college student in my family and so I get most of the pressure to do good in school and I am the one who has to finish school and become someone I want to be. Being the person in my family that gets the most pressured is very stressful at times because I am always the person that my little cousins look up to. And maybe I inspire them and they value me, the way everyone else in my family does to me. My family does inspire me despite the pressuring, it's kind of a mix of both. They inspire me and tell me that anyone can do this, and if anyone could do it then I can too. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1460,"I am the first generation in my family to attend college. There were a lot of things that I had to learn myself because I did not have anyone to rely on and guide me. My parents didn't attend college, so I didn't have much guidance from them. My family values education and believes a college degree makes you successful which encourages me to finish college. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1462,"The values that my family holds for me is focus on my education first, always. This had navigated me through college to always make sure to put my studies first. As a first gen student, the reason that my parents wants me to focus on my education first is to make sure I have a different future from them, however, I also find it challenging to find resources that can help me navigate through college but very appreciative when it does come my way. There are also expectations set to the first gen students from their families to do good, which also is a concerning factor to think about so you do not feel like you are disappointing them, however, it can also be used a motivational factor that keeps pushing you forward. People that are important to me as my strengths are my friends and peers that helps me move forward. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1453,"I really love my community, I am Bosnian and have grew up in an immigrant community of Bosnians and Mexicans in San Jose. Bosnians were often used as the cheap labor force of Europe and many Bosnians do not really look to university as a way forward, most of the time they go into trade schools or try to find a trade. I also grew up around a large hispanic community, which also taught me the importance of family and friends. Both of these communities were both very religious and that also helped, even though I am not religious I feel like growing up around those ideals have had a positive impact on me. But I grew up around a lot of hard workers and that rubbed off on me, sometimes I feel as if its not too much that I am a hard worker but that I am stubborn."
