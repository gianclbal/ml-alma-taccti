2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1457,"When life gets challenging, I tend to take a step back from the situation and take a breather. After observing the obstacles in my way making my life challenging, I tackle them one at a time. Rather than feeling overwhelmed with the multiple tasks I am responsible for, taking them one step at a time not only calms the nerves, it allows for better quality of work. If you attempt to solve every issue in your challenging life at the same time, everything is rushed and will result in poor quality of decisions or work. I also handle challenging situations like these by taking a break from the work every now in then. It is bad to overwork yourself to the point where you are exhausted and no longer have time to enjoy the things you like to do in life. For example, I like to watch anime on my free time so when I do take a break from the hard work that is what I do."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1479,"The hardest thing for me this semester was definitely getting COVID-19. The reason why it was the most challenging thing for me this semester was because of it, I missed a lot of school work for about 3 weeks and it was near the beginning of school so it was terrible timing. And what made it even worse was that my symptoms were a lot worse than other's symptoms and a lot harsher as well. I had major body aches and major headaches and did not have much energy to do anything. The fatigue really got to me and was super hard for me to even get up out of my bed. And when I would try to get up out of my bed, all my muscles were really sore and my body would just start aching like crazy. And so having major body aches and having to use the restroom a lot was one terrible combination. And so what I did was kept listening to Quran and motivational talks to keep telling myself that I will come back stronger and better and that it was a sign from God since my faith was really really low. And so now when I have really small stressful problems, I pretty much turn to God to help me and I honestly feel do a lot better. And that is what I do when I struggle, especially during this semester."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1461,"When life starts to get a little more difficult than I would like it, I usually try and distance myself from whats causing so much stress, but only at first. I take time away from that particular dilemma in order to re-assess what I should do moving forward. After I take time away, I break down the necessary steps I need to take in order to overcome it. By doing so, I can fully mentally prepare myself for it. Sometimes, it does not turn out this way and I'll probably try and avoid it for as long as possible but, those are usually the first steps I take, If and when, I choose to take on the task. It is important to not let life trials and tribulations affect you too much. Most of the time, what make the challenges so difficult is the thought of actually having to deal with them and not the problem itself. Because once things get a little better, you realize that what you thought was super difficult and antagonizing was actually not as bad as you thought it out to be."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1458,"When life gets hard, it is sometimes hard to get yourself out of your head. You start to think what you did wrong to get to this time in life and for some people it is very mentally draining and hard. For me, some things that i like to do to get myself out of my head and just get through life being hard is to surround myself with people I love and doing things that are going to distract me, like working out. Sometimes when life is hard, another thing i like to do is just sit down or lay down and just think what i can do to make it better. What can i do to make life a little bit easier for me at the moment? After i finish thinking i try to do the things that i thought about and make things better for myself."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1464,When life gets challenging my main concern is to not get overwhelmed and try to manage whatever it may be. I tend to get anxious and overwhelmed easily so when life gets challenging I take tasks one step at a time and divide my work to make it more manageable. In order to care for myself I allow myself breaks and self care whether that be a simple 20 minutes to myself or journaling like this to reflect and not get caught up with work. I as well take advantage of my resources I am one to usually not as for help since I like being independent but doing this time it’s crucial to not keep that mindset. There are people in my life who can make life a bit easier during these time and I just need to reach out and as well as advisers and peers who can provide insight/advice to whatever I’m dealing with. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,559,"Honestly, when life gets challenging I tend to try and avoid it. And by that I mean I will do something else like bake or go shopping. Right now I’m going through a challenge will online learning. I was so confident that I would do amazing this semester and then my first chemistry exam was a disaster, I had 2 300-500 responses with readings every week, and physics homework. I wasn’t use to all this homework before but now it seems like we’re given so much more. I’m working on taking a different route when life gets challenging like taking a second to breathe and write everything that needs to be done. Basically try not to overwhelm myself with what’s going on. And take breaks but not too long because I’ll lose focus on what I really need to do. I know that from experience I’ll end up just not doing the rest of my task. Yes, I know it’s horrible."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1470,What I usually do when life gets challenging is surf.  Surf is my go to activity.  I picked up surfing when I was 19-20 and I haven't stopped since.  I live in an ideal place for surfing so it was easy to get out to the beach but the actual activity of surfing is hard.  The challenge of surfing is what keep me doing it and what kept me distracted from my problems.  I made a lot of friends from surfing and met my best friend surfing as well.  We all come from different backgrounds and its so much fun having this activity that we can all do together regardless of what we do outside of surf.  I do have one other distraction and its video games.  I love to keep my mind busy games because they can be so immersive or even fun to play with my friends.  I like video games so much because of how easily accessible they are and that there is games for everyone.  It's different from surfing because of how easy it is to get into.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1454,"When life gets challenging I have many ways to handle the situation. One way to deal with it, it is take a step back and remove myself from the challenge. Sort of like taking a break. I play video-games or talk to friends or family. Interacting with people normally helps me feel relaxed and helps with a mental reset. If I dont take that option, another great option I enjoy is listening to music. Music sets the mood for me, I often listen to relaxing, chill music such as lofi to help or listen to video game music remixes. Video games such as minecraft, legend of zelda, etc. Last option for me is to go into my bed and take a quick nap. This also helps me reset my mind, and I enjoy sleeping because my bed is just too comfortable."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1478,"At times like now when I encounter difficulty in life, I find a variety of things that I can do that help me cope with the pressure. I often do things like look to my friends and family to hang out with and talk to, watch movies, or meditate. My favorite outlet of all, however, is music. When I am most stressed out, my favorite thing to do is hop on my drum kit and begin playing. It seems that as I play, all the problems go away and my only focus is getting a good recording and grooving on whatever track. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1450,"This semester, I've been having to do homework almost every day which has been kind of stressful, especially when it's close to deadlines. I get massive headaches when I work or study for too long which frustrates me because sometimes I still have more to do. When this happens, I usually plug in some earplugs and meditate it off. This week also started off really rough for me and my family. On Sunday, we had to say our goodbyes to my uncle who was struggling with COVID-19 since August which was probably the most challenging life can get for me. So what do I do? I don't know. I can't meditate this one away. I also still had assignments and quizzes that were due. Life just continued on. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1472,"When life gets challenging I handle it in many different ways depending on what it is. If its school wise, when it gets challenging when I'm overflowed with work, I  tend to make lists of what I need to do. And when I start to do work I'm on a roll, knowing out as many assignments, but when I make time to relax I don't come back to do work for along time. As a stress reliever, I like to hear relaxing music, picnicking and just taking the day to myself. Something that I find important is talking to my friend, when im with them we dont talk about school at all so its a relief to not think and worry about school all the time. a realization that has helped me too is talking to myself how I talk to others, I always say ""you got this!"" ""I believe in you"" but I never was able to say that about myself."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1462,"What I do when life gets challenging, I let out my emotions for me to get it over with the overwhelming feelings I am feeling or distracting myself from those challenges for awhile and do what my hobbies are like painting, watching a show or going out for a walk among other things I can do. However, you can avoid your problems forever so then I reach out to whoever can help me like significant other or friends . If my challenges were regarding school, I try my best to contact people that can help me out in class or my professors are a great resource to get thet assistance I need. Another self note, that has helped me alot is planning a list of things I need to complete in order to move forward in order for meto feel accomplish with my assigments whether if it was little or not. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1453,"Personally it depends on what type of challenge I am facing. There are challenges in life that I have to overcome just to be able to live my life, like the challenge of being able to support my self or a family I plan on having. Those challenges are ones I sometimes have difficulty with but I know I must complete them. Then there are challenges that sometimes we put on ourselves for no reason, like being stubborn and continuing to do something that you know won't work but you keep doing it. Fortunately for me I am pretty stubborn so I do try to face challenges pretty often, that I create myself."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1449,"What I do when life gets challenging is I usually try to get into the best headspace that I can, meaning that I try to go to my happy place or even just try to calm down by doing things I enjoy, like going out with friends, hanging and spending time with my family, or even having a day to myself, like watching movies or just going out and trying to get my mind off of things that are hard in my life at the moment, but I also try to overcome those challenges by thinking that it's not too bad and trying to face those certain things, and take them down one by one, like just thinking of what i should get done first and then be done and by the time I overcome them, everything turns out to be fine in the end because sometimes life does get really hard but we can always overcome when things get bad."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1452,"When life gets challenging, I tend to talk to friends for emotional support. One thing that I won't do is give up just because of something challenging when there is so much more ahead of me. I try to be optimistic and push away negative feelings that bring me down. I try to be the best version of myself around other people. I do the things I love to do to keep my mind occupied for example, friends and family. Work is also my distraction from life because I would be totally occupied with the responsibilities I have with work. I listen to music to calm my thoughts, so I can think critically about the challenges I am facing."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1467,"When life gets challenging what I realized what helps me is to talk about it. Talk about it to my family and friends. And a lot of the times when I have done that I have gotten feedback and advice on how to help myself with whatever problem I am having at the moment. Whether its school or a relationship with a friend. What also helps me a lot is staying organized. Keeping my school things organized physical papers and things but also staying on top of assignments and not getting behind. That way I can reflect on what I don't understand and also compare to the new things we are learning as well. But also having a clean room and keeping your things clean and myself clean really helps me feel better when I am down about something. Especially if it is something I can't do anything about, I organize that drawer that I've been meaning to organize. I vacuum my room that I've been meaning to do. Or even just take a shower and eat or drink something. It all just helps me think clearer or gives me time to do a mindless task and to think about what's going on and how I am feeling about it. Especially if its something I can't do anything about. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1448,"David OlingerJournal #3When life gets challenging I take a break and step back until I am ready to return with a level head to start problem solving. I begin to think of efficient, and possibly temporary solutions that will allow me to keep myself calm and collected; until I can find a more permanent solution. From there I brainstorm how I can either overcome challenges in my life or whether to accept them as is and do what I can."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,103,"When life gets challenging I like to look at my goal list and ask myself what am I doing right and what am I doing wrong so I can find my flaw and fix it. Or do I need to go for something else and make a backup plan. I also like to take time and look over all the notes and make sense of it in my free time. But when I am too stressed then I feel like the challenge can be easier if my mind is refreshed so I would take a break to spend time with my family and friends. I might even go to sleep or do self-care if necessary. I would then plan my day afterwards for the week and get myself back together. I would sometimes draw and get my creative side out if I feel pressured and try to relax, because drawing makes me feel better and content if I want to be in my own space after finishing something challenging."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1456,"What I do when life gets challenging, is try to take a break and do something I enjoy. Even though I really like to take breaks a lot most of it consist of looking at my phone or just watching netflix. Sometimes it helps but most of the time it doesn't help my anxiety or stress at all. I typically find myself even more anxious than before. Maybe it has to do something with me being unproductive during that time. Anyways one thing that I've recently found that helps me with my stress and gets outside is rollerblading. I barely began three weeks ago and I still fall but I personally feel like I have improved more. When I do fall I try not to get mad or down about it because I like to think that it's natural fall because I'm just learning how to not fail again. If that makes sense. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1465,"Honestly, I am still going through ways to handle tough life situations. So far, when I am in a rough mental spot especially with work or school I either 1) Cry, and feel angry at myself for not trying harder, 2) Sit in front of my planner so I can try to get some organization back into my life or 3) just go to work and distract myself from thoughts of school. After writing this, it hits me that I do nothing to get back on track with classes. Recently, I had taken time off from work to work on all my classes so I am looking forward to that and I've been trying to get my motivation back for classes so I am going in this weekend with a strong mindset of catching up with as much as I can. One thing I have to remember is to not set too much of a high goal for myself so in case I do not reach my intended goal I will not let it get to me and knock my motivation off again. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1463,"When life gets challenging I honestly just feel like giving up for a little bit but then after a while I try my best on whatever has challenged me. I end up trying my best when life gets challenging because in the end if I don't try then it won't benefit me. Life is very challenging for me right now because I have to deal with school and work at the same time but I am getting the hang of juggling the two together. I just know that there is one class that I need to focus on which is one of my challenges right now. My biggest challenge overall would be online classes because online classes has always been an issue for me. Overall, I find challenges as an opportunity for me because in the end it will affect me and help me get through life. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1477,"When life gets challenging it comes a time where I have to take a deep breath before anything good or bad happens whether it's about school, work, and inside the household. School can be very challenging because you're always going to be dealing with exams, quizzes, essays, and homework assignments every day/week. Many professors can be very hard to deal with because most teachers aren’t very organized with grading and don’t give us the amount of time to do the homework or classwork assignments. When it comes to work it can be frustrating sometimes since I work most of the day with a five minute break. After heading home, I sometimes get lazy trying to finish my homework on time and even study for an upcoming exam. In the household, as the older sibling it’s a huge responsibility making sure your younger sibling attends his classes everyday. Especially, reassuring that he doesn’t go off playing video games whenever I’m out of his sight."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1466,"When life gets challenging, I tend to try and relax in the few moments I can. In quarantine especially, life was a little tough, because I actually tested positive for COVID! It was a hard time and all I could do was eat porridge and try to breathe as normally as I could. My mental state was not the best, since I was really worried for my family and myself, and always wondering if in one moment, things could go really bad really fast. Most of my family was asymptomatic, but we were always worried that our conditions could get worse as time went on. Thankfully, we all recovered and we are all negative now.Throughout the experience, I kept thinking about different scenarios, and it wasn't the best for my recovery. I would not consider myself a super religious person, but during this time, I prayed to God for my family's recovery, and I found comfort in that, even if it was to an ""upper being"" that I still have trouble believing in. In other tough situations, such as in school or life in general, I just keep reminding myself that everyone has their own path and we're all taking our own steps to get to the place we want to go to. It sounds a bit cliche, but I really didn't truly recognize that until I was almost done with community college. When I first started that journey, I always kept comparing myself to my peers, and it was just a constant toxic cycle about worrying about my future and comparing my path to others. I believe I'm in a better place now, and I hope I can just go up from here on out."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1471,"To approach the question What do I do when life gets challenging? I often look back to the road that I have traveled on, in order to see how far I have come. I tend to have challenges outside of the classroom because of the way my current situation is in life. I have to deal with the constant stress of being a young person in a competitive field that is not too fond of accepting colored students, having a negative mindset about myself because I am not as perfect as the picture perfect person that a institution wants, and constantly thinking of trying to meet a standard that is obviously unfair and discriminative towards certain groups of people. Referring back to the question, I tend to watch a lot of youtube videos about well known and respected figures in a difficult field of work, and understand their struggles as a person, and form the connection between myself and them. I like to talk to new and known people about life itself, and the well being of ourselves. I constantly push myself to become a better student and person as a whole, because I want to learn, and I am eager to do so. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,612,"When life gets challenging, my mind often feels really crowded with thoughts, feelings, things I have to do, homework that needs to get done, zoom calls I need hop on for, family time I have to make, and so on. It can be rather challenging having to balance everything. I feel like as I get older, I'm starting to realize that not everyone has their life together and a lot of people have no idea what they're doing but they seem to ""smile through the pain"" and take it day by day. Personally, with my life turned upside down with everything that has happened in the last couple months, I've been journaling and writing out lists. I feel as if writing stuff down has really taught me to gain perspective and be able to organize my thoughts in a much more concrete way. Also keeping a calendar and getting in my daily lists done has proven to really help me during what I find to be one of my most difficult semesters."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1447,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?""The most common question that's asked but not a lot of people can answer. For me personally I find it a thrill in most appropriate aspects of my life. I believe that with every challenge, there is an opportunity that allows you to not only better yourself but even find things about yourself you haven't already. Every step forward is path towards whatever may lay in front of you. The only way you can overcome that challenge is by facing it head on with every intention that you will come out on top. I allow challenges and I seek them everyday of my life because I am not completely fulfilled with where I am at right now and neither will I be in the next 10-15 years or so, until I get what I want after the fact that I have worked hard for it as well building the person who I want to be in the future."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1468,"When life gets challenging, I usually do things that are stress free, like I either get ready, so my make up and go out with friends or I stay home, eat, and just watch some shows or movies. I like having a break when things get challenging, because if I don't I just start doing everything wrong and I start getting super stressed which isn't good for me. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1446,What I do when school gets challenging but overall when school get challenging  is that I tried to find techniques in ways that it will help me find ways to solve my problems.  for example if I am struggling with a class assignment I tried to look for tutoring so they could be help me explain me on how can I solved. Also when i don't so good on the exams of my classes If I study for the first but even though I did not do so good so I put more effort on study by reviewing the notes the examples of the homework. Another thing that I do when life gets challenging is that I tried to take a time and forget about everything and just relax for a moment and go hiking with my family Also my family helps me out some struggles that I may have in school or  in life they give me thier support. Right now that we are learning in by  virtual it is a struggle and a  challenging for me but I tried to overcome by  looking or resources that could help me understand my classes and or my  assignment.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1460,"When life gets challenging, I stop doing everything and just give a moment to myself, sometimes crying it all out helps as well. I would always tell myself that life will get better and that these kinds of situations are just temporary. Sometimes I would talk to someone about it because I find it helpful to just let it out and lift it off my shoulders. Life is not easy sometimes and I believe everything happens for a reason. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1473,"When life gets really challenging for me I try my best to take deep breathes and clear my mind by either going outside or expressing my feelings towards my family members or girlfriend. I feel like when everything gets tough I try to remember that I am doing my best to fight this battle (for my grandma who passed away 2 years ago). Sometimes when I feel overwhelmed with work, personal, relationship, and school, I try to humble myself and take everything one step a time, one minute, one objective, and goal that needs to be finished. I also feel like when life gets challenging, I play music and zone myself out when I am alone so that my mental capacity can just reset and be okay. Mostly, I like doing groceries alone and taking my time because I feel like, at home, you aren't given that ""me time"" that you always want in order to have some peace. Finally, the last thing I do when everything is getting hard for me is that I try to remind myself of positive thoughts and bring positive energy and give myself the best confidence imaginable"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1475,"When life gets challenging I resort to things that comfort me such as: taking a break and meditating, working out, making my favorite foods, and doing a hobby that relieves stress. It might not be the best way to cope, but it is a temporary fix. I do notice that I get into a cycle every semester of going on a high of staying on top of my schoolwork and then I suddenly lose motivation. So I have to remind myself I have to stay on top of my responsibilities. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1459,When life gets challenging I like to sit back for a second and revise either what I did wrong to get here or what's happening and then how to get through the situation. If it's something I can fix then I'll find a course of action to do that. If it's because I'm stressed I take a break and play some video games. I also like to talk to my friends since they're really fun people to talk to. When feeling overwhelmed I find it best just to slow everything down and think things through one by one until I get everything in order.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1455,"When life gets challenging, I look to others for advice on guidance depending on what's been challenging my life. If it's about relationships, I usually go towards my friends to get advice from. I go on to tell them what happened and what to do. And from listening to their advice, I always take their advice into account when I make the next decisions. It's really nice to get some outside perspectives on certain situations since my mind could be typically biased because of the emotions and feelings that do occur. When it's more life-based such as career, I usually always go to my family for advice since they have similar goals like me in terms of career. As for myself, I sometimes don't ask people for advice when it's something that I feel that I should take care of it myself. So with that said, I usually go out to a nature or beach setting to think things over and clear my head. Those are places where I feel the most calm to collect all my thoughts together."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1474,"What do I do when life gets challenging? Well I guess I try to do something for myself to reset my mindset. I try to think positively and imagine the best outcomes and honestly will play my own “theme songs” (I have a playlist), and look in the mirror and tell myself that I got it. After that, it is more being determined and making a plan to get through the challenges and obstacles in the way. And then just act on those plans. I think without getting your head right and creating a perception of positivity and success is important, otherwise it is a lot less likely that I will achieve what I need to. In terms of emotional challenges, I mean really looking in, identifying the issue, and taking time or yourself is important in terms of those types of challenges. Either way, people need to find ways to motivate themselves through the hard times in life, because they will always come. For me, that is positivity, perception, confidence that I can do what I set out to, and motivating myself. I also will listen to a youtube hypnosis meditation for personal power when I feel like things are getting out of control and I need a mental reset and confidence boost. "
