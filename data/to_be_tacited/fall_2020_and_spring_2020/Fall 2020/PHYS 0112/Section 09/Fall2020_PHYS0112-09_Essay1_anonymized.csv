Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,612,"Apart from this being a required course for my biology major, I guess I would have to say I'm here so that I can continue to pursue my goal of being in the medical field in the near future. I have always believed that my sole purpose on this earth was to help others. As a kid, I've always wanted to be a veterinarian, but I have also shown interest in other fields of medicine throughout the years. I'm currently on track to pursue a veterinarian career with a concentration in zoology within my biology major, however, I'm keeping my options open. I really enjoyed physics in high school and was even ambitious enough to take AP Physics, but I later ended up dropping the class feeling extremely overwhelmed with my other AP classes. I really do hope to get a lot out of this class despite the circumstances. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1446,The reason that I am here in school and in class because I want to learn about physics. I want to learn how matter and energy is related to physics and who invented the matter. Another reasons that I am here in school because i want to graduate from college and being able to attend medical school. I like to learn about physics because it has to do  more about related to math. I am here in SF State because it has the major of Biology with a concentration of physiology that will guide to become a doctor.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1447,"It took me a little while to figure out what I wanted to do in general and I finally was able to sit down and figure out what I wanted. For the past 5 years I’ve switched through 4 different majors until I knew what I wanted to be. I went from wanting to be a civil engineer meaning taking a lot of math classes, physics classes and as well as hands on classes to adhere to my experience but in the end I didn't like it. After that, I wanted to become a paleontologist, teacher, then an astronomer. After going through countless classes and counselor meetings, I was able to obtain my true desire in life and what I wanted to study on was Environmental Science (possibly in Sustainability). It takes awhile for someone to realize their true purpose or potential but in the end it took one newspaper to convince me that Earth's environment and every other planet is just as important as understanding why you are here and what makes you different mentally and physically amongst possible civilizations out there as well as what you can offer to the world. Right now I want to learn and understand our planet, galaxy and many others along the way as I take these classes to better help me pursue my dream in understanding our environment and working in the big leagues one day"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1448,"David Olinger 09/02/2020Physics 112Why I am in PhysicsThe reason for me taking a physics class is simple and pretty straightforward. It is a basic stepping stone in order for me to graduate with my Major of Biology (Concentration on Cell and Molecular) from SFSU. I need to take 2 semesters of physics and pass in order to move forward in my journey. After I graduate from SFSU I will then apply for medical school to become a pharmacist at UCSF, which is the overall and main goal I have for myself! I am fascinated by the job and I want a career I can look back on and feel proud of my achievements."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1449,"Why I'm here is a pretty broad question but can also be answered with the domino effect of my personal choices (and non personal ones). The reason I chose to take Phys 112 was mainly because it’s a requirement to graduate and also because I’ve never taken a physics class in my whole life so I thought that it’d be pretty cool if I did for my first semester of my second year of college. Why  I showed up to class on this day (September 3rd, 2020) was because it;s only the second week of school and it’d be kinda lame just to miss class because I want to and, I actually enjoy this class already, considering it’s only once a week, but everyone just seems pretty chill. But moving on to the topic of being places in the first place, why did I even wanna be/go to San Francisco State University in the first place, well first it was because my parents forced me to go to a four year university, and then I chose SF state because they had the major I wanted, which was Biology with a concentration in physiology and I also wanted to go far, considering I’m originally from Southern California. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1450,"I am here, taking PHYS 112 because it is a required class for my major, Biology. This class is also probably a pre-req for another class that I will need to take. I am at home, lying in bed, because there is a pandemic going on in the world and now school takes place online through meetings on Zoom. Quite honestly, it is very easy to fall behind classes because I don't have the pressure of seeing my professor face to face. It is also not as motivating as in-real-life classes. However, I don't really have a choice so I will just have to manage like everyone else. I am here to not only pass this class, but to learn some concepts of physics and to use the knowledge that I gained from this class to explain things in real life. I also plan to carry what I learned to my next physics class in the future. I am here, not because I need to be, but because I want to be (for the most part..)."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1451,"I am honestly just trying to fill in a prerequisite, however i am pretty nervous of taking this class, i took physics AP in high-school and it did not go so well, I understood nothing and i failed the class. So i am here facing an old enemy, we'll see how this goes. I think i am ready to take on physics once more and i at least don't plan on failing. So far i have been understanding most things in lecture I always have to go and do a little extra research on youtube but i am good."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1452,"Why am I here? I am here in your physics 112 section 9 class because I want to learn and experiment on how physics works. The topic that I am very familiar with would be about forces and gravity. I really want to learn how physics is applied to this world because I know our daily lives has to do something with science. For example, how do we have the technology we have now, or the electricity? Without science, we would not have what we have now. I am looking forward to learn about physics in your class. Another reason I am here because I want to understand how physics is applied to my career of becoming a Pharmacist. I am wondering what is there to physics other than forces? I do not know much about physics because I did not have a great teacher in high school, so I lack a little in an understanding. I am looking forward to learn new things about physics in your class. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1453,"Hello my name is Merim,I am in this Physics class because I am a biology major and need this class a pre requisite for my studies. I really enjoy learning about biology but it wasn't always my major, for a time I majored in computer science. I tried computer science because that degree had more potential out of a four year to make money right away, but when I was in computer science class I realized I had no passion for it. Then I came to realization that biology was the perfect major for me, even if I wasn't gonna make as much money doing it. As for SF state I wanted to experience San Francisco State. I have spent over 3 years in a community college so I have class experience and understand what is important to me. I have some regrets about not starting at a state school because I could have completed my school journey faster, but at the same time I have learned some valuable life lessons in my classes"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1454,"I am here because I am required to be here. Physics class and lab is a required course that I must take in order for me to graduate with a biology degree. However I do hope that I learn a lot about physics because I enjoy learning and gaining new knowledge. I am here because I hope to be successful and pursue my goals in being a scientist especially within the research industry. I am here because I love science. If I were to choose any subject, science would by my number one choice because there is science behind everything in everyday life. I feel like science can be applied anywhere while math, english or history etc. does not. Science interest me the most and I have always been interested in science since I was in elementary school. However it wasn’t until High school I learned that I would to make a living off science."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1455,"Generally, I'm here in college because I would need to get a degree in order to be a chiropractor. In addition, I feel like college is one of the milestones in life that a good amount of people should accomplish in their life. Obviously, college isn't meant for everyone. However, it does open up a lot of doors for some individuals. Specifically speaking, I'm in this class because it's listed as a class that Kinesiology major students have to take. I'm hoping that I would need to use this class material in the future because I would later forget it over time if it's not constantly brought up throughout my life. I’m currently a Pre-Kinesiology major, and I hope to get into the Kinesiology program. I’m crossing my fingers because Kinesiology is an impacted major. Taking this Physics class would help me get one step closer to being a good candidate for the Kinesiology program."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1456,"I am here because I wanted to get away from home. I know that sounds a bit weird because why would I want to go away from home. Sometimes home can be nice but there are also moments where home can become too much. I have been around my home for almost two decades and I wanted to reinvent myself. I just needed a break from where I grew up. The reason why I chose to come to SFSU is because I love the weather especially when its dark and cloudy. It makes me feel more active. I can't explain why but I came out here for school but also to force myself to meet people. I came to SF State alone and not knowing anyone but I have to say it was the best decision that I made. Before I was a homebody and a hermit, I only went out when I had to but being here has really made me grow mentally as a adult. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1457,"Why Am I Here?	The question I often ask myself from time to time is, why am I here? At times I’ll find the temporary answer to that question, but never fully understanding the answer I come up with. Some answers may be from justifying this is my goal in life and it is set that way. I believe I am here in order to figure out what I want to do with my life. I know that answer is very vague but it is true. As of right now I am following the majority of people in my major in becoming a physical therapist. I don't know if I want to be a physical therapist or not, it’s just one of the most successful careers to pursue in my major. The world is massive and in reality, most of the decisions made in life are insignificant compared to the big picture. I often think that I don’t need to live up to everyone’s expectations and I can just do what I want and live on. To a certain extent, I believe that, however; the experience of getting an education and seeing how far you can progress in life is the reason why I am here. Looking to better myself in every way I can, this is the reason why I am here."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1458,"I am in this class due to it being a pre-req for my major which is biology. I am her so that i can gradute with a bachelors in Biology and hopefully get into medical school. I am passionate about this because i want to become a pediatric surgeon or doctor. This has been a dream of mine for a while and i have stuck to it ever since it became just an idea in my head. The reason for my interest in the medical field is as a pediatric doctor or surgeon, is because i love working with children and i would love to give them a second chance at life and just put a smile on their faces by making them feel better. It is going to be tough but i know that it is something i am really passionate about. This is the reason why i am here so that i can acheive my goals and what i am passionate about. I chose SFSU because it was the closest school from home that accepted me and i didn't want to be to far from home."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1459,"I'm here at SFSU to get a college education and also because it's the closest school to home and would cost less than going anywhere else. I'm taking this class, physics lab 112 because it's a co-requisite for general physics which I have to take for my biology major. I'm also in this class because I genuinely enjoy doing labs especially physics labs as opposed to just a lecture, it helps me to get a better understanding of physics concepts so everything isn't just math and formulas. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1460,"Why am I here? For this class, I am here because it is one of the prerequisite classes that I have to take for my major. But, one thing I want to talk about is ‘Why am I in college?’ I decided to attend college because I don’t know what I want to do in the next stage of my life, so I decided to go to college and see what I like to do. I also decided to attend college is because I believe having a degree would be useful for the future. Yes, I know there are other options to be “successful,” like vocational school but I don’t feel confident or comfortable enough to be successful without one. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1461,"I have always wanted to become more involved in bettering people's lives. After completing volunteer work at several temples, I started to become enamored with helping others. In the beginning of my college career, I thought that by working in a healthcare field like pharmacy I would able to work with others directly. However, after working in the pharmaceutical setting, I came to realize that the work I was performing did not leave myself feeling satisfied but, instead, weary and tired. After graduating, I stumbled upon optometry and became fascinated with the study of the eyes and their importance. The field seemed perfect to me. The field would allow to help other people quickly and effectively as well as be able to interact with them holistically. This is why I am here. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1462,"To start off, I am here in this class as a class requirement for my major, as well as understanding how Physics is the theory of life as most have described. My purpose is to help people. I would want my career choice to be able to help others which is why so far, I have thought of becoming a pediatrician due to my interest in working with children. From volunteering with kids from a young age, I begin to understand how they act around people and also would like to understand more about how to help them healthwise. My goal is to be something in a Medical field, even though it is highly impacted to be in one, I am trying my hardest to maintain my place in my classes and succeed. If we go on a personal level, I would also like to support my family with what I decide to do because the one sole reason my parents are here is to support me and I wanted to do the same for them to show their efforts have not gone wasted."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1463,"I would say that I am here in school because it's something that is very looked upon in my family since I am a first generation of going to a university. I did graduate my high school with an AA degree as well. When I graduated with my high school and college diploma, it has really gave me a boost in my education because this helps me get a step closer to my goal which is becoming a pediatrician. My purpose is to better my education and get the knowledge that I need to help me get through life. I am here in this class because I need this class for my major which is Biology. I am also here to learn about physics. I am here because I have always wanted to see what physics was about. I've always thought that physics was all about math but its not, its more of a little bit of math and a little of science. Not only am I here to learn about physics but I am also here to meet new people. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1464,First thought I would say it because this is a requirement that gets me closer to my career goal but diving deeper I'm here because as a junior in high school I found a passion for dentistry. At the time I was working as an intern at an orthodontist office and had decided to dedicate my future to it. I was drawn to it because the job was light and interesting and the patients were always glad to see you because you're changing their future for the better. At the same time you have the ability to critically think rather than have a mindless job. In order to hold that I must take certain classes that are geared toward that. At times I feel like these classes are not relevant but have come to learn to have an open mindset because you never know if you'll find another internet and passion that otherwise you would have missed out on.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1465,"I'm here in this class because it is a requirement for my intended major which is zoology. I had started in SFSU as a pre-nursing major but that never really was my passion, it was only a career my parents said I can make money in and although that is true I thought to myself that I would never be completely happy with that job because I'll always be thinking about my real passion, which is caring for animals.I chose this school because 1) When I dorm it would be far enough and close enough from my family  (we live in San Jose) and 2) when coming into the pre-nursing major, I saw that SF State had also offered zoology so I guess in a way I knew I would eventually switch my major, I just had to have the courage to switch and follow my passion. Currently as well I am working at an animal hospital to make sure it is something I want to stay in and also surround myself in the field to gain any experience for future jobs and schooling. Working at my hospital shows me the different types of doctors as well as far as personality and work load preference. Based on what I have seen and experienced so far I am here also because I believe I can become a doctor that brings people who are excited about working with animals together in a fun yet professional work space. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1466,"I’m here because it’s a required class for my major, to be honest! I’m interested in learning about physics for the first time, as well. As to why I’m here as an SFSU student, I’m actually a transfer student from a local community college. When I was in high school, everyone really trash-talked community college and how it is only for dumb people who just wanted to experience more high school classes without a social life. It was a very prestigious and competitive environment that was super toxic for me. I recognized that I wasn’t a genius like many of my peers, but that I was still capable of learning at my own pace, and that was perfectly fine. It took a long time for me to accept that, and come to terms with my decision to go to community college. The first year was pretty hard, and I was always thinking I was so inferior. But I’m glad I’m finally here, although school is online. I also originally wanted to transfer to a nursing program, so I applied to many schools in California. However, I did not get into any of them. It was also a really hard time for me to get through, because I was really struggling with deciding if healthcare was really the right path for me, and I felt like I was back to my old self that was feeling so inferior and “not good enough” from a few years ago. But I’ve jumped back, and I’m feeling motivated to make the most out of these classes! I look forward to this semester."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,559,I am here because not only is this a required class for my major but I want to attempt to learn and comprehend physics. The reason why I say that is because last semester I enrolled in physics only to be lost on the first day of class. I don't know if it was the way it was taught but I had a difficult time grasping information. So this time I am here to ask questions when I need help and make sure I fully understand a topic. This will only benefit me in the end because I will be able to apply physics outside of class. In general I am here because I want to be here. By that i mean I want to educate myself more biochemistry. It took a few bumps in the road to get my stuff together and choose a major but I'm grateful it happened. I have to say i'm a little behind on graduating on time but it's okay because everyone has their own paths. College hasn't been easy but I know in the end itll all be worth the middle of night stress cries. Also I'm sorry I didn't turn this in way sooner I switched into your class 2weeks in and I was looking for my response from my last class.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1467,"I am here plainly because I need to take this class for my major. But since it relates to my major it relates to the reason I chose my major. I chose my major (biology) because it would be my dream to become a veterinarian. Although I haven't had many pets myself I have always loved animals growing up. And I have been surrounded by friends and family who do have other animals as pets. And to have a job where I get to see animals all day and make them feel better from whatever ills them would make me so happy. Of course, I have thought of the downside of being a veterinarian as well. I know that this job I may not be able to save all of them, or I may have to be the one who puts them down. But the way how I try to view it myself is that when you put an animal down it's for the better."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1468,"Why are you here?The reason why I am at sfsu is because I wanted to be the first in my family to go to college because my mom really wanted to see one of her children going to college and I was the last out of her 3 kids that has the chance to go because my older brothers didn’t want to go to college, and I wanted to make her proud. Also, because I want to become an OB (I don't know if I want to be an OB nurse or the actual OB doctor)  someday and I need to go to school for that. The reason I am in this class is because I’m taking Physics 111 and they told me I also had to take the Lab, so I decided to do both classes in the same semester. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1469,"John Henry Skinner Phys 112-09 R 9/3/20I think this one is actually pretty straightforward for me, because it's centered around a call I've already had to make. When I decided to drop the lecture class I had to weigh the reasoning behind staying in this class vs. dropping it.  Ultimately, I decided that I was interested in the content of the class and it wouldn't hurt to get the required course out of the way while familiarizing myself with physics a little more before taking the lecture class. I would summarize my reasoning by saying that there are three components to the reason why I'm here: I'm interested in physics, I wan't to feel more prepared in future physics classes, and, of course, ""because I have to."""
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1470,"So I am here in this class because it is a requirement for my major.  This is a very standard answer but it goes more into that.  This class helps get me to my end goal.  I want to get into research.  My major is microbiology and to get my degree in that, I need to take this class.  That being said, I still enjoy physics.  I actually really like it because I remember back in high school always having a good time while taking it.  I don't think I'll ever use physics in my field but I have always thought it was rad.  I also think that people do struggle a lot with it and I enjoy the challenge of it.  I also hope that once getting done with school for micro and working for a bit I'll probably go back to school to either get a pHD in micro or go to medical school.  I haven't decided yet but the possibilities are there."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1471,"Louie Jackson9/3/2020Physics-112Jonathan WeisbaumWhy Am I Here?I am here because I want to honor the sacrifices that both my parents had to take in order for me to get an education here in the United States. I am here because I am eager to learn new things everyday, that I know will benefit me in the near future. I want to be here so I can have the opportunity to help those in need of information that they do not possess. I am here to break the stereotypes among the latino community that have been brought upon us by an ignorant belittling perspective. I want to fulfill my vision and ambitions, so I may be forever grateful for helping those in need. I chose to be here because I love being a person that people can look up to. I want to be that person that I wanted in my life to look up to, but never had the chance to do so because of my environment. I am at San Francisco State University because it is at home. Home is where I feel appreciated, comfortable, and proud to be at. The bay area will forever be my home. Furthermore, I am here learning physics because it is not only a requirement for my major, but because I am excited to learn the subject itself and how it applies to our everyday lives."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,103,"Why am I here? I am here to learn more about science, because I have enjoyed science since elementary school, but I can only continue to learn more of it if I go to college. When I first got started in science I was in elementary, my dad and I entered in the school science contest for fun and we ended up winning.  After I kept taking science classes and it never stressed me out. I found it interesting and fun even when it's challenging so science has always been my favorite subject. So I am in your course to learn more about physics and I need this course for my major biochemistry. I am majoring in biochemistry, because I feel like it will be helpful for me before I get into medical school. I want to get into medical school not to make anyone proud even though it is a plus, but I want to do it for myself, because I have seen many MD in different positions in the medical field doing their job and they even show me things that sparks my curiosity and interest even more in science so it just make sense for me want to go to medical school, because that is where there are hands on learning of different positions of the medical field."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1472,"Why am I here? I think this question can be answered in many ways. I see this as my purpose, my passion, which is to spread joy, positivity, and be a source of help for others. I’ve always enjoyed helping and making people happy, but I’ve seen how focusing solely on others can take a toll on me. I don’t know where I’m going with this but anyways, for my future, I wish to enter a career where I can help people, I’m interested in pediatrics, pathology, and forensic science. (I don’t yet know which)I am also looking into PA, which I just became aware of through other classes I’ve taken the summer. My mom is a medical assistant in the pediatric section specifically with child cancer patients, and hearing what they go through is heartbreaking and I wish to help them in the future. In order to get to my goal, there are classes I need to take which includes this one. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1473,"I am here at SF State to pursue a degree in Biochemistry and become a pharmacist. This class is a prerequisite to my major but also, I never took a physics class so I wanted to see if physics is a really interesting subject in the science field. I believe that becoming a pharmacist is very underrated. There are many benefits to becoming a pharmacist like getting to know which medicine is OTC and what can instantly help you out or your family. In addition, they make a lot of money so it helps you out financially too. I also think it would be really cool if someone in your family is like ""I got this issue"" and then you have the answer to that and can tell them what medical doctors are likely to recommend as well. I came here to SF State because my first intended major (Pre-Nursing) was very hard to get into so I decided to look at other jobs and pharmacy really caught my eye. I also took care of my grandma's medication before she passed away so I was also just interested in how other medications can affect the body. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1474,"Why am I here?This is a really deep question. I mean I don’t really know why I am here. I would like to think that I am here, because I have some purpose in life. If we can put meanings into the things we do, what is the point in doing anything at all? What would be the point in living? I think there a lot of things that could be reasons of “why I am here.” One, I think I have gone through hardships and experiences that most people never will. This makes me empathetic, understanding, and more mature. Because of my hardships, I can better connect and help others with their issues. I also, have always been passionate about animals. From a young age, I have believed my life purpose is to help save and rescue animals in need. I still believe this could be my purpose in life, as I am a Zoology major and making steps to progress this path. Lastly, I think I am here to influence others. For example, I gave my mother and dad a daughter. I made them a family. I have relationships where I have taught, touched, and even hurt at times. So I am here for my own individual pursuits, and to shape the lives and pursuits of those around me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1475,"In the context of school, is I am here for the reason I'm on the path to become a doctor. Science has always intrigued me, but I feel like the schooling system of STEM classes kind of makes it harder for me to enjoy. Due to the pressure of getting a bad grade, an overload of homework, strict rubrics we have to follow. It's almost like we are being forced to follow these curriculums in order to learn about sciences. There's more stress than enjoyment for me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,9,1419,"I am here to study physics to better understand the dynamic physical relationships and physicals laws that govern how we experience our world. I plan to use this knowledge so that I may excel in solving geologic problems in my career, and positively impact the world. I also enjoy understanding physics more in depth, because beyond my career it has helped me solve very mundane issues. Issues such as, getting my guitar pick stuck out of the body of my guitar using the law of conservation of momentum."
