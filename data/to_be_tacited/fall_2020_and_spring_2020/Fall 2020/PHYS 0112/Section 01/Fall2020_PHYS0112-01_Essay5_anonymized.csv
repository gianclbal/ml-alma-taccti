2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1256,"I am a first generation college student. Neither of my parents went to college or graduated from high school. Going to college was never talked about in my household. Once I decided to go to college my mother supported me by watching my son while I took evening classes after high school. My community college was very supportive. There was supportive services for student parents. This helped me transition to university. My SF State professors have all been very supportive, especially in phys 112 lab. The biology department has been very supportive because I receive emails throughout the week with opportunities. I try to attend as many workshops as possible. I have joined several clubs and I am applying for several programs to help me navigate the college experience and apply to graduate school.

I was fortunate to receive a lot of help financially with local scholarships which have truly helped me. I come from a small town where many of the individuals living there know each other. I get to build closer relationships with teachers who show so much support and encouragement. I feel like my community has shown me the importance of support and friendship. I feel like these values have helped guide me through college by creating friendships between classmates where we are able to help one another and talk about how we feel to support our mental health. I feel like the support that one another gives keeps you driven and passionate in the long run. Having that support of other individuals and them cheering you on is what creates such a loving experience.

I don't mind it because I feel like I genuinely enjoy learning and going to school. Being a first generation student, getting a degree is an accomplishment to my immediate and homeland family. I started my degree at SF State and even though with covid affecting universities and school work, I want to finish my degree at SF State even though I live 300 miles away from campus. I can be representative of my community in my hometown as maybe not everyone has the opportunity to go to college. I can be one of those people who can help represent where I come from"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1252,"For me some values that helped me navigate through college would be remembering the importance of education and why we study in the first place. As I navigate more and more into college I started to understand why education in particular is such a great opportunity for everyone so we should try our best. Another value would how I should be responsible in college just like how I am expected to be at home as well. These are only some of the values that my family has that has really pushed me through college since sometimes going into it, its tough to understand how to navigate through. I've also had different values ever since I started college just like how I value friendships, I've made a lot of new friends during this time period and have learned a lot from them as well. This has also helped me navigate through college because they've all had similar experiences as what I would be going through."

I am the first person in my family to pursue school after high school and at times it is very hard to obtain advice and navigate what to do in certain situations because no one has gone through what I am going through. Though they may have not obtained a college education, they always find a way to motivate me and let me know that I am doing great things and setting a great example for the family. I love how my family always finds the good things in life and it motivates me even harder to become a doctor because I really want to help underprivileged families/ communities such as the one I grew up in. My family values hard working people with good hearts and I work hard everyday to maintain those values and live that example. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1263,"Since both of my parents immigrated here from Mexico for a better life, they have emphasized the value of a good education when i was very young. Learning about their life in Mexico and all the discrimination they had to face when they came here really motivates me to do well in school. This has also motivated me to navigate through college and seek out tutoring or other opportunities to further my education. My family also values asking for help when you need it and that has helped me through my college career as well. My mother also values the power of networking and has pushed me to network with different people in order to gain new opportunities, such as school programs, and this has allowed me to navigate through college and find programs and talk to people that have helped me find out what i want to do as a career.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,547,"My parents have always told me college would be tough. They also told me that it would be the best years of my life. So when I finally decided to leave my hometown and move to SF I was really excited. Sadly, corona hit, I lost my job and decided to move back home. So far this has been the toughest semester because of loss of motivation. However, my parents are still my number one cheerleaders.

2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1267,"I grew up away from my mother's side of the family and was alienated from my dad's side of the family. The values I have now are from my mother and father, my community is almost non-existent since we never fit in with the Mexican culture neither with our neighbors, neither with the people at church. My mom taught me the value of doing things correctly even if it took longer, value of thinking before acting as well as thinking long term. My father taught me that I can break rules here and there (very small things) and that I can have fun and the value of acceptance/ not judging others. My best friend taught me the value of living in the moment as well and all 3 of them taught me the value of kindness.So through college, I was able to easily reject parties and doing the typical college stuff and focus on my classes and stay out of trouble ( this is the long term value). Over all I just mind my own business since that's how my nuclear family is. I was still able to make friends in college and have fun healthy memories and not just have my nose stuck in a book/ computer. I am able to make many friends because my father taught me acceptance and not judging others before getting to know them. Though classes can be hard, I am kind to myself in regards to grades or failing a test. "

Seeing her sacrifices everyday has led me to become that much more motivated and will not give up until she sees me make it. Aside from my mother, my communities values have helped me a bit as well indirectly I come from Richmond California where the cities motto is ""The city of pride and purpose"" and I had always seen those words and always kept them in the back of my mind because this city has a bad reputation and one person at a time we can become the city that the motto represents.

2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1254,"Due to quarantine, I am more involved with my family than my community at the moment (not to say I am disconnected from my community). For this reason, my family's values are much more prominent and motivate me to work diligently. My family has immigrated here from the Philippines to pursue a promising future and a prosperous life. With an absent father, my mother and sister worked relentlessly to provide food and rent for our family upon arrival to the US. It is through their hard work and undying determination that they were able to secure lucrative careers in health care and business administration that allowed me to pursue higher education. Their sacrifice is what inspires me to succeed in my academic career and persevere through any hardship that I may encounter. My goal is to one day return the favor by taking care of them the way they took care of me. This is the value I hold to help me navigate through college. "

My college success is also due to my parents and wife because I am a provider. This means that I can't be happy unless everyone else is happy. My family has a lot of health problems for the males and many health related jobs for the females.

2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1258,"My family is very supportive of me and the let's me make my own decisions. Having parents who are excited for me to get a degree I have chosen to pursue at a school that I applied for and got into helps a lot when it comes to having to study for hard classes because I know I chose this and it's something I want to do. My family is always there to help and are understanding when I need time for my academics. They help me the best they can for me to get to a bachelor's degree including helping financially. This gives me a lot of relief because even though I do have a job, I don't have to stress so much and work more hours than needed where it affects my grades. I know I have my parents to fall back on financially if need be. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1266,I think the emphasis on how important my education is really helped me navigate my way through college because without it I wouldn't be afraid to fail. My fear of failure really pushed me to continue my studies despite its difficulties even on the verge of quitting especially during these times of Covid. Ever since I was little my parents really empathize how important it is for me and my siblings to finish our school and graduate with a degree. They would remind us that without it we wouldn't have a stable job and a stable life because they worked pay check to pay check to provide is for our wants and needs. They showed us the hardships of life without having a good education when they were younger but still provided us a kind of comfortable life. I've learned to take whatever opportunities I need to reach my goals in life. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1259,"My family and community have always valued education, especially higher education, so going to university was always expected of me. I'm lucky that I do find interest in what I study, or else going to university would be a problem! Because higher education is so valued, I think that having people that give me support, like my grandmother, if I have a hard time helps me a lot. My sister also went through the university system with the same major as me, so if I ever feel stuck I know that I can ask her for help. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1271,"A primary value of my community is to work hard to overcome barriers and succeed in whatever field.  My parents have been very supportive of me throughout my time at college. They have provided me with financial stability and encourage me to continue on with my education.  What I appreciate the most about. their support is that they do not force me to accomplish something, meaning that there is no added pressure to school. Personally throughout school I've always given it my best, because I know that being able to do that is honorable in my community. Overall I am grateful to have the help I need and feel comfortable navigating college. What I also appreciate is that. even if my parents don't know too much about college they are supportive and always hear my rants when explaining my path to them. This makes me feel heard and understood in my household."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,570,"My family values have greatly influenced me doing well in school and continue to achieve a higher education. I come from a Hispanic heritage where children are taught to always excel further than their parents and grandparents. It doesn't matter if your first gen or not you have to excel in your education in order to excel in life and not live the poverty life but at least the middle class life style. My parents have always pushed me when it comes to this, let it be that I dream big and never small that way I can chance whatever ""impossible"" dream and make it a reality. So far in college its to graduate and apply to med school. They have always been supportive of my dreams and want me to achieve everything they know I am capable of. Another value that they've shown me is that family really does mean everything. When I use to live in SF I was on my own and alone. I made friends but no family was there until I realized that family is a special bond that I can make with friends who seem like your long lost sister, brother or cousin."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1279,"My values are widely stemmed from my immediate family. Coming from two immigrant parents, that traveled to a more westernized country for a better life for their children have majorly impacted the way i navigate through college. Education is definitely a must in my family and though neither of my parents are college graduates they had seen to it that when it came to college and how i got through it was also referring me to other family members and friends within the same situation. My family values are quite strict but also very important to me and that being said really helped me stay focused and not drift from what it is i came to college to accomplish."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1253,"My mother taught me to become independent at a very young age and was always strict in terms of getting the chores done around the house and always focusing on school first. Even though her parenting was always tough, extremely traditional, and strict it prepared me a lot for when I did move away to college. At a young age, I knew the importance of education so when I got to college I always took my classes seriously and did the best I can. I was able to establish independence on my own and took care of myself because of what my mother taught me at a young age and now I'm able to live alone with roommates and know how to cook and clean after myself. The values of my family allowed me to breach out on my own and understand the dangers in the world and to always be cautious of things and think things through before acting on anything. This really tough me how to live alone and deal with stress from work and school at the same time. I am forever thankful for my mother and family around me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1276,"Family and or community has been a key part of human life since the beginning of human society. In the modern world, the family continues to play a key role in the life of a person. The values of my family have helped me get through college in two distinct ways. The principle of helping the family through thick and thin has been akin to a safety net for me as my family has always been there to provide support. Whether it be driving me to the places I need to go or providing emotional support my family is always there for me. Another way my family helps me is by being my motivation to keep on pushing forward in my studies. There are times when things get really hard as my family is something I can always use to relight my fire. Overall, I would not be here without my family. "
