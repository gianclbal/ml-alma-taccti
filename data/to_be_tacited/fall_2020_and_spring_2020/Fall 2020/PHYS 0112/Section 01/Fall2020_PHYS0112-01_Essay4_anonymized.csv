2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1258,"With the pandemic and classes being remote there aren't as many resources left to help me out with classes. Everything on campus is hard to reach or closed especially being that I am not living close to campus to even take advantage of any resources that are open. All libraries near my home are closed as well. I am very old fashioned in the sense that I like to have hard copy resources and face to face tutoring. I don't work very well only off technology. However, technology has offered a lot of resources for help whether it be tutoring online, youtube videos, or simply looking up material and looking at example equations. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1256,"Resources can help provide support. It is difficult to survive in the bay area as a young single mother and there are not a lot of resources that can really make much a difference. For example, traveling in the middle of a pandemic with two children for a box of food is a difficult choice to make. Many of the resources require many appointments that overlap with school and have extremely long waiting times. However, I like to use mindfulness tools, nature, family, and education as resources. For mindfulness tools I like to listen to guided meditations, relaxing music such as sound bowl healing, use positive affirmations, and gratitude. Using nature as a resource, just going outside and feeling the sun or the breeze can be very helpful. My family is a great resource. My children always feel me with joy. Another great resource is my education. Completing my degree fills me with motivation, strength, and hope. My professors have been great resources. I also use the internet as a resource for learning class material. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1276,There are many resources available to me here at San Francisco State University. I have gotten many emails with information as well as had professors talk about these resources. While I cannot list these specifically I know that for any problem I have there are many people and organizations that can help me with it. One resource that I have made use of recently is the webinars hosted by the biology department. I've attended the pre-med webinar and I think it has been very useful for me as it has made the career path more clear. Now I know what things to focus on more. One thing I have learned is about opportunities to develop personally and about how to meet people to get letters of recommendation. I think the resources in this community are essential to every student on campus. There is a sense of relief just knowing the resources exist. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,556,"The resources that I have to support my iPad, my laptop and my iPhone. Another resource you support me in school is my notebook and the way I take notes. I tend to title everything and organize everything by class and by dates and everything and that I guess a resource that helps me learn from my classes is keeping my notebook organized. My iPad is necessary now because of the PDFs we have to turn in an easier to write in with the pencil instead of doing it on your laptop. My iPhone Is the resource or uses because and iPhone has everything you need. My laptop is the biggest resource I have the supports me and because without it I won’t be able to take my classes and the resources available within the laptop to establish your classes and do the best you can."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1272,The resources that I have to support me are my friends and family. They are always there for me when I need help and need advice or opinions about certain things that are going on in my life that I can not to alone. Other resources I have are professors who are there to help me on school work. Along with advisors and counselors to help guide me in the right direction. I also have my laptop/phone/ the internet as a resource to help me look up any information that I need to to help me better understand things when nobody else has the answer to them.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1274,"For this class, as well as many others, I believe we have many resources to support us and help us succeed. One main one being the professors themselves. They are able to provide the necessary information and guidance in order to pass their class. It is also extremely helpful to be able to contact the professor through email or even go to office hours if we have any questions or concerns. Another helpful resource is the internet itself. There are countless numbers of videos or websites that we are able to go to, to help further describe the information we are learning during class. Places like YouTube or Khan Academy have numerous videos and examples of concepts that we learn in not only physics but any class we take. These are some educational resources and as far as mental health resource goes, being home and with loved ones is always a good way to feel better and relieve some stress. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1267,"Resources that I have that I feel support me academically and emotionally are my academic advisor from the Guardian Scholars Program, her name is Melanie, my therapist, my emotional support animals [ cats ] Pan and Hanta and teachers' office hours. The resources that support me spiritually are my pastor, my youth group from church and well as God's word the Bible and intimately would be my boyfriend, Javier who supports me in my choices, views and opinions and gives me a sense of stability.  These are the many resources that I feel I have that support me and each support me in different aspects and meet different needs that I have in my life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1261,The resources I have to support me this year are my teachers to explain the material to me. also I can come back to the day the lecture/lab class and watch the material again if I didn't understand the material. however theres a lot of distraction with using technology and it can distracted me. but the support of my teachers and my parents telling me that I can do it if I put all the work that boost my confidence and thats what's pushing me to be better. Hopefully I can finish my class with a good grades but I need to push myself harder in order to succeed in class. we can use the resources of computers to go and look for materials that we need or always ask a classmate for support maybe they understand one portion of the material that you didn't get it. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1279,"What resources do i have to support me? It depends on the circumstances and the type of resources i need. When it comes to my education, the resources i would use are actually not readily available to me such as tutoring and individual help from my professors. When it comes to personal issues, i heavily rely on my family and close friends for support. For example, financially my parents have helped me a ton so i can focus more on my education and when it comes to emotional resources my family and friends are always available to me for emotional support."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1270,One major resource I have to support me are my friends. I make sure I surround myself with people who support me and encourage me to be my best. Another resource available to me through school and work are counselors. SFSU and my job both provide free and anonymous counselors which I think are very good resources. Another reliable resource is family. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1280,"In my everyday environment I have my Mom and friends to support me, I also have a lot of pets and they provide a lot emotional support! And I am not one to sit down and talk about my feelings, I usually have other ways of healing, I love to garden, read and write as a form of therapy. For my learning environment I go to office hours or I go to tutoring that SFSU offers. Also watching YouTube video on how to answer some questions, I like having different perspectives. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1263,"Some resources I have to support me would be my family, especially my parents mainly for financial needs. Ever since I moved back home, they have been helping me financially with groceries and a free place to stay. I have also been using Kaiser Permanente as a resource for my mental health. I have access to therapy which I have been utilizing to help with my mental health especially during these times, I have felt my mental health slowly deteriorate but with the help of therapy, I have been feeling much better. I have also been using the gym and working out as a resource to support me. It helps give my brain a mental break and also helps keep my motivation for school. Another resource I have would be all my professors have office hours to aid students in the course or answer any questions students may have about assignments, exams, or projects.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,690,There are many places can turn to when I need help academically or personally. If there I problem that can't I figure out for a class my first resource is my classmates. They are the first people I go to. If they are also struggling and can't help me I then go to my professors or tutoring. I also have other resources available to me like EOP to help me with school related thing that are not academic. I can aslo ask my sister for help because she is an admissions director at Cal state LA. In my personal life I can help from close friends and family.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1262,The tutoring sessions always helps. When I am confused about science questions I always ask my family and they always help me. Khan academy and toutube is a help as well. Also office hours would be always a help but unfortunately it is notone to one
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1268,"The resources I have to support me at the moment which I count on every time are my family and friends. I always like to refer to my friends because I know they can relate to issues I am facing at the moment and I know that they can give me their honest opinions and suggestions to any problems I am having. At the moment I feel like I rely on my family for support especially because they are the individuals that are closest to me at the moment since I’m back in my hometown. I feel like it has brought us closer because when I was away I didn’t want to call them with issues and concern them. I know that I can come to them with anything and they will always try to make me feel better every time. I know that my school has support programs as well for many areas such as counseling and psychological help, overall wellness and any tutoring help for your academics as well, which is very helpful."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1264,"I have a few resources to support me in physics. The resources I use the most are my textbook and online physics websites. These both help me a lot when I am not sure how to solve a problem and need help on how to move forward. I also go to my parents for help with physics a lot. My dad and stepmom are both engineers and can help me with any physics problems that I am really stuck on. The only issue with going to my dad for help is that he can get pretty frustrated when I can't understand what he's saying. Finally, I have Zhuowa and my physics professor that I can ask when I really need help and cannot go to my parents. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1278,"Luckily for me, I have a lot Of resources that are accessible. For starters, I have an iPad so it makes it much easier to take notes. It's easy for me to be in office hours and show my professors what I need help with. Also, SFSU offers tutoring every day. Lately, I have been going to tutoring because it helps me learn and remember alot more. It has been a significant help to all my studies. I am grateful."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,570,At the moment the only available resources I really have at the tip of my fingers is anything on google. Anything I need help on wither it be homework or advice help I head on over to google and type my answer. Things would be different if I were in school then I be able to walk in to the biology department and ask for advice to see a consular about future career goals or about my academics. And yes I know we still have access to it online but it doesn't feel the same as it did before COVID. Also another resource I have is tiktok and Instagram where I was able to find an online shadowing experience with a physician virtually. No help from school resources but from online people trying to help others when school isn't helping. Overall those are my resources at the moment.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1259,"For resources I have to support me, I'm aware that there's university support through tutoring sessions if I'm stuck on school, my professors to email and talk to, advisors, etc., but also if it's other problems (such as personal), there is mental support especially in times such as the one we are living in in this pandemic. Besides university support with my academics, and potential mental health, I have resources outside such as my sister, a doctor that I check with often, etc., so I wouldn't say that I don't have access to resources if I need them. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1265,"The resources that I have are the etext book and my lab and lecture professors. If I am having trouble with something like homework or if I can't fully understand a concept, I can also ask around with classmates or others who I know have taken the class before. I also find myself looking through lab and lecture PDFs to go over the material again. If I have time, then I will even rewatch the recordings to better understand the concepts. There are many resources around me that help me continue being successful within physics courses. When I am having trouble with something, I find myself always texting others that may know the material a little bit better than myself. They either show me through sending pictures or even on zoom sessions with a shared screen. It's really helpful to be able to see what is happening and the choices they make in solving a specific problem. Classmates and friends who have taken the course are my first choice of resource when I can't fully understand the notes myself."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1253,Some resources that I have available to me that contribute as support factors are my friends and family around me. I know that whenever I'm not in a good mental state of mind they help pull me out and make sure I don't lose focus on the goals that I set in mind. I also have professors and counselors that I can talk to about school or if I need guidance on what to do with life in terms of career goals and how to achieve them. This may not be as trustworthy as the people I describe but I would say the internet. When I don't know something I like to read more and research to get a better understanding of what the concept is and I can also learn more on how to best support myself. I also have my flatmates who live with me so they know what my daily life is like and from what they witness on the day to day basis can help with me if I have questions about schoolwork or even life. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,614,"To support me, I have a couple resources around me.I have my friends to support me in my emotional and psychological needs, and I have my family to support me in my needs that your family can help support. Involving school, I have my classmates who may go through the same things as me either with school or in their personal life, and internet resources to help me academically if I am struggling. I think youtube is pretty helpful in helping explain concepts in a more simplified way, and so are websites designated for specific subjects because sometimes they make study sheets about the topic or subject. I also have an advisor for EOP that I can ask questions with about school, my schedule, or any other details about how I am doing. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1269,"To support me, the resources I have to help me are my peers, my teacher, and most importantly the internet. I like to use youtube for extra informational details on the topic we work on in class. I like to review the slides for the lab and the zoom recordings, just in case I forget how to do certain things. I look at google websites that have information on the topic, and read through them to assist me with the ideas on that topic. I mostly watch the zoom during class time because it helps me answer all the required questions for the lab exploration"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1252,"some resources that I have around me are definitely my instructors and professors who are teaching the course, a lot of them hold office hours for us to attend for any questions or needing help to review which I think is super helpful. I do know that some courses also has study groups as an extra 1 unit so that you would join them and go over your work while working with others in that course. There is also tutoring that I know the university provides which I think is pretty cool too just in case there are materials that I would have to go over more in depth. Besides that there are a lot of peers that are going through the same course and I do know that there are usually group chats in which we can talk more about the material we are going over in class. There are still a lot of other resources but I do feel like there are already a lot that the university and that the course itself provides."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1257,"Resources that I have to support me are my parents, my grandparents, my boyfriend, and my biology school counselors. I really rely on all of these people to help support me through this tough year. I love talking to my parents and grandparents about how I feel because they somehow always find a way to motivate me and inspire me to set a well example for my younger siblings. No one in my family has ever gone to college so their support really helps me a lot! I am also really thankful for my boyfriend because he always cheers me on and reassures me that I have the support as well as drive to get my college degree. I am also really thankful for the biology counselors that help me out whenever I have questions about my schedule or future plans as well as encourage me to continue and achieve good grades."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1260,"I'm not really sure about actual resources but one of them that helps out financially is a scholarship I have. It helps pay my tuition and I am extremely grateful for that because or else I don’t know how I would have paid for school. This is my third year and I have not paid something out of my pocket. I don’t consider my mom a resource because she is my mom and is a human being but she is my number one supporter. She supports me a lot, in my new crazy ideas and in everything I want to try she is always there supporting me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1271,"Right now I find myself in a situation where I have a good support system. Currently my parents have been helping me out with my education. Other than that I have been rely on other resources to help me during the semester. I can rely on YouTube videos or explanations done online to better understand the work being taught. For my Chemistry class I also have time to attend Q/A sessions for when I am confused about certain concepts. This gives me greater access to my professor. Plus asking peers is also helpful, because possibly other can explain the material better than the professors. I also have programs like metro where I can rely on tutoring and advice when I may feel stuck on other issues. Having class on zoom does make it a bitt easier to have one on one meeting with your professors which has been helping me more prepared for the semester and I hope to continue doing that and finish strong."
