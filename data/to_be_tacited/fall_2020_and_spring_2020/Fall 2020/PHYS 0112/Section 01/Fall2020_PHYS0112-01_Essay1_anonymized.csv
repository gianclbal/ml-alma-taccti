Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1252,I am currently here because I'm trying to pursue a degree in biology. I didn't always want to pursue a degree in biology and actually started SFSU as a pre psychology major. In the future I want to pursue a career in medicine and thats why I thought it was a better idea to switch my major even though I'm already a fourth year. I started to get interested in the path of medicine ever since I've been in High School but during that time I was also interested in psychology and thought maybe the topic would be interesting to learn. Biology has also been a really interesting topic and I learned that I'm actually good in those courses even though in High School I didn't do too well in those courses. I hope to pursue medicine while also being able to go through grad school and just getting more experience before I go into medicine!
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1253,"I am here because even though its one of my prerequisites for my major degree I would like to learn more about physics and enjoy the subject. I've had a pretty bad physics class experience because I couldn't fully understand what the teachers are trying to teach. For learning physics, it's easier for me to understand the concept when I see the instructors working out physics problems and explaining how to solve it or the thought process of solving a physics problem. I understand how to do math but setting up the problem was always a challenge for me. I’d like to say I'm pretty good at biology, chemistry, and math but when I come to physics I'm completely lost and almost have no interest. This brings me here to this class, in hopes to learn something about physics that I enjoy and hopefully not dread. By taking this class I want to get more comfortable with the subject physics and not be scared or hate it since I'm going to have to take more physics classes for my major. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1254,"I am here because physics is a prerequisite for physiology and I think it's because physics can help explain some physiological mechanisms such as tension in the bones and muscles. If I learn basic physical properties and concepts here, then I can most likely use what I learned to understand physiology. In addition, I think this class will help with critical thinking and logic development, for example, if I get some number from a calculation, does that number make sense as a solution? Furthermore, this class will help me in trying to approach problems more logically so that way I don't get frustrated and stare at the problem for a long time. In other words, this class will help teach me about the process on how to get an answer and analyze not only the answer, but the same process as well, to make sure I fully understand everything. This is important because in science how I get an answer is just as important as the actual answer itself."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1255,"I am here because I need to take and pass some general classes in order to graduate. I choose this class because I am interested topic in math or physics.  Physics is a basic subject, which reveals many basic problems in our life and is very helpful to our daily life. I hope that I can easily understand what happens in life through this course, and have the ability to make correct judgments when facing problems."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1256,"I am here because I am following my dreams. I've had to overcome a lot of adversity to make it to this point, and I am so grateful to be in a place that I spent so many years dreaming of. I was a teen mom so I spent some years at community college. I've always had big dreams of becoming a doctor, but my life circumstances made it seem impossible at times. I used to be so embarrassed to share my dreams with others because they would shoot them down. However, I was able to be a mother, maintain a 4.0 GPA, become a TA and SI, and finally make it to university. Now that I am here at SF State and in this course, I feel closer than ever to my dreams. I am a Cell and Molecular Biology major with a minor in Women's Health Issues and I am planning to apply to medical schools after graduation. I am hoping to specialize in OBGYN. I really want to make a difference in women's lives and respect their concerns. I am really happy to be here today and have such an awesome lab instructor. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1257,"Aamani ThompsonPHYS 112-01 9-1-2020Reflective Journal #1     I am here because I want to become an OBGYN or a Dermatologist. In order to fulfill those steps I have chosen my major as biology and I am following the classes requirements that will get me to that degree! Physics 112 happens to be one of those requirements and I am happy that I am here as it will take part in the knowledge I will need to know in medical school. I am very  motivated as well as passionate about becoming a doctor because of the lack of attention of medical assistance my community has faced. I wish there were more doctors of color in my community because I feel that I could have related to them more as well as connected with them as in aspects of culturally, physically, mentally, and emotionally.  I want to become a doctor so that low income communities do not have to worry about receiving efficient health care. I want to support communities such as the one I grew up in through my doctorate degree because so many ethnic groups are underrepresented, medicine is needed by everyone of every race. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1258,"I’m taking this class because I am double majoring in Environmental Science and Civil Engineering. I will need to understand physics and its concepts for both of these fields. With environmental science, I will be working to understand the earth and its terrestrial components. Physics has a lot to do with why the earth works the way it does and why certain natural things happen. For engineering, I will definitely need to understand physics because that’s mostly what this major is. Civil engineering deals with the physically and naturally built environment. In the future I want to find sustainable ways to help humans live on earth without having such a detrimental effect on the environment. Building and working with the earth will use a lot of my understanding of physics."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1259,"I'm partially here because this class is for my major, but I am also motivated to learn something new. Although I'm admittedly exhausted, and the pandemic does chip away at my motivation sometimes, I have a lot of goals and things that I want to accomplish, and this class just so happens to be along the way of the goals that I want to reach!It’s a little difficult to find more things to write about since I’m tired, but I hope that things (classes, grades, health, family) go smoothly and that this semester turns out to be alright despite the numerous variables that are bound to go against us at some point. But even if that happens, the only option that we have from then on is to find ways to move forward against the roadblocks that are placed before us.But besides all of that, and being philosophical or deep things, we are here to learn!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1260,"Why am I here? I’m here because I want a better future for my family and I. I am here because I would be the first in my family to have attended and hope to graduate from college. To me this is a huge blessing and a huge opportunity that unfortunately many people don’t have.  I am here because I want to set an example to many young people who have gone through the same struggles as I did. I want to show the world that anything is possible if you are persistent and give your best in everything you do. I am here because I want a better future myself and for my future generations. I want to live the life I deserve and I don’t want my future generations to go through what I went through. Overall, I want to make an impact in my community and be seen as a role model and I am here for a better future for my family and I."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1261,"For me this class its kind of a step to get into my major but also I'm excited to learn about physics. I want to be able to relate the theories into real life. For example the force of that object or the speed of that ball I would know that I had seen that in physics. I also think that having a bit of knowledge in chem or physics its more interesting than what everyone else is doing just math. another reason its because you get to be lab coats wear googles like real scientist, and you get to experiment with variables whereas everyone else don't.Another reason because I want to be different than my family they all follow different path where they went to business and I want to be the black goat and do something more challenging or interesting to me. I feel that the physics and chem attracts me. Also this semester is kind of different and its a bit challenging since you have to be on the computer and jump into different class and find links for zoom if you don't have the class added. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1262,"I am here because I am majoring in Biology. I want to go to dental school after I get my undergrad degree. The reason I want to be a dentist is because my family is oral surgeon and when I graduate everything is going to be ready for me. Physics is a requirement that I need to take in order to graduate. Though, I am really bad with Physics, Math and chemistry. The last time I took physics was maybe 5 or 6 years ago. I was avoiding to take this class because even the name of ""Physics"" is scary for me. Overall I am bad with anything that has an equation in it and needs to be solved. I am hoping to at least pass this class and hopefully do good in it. Taking this hard class online is going to be more hard for me because I already feel scared taking this class and with everything being online, I am actually losing all of my confidence. But I am here and going to do my best to overcome my weaknesses and fears! "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1263,"I am here pursuing an undergraduate degree because I love school and I love to learn. At a very young age my parents taught me the importance of knowledge and good education. Since I am a first generation American, my parents believed that with a good education, my sister and I could have a better life and more opportunities. I chose the major Kinesiology because of my background in sports and my love for health and fitness. I also love learning about the human body and of its complex processes. I am in this class in order to fulfill a prerequisite for Physical Therapy school because that is the career I would like to go into. I wanted to pursue Physical Therapy because I love to help people and improve their quality of life through manipulating certain muscles that will relieve stress or pain. I also want to work with athletes because I love being in a sports environment because its very fast pace and my everyday would always be interesting "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1264,"I am here in this lab because I want to be an occupational therapist. In order to be an occupational therapist, I need to learn physics because kinesiology is basically just the physics of the body. I need to know how much force is required to lift your arm and what lever systems that your joints use when lifting said arm. I hope that this is easier for me to understand after I take this lab and the lecture that goes with it. I am also here because I love learning. I have always enjoyed going to school and learning new things. I want to grow in my knowledge of the world around me and physics is a big part of the world. Everything obeys the laws of physics."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,570,"The main reason I am in this class is because my major, microbiology, requires me to take this course. I took physics back in high school and if I would've gotten a better score on the AP exam then perhaps I would've been taking the second part of physics. But that was not the case so here we are taking the first part of physics and honestly I'm alright with that. I have nothing against physics when it comes to the math part but if I have to think about it or explain it conceptional then yea I have some problems. Otherwise why I am here in the school is cause this school has good opportunities in the bay area or surrounding areas with UCSF and Stanford near by if I want to do any internships or go to conferences to learn about their grad programs or attend some cool activities they would host."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1265,"I am taking physics mostly because it is a requirement to sign up for physical therapy programs, but because I also enjoy math and science. I want to be able to use physics within the kinesiology field and to determine what can be done and to which degree for patients I may have in the future. I also like to play basketball, so maybe physics might be able to help with my shots because I've been getting worse as the years go by. I hope to learn a lot this semester to prepare for PHYS 121 and 122. I'm really drawn to math and science because I don't feel like I'm very good at writing or history or anything, so this is a good place I think I can excel in."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1266,"Why am I here? Sometimes I wonder why I'm here and my mind wonders to the idea of life and death. That we'll one day be nothing and slowly decompose or go to places like ""heaven"" and ""hell"". But at this moment in my life I'm working part time and going to school not just to keep myself busy but also for my future. I don't have to be working because I don't have any bills to pay, so why am I working? I'm working so in the future when it's time to go back to in person school I have money to pay bills and such. So I'm working because I want to be. I'm in school because I want to be successful not because I have to. I want to be able to provide for my family and especially to give back to my parents. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1267,"Dear Zhuowa Wu,I am here because I am an environmental science major; as such I should be well equip with basic physics amongst other basic sciences such as chemistry. I originally enrolled in Physics 222 since I was enrolled in Physics 221. However, I did not meet the math requirements and me taking calculous along side these classes was unacceptable. After scrambling for classes I realized that Physics 111 and 112 also qualified for my major. I crashed Andrew's Phys 111 and was in lab section 10 for the past week. There I completed the first week surveys which are the same ones in your class.Andrew placed me in your class around 12am last night and thankfully I woke up early enough to read the email and come to class. So, I am here because I could not enroll in another physics class and by random chance I ended up in your class. I am very happy to be here, you seem so sweet and smart. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,690,I am here because I have always been passionate about science and I want to build my career around the STEM field.I believe the our futures are dependent on the progression of medicine and technology. This is why I am a Biology major. My goal is to get a job a biotech company. This is in order to find new and more effective medicines to help people like my mom who suffering from chronic illnesses. I am also here because I have a great support system that has helped my get to this point in my educational career. My parents immigrated to this country 30 years ago and instilled that education was the way to success. Being the youngest of 4 and all of my older sibling having college degrees has helped me get through the challenges in school and life. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1268,"I'm here to pursue my aspiration of wanting to work in the medical field. Since I was younger, I had always wanted to help other individuals. I wish to spread kindness throughout the world. I am here at school to prepare for my future, to learn, and to grow. I am grateful that I am able to be surrounded by classmates that are so passionate about their career choice and so kind in helping each other. I also like that every individual here is different and I get to know a little bit about their background.  Although I know I want to pursue a job in the medical field, I am still not sure what specialty I would like to go into. I am open to many different specialties and feel like as time goes on, I will find the right fit for me. I would also like to travel as much as I can to get exposure to places around the world."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1269,"I am here because I want to make a future for myself, I want to become a pediatric neurologist. Upon becoming one I want to receive a bachelor of science degree, then hopefully transfer to a medical school.  I really love working with children, that’s why I am becoming a pediatrician.  As for physics, I am interested in understanding the laws of motion, and how it plays a role in our everyday life.  Such as getting onto an airplane and for takeoff. Or understanding why the clock ticks a certain way with the use of batteries. This is important to learn not only because we encounter gravity and motion but to also learn why things happen.  I am here to help others in life whether that’d be through my job or outside of it. I really hope that I am able to change peoples live for the better."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1270,"I'm taking this class because I've never taken a physics class before. I am also taking this class to fill a requirement for my major. I'm a biology major, and learning about other sciences such as physics and chemistry are really beneficial. Taking this class helps me get a better and more broad view on the field I’m studying. I'm studying biology at SF State because I want to become a clinical lab scientist in the future. I chose SF State because I grew up and went to school in a small town, and I love SF and being in a city."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,614,"I am here taking this physics class so I can be prepared in what I will be studying in and beyond my major..it will prepare me for my future classes since I will need to use physics knowledge. I will be working with wildlife in my career and so I hope I can use the skills learned from this physics class to make logical decisions in conservation planning or tasks I'll need to figure out. Like how to determine the dimensions of an area in order to build some type of shelter or find out how much material I will need to put up some sort of fencing, or figure out how deep something is in a body of water. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1271,"For many of us here PHYS 111 is a required class for many biology majors, but I'm particularly interested in getting introduced to new topic. I took physics in high school, but I can't recall much of it so me being here will give me a better understanding of how physics works. I am also excited to start using math to learn physics, because it is a subject that I have begun to understand and appreciate much more. Plus I am excited to learn how physics can apply to our lives or lab assignments. Overall I am here taking a college course to obtain a degree in Microbiology and work as a Clinical Laboratory Scientist. As a first generation college student and son of immigrants I am encouraged to involve myself in all types of science to be aware of how life is all connected. This will prepare me to be successful in my upper division courses."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1272,"Destiney MonsadaProf. Zhuowa WuPhys 112.0101 September 2020Reflective Journal #1-Why am I here?	Why am I here? I am here at SFSU in order to obtain my bachelor’s of science degree in Biology with a concentration of physiology. I want to become an OB/GYN because I like learning about pregnancy, women’s health, etc. I am here taking this class because it is a requirement towards my major. On a more personal level, I believe I am here to make my parents and family proud, along with being a good example towards my younger siblings. As the oldest in my family and also the first to go to college, I am here to show my parents that their sacrifices are not going to waste. I am here to also make myself feel good and proud of myself for being able to handle multiple things at once such as commuting, school, work, and personal things. I am also here at SFSU to join a lab because I am a part of the Genentech Foundation Scholarship Program hoping to make connections and be able to go to medical school after undergrad.	"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1273,"Reflective Journal 1Hello! My name is Ianna, I was added into lab last night so this is the first session I have attended. I am taking physics because it is my last requirement before I apply to vet school. I’ve been in the vet field for about 3.5 years now as a tech and I feel that if I want to continue, it’s time to transition to vet school. I love my job but my body is starting to disagree. My back is always sore and my arms and legs are covered with bruises and scratches. It’s truly not that bad, the positives of my job far outweigh the negatives. However, I know I can’t continue to tech forever. I have never taken a physics class before, I have only taken a seminar in high school and was always a little scared to fail. I actually really have been enjoying physics."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1274,"Why am I here? I am here in this class for various reasons. One of them is the most basic reason which is to complete my major requirement. I am a biology major with an emphasis in physiology. This physics course is a requirement for me in order to achieve my degree. The second reason would be my goal to achieve my degree in biology. I hope that after the completion of my degree I will be able to move on to medical school. Medical school has always been a dream of mine since I was a little kid. I am always looking for ways to help and give back to society. The third reason why I am here is my dream to go to New York. There are tons of medical schools in New York that I have my eye on. Besides medical school, I have many other dreams and goals that I hope to achieve and I believe and hope that being in New York might bring me a bit closer to those goals. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1275,"Why Am I here? Is such a broad question but I am here because I have made it a choice to be here, there are many ways to become successful nowadays but school to me is definitely one of the best choices. Why am in Phys 112? Well I am here because my major requires this course and is the only way I am able to receive my degree. Why am I here, was a huge question that I asked myself when I was a first year at state but the question backtracks itself to a series of answers. I would question why I was here before because I didn't have a sense of belonging in this environment but I quickly put those doubts to the side and instead of doubting why I was here, I made it more of words of encouragement. Why was I here? Because I want to be successful, I want to make my parents proud and most importantly I want to reach my full potential and make myself proud. I am here at SF State because it is on the path to a future career, in order to become an anesthesiologist I must first get my degree and then go to medical school in order to be able to help people in their time of need. I have always been a helper and this will be my way of helping others, giving back to my community, all while helping myself and doing something that I love that is why I am here."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1276,"I am here because I want to learn the basics of physics for my future career. In the future, I plan to be a doctor and I will need to have a good understanding of physics in order to properly help people. I want to actually learn the material and not just retain until final then throw away. I want to train myself to hold complex info long term. Also, since I chose a major that best prepares me for medical school; Cell Biology B.S. This is a requirement in my major in addition to physics two and lab. I have taken physics in high school and I found it fun and annoying at the same time. I'm really bad at math and prone to making small math mistakes which makes problem-solving very frustrating! I really hope I will do good this semester and the next with general physics two. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1277,"The reason for why I am at San Francisco State University is to reach my goal of working in a wildlife rehabilitation or conservation center. I grew up having so many different types of pets so I grew to love animals. There were many career paths I wanted to take before this such as becoming a vet, therapist and blood splatter analyst. All very different from one another, then I thought what career would allow me to work with animals, travel and be outside. This was a career in wildlife rehabilitation or wildlife conservation. In addition, I have always enjoyed watching shows on Animal Planet such as Dog Whisper, Pitbulls & Parolees, Animal Cops, Pit Boss and ASPCA. These shows further made me realize that I wanted to pursue a career that involved helping animals of any size. My dream goal is to have an animal sanctuary or rehabilitation center of my own. I don’t care whether it is small or big, I would be grateful for either. I can imagine it, living in a home with open land for the animals to run free and having the feeling that I help improve an animals life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,547,"I am here because I really love biology. I decided to become a Biology major because of my senior year of high school. I took AP Biology and I did really well. I ended up really liking what I was learning in that class. At first, I thought that I couldn't be a Biology major because I thought I wasn't smart enough because I am not good at math and a lot of my classes involve math. However, I have really enjoyed it so far. I mean the classes are hard and I have been struggling a bit but I am only growing from here. I really feel like these classes are helping with our critical thinking. Critical thinking is very important to develop different skills for future jobs. So, overall I really appreciate these ""introductory"" classes because they are helping us grow and learn our critical thinking skills. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1278,"I am here because it is one course closer for me to get my degree. I am majoring in Biology because I want to go into the medical field. I want to pursue my career as being a Nephrologist (doctor that specializes in kidneys.) Although this class. is not. Biology and stuff. that I am used to, it is something different that will challenge me and that is honestly what makes me want to work even harder. This course actually excites me because it is not about the human body or random chemicals (I hate chemistry) it is material that I can compare and contrast to my every day life. This semester I am excited to challenge myself especially because this is the first time I am ever learning anything about physics. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1279,"Journal – Why am I here     I am a  biology and environmental science student. I am here today to take my prerequisite classes in order to graduate, I am also here to learn physics and how that knowledge can make better at what I’d like to accomplish with my agree. Extensive research and math was not something I understood why I had to be so knee deep in when I first began my years in university but I have come to realize that al these subjects (math, sciences,physics) is what I have to do in order succeed since they usually go hand-in-hand. My purpose is to just be successful in whatever it is I put my mind to and to work especially hard to see that success… very cliché answer but it is very true. I am here because this is just another obstacle that I need to get through to get one step closer to where and who I am striving to be."
