2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1271,"When life gets challenging it can be difficult to move on. Sometimes I may think about it too much, but I try to cool off when I find myself in those situations. When challenged I think that it is fine to walk aways especially when you feel overwhelmed. That gives me an opportunity to really reflect ton my situation and not let myself get engulfed by my problems. Sometimes I go distract myself my exercising, playin video games, talking with friends or sleep. One can argue that sleep can be common in people experiencing depression, but I find it relaxing to just take a break from the day. But when I have to re-approach these challenges I do my best to overcome them. I personally believe that challenges are important and anyone has the potential to overcome them. I start to plan out a schedule and develop a strategy on how to overcomes those issues."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1268,"When life gets challenging I try to take a break from everything. I feel like I need a bit of time to reflect on everything challenging in my life and think about what I can do for it to be better. I let all of the emotions out and when the time comes I talk to people who are close to me. I have my close friends who I know I can talk to about everything. I also rely on my parents for help when times get very stressful. I know that the people I surround myself with are always going to give me the best advice. I haven/t tried talking to other individuals, like therapists, but i'm willing to give it a try. I know things can get stressful, especially during this time, so having someone that dedicates their time to helping individuals would be a good idea."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1263,"When life gets challenging, I try to do something active. I really enjoy working out or spending time in nature and taking walks on the beach. I try to do things to help me feel refreshed and motivated to take on the challenges in life. I enjoy taking time for myself as well. If i am facing a difficult challenge in life, I like to meditate and try to remember all the things that I am good at, that I am grateful for, and all the past challenges that I was successfully able to overcome. I also look to my friends and family to talk about my challenges. Sometimes talking out your problems and thinking out loud allows you to come up with a plan to overcome this challenge or a solution for this challenge. I usually try to solve this problem myself and come up with plans to overcome any challenges but if all else fails and I am feeling really down about myself, I will then talk to someone close to me and ask them for help. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,690,"When life gets challenging I confide in those I trust most around me. I talk out my problems with my brother and sister, they always give me good advice. There are time when i call my friends too. When I am by myself I have to figure it out on my own. When I feel like there is a lot of pressure on me I cry sometimes too. I let myself feel whatever I have to feel. Then I let out my emotions. Usually after 15 minutes i feel better. I also hug my dog. Sometimes I feel she can sense when I am upset and she'll sit by me  and having her close to me is comforting. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1260,When life gets challenging I usually try to be alone. I want to be in my room or in my car where I know no one will be there and cry. I am a very sensitive person and I show my emotions a lot and when life gets challenging and I feel like I can’t take the burden I start to cry because It is a way I can let myself be free and cry out the pain. After I am done crying and being alone in my car or in my room I feel much better because I have let go of everything that would hurt me or would make me feel weak. Many people see crying as weak but I don’t see it that way. I see it as something strong.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,547,"When life gets challenging I try to stay as productive as possible. I like to spend my time outside of class playing video games and journaling. When I had a job before corona, I would try to pick up an extra shift because I loved being around my coworkers. I also like to go for runs because that really helps me when I'm stressed. Right now, it is hard for me to focus on school because of everything going on in the world, but at least I can still play video games, journal, and workout whenever possible. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1278,"I love this journal because I am actually going through a hard time in life right now. I took on two labs and two lectures for physics and chem. Along with my 9 other units.  I visited my mom and she is the worst (I'm just dramatic) so I have been traveling, being on zoom at the airport, finishing class in different time zones, etc. What I do in hard times is remember why I started. I chose to take on two classes so I can catch up and be on time with my major. I decided to travel during school to take advantage of this time with my family and friends. I am here in college taking extra units because I want to go into the medical field so that is what is required of me. Although sometimes I have no motivation, I think about my dad in heaven. He died due to kidney failure so I want to be a nephrologist which is a doctor that specializes in kidneys. I do it for him. I stay up late and wake up early for him. I got this (:"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1252,"When life gets challenging, I find myself reaching out to my friends and trying to slow down to figure out how to get through it. Some times I like the challenge and would want to experience it with someone else to help with getting through it. A lot of times, when it is challenging I feel like its so hard to get out of a negative mindset so that's why I try to be optimistic and try different methods of bringing positive things into light. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1253,"When life gets challenging that the hard part because you want to give up but you know the real answer is to push through and not let go of what your dreams, goals, and aspirations are. No matter how hard you want to give up, you cant, at least for me, I know that I will have to put myself through hell before coming out to see the end of the rainbow. When it does get challenging to make sure to have a great support system around you to remind you that you will make it through whatever challenges that you are facing. I remind myself that its okay to feel these emotions during this time and cry sometimes to let it all out. To always talk to someone and seek guidance if needed during a challenging time because facing this difficult time alone can be hard. I will continue to try and live my best life, look for a new opportunity, and learn from these challenging times and not let it hold me back. I will continue to learn from all my experiences whether hard or easy, good or bad, to become smarter and more well adapt to future challenges."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1276,"When life gets challenging for me and it seems like things are impossible I try to return to myself. I try to see the bigger picture and remind myself that this is only a small part of my life. My spirituality and religious beliefs really help me in this step as they help me get away from the daily grind. It is also important to realize when you are way over your head. For example, this summer I tried to take Organic chemistry during a shortened summer semester. I was studying like 5 hours every day and I still felt that I was behind. I had to take a moment and realize that it was not gonna work. I dropped the class and am taking it now and it is way better and more manageable. I think this was a very important lesson for me to learn in my academic career."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1258,"When life gets challenging I try to take a step back and do things that calm me down. I'm usually very time organized so if I have free time I'd probably go on a run or paint or do something like that that brings me peace of mind. I often don't look to seek help when times are challenging and deal with it all myself. However, this can be a flaw. I've been trying to actually speak to others and talk to people when times are challenging because the people around us are also resources and maybe someone knows how to deal with a situation better than me. Now that we are almost two months into the semester, the work load has increased and I am very busy with school. I need to remind myself to put time aside to meditate or not overly stress myself out."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1270,"When life gets challenging I try to do things that are relaxing to me (face masks, bath, doing my makeup.....). Another thing I like to do is cooking/baking. It requires focus, and its something better to focus on rather than focusing on what's stressing me out. Going on drives and blasting music is another thing that reduces stress for me. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1265,"When life gets challenging I usually resort to yelling. I don't really yell at anyone or at least I don't try to, but I would scream random noises out loud, especially when I'm alone in my car. Other times, when I'm feeling the stresses of life I'll just sit myself down and binge watch my favorite anime (One Piece) or look at memes for a few minutes just so I can laugh every once in a while. There are times where I'll play a little bit of video games, but that can also cause more harm than good depending on the type of game. One of the most affected methods for dealing with my stresses though are to just lay down with my wife and dog and just appreciate their presence and being in that moment. If it's school related, then sometimes I'll look at my progress and see just how much I've completed in the short amount of time I've been in school and have been able to raise my GPA from when I first started. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1259,"Depending on what is challenging me in life and whatever is overwhelming me, I write down a list of the things that are bothering me first. From there, I write down reassuring things next to those problems, solutions, and how I can move past it. Besides that, I spend a lot of time sitting with myself and asking myself ""Why do I feel this way?"" or ""What is a way I can reflect on this experience and move forward?"" I'm told that I am very methodical when it comes to handling my emotions to be honest! I find that being really honest with myself about how I feel and my mistakes helps me progress forward faster, but sometimes you do just need to let yourself be sad, or whatever emotion is overwhelming at that time. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1280,"In general I find life to be challenging but there is always something positive happening around me that cancels out the negative. Now when there is no positive outcomes and all it is is obstacle after obstacle, I will take a minute to accept what is happening around me. Accept to only be angry at the things I can control. And once I've come to peace with the challenges ahead of me, I will make list of what I need to do or what can be do to improve my situation. And take small steps at a healthy pace to reach my goal. Overall just get to the pint where have control over my own life again. And there is nothing interrupting my peace. It is important to me to have control over my sense of direction, I don't like it to be altered by negative surroundings. So when life gets challenging, I take it one step at a time to fix what needs fixing."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1269,"When life gets challenging, I should sit back and realize that it’s not worth to stress over anything. I like to listen to music and talk to those who I love when life gets challenging. I like to go on long walks and enjoy the nature and the weather.  When life is challenging I like to think about my goals and how long it takes to achieve them, because I know my goals will make me happy at the end of the day. I sometimes like having warm drinks such as tea, coffee or chai, because it warms my heart. I also like to see that people who have harder situations than me are always smiling or find a thing that can keep them busy off of what they’re actually struggling with. I like to watch videos about my parents home country Afghanistan or even any other country, like food travel vlogs."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1267,"When life gets challenging, I first take a step back, do nothing for a day or two and think about ways to go about the situation. Map out ways my actions could impact the situation and based on that I act. Unless the situation requires immediate action then, I try to think for the best solution. It is until the situation has passed that I process my emotions and let myself feel anger, sadness or even depression. While all is happening I try to keep doing what I have to in my life, the world does not accept excuses nor will the world make exceptions for you. There is a limit to how much people can be understanding and help you so I help myself first and do as much as I can to continue living a functional life. When life gets challenging I do like a person with a bunch of lemons, make lemonade and sell it. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1261,"I think when my life gets challenging I would look for the help and support from my family to rely on their wisdom and knowledge. I think family will help you however there are times that life becomes challenging because of family and thats when you need to have friends that will help you. If you are alone and have no one then the best thing is to cry all day because you will reflect on this and the pain you were feeling will eventually hurt less because crying helps out to release the stress. I think that if life gets really challenging when you lose everything you just dont know what to do and sometimes even family and friends ignore you even after you help them. but thats how sometimes you learn who really your friends are. I think one sample of my life getting challenge for me was when I was young had to get a surgery and not knowing whether you will survive a surgery was the most challenging part of my life and the recovery process was harder but thanks to my parents that supported me and help me every single day, gave me the strength to keep moving forward."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1274,"Life can get challenging from time to time and sometimes more than other times. There are a lot of ways people overcome these challenges that they face in their life. I also have a few things that I do when my life gets a bit challenging; whether this is a personal, professional, or educational struggle. One of the things that I do, and probably many others do as well, is to cry. It is always said to let out whatever it is that your feeling instead of keeping it bottled up. Crying allows me to fully release whatever it is that is on my mind and then allowing me to feel a bit lighter and think more clearly. If I feel the need to cry, I usually go to my room and just have that alone moment. Another thing that I do when life gets challenging, is taking a step back and try not to overstress and overthink about the issue at hand. I try to go about the issue in a different way and try to rethink ways to approach it. One last thing I do is try to clear my mind, take a breath, and remember why I am doing what it is I'm doing. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1272,"When life gets challenging, sometimes I realize that I need to take a step back and breathe and self reflect. I think about what is wrong and how can I fix it. What can I do to make it better? Usually I try to sleep and do self care things, such as face masks, hot showers, listening to music, nap, or do my makeup. I realize that when I get super stressed out it is because I over work myself and don't have enough time for myself. I work almost 40 hours a week, I am a full time student, and I commute 2 hours a day to and from work. Not to mention I was up at 2am to work at 3am and don't sleep until 10pm. When life gets challenging I usually talk to family and friends and my boyfriend to let everything out and even sometimes cry because I learned that its very unhealthy to keep things to yourself when your mental health is not good."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1254,"When life gets challenging, it's usually because I get overwhelmed with all the stuff I have to do. From long-term goals, like my career, to short-term goals, like upcoming due dates, it stresses me out when I don't have a plan on how to approach either one. But then I realize that I'm trying to manage everything at once and take 5 minutes to just step back and breathe. After I've calmed down, I collect my thoughts and start organizing it. I start by writing down due dates of homework, quizzes, and exams for every class and organize it all by what's due first then by what assignment would be the most time consuming (so that way I can manage my time better). Then I start by visualizing my career and the steps I have to take to get there, then I write down steps like ""look up 2 or 3 research programs a night"" or ""look up available resources to help me get into med school"" (since SFSU doesn't have a premed advisor). Once I have everything organized, I see now that I have a plan and my stress becomes more approachable and manageable."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,556,"Something I do when life gets challenging is either go out exploring take a while enjoying life and nature. Walking around nature tends to call me down; I always try to take everything in at night calm down because whatever I’m going through, it’s going to be over and life is going to go on in life is beautiful—another thing I do when life gets challenging. I just try to take time to myself I sometimes play my guitar or I just mostly listen to music. I spend most of my day just listening to music nowadays. It just puts me in a better mood, also making my challenging days better. I love just staring at the beach and listening to music on my own it’s a way to reflect in life and just be thankful for the good things life has to offer. I would say that in my most challenging days I will just lay in bed and listen to music and probably just take a walk."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1279,"When life gets challenging for me sometimes it’s hard to hone it in. I’m a bit in denial about because I’ve grown up so independent my whole life, I have never tried to ask for help. That was one of my biggest flaws, that it was okay to ask for help when needed. That’s what I do now when life gets too much to handle. I confide in my people like my mother, sister, boyfriend and best friend. It’s always challenging at first to be in a vulnerable place but better to be vulnerable around the people you can trust and confide in than alone."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1256,"When life gets challenging I reach out for help. Sometimes I face unique challenges that make it difficult to balance all of my responsibilities. When this happens I ask for help and try to deal with the root of the problem so that I can continue managing my responsibilities. Sometimes the issues I face are very painful and I have traumatic memories, thoughts and feelings. I cant really stop these things from happening but having a plan in place for when they do happen helps me move through the difficult times. My past traumas can sometimes interfere with my daily life. Recently I have been struggling to deal with vivid and painful memories that make it hard to focus on class and work because I cant stop crying or feeling like I am in the situation again. Trying to ask for help and having a plan in place to work on my personal problems with a professional trauma therapist and speaking with professors and my employer to find ways to complete my work helps me move through the problems and still move forward in life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,570,"When life gets challenging I think the most common thing I do is cry, scream, get mad, or just find something to calm me down it all depends on the situation that is causing my life to become tough. When I was back at SFSU I think what calmed me down then was going to the library and staying till 12 or 1am and walking back to my dorms all alone. It felt calming and relaxing being able to walk through the dark misty night and feel at peace. But now I'm home here in SoCal. So the way I relax now is by watering my plants when the sun is barely going down so its not too hot or not too cold. Watering the plants while listening to music just helps me relax and clear my mind of whatever little or big thing is bothering me or have become too challenging at that moment in time."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,614,"When life gets challenging, I talk about how it is challenging with my closest friends because they can listen to me or giving me advice. I can also cry a bit to relieve the stress that I may feel. I go on walks when I feel really overwhelmed and that helps a lot because it helps me calm down and listen to music and think about whats going on around me, which makes me feel more reflective. I also tend to eat a good amount of ice cream in times where I feel like a lot is going on in life, since its sugary and cold so it helps you feel calm, happy, and levelled. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1264,"When life gets challenging, I try to come up with a solution to whatever problems I am facing. If I am having trouble with a physics problem, I first look in my book for answers. If that doesn't help, I look on the internet for articles and videos. If all else fails, I ask my dad because he's really good at physics since he got his degree in aerospace engineering. If the challenge is having so many assignments that I feel overwhelmed, I will write down everything that I need to do for the day and break each of the assignments into smaller steps so each task feels more manageable. Then, I go through the list and get as much done as I can until  I need a break. I think that taking breaks is very important, especially when faced with challenges that stress me out. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1257,"Aamani ThompsonPHYS 112-0110-6-20Reflective Journal #2     What I like to do when I feel life is challenging is deep clean my house. Cleaning actually helps me relieve anxieties that I feel and gives me a reassurance feeling after I see everything organized and clean. Seeing a clean house while doing homework actually puts me in a calm and such a good mood. I also like to organize my school planner and make myself notes of what homework/studying to do on those particular days so I won’t overwhelm myself with too much homework on one day. I also like to go to office hours of my professors when I am struggling on a concept so that I can fully understand the material and not stress about upcoming tests and quizzes. If I feel very anxious, I know I can speak to an SF State advisor that can help me calm my anxieties and be in the right state of mind for class. "
