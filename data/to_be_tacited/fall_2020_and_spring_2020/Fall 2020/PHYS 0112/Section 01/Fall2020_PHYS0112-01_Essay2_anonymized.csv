2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1280,"My short term goals are of to pass this course with and A grade, I feel as though I am having a difficulty reaching a clear understanding of the work I have been doing in lecture. I was just added to this particular class section, so this is my first actual live zoom meeting. But I did watch the past ones and feel a lot better about the my future in the course. And long term goal is to graduate SFSU with a physiology degree. I hope this class provides useful knowledge as I further my education in my other science courses. I have honestly yet to see the correlation on physics to the medicine (which I hope to attend medical school after wards) so I'm looking forward to finding that out. And my more general goals is to absorb knowledge in this course which is kind of a no brainer, but there's a lot of times where I only store what I need for the course and then completly forget about it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1264,"My goal career-wise is to become an occupational therapist. This class is helping me because I need to learn about physics to understand how the body moves. Another goal of mine is to get good grades and keep my GPA above 3.5 so that I can get into a good occupational therapy program for my master's. This class is helping me achieve that goal because you are a very good instructor and I understand everything that you are teaching so it's easy to get a good grade in this class as long as I pay attention every week. These goals are both very important to me so it's important that I take this class seriously and really learn the material that we are covering. Luckily, looking at concepts that I learned in the lecture in this lab is very helpful because it helps me visualize the concepts in real-world settings. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1276,"My goal is to become a great doctor, specifically a surgeon. To become an amazing doctor I need to have a good foundation for undergraduate classes. Physics is an important part of this as I will need knowledge of physics in order to properly help patients; giving them the treatment they need. Physics is needed to understand how tools will impact the body as well as the inner workings of bodily systems. Everything in this work works under the laws of physics so it makes sense for a physician to have a good grasp of this in combination with knowledge of other sciences. For this class, I want to get a better understanding of concepts and how they can be applied. I want to avoid the method of ""plug and chugging"" equations. I think I remember conceptual stuff better anyway. I really hope I will be successful in my goal this year and future years. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1270,"My goal is to become a clinical lab scientist. In order to do that I need a background in other sciences such as chemistry and physics. Doing this helps me get a better understanding of the science I'm most interested in (biology). I took this class because it need it for my major, but I also find it interesting how all the different sciences connect. I've never taken a physics class before, even in high school, so it's nice to learn something I don't know anything about too."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1272,"My goals in life is to finish school, have a career in the medical field, be stable, and to have a family of my own. This class is helping achieve my goals because it is required to obtain my degree and also it brings me closer and closer to my goals. It is important that this class helps bring my closer to my goals so that my life in the future will be happy. These are my goals because I want to make my parents proud and be able to show them that their sacrifices they made for my siblings and I are worth it. Also, I want to have a good and stable job to be able to provide for myself and my future family as well as help out my parents and/or my siblings if they need any financial help."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,614,"A great goal is to learn--this class helps this goal as I am learning about a new subject I haven't seen before. But, it is a subject that involves what goes on in my physical surroundings-- so I will be able to utilize this information in the real world. Which is another goal I have where I can practice the information I learn, since it is helpful and rewarding to put to use the information you learn. Another goal is to be academically successful. Being online this semester can be difficult but there can be some ways to help mediate this.Also, I would like to just be stress free and enjoy this semester :)"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1253,"One of my goals is preparing myself for future and higher education such as going to graduate school or medical school. I understand that medical school can be very rigorous and difficult if I'm not prepared which is why I am in this class along with other science courses.  Besides learning about the actual physics of things, there are other components that physics has to offer so help me in my future life. Taking this class can also help me understand more about the natural world and even space if I decided to become more interested in physics. This class can help me see the world from a different perspective like know I have to find different whys to solve a physics problem. It can help me practice my problem-solving skills and understand that there are other ways to solve a problem rather than one correct way. I may not completely need to solve physics problems in my future day to day life, but if I'm going to be in the science field I'm sure I will be doing some sort of science-related topics, and maybe a physics problem would come up and I'd be prepared to solve it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1271,My current goals for this semester is to dedicate enough time to my classes so that I can grasp a better understanding for every subject. This is different for every class. Currently for this class I am trying to be attentive through note taking as I am writing down all the possible examples given to me. This has helped me understand the basic concepts so far. My future goals have to do with majoring in microbiology.  This class is helping me accomplish my requirements so that in the future I can takePHYS121/122. These classes will give me a better understanding of how life works around me. As a biology major I tend to focus more on the bigger picture instead on the small details for why things occur in life. Physics is probably applicable to a lot of biology so it will provide me with the necessary background knowledge to learn more complicated subjects in biology and chemistry.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1254,"My goals are to develop my critical thinking, logic development, and data analysis skills that I can use not only in this class, but in any aspect of my life and career. This class is helping me achieve all these goals because the work done here help me understand the process (and the concepts included in that process, such as algebra and physics) on how to get the answer rather than just getting the answer. For example, the challenge problems and post-lab knowledge check help me reinforce what I learned in lab for the day and the summary form make me reflect on that knowledge and lets me know if I actually did retain anything. Even though all instruction is online, I still feel like I am learning what I need to learn, in terms of physics and my goals, so I am confident that this class is helping me achieve my goals.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1258,"My goal is finish this class well prepared for the rest of my physics classes and classes that use this material. In addition, staying organized and ahead of schedule with what we are learning each week and submitting the assignments on time if not early. This class specifically has been extremely helpful with staying organized. Having a lab instructor that is organized with a set schedule and a common theme of what we do in class is very  beneficial for my study habits. Knowing that the material will be gone over in the beginning of class makes me less stressed out if I am confused on anything. In addition, having set due dates that don't keep changing around is very helpful for time organization and planning when to do my homework when I have free time. As a college student, especially one during this pandemic and the complete switch in how school works, organization and communication with professors and teachers is key to succeeding. With everything being online, I am very grateful that this class is organized and planned so I can work around other classes and my life in general to complete assignments and learn the material. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,556,My goals are to get my bachelor's degree in biology and human physiology. I didn’t plan to apply for dental school and become a dentist. I want to be able to have a stable job a job that I like a job that I want to have to wake up and be like oh my God another day. I want to have a job where I wake up and I want to be happy and enjoy what I do to make my patients happy. This class is helping me because physics is part of my major cause it’s also teaching me valuable lessons that I will also implement In my future science classes and as we go we learn new things that I will be able to connect and make use for lessons to achieve my goals in this class. I am also a person that’s into art and I recently found out that a dentist is a form of art within science which I like because it combines both of the stuff I’m learning.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1265,"My short-term goal for right now is to be able to apply for physical therapy school. To do that I'd need this class as well as a 2nd semester of general physics. This class is helping me with my short-term goal by fulfilling a prerequisite for application. My long-term goal is to become a successful physical therapist. I'm not exactly too sure how much of a role physics will play in the medical field, but it does help in engaging my mind which I'll need whether it's in PT school or as a PT. Maybe this class is helping me to understand accidents or ranges of motion a little more, but I'm really not too sure until the moment comes along where I realize I understand something a little better because I took physics. Another goal of mine is to be able to apply physics to increase performance. This can be used either as a PT or just by helping an able-bodied person improve overall. I can use physics by finding their initial statistics like saying that their average distance to kick a soccer ball is 50 m, apply an exercise for improvement, then finding their final statistics for a comparison."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1268,"My overall goal in life is to be successful and happy. I know that I would like to have a job in the medical field; however, I’m not sure what I want to specialize in. I would also like to travel the world and explore different places. This class is helping me achieve my goals by giving me the preparation and learning skills of science needed for the job in the medical field I am planning to pursue. This class is also helping me with my communicative and teamwork skills needed for the field I plan to go into. In the medical field you are working with other individuals in order to do what is best for the patient and so being on the same term with a coworker is key. You do not want to put someone's else's life in danger because you can't communicate or agree with someone else. Getting to know different people from different places is nice as well. I feel like starting these connections will help me in the future. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1274,"My goal in terms of college and education is to be able to graduate with my bachelor's degree in biology. After graduating, I hope to aim for medical school; preferably a school on the east coast. This class for me, and probably many others, is a requirement to achieve their credits for their degree. For me, this class is a requirement for my biology degree. Physics is a topic that I never really liked in high school and was somewhat difficult for me. Through this class, I am hoping to change my perspective on what physics is about and hoping to change how I feel about this topic. My goal for this class is to be able to increase my knowledge of physics and start making connections to things in my everyday life. By making connections, I believe that it makes understanding any topic, including physics, a bit easier. As well as give you more depth on the subject. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1279,"My goals for this class is to be able to retain knowledge and be able to use them in my career. My career path involves a lot of math, physics and science in order to be successful, i must be able to retain this knowledge and be able to apply them when necessary. Physics is not my favorite class, as i find it quite difficult more than any of my other subjects. But being able to follow through with it and work as hard as best to my ability to see it through."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1278,"My goal is to go into the medical field. Although I used to think I don't need physics at all, this class is showing me more and more of how much physics is used every day.  Now that it has been a couple weeks, I am excited to continue my education journey In this class because it connects to real world problems. Concepts, formulas, and equations that are taught in this class will. be used in the future so it's important I learn it now. It will help me in the medical field because if someone is in a car crash, it. is important to know. as a. doctor the speed and force of which they were hit, ALL PHYSICS. (:"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,690,"My short term goals for this semester are to become more comfortable with online learning. This will be helpful because we will be learning online for the rest of the school year.My goal for the year is  not fall behind in my courses and hopefully boost my GPA. Another goal for the next year that is not related to school is to take on a new hobby. I've been become interested in gaming so I am planning on building my own gaming PC. I feel my most important goal will be t train my dog so she can be registered as service animal. Moreover,  would also like to spend more time to myself so I can make sure I am doing well. Long term, I am not sure were my career will take me but I want to help people. This class will help me achieve these goals because it is one of the steps to keeping me on track with my academic plan. This class will also help for future class by giving me better understanding on how labs can be done online."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,547,"I have short term and long term goals for my education. My short term goals right now would be to get through the semester with all passing grades. It has been a really hard few months and I just need to keep my self going. So, for right now I need to make sure I pass all my classes. I would like to get at least two A's in my classes. Hopefully, this could be one of the classes I get an A in. In order to maintain these goals, I need to keep up with my classes. Overall, I know that if I keep up with my school work and try my hardest I can make my short term goals happen. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1261,"my goals are being able to use the skills and knowledge I learn in this class and use it in real life. I want to be able to say oh I learned that in class and I know how to use it. Taking this type of class will help me understand and use my brain in a way I haven't learn yet, I think ill will be able to think outside the box to get the answer. I think this class is fun with the material which encourages me to pay attention and learn as much as I can.I feel my goal will be accomplish and I can use this class for the future classes to have a background for what's to come as I keep studying. this can be used as the foundation of the pyramid and learning everything will help me understand what's coming. I think being able to see how the problems sometimes correlates to real life or see it like the laws of inertia how you can actually see in real life examples its really interesting "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1277,"I’m currently majoring in Biology but want to switch to a Zoology major. My current goals are to have a career in wildlife conservation or rehabilitation. I don't have a set goal on the ways to get there, I still have to do some research. But the career I want to go into doesn’t have a lot of requirements compared to other career choices. This class is a requirement for my major therefore it will help me achieve my goal of reaching the requirements. I’m not too sure how it will help me otherwise. Although physics is something used in everyday life, it can help me with things such as distance, time or temperature. Which will come handy when dealing with animals, knowing their behaviour patterns, survival tactics and physical health. But, based on doing physics problems and such I don’t think I will be doing that. Since the career I want to go into is more hands-on duties than problem solving."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1259,"I have long term goals (such as graduating college, working in a lab, going to graduate school) that I'm slowly working towards, but in terms of short term goals, I'm taking everything one step at a time! Some of my short term goals are things that I can work towards in the present moment - such as finding motivation to go to classes this semester - due to the situation we are all in, it is difficult to find motivation to do work right now. More short term goals I have are passing my classes this semester, fixing my sleep schedule, practicing more healthy habits in taking care of myself, and so on. This class is part of the way in achieving my goals for passing my classes this semester, and I hope to learn from this class! It also kind of gets my ""fix your sleep schedule"" goal out of the way as well, since it is so early in the morning! "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1252,"My end goal is to go into healthcare and become a doctor whether it be a obgyn or maybe even something to do with surgery. I've always been super interested in that field but I just started thinking more about my career so I did switch my major a bit late. This class will help me get there because it is a requirement but also this class would really help me with understanding physics a lot more. I was never really a fan of physics and always had trouble with the topic because I could never get the hang of it. I am honestly hoping that I am capable of achieving my goal and to continue schooling because I do liken being able to learn more. Since I am pursuing what I am, I feel like physics will help me a lot in just understanding science more and it will be a fun challenge to learn. I never really liked the topic only because I could never understand the calculations and it never came easy to me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1267,"When I first took this class, I enrolled because it was a requirement for my major. However, as the classes go on the concepts such as average velocity, gravitational laws and how there is force even though there is no movement, is all interesting. So now I'm invested and want to actually get to learn physics, it seems like fun. My goal at the end of this class is to see how basic or general physics applies to environmental science and how can I use it in the future. In general I enjoy learning new things and seeing how the world works in ""behind the scenes"". This class is showing me how to visualize in graphs and equations day to day movements such as an ant or a person moving towards or away from a point. I just hope I can figure out how all this applies to environmental science before someone explains to me how. So far, I am enjoying the class and is not as bad as people made it seem before, at least not yet (nervous laugh)."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1269,"I aspire to become a Pediatric Neurologist after I hit all the education requirements.  Over the years I have devoted my life in worrying about my education before anything else.  I expect to succeed in school because I devote my time to getting the right answer, instead of turning something in. I love helping people and take pride of any responsibilities given to me. This class is helping me achieve my goals by filling the requirement for my degree. And it allows me to understand physics and why motion is the way it is. My goals are to help people in life so that I can change people's lives for the better.  That is why becoming a pediatrician will help children's neurolgical struggles because I will be becoming a pediatric neurologist."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1262,"my goals for this class are to have a better understanding of physics. I was never good at physics or anything that has an equation in it. I am a junior and until now I was avoiding to take this class. First I wanted to challenge myself and face my fears. Also, physics is a requirement for dental school which I am going to apply for. I am aiming to get better at physics and change my mind about it and possibly fall in love with it. From my understandings until now, Physics is more useful in real life than other classes similar to physics like chemistry. Being in This class for the last couple of weeks made me realize how sport watches work and how how they calculate our movements and provide a graph for it. Realizing that they got these kind of datas from physics was actually prideful for me lol"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1266,"My goal is to finish school on time to become an Occupational Therapist (OT). This class is a prerequisite for the required classes that I need to take for grad school. First, I'm planning to get my Bachelor's in Kinesiology so I need to complete all the required classes I need for that major. And since OT requires at least a master's degree, I need to go to grad school. I've looked at possible graduate schools that I want to go to and most of them are in California because I don't know if I would go out of state. After getting my bachelor's degree, I need to complete at least 50 hours of volunteer work under an OT supervisor to apply to grad school. Basically this class is just one of my stepping stones to achieve my goal as an Occupational Therapist in the future. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1275,"My goals for this course is to learn more about physics although it is not necessarily part of my biology major, physics is still part of everyones everyday life and knowing more about physics would make me understand a lot of everyday things. It seems as if a lot of people go ahead and think of this course of more of an obstacle when being a bio major since it isn't directly connected, I also thought like that before but now I know this course can actually help me build my knowledge. I also believe that there are many things that physics can actually help me understand in other bio courses building upon what I learn here may benefit me in the long run. My overall goal would be to take the knowledge I gain in this course and take it with me for a lot of my future endeavors. I believe I have many goals in for not only this course but in general and I want to make sure that I achieve all my goals and I do not give up before I get there. This is my last year at state so any information I learn now would be crucial for me next year for if and when I get into medical school. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1263,"My goals for this semester are to get all A's but if I get one or two B's i'll still be okay. Given the circumstances, I still want to finish this semester strong and stay focused and motivated. Another one of my more long term goals are to get into DPT school and do really well. This class is going to help me achieve this goal because it is a prerequisite for this graduate program and I will be more towards completing the necessary requirements to be admitted. Another one of my goals, which is not about school, would be to workout at least four times a week and to meditate every day for at least ten minutes to increase my motivation and enhance my mood. I have noticed myself feeling stuck and unable to focus so I am hoping that by working out and meditating I can keep myself sane.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1256,"Being in this course is helping me achieve my goals. I want to be the first person in my family to graduate from college. My goal is to earn my Bachelor's Degree in Cell and Molecular Biology from San Francisco State University. After earning my degree I hope to apply to medical schools. I would like to become a medical doctor specializing in Obstetrics and Gynecology. I want to work with the female population and help save lives and bring new lives into the world. I also want to be able to be a doctor that makes their patients feel heard and validated. By being in this class today, I am another step closer to reaching my goals. Although I am not a physics major, I think that having an awesome instructor really helps me enjoy this class. I have a lot of fun in laboratory because working through the labs as a group guided by the instructor helps me understand the material. I've always been nervous about taking physics because I thought it would be very difficult for me to understand. I do get confused sometimes, but with the labs my confusions are normally dispelled right away when my questions are answered. Even though I always saw taking physics as being a very daunting task, it has turned out to be fun and I am grateful to be here today and to be another step closer to reaching my goals. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1257,"Aamani ThompsonPHYS 112-01 9-15-20Reflective Journal #2     My goal is to go to medical school (hopefully at UCLA or USC) and later become either a cosmetic dermatologist or an obstetrician gynecologist. This class is helping me achieve my goals because I will need to know the basic concepts of physics to pursue medical school and this class will help me understand future classes I will take in medical school. Doctors use physics everyday at work to understand their patients' health issues and what caused these problems. Physics introduces key medical concepts, like laws of pressure and volume, which are essential for cardiology and understanding the forces operating with the body. This class has also made me think about real life situations in a more mathematical way that I would have never thought of before. Physics is really important in the medical field and it is a foundation that is essential to my learning and understanding. I am excited to continue learning physics and further my knowledge in this class. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1255,"I like this course very much. I think physics is a subject close to life. From this we can understand many phenomena that we have seen but cannot explain. Like this wine Junior high school，but for various reasons I did not steady very deeply. Now I have the opportunity to start learning again, I feel very lucky. After two weeks of study , I felt relaxed and happy in this experimental class, which helped me understand a lot of problems that I had not thought about."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,1260,"My goal is to have a better understanding in physics, like an extra support so it won’t be as difficult to understand. I want to understand this subject since it is my first time taking physics since high school and I believe there is a lot I need to catch up too. This class has been helping me achieve these goals because we get to go over more physics problems as a class. As I mentioned, this is my first physics course and going over the problems is extremely helpful because I get to have an idea of the correct way and why things are like that. I find it helpful because I do it on my own then I would think I'm doing it correctly but I'm not. Instead I would be making so many mistakes without knowing and having no guidance. I want this class to be supported in that area, such as going over the problems as a class. I find visual representation very helpful and it is one of the ways I learn faster. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,1,570,"My goals are to finish undergrad and then apply to medical school in the future and continue onward towards my dream career of becoming a OBGYN or a family medicine doctor one day. But first off I gotta find some internships or shadow some doctors once corona is more controlled and we can go out and interact with people again. Secondly I also wanna volunteer at a my local clinic or hospital to get my hours in. Thirdly I wanna make connections within the science department here at school to help me stand out amongst the thousands of applicants who are also going off to med school. Fourthly I hope I can also find a lab on school, once we are allowed back on campus, that will help me expand my knowledge on topics that I also like and will benefit me in understanding the human body even more. So in conclusion this class primarily to me is a requirement not just for my major but also my prerequisites when applying to med school as well. I'm not a huge fan when it comes to physics but still we need to at least learn the basics cause it could help us down the road weather we like it or not."
