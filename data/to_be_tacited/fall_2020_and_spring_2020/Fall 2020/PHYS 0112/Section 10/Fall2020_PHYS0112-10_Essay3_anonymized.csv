2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1503,"Reflective Journaling #3When life gets challenging, my family and boyfriend provide a solid support system for me. I am definitely lucky to have people who are there for me when I’m going through a challenging time in my life. Having people in my circle to lean on and make me smile during challenging times makes a huge difference. When life gets challenging academically , I try to be as proactive as I can--despite the negative effects that stress can have. Oftentimes I can be a procrastinator, which leads to more stress. So staying proactive and trying to do anything in my power to minimize my stress is definitely a priority in challenging times. Taking care of myself and making sure to get enough sleep and eat well is also important while going through a stressful time. If I am well rested and have eaten I am much more likely to be productive and not be lazy so this is definitely a priority. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1484,"When life gets challenging, I usually try to stay realistic and know that eventually I have to get through it. If the situation is stressful I usually try to have some relaxing me time before and after the event. If the situation is going to be very time consuming, I will try to break it up if possible to make it more manageable and I try to start early to get it out the way. I complain a lot honestly, but only because I feel like life is usually challenging so it gets pretty tiresome. To cope, I try to maintain my hobbies like reading, writing, or listening to music. I also discuss my issues with my friends to relieve some tension that the stressful things bear on my mind. As much as I usually feel compelled to, I try to avoid shutting down when life gets to be a little too much. By this I mean taking a nap or just being unproductive while avoiding my issues, I try to not react this way because I know it doesn't help me grow and in the long run it will only make matters worse."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1485,"What I do when life gets challenging is to simply focus on what is important to me. I will prioritize what I want out of life, and try to pursue this in the midst of the struggles of life. I don't find it helpful to talk too much about the problems themselves, as it could lead to me excessively ruminating on them and doing my mindset a disservice. The way that I found has helped me to get through harder times is to just shut up and keep pushing. I try not to dwell on things, as I don't want to waste my time thinking about things that I may or may not be able to actually control. In the face of hardships, I try to keep pushing and focusing on my goals without being held back by negative thought patterns."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,593,I have a few things that I do when life gets challenging. When I find myself in stressful or rough situations such as involving school I try to calm myself down and I do this by doing things such as physical activities. Going outside to skateboard is always a really great stress reliever for me even if I don't have much time to do it. I also try to do things like get a good amount of sleep at night and take breaks to give my brain sometime to recuperate. Drinking tea also helps me a lot as it can relax my mind and body. Also asking other people for advice is usually very helpful. My brother is a good person to ask for advice right now especially for school since he is an engineering senior student. I know that I can also always email my teachers or look to online tutoring if I need that as well. Other online resources also help when I need help with school and these could be from sites like youtube or scholarly websites.  
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1491,"I try to cope with things by making myself busy with anything when life gets challenging. For instance, if I am really stressed or something I usually clean while listening to music since I think of cleaning as a coping mechanism, or I would try to work out and take care of myself. But mostly I like to help others when I am really down or stressing a lot, I don't like speaking about my problems so I prefer being busy with other things and then try to solve what is bothering me on my own. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1490,"What I do when life gets challenging is to try and figure out solutions to the problems I’m having. The way I see it, a problem is just a question where a solution hasn’t been found yet. When things get difficult, it’s usually when a proper way to figure out how to solve the challenges hasn’t been thought of. Other time things get difficult because it’s tedious. In those types of situations, I try and push myself to go forward and do what I can until the task is completed. A good coping method when life gets challenging is to take each day at a time. When you think too much about the future and list down every potential problem, it becomes very overwhelming. Taking things a little bit at a time is a good way to pace yourself when dealing with a challenging situation. Additionally, when things get challenging, it can sometimes motivate me to work harder when the overcoming the situation will result in me being in a better position in my life. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1495,"Facing obstacles and overcoming challenges is important in order to achieve an end goal. Having no challenges in life means you are not pushing yourself hard enough, and by pushing yourself when life gets challenging is when you see the greatest amount of progress.When life gets challenging for me, whether it's in school, in my social life relationships with friends or family, or in a competition or sport, I know I must keep trying until I feel as though I am close to my end goal. This could be understanding a math problem, a physics problem, running as fast as I can to run a mile under a specific time, or even a break up with a boyfriend or girlfriend. Life is challenging, but we must continue to put in effort and not slack off so that we see actual improvement and progress in our lives. Life has been very challenging lately for me. Considering everything going on in the world currently, such as Covid, the fires, and even midterms, stress is very high and I'm struggling to make ends meet. I know that at the end, when things start to settle down, I will see that studying so hard during this difficult time was very well worth it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1502,"When I am faced with a challenge, I try not to get too frustrated with it or filled with emotions. I think it's okay to take a break to deal with those emotions if they come, but ideally I wouldn't try to solve the problem while so emotional. I would wait until I'm calmer and have a clearer head, which makes it much easier to deal with the problem and try to brainstorm the best solution(s). I do however tend to devalue my problems by making myself think that it's not a big deal in the long run so I shouldn't worry so much about it in the moment, which has its ups and downs. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1499,"When life gets challenging, I try to focus on my goals, especially my long-term goals. Doing so better allows me to really dedicate time to work hard and keep on being a persevered individual until I really learn something. I feel that with some optimism and attention towards what is really significant during challenging times, I’ll really be motivated. I also find that listening to some good music that I enjoy really helps me prioritize, get organized, and come up with a structured plan to complete all of my assignments for a specific day for example. Thinking about how today will impact my future and all of the days that are to come hopefully after tomorrow really helps me overcome hurdles that life may throw at me and those around me. All in all, recognizing the value of today allows me to better structure my life’s foundation so I can make my “dreams come true” as they say."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1500,"When life gets challenging we all have different ways to overcome it. Whether it's taking a personal day off, sleeping extra, cooking, practicing mindfulness, etc. During this time I have encountered many challenges and I'm continually overcoming it by reminding myself that it will eventually be all right and I have to keep moving forward. I also take breaks to prevent from burning out. Since we're at the middle of the first semester of remote learning it has it downfalls but we must get up and get back in the game since this is our new 'normal' for at least this year. Positive thinking has also helped me out of motivating myself and creating new goals."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1504,"When life gets challenging I spend a lot of time talking to my family and listening to music or hanging with my friends I try not to get too deep when it's challenging I always try to find a little distraction if not make it real bad so I do things like reading fantasy books or fiction I watch too much YouTube I go out with friends or sleepover at their house I usually end up talking to my mom like 6 hours a day that way I don't have to do anything else because usually she ends up giving me a list of stuff she needs to be done I just sleep and I'll sleep for like forever. I try not to focus too much on the challenge. I know people like to really dig in to get over it, but if I focus too much I just get overwhelmed and sucked in so I just try to do a bunch of little things to keep my spirits up. That way I can push through slow and steady."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1480,"Challenges are always a part of the journey towards a certain goal or success. There are times where we get stuck towards a challenge and whenever I do get stuck, I usually try my best to brainstorm solutions or ways that I can overcome it. Trial and error also applies with these difficult challenges. I put my solutions into action, in order to see which will be the best to course of action.Although, it is disheartening and frustrating to be stuck on a challenge. However, this doesn’t stop me from moving forward, or giving up. Trying my best is a way to success, putting the hard work and effort will pave way to achieve my goal. But, it is also alright to give up, giving up does not mean we are weak, giving up sometimes means we have hold onto something long enough for us to let go. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1506,"When life gets challenging I always look to the things that calm me down or make me feel happy. First, I like to listen to music that I really love or music I can resonate to. Songs like Gettin' It by Too Short or some Steel Pulse can usually turn my mood around and get me motivated again. Music tends to be the thing I gravitate towards, I don't know if it is what the artist is saying or more of the beat and flow that makes me feel better. Or maybe it is just all of the above. Getting things done around the house that have nothing to pertain with whatever is bothering me or making life tough, this usually gets frustration out or just simplify things for a bit. Sometimes thinking back on times when I was really successful or a time in life where things were going really good. Lastly, talking to friends and family about how things are going or the challenging situation I may be in can usually help me or make me feel better. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1481,"When things get challenging in life, I normally do my best to try to take a step back and identify where the problem is. From there I would determine if it's something that is a result of my choices or things that are out of my control. I am definitely the type of person to stress over things without realizing there isn't much I can do about it. In those situations, I would not give up and look for a possible solution to the problem. I'm very independent and not the type to go to others for help, but I do have a few friends that I can go to and are a great support when things get rough. Though this is normally how I would cope when life gets challenging, during this pandemic things have gotten tougher in my life and it's been hard to turn to that process of coping. Normally when things gets challenging in my life its for a brief period of time and not such a prolonged period of time. I guess this is possibly just pushing me to find new ways of dealing with life's challenges. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1489,"When life gets challenging, what helps me the most is approaching whatever challenge it is with a positive mindset. This helps me the most as to me having a positive mindset involves multiple other things besides being optimistic in the situation. When approaching the problem, I also try to plan ahead of time how I could approach this difficult challenge by coming up with a practical and doable approach for me. Once head on with the obstacle, I try to keep a clear mind throughout as I find it helpful to just do something without thinking much, as thinking usually while doing something that I'd rather not do makes me feel lazier and and just trying to get it over with by looking at the time, what Im trying to say is thinking usually leads to me losing focus and focusing on everything else except for what I was trying so hard to do. Finally, having an optimistic but practical way of thinking helps a lot too, if I were to think, I try to think to myself positive thoughts like if I were to try my best in the next five minutes I'll get a lot done and get quicker to finishing the task and soon enough I'll be relieved and done with the activity. Having this type of attitude for me has been important throughout the semester as it has helped me push myself to study and finish the majority of my tasks given. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1496,"When life gets challenging what I really want to do is hide and just run away from the situation. I can't say I've been in a super challenging life but I have ran through some obstacles. In school especially this year I have ran through so many challenges that I really thought about just giving up. However, I have never just gave up on something I did it was never an option. When life gets challenging I may feel down for a couple of minutes but then I realize I just have to take it by pieces and do my best. I try to dissect what the problem is and take it by pieces. I then do my best at my little jobs and understand it is okay not to get 100% but as long as you give it your all. Also, coming in for the next time ready and know what I need and STAY ORGANIZED helps ALOT!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1486,"When life gets challenging, I like to think of the motto, “Hakuna Matata” from The Lion King. It means “no worries”. I find it good to have this mindset sometimes, because constantly worrying just leads to stress. Sometimes to not worry and stress out, I just step back from what I’m doing and take a break. Whether it be listening to music, getting water, or stretching. After the short break, my mind will be ready to take on the task at hand. Another good thing to do is to not let life become challenging in the first place by not procrastinating. Procrastination leads to me worrying about deadlines and due dates. Also, it piles up work, which makes things harder. This is why I always leave enough time to complete my tasks. To sum it up, to prevent my life from becoming challenging, I don’t procrastinate. And when it does get challenging, I take a short break to get a clear mind."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1482,"In regard to classes, when things get challenging during the semester, I usually take a little break from the work that I am doing and take a moment to clear my mind. I try to do things that are not related to school, workout, go on a walk or a drive and clear my mind. When I get back to the work, if I am still feeling overwhelmed, I seek support from family and friend. I also, look to support from my professors. I do become very overwhelmed in the middle of each semester because of full-time classes and full-time work. I always just need to take a step back from everything and take a moment to myself. Right now, with having to attend school virtually, I find myself struggling to find a sense of ""relaxing"" or being able to clear my mind. I have been struggling with feeling exhausted and very overwhelmed with time management. I will look at new resources available through the university. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1498,"When life gets challenging, I try to stay calm and work on whatever is required of me at a pace of my own. For example, if there’s a stressful project or midterm that I’m worried about, I try to start as early as I can in terms of researching and studying because I know that I have a bad tendency to start preparing for these things too late in time. Moreover, I try to hold myself more accountable than usual because I know that in times of stress and worry, I tend to put things off and not worry about / put time into preparing for them as much as I should. Given that we’re already two months into the semester and that we only have two months left, midterms have already occurred and there are only a few more chances left to really solidify my learning and grades for my classes. With all of that being said, its very easy for me to be stressed from knowing that alone since I haven’t really been doing my best in a class or two. I will try to remember to hold myself accountable and to keep going forward no matter what. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1494,"Life always has its own obstacles, and it's different for every person. People have always told me that things won't come easy, and as a second year college student, I am now starting to understand the hardships of life and what I have to accomplish to get to where I want to be in the future. I always have to remind myself that I am not the only one going through these difficult times and that it is okay to fail. I am one to blame myself greatly if something bad happens to me, but it is not always my fault that it happened. It's easy to find ways to avoid the challenges we have to push through, but it really isn't good in the long run because the more you avoid it, the more disappointed you'll feel with yourself. Having to challenge yourself and actually making it through, I feel that I can look back and be proud that I experienced what I did and be able to remind myself that I did what I could to move on."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1483,"When life gets challenging I like to found ways to keep myself grounded. When life gets challenging its usually because of schoolwork and stressing out over time. I like to take walks to help my mind reconnect with reality and to have some peace before returning back to work. Walking and just being outside and connecting with nature helps me stay grounded very well. It's good so I don't overwhelm my mind with too much schoolwork. Its also important to take breaks periodically so your brain doesn't fry from too much information, especially since everything is online now. Taking more breaks throughout the day help me stay on task and be able to get a lot more work done throughout the day. Much better than grinding for a couple hours and feeling too mentally exhausted to continue working the rest of the day. Other than taking breaks and walks, its also important to stay hydrated in order to properly work and be focused. Water helps immensely with your brain speed and capacity, so you are able to work more and longer."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,603,What do I do when life gets challenging I start to look at solutions for example if we have a physics problem that's a big challenge I start to look up ways to find solutions like equations knowns and unknowns and look up in the book the equations to locate the solution. When life gets challenging I either push and try to beat this challenge no matter what I will always try to beat the challenge and stay focus even on this difficult time. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1493,"When life gets challenging, First thing I do is, I try to calm down to know how I can get rid of the problems that make my life challenge. I try to make plane ahead and solution for future. Second, when I find out the problems that makes my life challenge I ask for help from people who may know how to solve my problems. I try not to be afraid to ask for help when I need it. Also I have to accept support from other when I ask for help. next to that, I try to forget the stress of how can I get As in my subject and focus of how can I learn better. that will decrease stress level in my feeling which then I can see challenge as easy pert then I can achieve and get the highest grade that I want. Train my mind to think positively it is really important when life gets challenge, and I try not to give up and work as much as I can."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1487,"Life in general can be challenging at times. Challenges can be part of everyone’s life. You either learn from these challenges to find a way to overcome them. I personally find my life challenging at this time, school in general has been challenging. I believe difficulties test the courage, patiente, perseverance, and true character of a human being. Adversity and hardships make a person strong and ready to face any challenges of life with equanimity. There is no doubt that there can be no gain without pain. Whenever I face these challenges I try my best to work on myself and believe in me to be able and push myself forward. Although it might be hard to overcome these challenges you should never give up on them because these are just lessons that will make us grow to be better and do better in life. Nobody should doubt in themselves because life in general is not perfect, we will always have our ups and downs no matter what."
