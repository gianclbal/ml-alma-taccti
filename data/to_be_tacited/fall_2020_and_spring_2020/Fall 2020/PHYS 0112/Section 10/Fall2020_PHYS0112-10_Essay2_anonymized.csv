2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1484,"My goals are to have a career at the end of the day I think, like that is my main reason for going to college. So I guess this class is helping my achieve my goals because it is a part of my academic path, it is helping me fill certain requirement in order to progress. My goal is also to be very knowledgeable in general too, being able to have some input or knowledge on a variety of things is something I value as well so even if my career does not involve physics at all, I could still engage in conversation or activities that involve physics. No one wants to be a one trick pony I think so this class is helping me be a well-rounded intellectual."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,603,My goals at the moment are to graduate from this university and being able to understand my major civil engineering in order to become a successful person. This class physics is helping me achieve this goal because in order for me to understand civil engineer I need to know about motion and forces I need to learn about physics and how it will affect the plans that I am building when I become an engineer. I need to know everything about Newtons law-like forces how a force can decide what direction it goes I need to learn about everything about physics in order to really know what a piece of engineering fits with physics. If my goal is to graduate from engineering I need to take this class in order to know what physics is before I go to physics with calculus 1. This is my goal to pass physics and to graduate as an engineer those are my goals for now in the future I will have many more like buying a house.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1483,"My goal is to graduate from San Francisco State University with a bachelors in Biology with a concentration in Physiology. This class is helping me achieve this goal mostly by filling the requirement for my major. Although, this class is also helping me by teaching me the necessary information I need in order to pursue my studies in Biology. What i am learning in this class is valuable information that I will most likely need to use in my future career and daily life I believe. I may not be using everything down to the equations but the concepts of the problems we are solving is what I will need. So far, I have really enjoyed what we have been learning and I am excited to see whats next! I find this class very easy to follow and the problems in the labs are challenging but can be figured out with the information we learned in lecture or in the lab itself."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1487,"My goal is to succeed in this class and by doing so I am willing to put all my effort to achieve this goal. I am currently enrolled in Chemistry and biology as well and let me tell you it is not easy at all but I am reading my books and reviewing notes I take during lecture. This class has helped me understand the concepts we have covered up since the beginning of the semester. Attending the lab has helped me clear up the confusion I face too when it comes to problems. Following up with class and asking my colleagues or the instructor questions about the topic will be helpful to do well in class because if we don't ask it will make our learning difficult. I believe participating in discussion is also a main key to succeed in class, since it is the opportunity to exchange thoughts between each other. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1502,"My goal is to become a clinical lab scientist, and to do that I need my 4 year microbiology degree, as well as certain classes. Physics is one of the classes that I need in order to graduate, so that's why I'm taking this class. I also haven't taken physics since 8th grade, so I think that this class will be useful in helping me learn the basics and get a general understanding of it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1494,"My main goal in this class is to achieve better understanding of general physics. Lab is supposed to be a complementary class to the lecture section of physics and since it works with more of the concepts, I am able to apply what I learned during lecture into the lab activities. So far, the labs that we have had helped me clarify a lot of questions I had during lectures, and I am able to understand the language in lab better. For some reason, I feel a lot more confident in my answers in lab than I am in my lecture. Since we are focusing more on the concepts rather than getting a visual hands-on experience to apply to concepts of physics, I am learning more about how I react to this type of learning style. It's definitely different but in the long run, I know I'll come out as a better student by being more attentive and active in comprehending the work that I'm given. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1491,"I have many goals for this class but for my main goal it is that I want to learn physics because I heard a lot about it through friends and family and to be honest they made it seem so difficult but now that I am actually taking it, they were absolutely right and especially given that it is online it made it twice as hard since it is not the same learning environmental like a classroom in person, and I love visual learning as well as hand-related which was a part of the lab that I was excited about. I also have a goal to learn physics and actually be able to teach it to someone else because that is when I will know that I have actually understood the concepts of physics. It is interesting but it is a really hard class with time and everything that is going on it is hard to keep track and stay on track with all of my classes but I feel like I do learn a few things in your lecture which helps me do my lab work later on and I also need this class for my major.   This class is helping me achieve my goal by completing a class towards my major but also something that I want to do which is trying to master physics as much as I can. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1500,My goals are to be able to understand physics and apply the skills outside of the class. Since this class is a lab I am able to visualize the many topics covered in lecture and apply it in the lab by doing the simulations and fully understanding them.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1480,"Making and setting goals gives me motivation and a push forward to my journey. One o the goals I have is to succeed and finish college and to achieve this goal, this class is one of the classes that will help me through it. Education is one of the most important value to have, unfortunately, not everyone have an access to education and learning. Thus, I am grateful that I am one of the few who has access to higher education and further my studies. Physics is a class that teach you the value and mechanism of life, physics is a daily occurrence for everyone, by just walking and doing activity, physics is applied. This class helps me understand deeply the connection and activities of our situation. Physics will also help me with my pre requisite for graduate school. This class gives me the information and knowledge I need to learn and absorb in order to achieve my goal."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1493,"What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""  My goals in this class are I want to be able to use various problem-solving strategies. I want to be able to transform physics problem to data and be able to describe it as a graph and know how to use consistent equation to solve the problem. Also, I want to relate what I learned in physics to the real live. I want to know how fast or slow thing move around me.  This class helps me achieve these goals because during the class we draw graphs, we solve problems. we use equations that I studied in the lecture.  also, when we use certain links that show the exact movement of the object such as the link for the man helped me understand better. I also, like when the professor helps us to solve the challenges questions."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1492,"My goals are to pass this class and be able to continue further with my major. This class is helping me achieve these goals by letting me able to take this class. Also, this class is helping me become more informed in the sciences so that I'm prepared for the other classes I have to take. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1486,"My goal is to get a degree in marine biology. I’ve previously attended City College of San Francisco (CCSF) and transferred to San Francisco State University (SFSU) to get the degree. This class will help me learn about physics, so I can be ready to take the upper division courses. There are many other science class prerequisites that I need to complete before I can take the classes that are related to my major. For the time being, I am getting used to SFSU and the online classes. Once I get the degree, my next goal would be to get a job related to the field. I want to be able to explore and study marine life. When this happens, I will feel content with myself. I decided to pursue this major because of a class I took in high school. During high school, I took many science classes: biology, conceptual physics, biotech, physiology, and marine biology. Since then, I’ve just found great interest in marine life and decided to go pursue this as my major."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1482,"My goals are to graduate from SFSU next Spring, 2021. This class will help me meet my graduation requirements but also help me later in my career. I am a Geograohy and Environmental Science major and I know that many of the fields in Geography and Environmental Science require the basic knowledge of Physics. The labs, in particular, will help me to understand how to organize data and use equations to find missing factors. In my Geomorphplogy and Spatial Analysis course that I am taking right now, we have reviewed how Physics is used to determine the angle needed for satellite imagery and what it means. Taking this course will help me to better understand the principles that we are learning now. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1495,"My goals are simply to stay focused in my classes and maintain organization as procrastination has been one of my weaknesses. During online learning, I've noticed that it is very easy to fall behind in class, so catching up and staying on top of assignments and lectures are extremely important. Avoiding procrastination is essential as well, as this can make one fall behind in class, and cause me to be behind. For the most part, I feel as though I have been on top of my work, however sometimes I find myself slacking off and being lazy which makes me push off the assignment until the last minute where the due date is close. This class will help me achieve these goals of staying on top of my work because the assignments are always due on the same day and same time, which makes me feel a lot more organized."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1505,One of my goals is to go to dental school after graduating from SF State and my ideal school would be UCSF which is very competitive. The past year hasn't been easy in any aspect of why life but no matter what setbacks I endure I would really like to stick to my goal of becoming a dentist. There have been many times where I have wanted to give up or change my career but this is the one thing I have wanted the most in my life so I will continue to go after it. I need this class to help complete the prerequisites in order to apply for dental school. I am still deciding between becoming a general dentist or pediatric dentist. I believe this class will also help me with problem solving skills that I will be able to use in the outside world. Last year I had a hard time passing some of my classes so for this semester my goal is to pass all my classes. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1498,"One of my goals at the moment, like I previously mentioned in the last journal, was to find out if I really want to pursue a career as a physician. From there, I’ll either look for other opportunities in healthcare (since I’d still want to help people somehow) or I’d further prepare myself by getting experience and studying for the MCAT test. This class is helping me get closer to my goal by giving me a small portion of knowledge needed overall to become a physician. I know in the end that all of the subjects I’ve learned about will stay relevant to what I’ll specifically be doing or that there will be a time in the future in which I’ll have to reference back to the knowledge from that subject. In addition, even if I don’t end up pursuing Physiology, I know that the knowledge I gain from Physics will still be relevant in almost whatever I do since Physics is the study of fundamental laws of the universe.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1497,"My goal is to become a nurse, but this course is great in helping me attain a greater understanding of the functionality of the world at greater depth. I'm learning about the science behind speed and acceleration and its honestly fun."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1481,"My goal is to not only get my degree and become an orthodontist, but also to be a knowledgeable person. This class is giving me an introduction on subject that has some practical application in the career I would like to pursue. The lecture class for this lab has a whole bunch of little assignments that I feel actually always keep me interacting with the class, so I feel like I'm becoming more familiar with the material. Also it's giving me more general knowledge and a visual on concepts that I did not know before. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1506,My goals for this class is to be as successful as I can be. I enjoy lab although I have found it a lot more challenging in these recent times because of how it is all online. I just feel like I am less drawn to certain topics because they are taught through a virtual setting rather than face to face where you can really dive into learning it. I understand though that it is more than that and I need to be able to show the same amount of dedication as I have before but it is not easy for me to transition. Especially when I feel like we as a whole can make adjustments towards getting back into the classroom sooner than later to get us back to our norm. This class is teaching me much about persaverence than I would have thought and I enjoy that in a sense. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,593,"As of now my main goals involve working on school and achieving good grades while doing this. In college, I am really trying to push myself to get good grades in my classes and this class is probably helping me to do this because it is definitely teaching me valuable skills about how to study better, how to ask questions more, and how to turn in my assignments on time. My major is environmental science and this class is requirement for my major. I also believe that this class is helping me to achieve my degree in this major by not only being a requirement but by having lots of valuable material. For example, I'm sure that physics topics such as laws of motion or equations of motion have a lot of applications to environmental science. In general, I think that taking this class is allowing me to gain more academic skills that will help with my degree and whatever I pursue after I graduate."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1485,"My long-term goals are to become a wildlife biologist or at least some kind of researcher in the biology field. This class is opening up the side of science that is physics to increase my understanding of the natural world and its processes. Physics will be helpful in future classes and I am sure that it will come into play at some point during my career. Admittedly it is hard to look at physics at face value and say it will help me in my biological career, but knowing how integral physics is to our understanding of the world, I am confident it will serve me well in my academics and career. This class is helping me to understand motion and connect formulas to real-world actions in a way that is intuitive (so far), so I am enjoying it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1499,"My goals are to continue learning and really understanding new concepts. I feel that with a better understanding, I will be able to use that to the best of my ability to broaden my knowledge and use that to help others through my future career. This class is helping me achieve these goals because it allows me to focus on how daily activities are integrated greatly in our daily activities. For example, Physics and Physics Lab allows me to know the science behind driving a car, throwing a ball, hearing a sound, walking to someplace, and so much more. This class also allows me to understand more thoroughly how science is like earth or an apple or a ball itself that one slowly takes off the layers of to see the core that shows how everything comes together through one another. I hope that I’ll be able to continue learning new topics that will be useful for me to understand the facts behind everything that we do because it’s all connected - that’s science. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1490,"My goal is to be a lab scientist. This class fulfills my goal by completing my GE requirements and my degree requirements for my major. By doing well in this class, I can get to the next semester of physics and meet all my prerequisite requirements. This will allow me to register for upper division courses that I will hopefully do well in. I see this class as a stepping stone towards my degree and then my career as a scientist. I hope that you doing well in this course I will be able to achieve my goals and have a good career that will allow me to never have to worry about being in poverty or have a career choice that I do not like. By doing well in this course, I expect it to prepare me for the upper division courses and the next semester of physics. The knowledge I gain from this class will help me achieve my goals and help me clear the requirements for other courses. While this class is a small step towards my future career and degree goals, I think it’s imperative to put in the time and effort so that I can build a strong foundation that will help me be successful for several years to come. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1496,My overall goal for my career is to end up in the medical field. I am certain this is were I want to end up but I am not certain what role exactly I hope to do. Physics overall is a subject I struggle with. I am not sure if I will need to be able to understand physics for my career goal but for my personal goal. Personally my goal is to at least understand the concept of physics. I want to at least say I understand some parts of it. It is almost as if I am facing my fear and just doing it. Physics may not be my biggest fear but an obstacle. I never though I would be learning about physics virtually but I do have to say I defiantly getting a much better understanding compared to high school physics.  
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1489,"I would say I am currently focused on my short term goals rather than long term. This class can help me with keeping up with work which is one thing I am trying to do which is especially hard when we are taking online classes. Doing work during class helps me a lot specially with understanding how to do it and further understanding the topics of physics. This class helps me stay consistent with my work as well, as it motivates me to try to get things done as fast and efficient as one can. Anyway, my goal for the semester is to be consistent with my work and attempt to turn in everything on time, as I previously explained. I also want to dedicate a few minutes each day studying and furthering my understanding of what I am learning, as I also previously stated that this class helps me with staying up with the stuff I am learning in lecture and physics in general."
