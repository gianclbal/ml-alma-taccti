Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1480,"Why am I here? I usually ask myself that question, the purpose of my existence, the decisions I make and the responsibilities I have to do. Regarding the connection of the question, I am here to learn the subject while enjoying the class as well. Learning is not an obligation nor mandatory to do, yet it is the most common thing people do. We learn everyday even without the intention to do so. Whether that is inside the class, people surrounding us, and even ourselves. Our knowledge and experiences grow each day, interacting with individuals similar and stranger to us. However, the purpose is not only limited to learning, but as well as teaching and passing down the knowledge that I have gathered through my journey. Being a human, curiosity is something to be grateful for, as I seek out  the knowledge of the question or the situation, and I pass it down to the next generation. Yet there is a limit to being curious, as one should not go deeper to something dangerous. Thus, the reason why I am here is continue my journey of learning mistakes and my experiences and pass them along the way."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1481,"On the surface level, I am here to complete my requirements for my major and graduation. Now, as to why I appreciate being here. I am the type of person that truly believes knowledge is power. I think it's really amazing when I see someone or become acquainted with someone that can have a conversation with anyone about anything. I know others might not really care about that but I think that's such an underrated characteristic to have. I strive to be knowledgeable and well-rounded so any opportunity to expand that is greatly appreciated. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1482,"I am here because I need to take the Physics as a graduation requirement for my major. Even though I have to take this class as a requirement, I have always wanted to take take a Physics course.Physica Laws are always referred to in almost every course that I have taken. I have always been intimidated by Physics, but I am excited to learn the material and finally get an understanding to the laws and methods that I have seen."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1483,"""Why am I here?""I am here, taking this Physics course to further my knowledge of science and be able to graduate with bachelors in Biology. Yes, this class is required for me to take as apart of my major but I am also excited to see what I will learn. I have yet to take a physics class and I am ready to accept the challenge. Science in general has always been easier for me than history, english, or even math. I think it is because I have a knack for problem solving and find science extremely interesting. Every subject within science that I have taken so far(bio, genetics, chemistry), I found very fun and interesting so I am excited about this physics class!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,603,Why am I here?I am here because I don’t know anything about physics instead of taking physics with calculus 1. I am taking this class because I haven’t passed calculus 1 is one of the reasons and I took physics in high school but it was a long time ago soI need this class in order to refresh my memory about topics that I have forgotten. I also took this class because I needed 12 units for this semester and I need to pass calculus 1 in order to get more of my major classes of engineering so that is one of the major reasons why I am here. I really need to understand more about physics in order to become successful civil engineering that is my last reason to stay in this class I could’ve left and go take another class but I decided to stay in order to learn more about physics.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1484,"I mean like ????? How does anyone ever know for sure? Isn't the purpose of life, just to live it? I feel like purpose could change during different stages of live. Right now, I am here to grow. I am here to learn not just academically but in all aspects of my life. I am learning about myself and my values, priorities, dreams, strengths, and weaknesses and taking all that info and experience to grow from it and do better. I am here to benefit others, not in a self-sacrificing way, just in the way that everyone has some affect on others and things around them. There have been people who did not have the best intentions that still have influenced my life enough to make me want to progress or make me realize that there is cause for change. I hope my existence affects others in a good way. I strive for that. I am here to get where ever I feel like going. Right now, I feel that place is a spacious apartment where I have a dog and a career somewhere with four seasons and lots of greenery and I am happy and stable and healthy. I am here to see things through I guess. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1485,"I am in a physics class because I need to take one to get a biology degree, and to achieve my career goals of becoming a wildlife biologist (but still open to other opportunities). I am here because I am in my second year of college, now meeting the math requirements in order to take this class. One could say I am here now because I have not done the requirements needed before freshman year, namely pre-calculus. If I had done pre-calculus in high school, which was an option for me, I would have been able to take this physics class sooner. Otherwise, I could have actually skipped this class if I had taken the AP test for AP physics, as I took this class in junior year of high school."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1486,"Why am I here? Well, I would say it’s mainly because this is a prerequisite for my classes. This is one of the many lower division courses I need to take before I can start to take the upper division courses for my marine biology major. On the way towards getting a major, I get to take this physics class which will help me to understand the laws that govern the universe. My only experience of physics is from high school, so I’m ready to learn more on the concepts of physics. Speaking of school, I feel that I’m here to learn as much as I can so I can get a major and hopefully find a job. With a marine biology major, I want to be able to study marine life. But that is the future, for now I need to focus on the present and study well so that I am ready. This is why I am here."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1487,"Reflective Journaling #1      I am currently a junior in college, this is my third year attending SFSU. I am looking forward to learning new concepts regarding physics. I remember taking physics back in high school but I don't remember as much about the class. I am excited to start this semester and overcome my challenges I face in this class. I am here taking a physics class to learn how the world works because many of us don't realize that physics is all around the universe. Physics gives us powerful tools to help us to express our creativity, to see the world in new ways and then to change it. I personally agree that physics is important to consider in each of our lives, this is why I am here taking this course even though it is a requirement for my major I am still interested in applying these new concepts I will learn throughout the semester."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1488,"I am here because I wanted to expand my knowledge of physics after already taking a physics class in a pervious semester. I think is class will go hand and hand with my math class because so far we're learning about vectors. My interest is pretty okay with science of how things work around me to an intend. I don't normally get the chance to go into depth with or look into certain things that I may learn from this class. I may or may not change major but I just wanted to keep my options to different subjects in the are of science. Another reason is to fill the minimum units for the semester because other classes were full or didn't enroll in them. I feel pretty rusty about my skills in physics due to haven't taken one in a year but as the semester goes on, I think I'll be fine. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1489,"I am here because I want to be. It’s specially difficult to affirm oneself during this period we are experiencing because of the whole virus situation, but the one thing that I have learned from learning in this new format is how important resilience is. Learning in this new format is difficult as to me personally, and I think a lot of people agree with this, which is that having that in person experience and hands on experience with learning is needed to further improve your own learning. Resilience has stuck out to me especially with the way people are approaching this new learning format, especially the professors. I don’t know if it’s only here in the bay area that we just have really good experiences when it comes to learning with the american education system, but I know I am grateful with the opportunities the professors are able to offer during this hard period. Seeing the resilience of others motivates me to keep doing what I am doing, and in doing so I learned how important it is to approach any situation with some type of optimism. To sum this up, I want to reaffirm myself and say I am here because I want to be."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1490,"I am here because this class fulfills a major requirement. I’m a microbiology major and this major requires two semesters of physics, with this class and its lab section in particular being part of it. I’m also here because I fulfilled the prerequisites for this course by completing pre-calculus last semester. Aside from that, I am also here to further my education not just to get my degree but to also help me better my understand of the world. Physics in particular seems like a great way to conceptualize the world and understand how different types of motions respond to one another. I also show up regularly to this class and my other classes because I want to get a good grade and have a transcript that employers would consider. In getting a good grade and being here regularly, this increases my chances of doing well and being successful in the real world by developing good work ethic and study habits. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1491,"I am in this class because I need it as a pre-req for my major. I am a biology major; I am also here because I am also interested in learning about physics. I heard many things about physics and the most thing I heard was that it is very hard and complex. I like doing lab work so I was really excited to be in a physics lab but unfortunately, we cannot because of our states current battle with COVID and the fires as well. I am fascinated by how physics works in the world, so I am also taking this course for my major and my own interest. I hope to learn many things from you and convert everything that I do learn into my every day life.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1492,"The reason why I’m here is because I need to take this class in order for me to continue with my other requirements for my major. I’m also here because I love the sciences. I think that they’re really important to know and how stuff works. Another reason why I’m here is because If I don’t take this classes, I’m not going to be able to move and do other classes that my major requires. Also, another reason I’m here is because I didn’t take this class last semester which I was supposed to take it last semester, but I didn’t."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1493,"Hello, this is Rim Hussein Alazzani. Why I am here? I am taking this class because it is one of the prerequisites for my major as well as introduction physics two. My major is microbiology.   For the other reason, I am interested to learn physics. Because physics one of the subjects that help us know what happen around us. by physics we can figure out some concepts for example, after taking this class we will know how to calculate the vectors, acceleration, force, wight and sound and many other concepts?  This is my first physics class I am looking forward to learn and enjoy discovering many new ways to solve problems. I knew physics one of the hardest subjects, but I will push my self as much as I can to get better understanding of the material, we will study in the class. I am sending this assignment late because I am still confusing of the due dates, I am trying to adopt with new learning style. I hope that you will accept it    "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1494,"I chose to take this course because it goes along with my physics lecture this semester and it meets my prerequisite requirement for my major. Physics is a completely new topic for me as I have never taken classes related to this. I’ve always wondered what the concept of physics is, so I hope to learn many new things this year. Aside from that, I love the lab environment and working through experiments. It was unfortunate that Covid hit and we can’t be on campus to do so, but I am still grateful that professors have made the effort to change the curriculum to fit the online learning. The labs are going to be more focused on the concepts rather than focusing on the visuals of the experiment, and I’m looking forward to what is has to offer. I’m happy that I get a chance to learn things in a new way, and that goes for all the courses I’m taking this semester. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1495,"I am here, participating in the General Physics Laboratory 112-10 because it is a pre-requisite requirement for my major. I must take physics for Kinesiology, as it is mentioned on the roadmap, and I might need to take another semester of physics to fulfill a years worth of physics as it is needed for most physical therapy schools. I am also enrolled in this course to expand my knowledge in physics since I've never taken it before(not in high school). It seems very relevant to many real life problems and basically explains why everything moves or how it works, which I didn't realize before."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1496,The reason I am here is because it is a part of my major requirements. To be honest physics is a science I struggle with the most and maybe taking this course will help me get a better understanding of what physics is and how you can see physics in your daily life. I hope I am here to get a better understanding and not just stress myself out even more.  
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1497,"I am here because I am waiting on responses from nursing schools. I am at home because there’s a fire, pandemic, race war, and smoke in the air. I am here because I need to complete the class in order to graduate as a general biology major. I am not too sure what I am doing in terms of life stuff. It feels kind of crazy that we’re all just trapped at home and there’s nothing really that we can do to change our reality other than doing simply nothing. It is sad and I think being at home makes me sad. I wish we could go outside I really miss going outdoors with my friends and I miss traveling and I spent my 21st birthday indoors. There isn’t much to say other than the fact that I wish life were kind of different and I am sure that many others feel the same way."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1498,"“Why am I here?” There are multiple reasons as to why I am “here,” and I can’t just say one while disregarding the others. Of course, an important reason as to why I am here is because of everything my parents have done for me - from all the guidance, sacrifices, affection, time, and so on that they’ve given me till now. The same could be said for everyone else who has contributed to me, whether it was for my emotional health / well being, physical health, a good laugh, time that was specifically for me, food, etc. But I think the main important reason as to why I am here is to not only make the troubles and contributions that were done for my sake to not be wasted, but to really find out if the path that I’m set on now is my purpose. Also, my purpose is not consisting of one single thing / goal, but it’s more of a set of things. One of these goals is being in a career I enjoy. Anyways, the path I’m referring to is basically the roadmap of the career I’m currently interested in, which is being a physician in emergency medicine; in other words, I’m unsure if I should pursue this career due to financial reasons and time. I know that I want a career in which I’ll help people, but I’m still not completely sure if this is how I want to go about it. In any case, I intend to keep moving forward in this path and to make any necessary changes as the situation seems fit."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1499,"I feel that I am here to really learn. I don’t mean just know how to use a concept or memorize it, but I actually mean fully understanding the material being taught to me. With learning new things, and putting them into practice during assignments, I feel that I will be able to use what I have learned to give back to my community. I would like to dedicate my time and effort to the best of my ability to broaden my knowledge of Physics. I want to dig deeper to gain a better understanding of how Physics appears in almost all activities of our daily lives. To me, Physics is also fascinating because it not only explains the structure of how objects function, but it really also explains things like how the double helix is a double helix and why another structure doesn’t exist for DNA, how light is reflected and what kinds of visible light are truly seen by the human eye, and so much more. Overall, why I’m here is not only to fulfill a requirement but truly to broaden my knowledge of Physics and how it connects with the world in so many different aspects."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1500,"I am here because not only is this class a prerequisite for my upper division classes for my major but also because I always wanted to learn the fundamental concepts of physics. All forms of science such as chemistry, biology, and physics occur around us during our day to day lives but we seem to ignore it. After taking this course I want to be able to go about my daily live and point out the physics aspect and to be able to understand it correctly. Another reason I am here is to develop critical thinking and problem solving skills used when solving a problem.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,593,"The reason why I am here in this Physics 111 lab is technically because this class is a requirement for my major, environmental science. So, in this case, there must be very valuable concepts in physics that apply to environmental science. I assume that rates of change, what we are looking at right now, can probably be very helpful for me to understand the field I am studying. But, besides just having to be here because of my major, I am still choosing to be here. I chose to go to college and I plan to use my time going to school as wisely as possible. I want to be able to understand the concepts of my specific study very well and I want to pull out of physics whatever will help me best to do this. I also believe that I am here to learn skills that are helpful to my life in general. As we discussed in our first lecture and the first chapter of our textbook, physics helps us to understand the work around us, so taking this class will definitely bring me some skills that will help me understand things in my day to day life. I am also sure that this class will be able to help with my other classes in the future. For example, so far we have been looking at unit conversions, rates of change, dimensional consistencies, and such and I am sure that this will help me in classes such as in the sciences and math that I will have to take in the future. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1501,"Jennyfer Vasquez Physics 112Sept 2, 2020                                                                 Why am I here ?This is actually a really really good question, Currently I am doing zoom meeting and class schedules from outta town, And its a bit hard todo so with not so great internet. It deffenitly  keeps my brain working by asking myself and thinking for the real true reason why one must be in any class. (31) I Have taken the lecture class Physics 111 the semester before summer classes. I managed to do well but was never accepted back into a lab section because classes were way too full each semester. This course along with other are actually really important for me I take, This class is a designated class for my specific major. I am here to fulfill my degree requirements but I am also here to learn how and why certain things work I am eager to learn even though physics is not my strongest object.   "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1502,"In general, there's nothing I can change or do about the fact that I was born, so I guess everyone's purpose would be to make the most out of their lives. More specifically, I am here learning from SFSU because I am striving to graduate with a degree in microbiology, so that I can pursue the career path I want: clinical lab scientist. Microbiology covers all of the CLS class requirements, and physics is a requirement for the microbiology degree. I also haven't learned any physics since 8th grade and didn't have a great teacher then, and since science is my favorite subject to study and math coming in second, I look forward to learning more about the branch of science that I know the least about. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1503,"""Why am I here?""I am here because this class is a necessary step in the degree and ultimately career path that I want. I am interested in physics, however I don’t know if this is a class I would take if it is not a prerequisite. However, I think understanding physics is integral in understanding biology so I’m glad I’m learning this information. More broadly, I am here because I’m excited to get an education. I’m grateful to be going to such a good university with such caring professors. This class is going to give me a more broad understanding of science. A lot of scientific subjects are based on physics, because the laws in physics can be applied to almost any scenario. I think I will be a more competent and knowledgeable biologist with a solid understanding of physics. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1504,"If I had to guess why I'm here it would be because my mom needed me to be here. A lot of people, they ask for I don't know something from whatever higher power that they believe in. They want a gift or a blessing or just help and I think for my family and specifically, my mom that is me. I don't think she might have known it at the time when she had me, but I've been the most consistently there for her as long as I could be, I think that's why I'm here to make sure that she has everything that she needs and so she always has someone on her side. And now, as my mom gets older I look after my sister who really needs me maybe I'm just here to look out for her the whole time."
