2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1489,"The resources that I have to support me are multiple ones. First off, I have my classmates which could be helpful during and outside of class by helping each other understand difficult concepts. I also have the professor as a resource to support in class, like during class if my classmates and I don't understand we can ask the professor for help, or outside of class during the professor's office hours, we can make an appointment or show up and ask a quick question or help on understanding a concept. Something else that's a reliable resource can be the resources the internet presents, as in explanations on youtube or using sites like khan academy that could help you with your understanding by giving resources like tutorials and practice problems. Another resource could also be our own notes and/or a textbook if one was given by the class."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1483,"At San Francisco State University alone, they offer so many options and helpful resources to help their students succeed. The SCI supplemental classes they offer amazing and one of the best resources to utilize. The SCI courses help students taking challenging STEM classes by offering assistance and practicing problems to make sure everyone understands the concepts so they can succeed in the actual course. This Physics class itself also offers great resources such as the community resource links, lectures, and being able to email the teacher. There are resources all around for us to use.  I personally love the SCI courses and think they are the best resource we can get our hands on as STEM major students. They offer so much help and even boost your GPA since it’s one unit grade primarily relies on attendance. Emailing teachers is probably the second best resource because they are always willing to help and want their students to ask questions."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,593,"I have many available resources to support me. Oftentimes in school, there are certain things I need help with. Sometimes it is with homework or also with college logistics. I know that SFSU can help out a lot with providing me help with these things. There are many tutoring programs such as with the learning assistance center or with the metro academic resource center. I can also get help from many advisors at school when I need it. Having some peers to asks questions is also helpful. I often text the class group chats that I am in when I need help with homework or have some questions about a class. I also have a lot of support at home, especially when I need help with physics. My brother and roommate are both senior year engineering students and have taken many classes involving physics. So, I often ask them questions when I am having trouble with some certain physics problem and they also provide lots of help when I just have general questions about college. Lastly, I also have my teachers to give me support. All of my teachers are very helpful and willing to give their students advice and assistance. So, I know that if I have questions about my classes, my teachers an only an email away!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1498,"As a student at San Francisco State University, there are a variety of resources that are at my disposal. A few common, important, and frequently used resources are the ones that are included on the syllabi of every student’s classes - including The Disability Programs and Resource Center (DPRC), The SAFE Place, Counseling and Psychological Services Center, the school library (which offers borrowed laptops for free), SF Suicide Prevention, Advising Resource Center (ARC), and so much more. In addition, I am confident that I can rely on each one of my teachers for additional help outside of class time because they’ve all made it clear that they’re here to help me out to the best of their abilities, especially with everything going on outside of the classroom right now. Two resources that I’ve recently used are the library and the Biology Undergrad Advising. The library has provided me with a free loaner laptop which I don’t have to return till December. The Biology Undergrad Advising helped me organize my thoughts and what my path for my major should ideally be. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1500,"Since everything is remote there is a lot of individual learning so to help me with this the resources I rely on are lecture notes and lecture slides to help me guide through labs as well as the internet, now it's not ideal write everything down word for word off the internet but it's there to help you understand the concept better. If I need a video to help me out on a problem or if I'm lost during lecture watching youtube videos related to the concept give a visualization of what it should be like it helps me understand physics better."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,603,The resources I have to support me are a lot of things I have my professors who can help me with a question I ask them through email if I can't make it into their office hours but most of the time I do make it in their office hours. I also have EOP they can help me with tutoring they are a big help for my math classes and so far I didn't ask for tutoring this semester because to me this seems fairly easy to do. I do have other resources for my mental health like my family who at the moment are here because of COVID-19 and I have friends I can call and message through my phone. Other resources that are given us through the class like break out rooms when we do our labs some of the rooms we use a lot of communication we talk a lot about the problems making it look like if we were at class at SFSU I like asking questions in breakout rooms especially if people are not shy to respond or ask themselves. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1492,"The sources I have to support me are the internet, family. But mostly the internet since my family does not know much of what I'm studying they offer emotional support. I say the internet because one google search can really help me understand problems that I find confusing. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1493,"What resources do I have to support me?  I have Mastering physics book which helps me figuring out some concept in physics. By reading this book I can get general ideas about the materials which I study.  Also, I have class journal in each week through the semester. In physic lab, we supposed to do exploration and learn one chapter from the book, lab exploration gives me better understanding of the physics. During lab exploration we learn physics concept and we relate physic concept to the world around us. On the other hand, I have Pearson mastering physics account, it is website which helps students solve physics problems and providing us the correct answers if we cannot solve the problems.  Next to that, I always search in google and in different website about physics vocabulary to learn the definition and to get better explanation in different concept that is not clear for me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1499,"I believe that the resources that I have that support me are many things, from tangible objects to people. All of my Professors, and other staff members in the advising center at SFSU have been bery kind, helpful, and understanding. Other resources that suppor me throughout my educational journey are my stationary materials such as pencils, paper, printer, laptop, and etc. because they allow me to study, take notes, and complete research about new topics we’re learning in classes. I’m also very appreciative for all of the great people in my life because they are resources that can guide me and tell me about their experiences, helping me make better choices along the way. But I think that my parents support me most of all in everything, from providing me with the necessary materials that I need for my classes to motivating me and helping me everyday so I can become a wiser person."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1484,"I have lots of resources at my disposal, I have the schools resources and my friends to support me. While I am not entirely sure of all the things the school offers for students, I know there is probably something for any issue I might have. Also, my friends are always willing to help or find help for me if I were to ever ask and the same goes for my family. I know my teachers are here for my support as well and that they offer ways to improve my understanding in class like office hours or supplemental courses. Basically, I am aware that there is help out there and it is just a matter of finding it is all."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1485,"In my life, I've got some important people that can support me. My father can support me financially, but he lives a few cities over, so sometimes it can be a long time that we don't see each other in person. My brothers are and always have been there for me if I need it, and are usually very understanding, especially since we've grown up with similar hardships. My girlfriend is a huge source of support for me, and I'm always reminded of this fact, it's pretty comforting. Otherwise, the only other support resources I can think of are the school resources, as I believe there are a few mental health programs offered, as well as financial aid coming from the school."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1486,"Financially speaking, I would say I have my family to support me during these times. I’m very grateful for that. I also have financial aid, which allows me to have my own money to spend. When it comes to emotional support, I have my friends and family. Right now during quarantine, I connect with my friends through video games. Since we can’t hang out face-to-face, this is the best way for us to stay in contact. 	Educational resources I have are my professors, classmates, and the university itself. If I have any questions, I can always talk to my professors during office hours if need be or by email. The students here help each other out if possible. There are also many staffs here at San Francisco State that I can contact if I go on the school’s homepage. I know that I have plenty of resources available to help me and I’m grateful for it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1496,Resources and having someone to walk you through is very useful when you don't understand something. Having someone who may be able to explain something to you in a different form might help you understand better. Personally I do not have many people around me who understand physics so I do have to rely on other resources. One of the resources I do use is YouTube. Most of the time there are other professors on their who can help me walk through a problem. Another resource I use ALOT is simply the internet. When I have a problem that I just don't understand I turn to google and try to see if I can find something to help. Most of the times I find something very similar but slightly different. This helps because they explain how they got the answer and I can then use the step for my own problems. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1495,"I have many resources that have made me feel much more comfortable with online classes. Many of my professors have accommodated their syllabus and work load to better suit the students, considering everything going on in the world at the moment. I'm very grateful for all the given resources, such as office hours, few professors have extended homework assignments, are very helpful for exam review, and reply to emails very fast. Although going to office hours is not the same as face to face office hours, professors are being extremely helpful and taking time out of their own days outside of school to make sure we are understanding the content. Going into the semester knowing that all of my classes were online was intimidating, but it's nice to know that my professors are going out of their way to ensure that their students are comfortable and doing okay with everything going on. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1491,"the types of resources I have to help me I believe are mostly myself, but other than that I have my professors as resources to elaborate with me any misunderstandings I have. I also have the internet when I am confused or stuck on something that I previously did not understand or if I don't know a term and would like to understand the term and how it is used in the physics problems. I also have some classmates to refer to. other resources I could think of are my lecture professor for physics and of course, my lab professor would be the first to email since it is for her class. there are also other forms of resources like the book that is provided in my lecture class. Overall I think these are the resources that I could think of or I could use based on what I need and I think that these resources are more than enough to help me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1502,"I know that if I am struggling to understand the material in a course, I have a lot of resources there for me. If I am confused about a certain topic, I could try to search for the answer online, or look at the office hours for the class and set an appointment with the professor to ask my questions. There is also usually enough time at the end of the class to ask questions. I could also try to connect with my peers during the breakout rooms and perhaps form a study group with them. I could have also joined a SCI class for tutoring help. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1503,"My family and loved ones are the most major resources I can think of that I have to support me. When I’m going through a difficult time; whether it be related to school or not, my support system is there. WIth covid, I haven’t been able to see a lot of my friends who are a big part of my support system. However, I’m still able to see those closest to me (my boyfriend, dad, brother, and grandma)  who provide the most support.  More specifically in regards to school; the primary resource I have while covid and online learning is teachers' office hours and one-on-one conversations I can have with my professors that way. Online learning can be really difficult and oftentimes frustrating; but recognizing and utilizing the support I do have has been crucial in me succeeding in my classes this semester. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1497,"I have my professor :D I have online resources like Google and professors also have office hours. I can't really use my classmates because most of them are lost too. There are many websites available to me that I can use to look up physics topics and its easier with physics because math will always be consistent regardless of region so I will be able to get assistance from a wide range of resources. In terms of other resources excluding physics based things, I have my friends to support myself emotionally. I have parents that support me financially. I have a lot of resources in terms of sustenance like food so I am very lucky. Some resources to fight boredom are stuff like books, youtube, and other recreational activities! I'm really losing my marbles though because I can't access the resources I used to be able to like the gym to fend off weight gain and stress. I miss playing on a volleyball team and stuff too :c"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1504,"I guess the resources I have to support me are my peers and my notes as well as the online videos. I have a tutor that helps me as well sometimes, but they are not always available I wish I was able to go to office hours, but I always have a class or work to do at that time. My best resource is asking questions, but sometimes I feel like I ask too many because everyone is getting the assignment except for me. I do enjoy working in the breakout rooms even if it is awkward usually we can help each other get the work done before class is over. Also watching the lecture videos help the personal ones you do more than the pre-recorded lectures on youtube from that guy. I use the book sometimes to look up equations sometimes to help with the challenge question if we don't go over it as a class. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1487,"After taking physics for 3 months now, I have learned that Physics is everywhere and can be apply in our daily life. I am currently enroll in SCI 111 this class has helped me since the time I decided to enroll. I found physics challenging because it was my first time taking physics from a long time, the last time I took physics was in High school which was just the basics. I believe I have learned more than what I expected. However, the class that I enrolled for has been extremely helpful. This resource has helped me understand the concepts that I had found confusing to understand. I really like how this class is well organized and follows up with the lectures without making is confusing for us. I strongly agree that being enroll in the class will help us succeed in physics since we have that support to clarify miss understanding of the class. I will totally consider to enroll for other science classes for next semester because I found this resource necessary especially if you are struggling with any science class. I will highly recommend this to any of my colleagues to try out."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,10,1482,There are many resources that I have at home to support me for this class. I have made conections with classmates in the class and we are able to discuss the lectures with each other. I also have a hard copy of the textbook which helps me find information quickly. Being able to use Khan Academy as well to teach me how to approach problems when I do not understand them. I have also been using the tools on Pearson to support my learning. I have also used class time to talk to my professor with concepts or theories that I do not understand. Due to my work schedule and class schedule I have been unable to attend the office hours but I have emailed my professor and she has been very helpful and supportive.
