2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,47,"My primary goal is be pass this course. I want to learn how physics work in different ways. My goal is to be able to see how physics applies to a lot of things we see or experience on a daily basis. I want to be able to explain why things work the way that they do. My goal is to learn what I did not learn back in high school when I took my first physics class. My goal is to pass, but I want it to actually make sense to me instead of just hanging at the very verge of the cliff. My goal is to actually take something from this course even though there may be a lot of difficulties because of the virtual learning. My goal is to not fall behind throughout the semester. My goal is to actually feel like I can get a lab procedure/ assignment done without feeling like I can't do it. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,44,"My end goal when I finish SFSU is I want to graduate with my degree in Marine Biology. I want to work with animals at a rescue and rehab hospital. I think in the end I want to work with sea turtles, but I am always changing my mind, so I am not fully sure yet. This class is helping me get to my final goal because completing this class will allow me to move on to the higher courses, I must take to be able to achieve my degree in Marine Biology. Another goal I have is I would like to travel and if I get my degree in Marine Biology there are a lot of places I could travel to to work in this field. This class is helping me take a step towards my degree.     Another goal I have that is not related to getting my Marine Biology degree is I want to start a dog rescue and help rehome dogs. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,48,"There's too many goals that I have to take the time to type them all out, but one of my main goals is to get into medical school. The way this class is going to help me achieve my goals would be by expanding the way I think and go on about solving a problem. I don't think much of us notice how involved physics is into our everyday lives, and so far we've managed to see how much it ties back to physics. I am a first generation, so I have no absolute idea what to expect in medical school. All I know is that there is a lot of competition involved, I believe thinking ahead and beyond the actual problem would really be an advantage to me in medical school. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,42,"My goal is to graduate with a Biochemistry Degree; I want to become an OBGYN. This class is helping me to fulfill the pre-requisites of my upper-division courses; in other words, the class opens doors to take higher courses. so I can become an OBGYN and this class is helping to introduce the basics of the material that I will be learning throughout the journey. This class is also helping me in my Physics 11 class because it refreshes my mind or goes in more depth in the material we learn throughout the week since the lectures are a little blur for me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,49,My goal is to go to medical school and become a doctor. I have to finish school at San Francisco state and be able to graduate on time. one of the classes I have to take before I graduate is physics 1 and 2. This is also my last lower division to get through. After this class and physics 2 I can focus on taking upper division biology classes. I also have to do the respective labs so this is why this class is helping me achieve these goals. to do that I have to finish this class as a requirement. I have a busy schedule this semester so monday was the only option that fit with my other classes.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,43,"My goal, mainly, is to get my degree somewhat on time. So far, I am expected to have to take an extra semester after my 4-year mark in this college journey. I want to be able to get my degree in order to get to the promising ""easier"" career search for my post-college life. As a first-gen student, education has always been one of the main priorities in my life, ever since even before I started kindergarten. It's so weird to think I only have a few more semesters left until I am officially done with school. There are always those thoughts where I wonder if I should go to grad school and further my education, but for now, the goal is to get through this chapter in my life and get my first degree.This class is helping to achieve this goal would be how this is the last lower-division course I need for my degree. Also, I feel like this class has been helping me really to understand the basics of each lesson. During the lecture, class goes by super fast, but in the lab, we go more in-depth and it really helps me to grasp the information. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,46,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""I think my goal for this class is to help me have a deeper understanding of physic. I think it is helping me gain more insight as to what's going on rather than just the conceptual idea. I also want to master my physic knowledge because it will be very beneficial to my upper-level classes as I major in Kinesiology and often time the human body and physic are heavily interlinking I think this class has helped me gain more knowledge in addition to my physic lecture, and honestly some material from this class overlap with my biomechanics. I like that this class keeping everything pretty basic and clear, and I hope to keep it that way since it helps me a lot."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,41,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""My goals are to continue to stay motivated and be productive each day. Considering the state our world is in and all fo things we naturally go through every day in life, motivation seems a little tougher nowadays. I am trying to find purpose in each day and make a ""to do"" list and follow through. This class is helping me fulfill that by giving me tasks to complete, with however, not being super overwhelming and overbearing. My over arching goals in my period of life right now is to finish my pre-requisites in order to take the MCAT and apply for medical school and this class is helping to prepare for taking the MCAT. The practices of this course are also helping me with conceptual and critical learning in order to use throughout medicine as it'll come in handy in medical school to practice this kind of thinking. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,45,"My goals are to become a physical therapist. I need to master physics in order to achieve my goals. Physics is the study of matter, motion, energy, and forces. Physical therapy is around to treat human body’s through physical motion within your body. I need to learn motion (physics) So I can be an exceptional physical therapist. Physics does not come easy for me. It feels like I’m struggling to learn the concepts. I get scared because if I don’t master physics then I won’t be a good physical therapist. However it is still early in the semester and My professors are excellent!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,39,"my goal for this class period is to finish the lab during the designated class time because then it would be one less thing to worry about and I won't have to go back and finish it. This class is helping me achieve this goal by having the instructor for help and also my classmates in the break rooms when I'm having trouble with something. What really helps is that from looking at this lab, it is not that long and even if I do get stuck on something I have enough time to even go back and work on it. When we did our very first lab, it was pretty long and since it was my first class this semester I was pretty lost because I haven't had my physics lecture yet so that was a stressful lab day. Now, that we are in week three it has gotten a little bit easier to get the hang of things."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,50,"My goals are to finish all the prerequisite classes that are needed for me to apply for graduate school in order for me to become a physical therapist. I have already graduated college and have walked the stage, but did not take care of all the classes that I need for grad school. My goals are a little bit different because I have already graduated and have a different mindset than other students. I feel like because I have already graduated, that is no longer my end goal and I now have a different drive to finish classes off like physics! This class is helping me achieve my goals because it is a stepping stone in the right direction for me to continue on my career path. Other than just helping me understand how movement works so that I can translate that to motion of the body, this class is helping me get back into the swing of being in school since I have taken a year off."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,40,"My goal is to become a nurse and to get into the nursing program. When I first applied to San Francisco State I didn't know what I wanted to major in, so I applied as a biology major. However after moving to San Francisco, I decided I wanted to pursue nursing. This class is more of a pre requisite for biology majors and not really for nursing majors. However, I still think that what I learn in this lab as well as the lecture will help me get into the nursing program and the knowledge I gain will help me in the future. I think that it will help me with learning how gases, such as anesthetics, flow and may help me with performing calculations. I have to take the TEAS exam later this year in order to apply to the nursing program and I think that what I learn in this class will really help me with the science portion of the exam. "
