Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,39,"I'm taking this class because it is a requirement for my major. I have taken a biology and a chemistry class before at SF State but I have never taken a physics class until this semester, which I think will be a very interesting semester. I was a bit unsure whether or not to take this class because I was kind of worried of what it would be like to take a online lab but so far I think it is going to be alright."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,40,"I chose to go to SF state since I was born and raised in Irvine, California (in SoCal) and had never lived anywhere else before. I wanted to experience new things and be surrounded by a new environment and since I loved going to San Francisco as a kid, I chose to go there for school. At first I was very intimidated by SF since I had grown up in the suburbs and had never really experienced living in a city, however I really enjoyed how different things were from Irvine. In Irvine, everything is the same and the people here all have similar backgrounds and views/ideologies. But when I moved to SF, I met so many new people and was able to gain new perspectives on life, school, and other things as well. My favorite thing about moving here was that there were so many passionate people. I was always used to being around people who had chosen majors in the medical field that their parents wanted them to do and none of them were passionate about what they were learning. But when I moved to SF I met so many people who genuinely loved what they were majoring in and who couldn't wait to be in their classes each day. I moved here to experience new things and meet new people and I think that I have definitely done that and I can't wait to experience/meet even more people/things!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,41,"""Why am I here?""I think about why I am here a lot, actually. I constantly question my purpose, but also am reminded of my purpose. When I am around my family and loved ones, it refocuses me and refreshes me. I want to make a difference in this world and if I can touch just one person in this lifetime, then I will be satisfied. That is why I am here.SFSU was actually one of the schools that I got into for undergrad and was considering for my bachelor's, however USF ended up being a cheaper option after scholarships. I honestly never thought I would come back to the idea of SFSU after I graduated, but I never thought this world would be in a pandemic anytime soon either, so there's that. I am fulfilling my pre-reqs for medical school here at SFSU as a post-bacc student and I am so happy that it has allowed me to stay in the bay area to do so. I am from Sacramento and I am here on the Bay because of my focus and motivations and refusal of disruptions and deterring of my focus. I'd like to think that I am here in my life because of God's plan for me. I am taking physics at a time where my educational maturity is at a certain point where I am ready to take on this class and also know that I have the capacity to do my best. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,42,"To answer the question ‘Why am I here?’ First of anything I am here in Physics because it is required in my major. I am a Pre-Biochemistry major and hope I can refresh my math for my Calculus class because I have not been in a Math class since Fall 2018. Secondly, I am here at SFSU because I wanted to get away from home to learn how to be on my own. I heard and seen that the science department is really good, SFSU is known for their science classes so I thought it would be good for me to start my career. I want to be an OBGYN. I heard my major is really tough but I like to challenge myself."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,43,"Why am I here? A question I have always thought about. I understand the physical reason why I am here, or why most of us are “here”. If this question means purpose, I can bring spirituality into it and think about my purpose. To be honest, I don’t know what that is. I am completely unsure of why I am on this earth and what my life mission is while I spend my time here. I can also be cliché/sappy and tell you my purpose is to be the best example of a human I can be for all my younger siblings and cousins. How to show them not to completely mess up and provide a positive, tangible role model in their lives. That is what I tell myself to keep me motivated every day. I guess they are the reason I am here. They have done so much for me and I am barely realizing it as I type this out. I am here to be open and present for them and give them the guidance I also wished I had."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,44,I always feel like when I’m asked why I’m here I think there is a lot of pressure for me to answer that question a certain way. I feel like I have to have this big purpose in my life already figured out. I am going to answer why I am at SFSU because I feel like that is something I have figured out. I want to get a degree in Biology emphasizing in Marine Biology. I am here in this Physics lab so I can fulfill a requirement for my major in Biology and move one step closer to getting a degree in Biology. I am here in this class also to learn more about Physics because to be honest I feel like I know very little about Physics. I hopefully will figure out more of my purpose at SF State the longer I'm here. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,45,"I am here because I am a new transfer student to SFSU. I am a kin major and physics is one of my requirements. :) I am from LA, and was looking forward to moving up North for school. Giving the circumstances, I don't think I will be able to move up any time soon. Sometimes I wonder if I should have just stayed at my community college at home, because it it’s way cheaper and also online. However, I’m super excited to be enrolled at SFSU . I love everything about this school and just wish it didn’t have to be online. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,46,"I think the reason why I am here taking this class is mainly that this is required for my graduate program. I have already taken conceptual physic for my kinesiology major, but I needed general physic to be able to apply for the physical therapist program. Besides that, I think physic can be such fun. I definitely learned a lot in my conceptual physic class. This will be an important class for me as well, and I will have a better understand of how physic works between the human body and other factors "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,47,"I'm here not mainly because I have to be, but moreover because I want to. I chose to be in this course since it allows me to be a step closer to what I want to do or become in the future. Being a biology major, it is required to take this physics course and since I enrolled in the lecture then I also had to enroll in the lab section of it as well. I'm here because it's important to be here. I'm here to accomplish the basics I need in order to move along and to be able to expand my learning in this subject of science. I'm here because I should be able to relate the material being taught in lecture to understand how it applies to the real world as lab should do. I feel like being able to see it through labs, it would make a lot more sense to me instead of just seeing physics as a bunch of math equations. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,48,"I am here because this class is a requirement for my major. I have mentioned in the previous class I haven't been the biggest fan of physics. The math and wording has a big cause in that, and not to mention it doesn't really catch my attention. Regardless of that I hope this semester is way different and changes my perspective on physics. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,49,I am here at SFSU to graduate as a bio major. I am here at SFSU as a bio major because I want to be a doctor and I want to go to med school after this. I wanted to go to this school because I have always wanted to move out and be on my own.I have always liked San Francisco so I thought it would be a nice place to live while I finished school. My parents are in LA so its not that far where I can't go visit at all so I thought this was a good school where I was able to be independent but still visit my family every once in a while. For a bio major physics is required to graduate so that is why I am in this class. But I am glad that I like physics so that I am able to enjoy the class while I learn.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,50,"I am here in Physics 112 in order to get the prerequisites for my goal of becoming a physical therapist. Although I had graduated from SFSU in Spring 2019, I came back in order to get these prerequisites for grad school to become a physical therapist. I was trying to take it at a community college but they were trying to make me take many math classes before taking the general physics 1 course they had. I did not want to stall my time any longer so I decided to try SFSU and it worked better in my favor. I am also here because learning is a hobby and being able to move myself forward in life while learning new skills and information makes school very enjoyable for myself. Although I am not the best physicist, I know these topics of motion can really help me in the future graduate courses as well as in the profession."
