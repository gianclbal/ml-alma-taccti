2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,48,"Coming from a family that has never had much, working with the little I got has helped navigate through college. Although things have become harder because everything is virtual now, I still try my best to keep up with all my classes. Being thankful and appreciative of everything and everyone around us that push us to be better is a huge thing I carry with me to keep me sane throughout college. School Is definitely not easy, but it isn't impossible. Being given the opportunity to go for a higher education is just a blessing itself. There are so many people in this world that wished they were in every college student shoes. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,44,I feel like my family has really helped shape me and ultimately has given me values that I've been using to navigate through college. My dad especially has really helped me. When I was younger my dad always taught me to always try me best. To give whatever I was doing my best shot and to be proud of what I was doing. Even if I didn't get the best grade or do as good as I wanted as long as I tried my best and was proud of my work it was good enough. I feel like that has really helped my in college because even when I get stressed or don't feel like doing an assignment I remember that I should always do work that I can be proud of. I also feel like my family always made me feel welcome to ask questions when I am struggling and in college it's really important to ask questions when I need clarification. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,50,"I have come from a Filipino background where I am the first generation of my family to be born in this country. This type of background has implemented a drive for me to succeed. My family had a pretty good life in the Philippines for my dad's side of the family, but they decided to look out for the next generations future. They moved here to seek a better life and I am a product of that dream. I had already graduated college in Spring 2019 and was very proud of myself to have been the second grandchild to do so in my family. It was something that gave me this feeling of not letting people in my family down. Obviously I went to college to have a brighter future for myself, but I cannot help but feel that this achievement runs deeper than just what I can now do with my life. It makes me realize that my grandfather's dream of having a better life in the U.S. has been thriving and coming to fruition with my generation of siblings and cousins."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,47,"The way I have been navigating through college hasn't depended on the values of my community, family, friends, etc. I've just always had to find my own way to make it through school and my classes. I find my own ways to continue to push myself and remain motivated no matter what it is that I seem to be going through. Yes, it has been very difficult for me, and I have come to the point where I break down constantly, but I always pick myself up. I've learned that people aren't always going to be there for you, in the hardest way. If you aren't there for yourself then no one will. There's nothing more important than believing in yourself, because without that, I feel like there's simply no way in becoming successful and accomplishing your goals. If you have the positive mindset then you'll never be disappointed and it's a lot more likely to get where you want to be. That's my way of navigating. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,40,"The values that my family taught me have definitely helped me through college because they have helped me meet a lot of really great people and make new friends. My parents always said that you should always be open to meeting new people and take advantage of that opportunity whenever it presents itself. Because of this, I joined a lot of clubs when I first started at San Francisco State in order to meet new people. After joining all of these clubs, I was able to meet a lot of really cool people who were very passionate about their majors. Because of covid it has been a little harder to meet new people but I have been making sure to keep in touch with my friends from San Francisco even though now I am living back home in socal. I think that if I hadn't taken my parents advice into consideration I wouldn't have been able to meet such great people my first year of college."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,45,"I have a very great family and support system. The only reason I know what I want to do in life is because of my grandma. My grandma was diagnosed with ALS my junior year of of high school. This is a slow muscle deteriorating disease. It was hard to see her lose strength in her muscles, she couldn’t move her tongue (couldn’t speak), she couldn’t walk, or even control the muscles in her mouths to eat, so a feeding tube was necessary. My grandma used an etch a sketch board to communicate. We moved her in a mobile home in between all of our houses to take care of her. She’d write down on her little board that she hated every nurse we hired. By my senior year of high school my mother, aunts and I would take turns carrying for her. She made me want to become a physical therapist and help people recover from whatever trauma they’re going through. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,42,"My family's values have kept me going, and I want to be a successful person in life. I learned to respect everyone, treat others how I want others to treat me; set myself high standards so I can be shoot for my dreams; challenge myself even though I know it will be tough but do not quit; be determined and motivated to push me to get where I want, my parents told me the road would be bumpy, with ups and downs, and only I can make things possible if it is not possible. I will find an alternative to make it. I also go by this verse from the bible: “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” Philippians 4:13; this verse has got me through Army Basic Combat Training. In this case, college, I remind myself of this quote and keep pushing if I get stuck because I know my career path is competitive and challenging."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,39,In my family because I'm fortunate enough to be able to go to college at all they have made it so all I have to worry about or focus about is school. So that is really my only priority and they are really supportive of me and what I want to do with my life and have for as a career so even if every now and again I I get stressed out about school and don't feel the motivation to keep going I just take a few breaks and push myself through because I'm not just doing this for me but also my family. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,49,The values of my community and family have helped me throughout college because they have supported me since the first day I started freshman semester. My family has supported me more because I am the first child thats going to college. They are happy with my decision and try to help as much as I can. They were not happy that I decided to get a job while at school because they wanted me to focus on school but I wanted to have my own source of money. They also want me to use my free time doing extra curricular activities and adding more to my application for med school. Even though they don’t want me to work I still believe they want me to do well so I can do well in the future. My family has also supported me in my major and my goals so I am grateful.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,46,"I think the expectancy of my family helped me navigate through college. As the only child and an immigrant, my parents both work really hard for me to be able to have a comfortable life. The only thing they ask in return is for me to do good in school. Both of my parents have not gone to college and from a young age, they taught me the power of education. My mom often reminds me that school might be hard right now, but life will be easier if I power through this. I think their expectancy for me and unconditional support really helped me go through college "
