2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,48,"Up until about three weeks ago I had one of my main resources completely damaged. It was my laptop, I never really realized how much it came in handy until I no longer had it. With everything revolving around the virtual world, it is even more needed. As I have been waiting for the new one to come in my main resource has been my phone. I am grateful to have it but it does limit me to the academic things I have to do. Another resource is taking it old school, it would be my pen and paper. It helps me go more into my thought process and understand the problems I have been trying to solve. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,43,"Resources I have to support me, in materialistic terms, would be the privilege to have good wifi and also an area where I can concentrate on my work to make it through all of this distant learning. More importantly, I have a great support system including my family, best friend, and my boyfriend. They have been the ones to support me in all the decisions I have made, regardless of the circumstances. Even though they may not have totally agreed with the decisions I have made, they have shown me unconditional love and support through it all. Another resource I have is access to the internet and being able to surf the uncensored web to educate myself on things I am passionate about that aren't always accessible in school. I am beyond thankful to have all these resources to support me in all aspects of my life.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,46,"I think my biggest resources are my computer, internet, and my friends and family being my support system. With everything being online I rely heavily on my computer to be able to go to class and complete homework. Recently my computer charger broke and it hurts the most basic routine of my daily life. I couldn't finish my homework or go to lectures because of that, so my computer is definitely the biggest support for me throughout online learning. Besides a reliable computer, I also need reliable internet to complete my works as everything is online. There will be a time that my wifi is acting up which hinder me from going to lecture since it's going to be zoom and without good internet, often time I would get disconnected, so I have been grateful that my internet is semi-reliable other than that I am also very grateful for my friends and family. There are times that I get very stressed out because of school work, but they always act as a resource for me to reach out and just listen to my frustration. This support system is very important as it keeps me going and not give up during some very hard time this semester.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,41,"""What resources do I have to support me?""The first thought that comes to mind is my mental health. With the privilege of having health care, I have a mental health care team of a psychiatrist and therapist. I know that there are tutoring resources on campus and just to our own disposal when wanting to hire someone. When I went to USF, I had free therapy, free tutoring, counseling etc. so I know I can still rely on those resources or be redirected to new ones through my connections at USF. I would say I am not too confident on all of my resources here at SFSU. I know my family and friends are a huge social resource that rely on too. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,42,"The resources that I have to support me are my parents pushing me to do better, not only put pressure but motivate me to push through my schooling. My boyfriend pushes me to do better he always makes sure that I finish my homework and tells me to respond back to him when I get a chance. Some other resources that I have that support me are Grammarly helps me put the last touches on my essay. Easy bib helps me create citations for my papers and San Francisco State University Gale helps me find articles for my English class."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,44,I feel like in times of uncharted territories (Covid) it is hard to feel like you have resources to support me. Nobody has every experienced a pandemic like this and now trying to juggle school online is very difficult. A way I find support is talking to other people/my friends who are going through the same situation I am right now. My friends and my sister are both going to school right now all online so I find that they are very supportive when I need to talk about how I am feeling. It might seem silly but I also find support in giving myself a schedule or planning things out for myself to do. Knowing I have something to do and something to look forward to everyday really helps me. Resources I would like to look into are the school mental health and wellness resources. I have never been to them but it is nice to know they are there for me if I ever needed to go and talk to them. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,47,"Though there may be several resources that are willing to support me, I lack to reach out. It's such a frustrating thing to me knowing that I need extra help or support to get through whatever it is that I'm dealing with. I got used to dealing with things on my own that I don't really know what resources are out there to support me. The thought of me needing support, makes me feel like I'm weak or something. However, I know that there is absolutely nothing wrong with needing support like it isn't even a bad thing at all, because we all need it at some point in our lives. I wish I could think of a specific resource that is there to support me, but I'll never know unless I go look for it. When it comes to classes, I sometimes do ask for help or send an email when it's getting difficult for me, but not every professor understands what their students are going through. Before you know it, you're filled with a numerous amount of assignments to get done by a due date and it becomes very stressful and completely overwhelming."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,45,"The number on support system I have is my family. My dad and my grandma are my biggest supporters. I don’t live with either of them but whenever I’m feeling down,  I am always welcomed to escape to each of their homes. I just moved 110 miles away from both of them and it’s very hard for me to see them frequently. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,40,The main resource I have in my life to support me are my parents. My mom and my dad have always been very supportive in everything I have done and have always made sure I knew that. I can always talk to them if I'm feeling stressed or discouraged and they will help me feel better. They've not only helped me a lot mentally but one thing that I'm also grateful for is that they do their best to support me financially as well. One thing that I really appreciate about them is that they never put a lot of pressure on me to get straight A's or to choose a certain career path and they let me choose on my own. I think that them doing this allowed me to really explore things that interest me so that I was able to choose a major that I really enjoy. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,50,"This semester being all based online has been very different than my past experiences with being in college and without the support of my professors it would not have been as smooth as it is right now. My professors and lab instructors have been very understanding of these times we are in and have provided me with tools to help me succeed through the semester. They have posted lab recording, produced study guides and have made study sessions available for us to attend. The school also provides resources for us students to reach out and find help, whether it be for our health or our education. Personally I have not reached out but it is nice to know the school has provided these services for the student body. Lastly, the most important thing that has been supporting me through the semester would be my family and girlfriend. They have given me the drive to continue my studies."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,39,"I have my instructors to support me if I ever haave any questions or need help on anything. I also have my family if I ever need to talk about something or if I just need to vent, I know that I have their support if I also in any need. My friends are also people I could go to for support because I know that when it comes to school stuff they are pretty much feeling the same stress and we also have other similar emotions so I know that they understand what I am going through and that I could always go to them. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,49,Resources that I have to support me are friends that I have made in my classes. They have helped me my assignments if I don't understand by explaining it to me. I'm in a sci class for my organic chemistry class and I have found it helpful for other people who have taken the class to teach me. I also go to the advising office so they can help me choose which classes I would need to graduate and that would be fill the requirements for med school. They have also find a lot of resources around campus that could help me too. They also helped me find different clubs that help with the application process for med school. They also encouraged me to join sci classes for my science based classes. I have taken a sci class for biology and chemistry and I think those extra support classes are what helped me pass the class.
