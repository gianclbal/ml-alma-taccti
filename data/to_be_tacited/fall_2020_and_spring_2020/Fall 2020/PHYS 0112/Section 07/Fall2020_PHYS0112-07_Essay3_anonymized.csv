2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,42,"When life is challenging I ask my closest people for advice, I will act like nothing is bothering me in public and keep pushing to complete the challenge. I like challenges and have always challenged myself in high school with higher classes. I am not much of an online class person but if it is what I have to do then I will have to get used to it for the next couple of semesters. I am a person that is a hands-on or visual learner. If a class is challenging then I spend extra time on the class to learn or teach myself or ask any classmates that I talk to or do office hours with the instructor."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,48,"What I do when life gets challenging, I completely stop whatever I am doing and reflect back on what I must do to get through the problems I have been facing.

2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,40,"When life gets challenging I like to try to take care of myself and try to do things that will calm me down. Most of the time this includes things like taking a self care day, sleeping, or scheduling a period during a day where I can do a calming activity like painting or watching my favorite show. The reason that I do this is because personally, I can't get things done when I'm super stressed out since I tend to focus more on the fact that I'm stressed out rather than the things I need to get done. I think that it's important for people to realize that your mental health and happiness are more important than things like school or work. A lot of people I know prioritize work and school before their mental health and this results in them being very unhappy a lot of the time which is why I think it's so important for you to take care of yourself when life gets challenging."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,47,"When life gets challenging, I tend to just take a step back and take a break. I allow my mind to wander. I grab my notebook, and I choose to write whatever it is that my mind is thinking. It's one of the ways I'm able to express myself, something that's just for me to see and keep. It's also one of the ways I'm able to let things go or let it out, whatever it is that may be causing me to become stressful or bringing me anxiety. Another thing I do to keep my mind at ease is playing the guitar. I enjoy hearing the sounds of the guitar as I strum on the strings. Being able to play brings me so much joy, because music in general is something that fascinates me and knowing that I'm able to do that with my own fingers and hand is such a nice feeling that I am unable to express."

My mom and I moved an hour and a half away from the town I grew up in. My step dads very sick, my mom has been to 11 doctors and they all don’t know how to help him.

That was the first time that I ever let myself leave to clear my mind.The usual way for me to clear mind and sort out challenging thoughts, I journal a lot. Just writing it out is the best way to get it out and put it down on paper. I rely on my family and friends a lot for emotional support. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,43,"What I find challenging this semester is maintaining motivation for school and just life, in general. Usually, by this point, I have a steady flow between school, work, and home/social life. This semester, maybe because of the remote learning, has been very difficult for me to do all my assignments on time without stressing so much. I even bought myself a whiteboard calendar to keep track of all due dates. That has helped so much, but just finding the motivation to actually do my work has been the most difficult for me. Also, with my home/social life, I feel as if it's nonexistent. I feel like I rarely spend time with my family, which could also contribute to a lack of motivation. I want to be able to find my groove, so I can prove to myself that I can still be the best I can be under these funky circumstances. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,50,"When life gets challenging I often find that I seek help from others to help me through situations. My girlfriend is someone who I turn to first because she has experienced a lot of what I have academically. She is currently in grad school to become a physical therapist and I tend to turn to her to get reassurance and help whenever I feel a tough and challenging road ahead of me. When I was going to class in person I tended to turn towards my classmates to feel more comfortable knowing that I am not the only one feeling a certain way. Lastly, I always turn to my family to help me through something I'm struggling with. I know that my parents will always have my back and support me through my challenges. This semester has been challenging, but not to the point where I am struggling. It has just been a grind to try and be serious about class when I'm locked into a screen rather than sitting in class."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,7,44,When life gets challenging I definitely run to to the things I love the. When I get extremely stressed my dad is someone that I really find comfort in. He always knows just what I need to hear to relax me. I also just love to just lay with my dog. She is still a puppy so she is super cuddly and is super lovey so I can really forget about all my troubles when I'm with her. One final thing I like to do is go outdoors I really love to just get out in nature and let my mind destress. I really like to watch funny tv shows and movies as well. I find that I don't get stressed really easily. I am usually a go with the flow kind of person and I can really just roll with whatever comes but when I get stressed I like to just step away from what is a real challenge to me and do something that I enjoy. When I face challenges I like to step back and find advice and comfort in others.

I grew to like challenging times since I see them as an accomplishment for myself when I finally got them done. I like to think that when I do something challenging, I actually challenging myself and I gaining experience for doing so. I see them as a learning opportunity even they can be very exhausting sometimes and it is easy to give up."
