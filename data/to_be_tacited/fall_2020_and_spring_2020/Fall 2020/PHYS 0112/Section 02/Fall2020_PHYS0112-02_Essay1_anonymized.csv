Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1281,"I am a second year Pre-Biology major. This class is one the required pre-requisites for my major and any Biology concentration I would want to pursue. I think this class is required because it enables you to think critically about how things work. This curiosity to learn will benefit me in the future because Biology is centered around composing experiments and observing the living world. Additionally, terms in Physics will appear in future classes or career situations I experience. The STEM subjects are all intertwined in some way, so knowledge of Physics will surely aid my understanding of Chemistry and other topics. Physics will allow me to understand concepts like distance, speed, and motion, which are involved in daily life, so it will broaden my understanding of the world overall. By the end of this semester, hopefully I will understand the scientific explanation behind common actions like throwing a ball or dropping something from a high height. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1282,"Why am I here?I honestly wonder this to myself all the time. Why are we all here? Some people argue that we are all here for a purpose and some say we’re here by chance. Maybe we’re really here for no reason, which is why early humans decided to build civilizations. To feel like we have a purpose. Because when you think about it, the only reason why we’re here in college, is to get a job that pays better than average. Money is man made. The idea of money is all in our heads. Do we all really have to be working everyday in our lives? Do we have to be educated on topics we’re never even using again? It all revolves around money. Because it seems like the more you have, the more successful you are. According to who? I’m majoring in environmental science, hoping to learn more about our home and how we can help repair the damage we’ve done. I know I can’t singlehandedly solve anything, change only happens if we all contribute to it so I’d rather try and be a contributor rather than not. Majoring in this has made me think about the so called leaders (politicians) of our country and their stances against climate change. So when I think about the reason why I’m here, I know there’s no reason but that’s the exact same reason why I try to live purposefully. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1283,"I am currently in physics 112 because it is a requirement for my major, but honestly I do enjoy physics. It's a subject I have found interesting since high school and am glad I had the opportunity to take it again. This course is part of the path I have to take to achieve my career goals. I have wanted to become a doctor for as long as I can remember, and taking courses in subjects such as physics and chemistry (aside from biology of course) are part of that journey. Because of my career interest, going to college is just something I have always expected of myself.Since it has been a while since I have taken physics, and courses are online this semester, I am a bit nervous but also excited to see what this semester and class will bring. While some of the material may be review, I am excited to learn new things and refresh my memory. I'm looking forward to the rest of this semester!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1284,"Tiffany Chang  PHYS 112-02  9/1/2020  Why Am I Here?   I am here because I want to be able to gain a solid education which will eventually get me into the Kinesiology program here at San Francisco State University. The knowledge gained from going to SFSU is being able to pursue a career as either a physical therapist or occupational therapists. I also want to be able to gain the experience as a college student and by doing so, I would need to expand my horizons by connecting with others from different backgrounds and ages. My goal for myself is being able to gain either a Bachelors or Master’s degree in Kinesiology. Although that is not until 4-5 years, I want to be able to meet new close friends here at SFSU. I am here taking this class not only because I need it for my pre-reqs, but I genuinely need and want to learn about physics, although it is quite difficult. I have absolutely no knowledge of physics coming to college since I never took it back in high school but I did take conceptual physics last fall. Although it wasn’t too difficult, I had to put a lot of effort into that course. This will be the time for me to learn more about what causes some objects to move and solving math problems using physics. I am here at SFSU to be able to grow and mature and step out of my comfort zone. This will be the time for me to learn many life lessons either the hard way or the easy way.    "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1285,"Why Am I Here?     First and foremost I am taking this class because I need it to graduate. However, If I have learned anything from my other classes, even if you are not trying to have a career in this field it can still help you. I do believe physics can play a role in the Physical Therapy field which is what I am trying to go into. In physical therapy patients manipulate objects with forces. This helps the therapist determine what someone’s range of motion is, how deep their injury goes, or how advanced they are in their therapy. Another way Physics can be useful is because the body constantly uses torque and forces just to move. Knowing how these forces are applied and their effects can help a patient. Therefore even though I wouldn’t have necessarily taken this class if it wasn’t required, I am glad that I am in this class because it will be beneficial."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1286,"Why am I here? Personally, I'm taking this class because it is a major and general requirement in order for me to pass college. Of course, if there's a deeper meaning then it is because I am a first generation college student for my family and seeing how hard they've worked to provide for me and my siblings, I definitely want to return the favor ten fold by earning a degree and getting a good pay jobing. They've always told me throughout the years that they don't want me to end up like them, having to work everyday and be exhausted just to make a living. I would also very much like to provide for my family once I get a job so they're not exhausted everyday and can enjoy the rest of their life relaxing or having fun because as the oldest daughter, I also had to play the role of being a parent towards my siblings when they faced hardships. I thought long and hard about what kind of job I truly take an interest in (women's health) would enjoy going to everyday for the rest of my life and pays well at the same time with the possibility of climbing up to a higher position which would be an ultrasound technician hopefully in an OBGYN or Neonatal setting."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1287,Gladis Perez At moment I am still trying to figure out what my purpose is in my life. That being said I haven’t decided what major I like. I’ve been taking the class for a bio major but I don’t seem to be more passionate about the major. I don’t know where I see myself in 5 years. I still don’t know what I want to be doing as a career. I have been doing research however due to covid I haven’t been able to do any internship to figure out what I want to be doing and discover what I like. Everything is a process and learning process. I just hope I do figure out what I like to do and what is my purpose in life. I don't want to be stuck with a major and be unhappy. I really do hope these whole covid things is over so I can do internship and decided what I want to for my life  
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1288,"Physics Lab Reflective Journal #1Why am I here?I am here because it is a class that I need to take in order to get my degree. However, I am also very interested in what this class will give me. The reason for that is because I have not taken physics at all, not even in highschool. The only classes that I would take would be chem classes. There are things that I learned in chemistry that I have seen in physics. So there are some things that I am familiar with. These things are like converting units, calculating speed, velocity, acceleration, etc. Furthermore, some of the things in these physics classes are new to me, however, it is very interesting to learn these things. I am taking this physics class because I need it to graduate, but I am also always open to new knowledge. I am very open to learning new things that I have never seen or was taught before. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1289,"Katya Candray 1 September 2020 Professor Ghosh Physics 112.02 Reflective Journaling 1 The reason that I’m here is because I believe that physics is an important subject to learn in order to help us think critically and also to get a basic understanding as to why and how the world works around us. I’m also here because I need to take this class as a  prerequisite for my biology major. I do enjoy physics and I believe that everyone should have a basic understanding of it. Physics turns people into problem solvers and that there’s more than one way to think and get an answer. I want to become a surgeon and I still think that physics is important because it helps people get an understanding of how much force to use and at what angle to use tools, such as how one should angle a blade or saw and how much pressure to use. Physics is an important subject, and I’m glad that I’m here to learn more and get a deeper understanding of the world around us."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,615,"I am here in this class because it's co-requisite along PHYS 111. So I am here to learn more about the physics world, I have never in my life not even in high school taken physics. The concept of physics is new to me but I am interested in learning more about it. Also, I am excited to meet some of my classmates as some of them may have more knowledge about physics than I do so they can possibly help out if I don't understand something before I ask you. Overall, I am excited to be in this class to further my knowledge about what physics is about and to help me out with the lecture portion of it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1290,"I am here because I am a biology major and physics is a requirement to earn my degree. Despite this class being a requirement, I hope to gain some knowledge over this topic. I am nervous that I might have a hard time in this class because everyone I know that has taken a physics course always deems it as difficult. I tend to have a hard time with math as well so I believe that may add on to the difficulties that I will face in this course. However, since this course is online, I have a lot more time on my hands to focus on my studies. It is my first semester at San Francisco State University so I hope to start off strong and earn all A's this semester. Another goal that I have for this class is to gain some confidence within my physics courses so that I am ready to take on my next physics class. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1291,"Ryan Giron“Why am I here?”Normally my answer would be a required component for my major. However, I intend to learn more from this course as a I have limited knowledge of Physics. I intend of understanding more of this course that really puzzles me. I expect to learn a lot from this by the end of the course. I am also hoping that the class will be useful."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1292,"Why am I here? The reason I took this class is because it is required to take for my major which is general biology. I actually did not mind taking physics because I took it in high school before so the material was not new to me and even though I found it difficult sometimes I actually really enjoyed it, I learnt a lot of new things in the class and opened my mind to new things. I never took a physics lab class separately so this will be a new experience for me, but I did do labs in my physics class in high school which were fun. I know that sometimes we go in groups for labs and I am pretty comfortable with doing group lab projects.The other reason I took this class is because I know it will benefit me in the future with other classes such as math, chemistry, biology, and much more. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1293,"I am taking physics to satisfy a prerequisite for my major, General Biology. I was not planning on being a Biology major from the start so I never thought I would be taking physics again but I am excited to tackle this course and learn more about physics. I have not taken physics since I was a freshman in high school so I am a bit scared that I will be under prepared for the class but so far I have been able to keep up.  I am planning on going into the medical field so I know physics will benefit me in the future. I once had a physics teacher in high school that said it is important to understand physics first in order to understand all other sciences so I believe that after this course I will be well equipped for the rest of my major classes. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1294,"I am taking Physics 111/112 because it is a requirement for my degree. When I took physics in high school, I really liked the class and found it to be really interesting. So I am excited to be taking it again but a little nervous since I have not dealt with this subject in like 3 years. I am hoping that I am able to do well and succeed in this class so I can take the second part of physics. I think physics is important and can be seen throughout someone’s day. I think it for sure helps with one’s critical thinking and problem solving. As well as just gaining an understanding of the world and how things work. I think this will help with what I am majoring in and what I want to do career wise. It is for sure going to help with my critical thinking and problem solving, whether it is for math or solving a real life problem. I think it will be helpful with zoology when learning more in depth about the physical aspect of animals, like what helps a bird fly or how are fish able to be buoyant."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1295,"I am here to fulfill a course that is required for my major. I am a Pre-Kinesiology major and I have to take PHY 111/112. My first impressions of the class are not so positive because I’m already confused in my lecture. The homework we are assigned has problems that are tough for me. I hope to have a good study group so that we can all work on it together. I took a physics class in high school and did well on it, but I had to work very hard. Throughout college I found study groups to be very helpful. I also enrolled in SCI 111 to get further practice.	My first impressions of the lab are ok I guess. I’m not sure how we are going to do physics labs over Zoom, so I’ll see what the future holds for me.	Since physics is all about problem solving, I hope to get problem-solving skills from this class. Maybe I might even use this skill in the future."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1296,"I am in this class because it was part of the prerequisite and concurrent enrollment in physic 111. Another part to mention is that a lot of classes currently at any school are online so it brought me to this class. Therefore, I would like to learn more about physics and understand how useful it can be to my major pre-biology. The last time I took a physics course was in highschool and I was quite often confused while not covering some details through experiments like I wanted to. Also, I am still very new to physics as I do not recall much from my previous physics class and was very bad at understanding how motion works in general. So I would expect to learn more in depth of how motion/thermodynamics works so it can help me in my daily life and the future. Through lectures so far and in the lab I have covered a lot of material I did not know of."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,361,"I am in this class because physics is a prerequisite I must take to get into physics 122 in order to fulfill major requirements. As far as physics, I am somewhat familiar with basic material since I took this course in high school. I struggle with trigonometry and I know that is a skill I must have in physics. With enough studying, I can most likely make it through physics without struggling too much. I hope in this class I am able to learn about many questions of “why” I have of how objects interact with each other. I suppose that is a major curiosity of mine, which is how objects interact. I hope that this course will help me to understand real world especially with what I want to do after college which has more to do with chemistry. So far, I have noticed chemistry and physics have some overlapping topics and informations which is interesting and can be helpful to understanding one another."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1297,"""Why am I here?"" I am here because I need this class. Ever since high school I have always avoided taking any physics class because I was afraid of how hard the class was and failing it. Now, I have to take this class because it is part of my roadmap of majoring in biology. I have always been interested in physics and to see how to construct experiments that incorporate different concepts, but always too afraid because I feel like I am bad at math. I think that even though I am a biology major, knowing physics allows me to become a well rounded individual and that majorly reflects the medical field. I think that doctors should all be well adverse in areas so that they can guide their patients and also to provide the best health care. Physics gives me a better understanding of how things work in the world and I think that is something that will help give me perspective when I start learning more about what makes the body work."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1298,"Why am I here? A question that can only be answered within your inner self. I am here today to learn more about our universe and what our universe is capable of in the works of physics. It is my first day here because I have been temporarily assigned to this class. Despite being my first day, I am still honored to be able to have a seat. Excited to absorb new information that has not crossed my sight yet. Going more into depth as to why am I here, I am here because physics will be beneficial for my major in biochemistry and future career in the medical field.Having a fundamental knowledge of physics will strengthen my problem-solving skills. Learning physics is helpful to not only me but to all because it answers the basic fundamental question of how this world works, or of its appearances and natural disasters, etc. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1299,"I am taking Physics 111/112 because I am a pre-Bio major and it is a requirement to take physics.  However, I have never taken physics before and always wanted to know more about it.  I have heard that physics better your skills of reasoning and I think by taking this class, my skills of problem-solving and reasoning will improve.  I am also here because I want to learn more about how everyday things work.  I think physics help explain how everything works for example I think it would be interesting to know how roller coasters work.  Also, I love science, and since physics is a science course, I wanted to take it.  I am taking physics lab with lecture because, in the lecture, I will learn the basics and understand physics and its different aspects, but in the lab, I get to be more hands-on even though classes are online."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1300,"Reflective Journal #1I am in this physics class because I want to become a Veterinarian. I am currently a fourth-year but is a junior standing. I haven’t been able to choose what career path I want to take for college because I was too indecisive of what I wanted to major in. I went into SF state as a general business major because I wanted to open my own bakery. Then I changed it to Psychology because I wanted to take the easy route because I saw that one of my friends was also a psych major so I wanted to copy them. Also, turns out I’m not good at analyzing people so I don’t know what people are thinking or read the room well. Then, a year ago, I went to Mexico and that’s where I know that I wanted to become a vet. I’m still a psychology major because I sent in an application a year ago and this summer got changed to it, but I’m changing it to Biology with a concentration of Zoology. After I get my bachelor’s degree I am going to do a program at UC Davis to continue becoming a vet. I really love animals, I hate it when I see them sick or hurt on the street and I can’t do anything to help them at all. Also, I know that I hate writing papers so I also choose a major that has the least amount of writing in it. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1301,"The reason why i am here is because it is a class that I must take since I am a science major. I have never taken physics before so i have no background knowledge. I have heard that physics is a hard subject and takes a lot of concentration and time to fully comprehend the world of physics. I am very nervous to take this course because I have no knowledge and can get confused easily. Another reason why I am here is because the laboratory section of physics will help me understand a bit more visually about physics. I am here because I want to learn physics and be able to say “I understand physics.” I know that physics is a hard subject and can be very difficult but I need to make sure I ask questions, identify my confusion, and learn from the mistakes. Also, I am here to hopefully make study groups with students so we can help each other out. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1302,"Why Am I Here?  Why am I here? For starters, I am here because I believe that receiving some type of education whether its good or bad can be used for the future. This class is a required course I have to take in order to graduate within my major so that is why I am taking it. I don’t believe that I will use anything physics related in my future but getting the knowledge will be helpful. My career goal is to become a cosmetic/plastic surgeon so I am unsure about how I will integrate physics with that. I like helping people and making people feel great about themselves. If taking this course means that I will get closer to my goals than I will happily take this course. Overall, I am excited to learn some new things in this class and I will work hard to make sure that I understand what is being taught.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1303,"The reason I am here (this class PHYS-112) is because it is a requirement for my planned major, in Earth and Climate Science. The us for this class is important because the Earth and its Climate is shaped by physics so knowledge on the subject is useful for the future. I am worried about my grade in the class because I did not do well in Advanced Placement Physics when I was in High school (I got a B-, however the class was weighted so I was worse). I was constantly distracted and didn't really understand what was going on, along with the fundamentals of the class. So another reason I am in the class is to better understand physics a topic I have a long history of problems with. Another reason I am in this class is to get a better understanding of the world, so I can do better in the future with the subject that I have had issues with. In the end, I am here to understand physics so I can finally do well in a subject that I had problems in the past with. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1304,"Hi I'm Sam and I am here in General physics class because it is required  for my major which is micro biology and I think learning physics would help with what I want to be in the future which is a Clinical Lab Scientist where I'm sure is needing a lot of critical thinking and problem solving. I also think that learning physics could help our daily lives such as calculating bills and measuring areas, so taking this class would help me practice more of that and also it will help me graduate. So it's a win win for me if I pass this class."

This class is also a requirement for my Biology degree. I'm here in order to get some lab experience for physics related topics. I'm here at this school so I may graduate with a degree that will help me receive a job in the future. I'm here because I deserve it and I paid a lot of money in order to be taught by the wonderful professors at this school.  I'm here because I worked very hard in my first two years of college in order to change my major to something I liked more than what it was before. I'm here because I like math and I am interested in physics and learning how things work. I'm here hoping that i will be able to learn something new. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1306,"Why am I here?I am here because I want to make a better life for myself. I am here because for the past 17 years of my career, I've dedicated my literal blood, sweat and tears as a cook and now as a chef/owner of a restaurant. I grew tired of working long hours, hurting my body and serving people. All while not having enough at the end of the day to provide the life I want to my family and myself. I started this new journey 1 year ago, and the pandemic as accentuated my satisfaction with the decision I made. I want to be of service but in a different way. The goal is to become a vet and serve my community through animals, whether it be farm or small animal practice. I am here to provide more time to my family. I am here because time is the most scarce resource and the most precious thing to give. I want to create more time and value while I am on this earth."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1307,"I am currently taking this physics 111-112 class because it is a requirement for my major. I am currently a Biology major so I have no choice but to take it. I honestly don't know how this course will help me for my future goals or careers. If I had the chance to not take it I would. I guess it is important to know about physics because it happens in our daily lives. For example driving a car, opening a door, and even walking.Its good to understand how the little things in our life function."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,710,"I am taking this physics course because I have a goal of someday becoming a doctor of veterinary medicine. In order to achieve this goal, I will need to get accepted into an accredited veterinary school. Veterinary schools are extremely competitive and only students with high GPA’s and hundreds of hours of animal/veterinary experience are admitted. To ensure that I stand out as an applicant for veterinary school, I am striving towards a 3.8-4.0 GPA all throughout college. I have never taken a physics class before, and I am very curious to see what this subject has to offer. I am hoping that there is not too much math, because math is not my strongest subject. I have had a lot of trouble with math classes in the past, some of my teachers were absolute nightmares, but so far this physics class doesn't seem too bad. It would be much nicer if we could have class in person though!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1308,"I am here to finish college and be the first person in my family to have a degree. I was set on a path with many obstacles I must overcome. Though these obstacles may be tough, I try my best to push through because I know I can. Despite my struggles, I want everyone to know that it is not easy. I am here to make someone’s day. I like to make those around me happy or even doing one little thing to make their day. I value kindness and happiness. I also value friendliness. How I treat others is how I expect others to treat me. I am here to explore the world. I love to travel and visit new places I have not been to before. Visiting a new environment is a good feeling and puts me in a position where I don’t always know everything. Lastly I am here because of my friends and family. They give me the love and support to keep going in life. They are my reason to go on in life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1309,"I have not taken a physics class before and I think this will be a great opportunity to learn more about it. I am taking physics 112 because it is one of the required concentration courses for my major. I am majoring in Kinesiology with an emphasis on exercise science. Kinesiology is the study of mechanics of body movements. Physics will help me understand the study of Kinesiology better. With the area of biomechanics, I will be able to understand how the body works and how to improve our movements to prevent injuries. Also, physics will help me understand how the technology works. For example, cell phones work based on the principle of electricity and the electromagnetic spectrum. When we call our family with the cell phone, our voice is converted into an electrical signal. Then, the cell tower receives the electrical signal and sends it to the other side through the electromagnetic spectrum. In addition, I believe physics will help me increase my critical thinking and problem- solving skills."
