2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1283,"Throughout my life, I have faced a number of challenges. Although I have learned how to better manage and face those challenges, I sometimes still find myself getting too stressed and overthinking certain situations. Despite this, I do eventually overcome the barriers and challenges that I encounter. I do this by reminding myself of what my goal is, and what I need to do to achieve it. I feel that for almost everything I do, there is a reason or purpose behind it, which sometimes I can lose sight of when facing a difficult challenge. I know that I have to remind myself that I can overcome such challenges, and if I cannot do that on my own, I like to talk about how I feel with my friends because I know that sometimes I just need to let it out to feel better and move forward.When life gets challenging, sometimes you just have to take a step back and clear your head before trying to overcome whatever challenge you're facing."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1296,"When life gets challenging like now turning in an assignment so late is to think I have more in me and frustrated. If I overthink something and think its not possible I end up not doing it while waiting for too long. Waiting too long would usually get me no where so I end up doing things that are challenging. I set up my day by getting up immediately to not get lazy to do anything and atleast show up to some challenging parts. Even if its late, I think its never too late to start. If I set limits I become that limit most of the time fearing what I can do. I rather feel happy failing than doing nothing. Sometimes visualizing me completing the challenges makes me wanna do it since I can believe I can work up to it. Sometimes I list what I do during the day thats wasted time and say I need to change or else I can never overcome these challenges in my life. I want to make my mind stronger and find more myself. Everyday we got the time to make us better and these challenges would help us."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1285,When life gets challenging I just try to take a step back and look at everything in a new light. Most of the time stepping away and approaching it at a later time or under a new perspective is the easiest thing. Also talking to other people is very helpful. Getting an outside opinion on something can also open your eyes to a different thought process. The goal is to just not give up. If you keep trying eventually you will figure it out. If you just give up then you will be in a worse position then when you started. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1284,"Tiffany Chang   PHY 112-01  9 October 2020  What do I do when life gets challenging?  When life gets challenging, I will usually take a break from whatever is causing me to be stressed, especially if it is related to school. But there are times where I neglect it and ignore the challenging aspect of my life and push it aside to complete and deal with later. This is not a good way to deal with things when life gets challenging so I am trying to change how I deal with things. Whenever I feel down, I would always listen to music or take the nap so it freshens my mind a little bit. Often times I will talk about my challenges to my sister who will listen to me and give me advice on what to do. But the main thing I do is that I would put my work aside and not think about it for a short awhile before going back to complete the challenging work. I would always get extremely stressed out when my life gets challenging but I would always push through having the mindset that if I finish everything now, I won’t have to worry about it in the future."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1308,"When life gets challenging, I try to take a step back and look at everything going on. Sometimes I will write down on a piece of paper everything going on so I know what my priorities are. I get a calendar and write down everything that I have planned so I can see what I may expect. When things are just stressful, I try to take a whole day to go visit a place I am not familiar with and relax. Especially with how our current situation is in the world right now, life is definitely challenging. I struggle with my online classes most definitely and it is hard for me to keep up. The tasks are easy but hard to complete when I have other things on my plate too. I think classes are also tough when I work about fifteen hours a week. Sometimes I will talk with a friend with how things are going, having someone who could almost relate with me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,615,"At this point of this semester things are starting to get challenging from midterms, quizzes, and assignments piling up. What I do to stabilize my schedule with my school work is that I put on my calendar on assignments that are coming up that are due first to what is due last. I also have to worry about my family since I stayed back home due to the pandemic and they can be stressful sometimes maybe even adding onto my stress. What I do about that is I try to put my headphones in or try to find a quiet space in the house. I would like to balance out my school life and my social life. I like to go out and hang out with friends to help relieve some stress and forget about school at the moment since school does not have to be on my mind 24/7. Whenever I need help with any assignment I try to ask my peers that are in the same class and if they don't know then I would turn over to the professor for help. This semester is challenging in so many ways due to online learning which is no where near the same as remote learning so it took me a while to adjust to it but I'm doing well with it so far, I just have to stay on top of my classes and constantly check for assigned work."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1294,"When life gets challenging, I will make time for self-care days. I try to get out of my house for fresh air and do things where I wont have to look at a screen, like my phone or computer. Usually I will go to my friends from home first and facetime then. If they are unavailable, I will go to my mom or sister, my sister usually talks about whats going on in her life so this distracts me from mine. I like to go out and grab a cup of coffee and then head to the beach to sit there for a while. When i was in SF, I would go on the muni to find an area I have never explored before. I used to go on runs or walk on trails but it has been too hot. Since ive been home ive been going on long drives to blast my music, I usually end up at the beach. Recently ive been trying to make time to do yoga in the mornings in my backyard before I start my day. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1309,"When something challenging occurs in my life, the first thing I do is stress about it. Then I try to find ways to solve it while trying to procrastinate and not deal with it at the moment. Which is a bad idea because it will create more stress for me. For example, challenging questions from my assignments. When it comes to a problem I do not know how to do, I will ask my friends for help and explanation. I also find practice problems very helpful in understanding the materials. Another example is having all my classes to be online. It is challenging for me because I am less motivated and it takes time for me to adjust. I would also complain to my friends about how hard online classes are and it helps relieve my stress a little. In addition, I would also ask them for advice and I find that helpful. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1303,"When life gets challenging, I react in different ways, but I try to do the best that I can in achieving my goals in life. One way is an analysis way of thinking, reviewing a cost-benefit method and list setting so I can achieve my goals over time. I analyze the scenario, and see what is happening, like how did I get here and what are my end goals. Then I look to see how I can achieve my goals, and from there I get to make a list of things that I need to do. When I get to list making, I like to split up what I need to get done, then set myself to do each part of it until that subject is done, then I can focus on the next topic that I need to do. What I also try to do is calm myself, challenging stuff is stressful, and I try my best not get completely stressed out about what I need to get done. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1305,"Kelsey Hauf Reflective Journaling #3""What do I do when life gets challenging?""	When life gets a little challenging my knee jerk reaction is to lie down and not think about it. Obviously this strategy does not help me at all, so I've learned some other techniques that really help. These days my favorite thing to do when I'm feeling frustrated is to leave my house. I do not have a car but it feels amazing to take a walk around my neighborhood with some headphones and obviously a mask to keep the people around me comfortable and safe. I really believe a good walk lets me organize my thoughts and get out of the environment that was making me feel stressed in the first place. Another thing I often find myself doing is to clean around the house. It feels nice to get away from my desk and dance to some tunes while I do my household chores. This let's be do something productive and feel alot better about whatever challenging situation I have to face. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1295,"For the past few years I have always had music and working to rely on when life gets tough. Unfortunately it’s hard to work out nowadays, but my dad and I more or less solved that when we built a mini-gym in my room. So now I have my guitar stuff and work out stuff within 5 feet of each other! 	Anything to do with music calms me down whether it’s listening to it or playing it. Lately I’ve been trying to make some, but it’s not good. I bought a headset that I plug into my computer so I can play quietly so as not to disturb my siblings, so if I wanted to I could play at 3 am, which is awesome.	And with my little gym setup it’s pretty basic. All the cool machines a real gym provides are too expensive and I don’t have any room for them anyway. I tried to run around the neighborhood, but with the fires I stopped that."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1301,"What I do when life gets challenging, with school and other personal reasons, I definitely try to make time for myself. I sometimes give myself a spa day which includes giving myself a nice long bath, skincare, and manicure, etc. At times I just like to splurge on food or clothing, which is not good for my bank account but it does make me happy. Most importantly, I like to workout, go for a run while listening to my favorite type of music, it is just so relaxing and peaceful, or I do other workouts at home to take my mind off things. I also really enjoy going to my best friends house, she always knows what to do to cheer me up which is going to pick up food. At the end of the day, after I take my mind off it and I am in such a better mood, I try to attack the challenge by first recognizing it and then finding a solution. If I can't then I ask for help, I ask for my friends advice and just try my best. If it becomes too challenging then my alternative is just to ignore it and hopefully it goes away."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1302,"What do I do when life gets challenging? Well, it kind of varies, I can either cry about it or take a break, but I try to never give up. My whole life I have been faced with challenges that I thought I would never overcome. Now looking back, I am confident to say that I have overcome most of the hardships in my past. Today I am faced with many difficulties and responsibilities but I will always continue to motivate myself because I am working towards something that is going to secure my future so that I can make sure that the generation behind me within my family doesn't know what making ends meet and struggling feels like. This whole semester I have been struggling with my lab classes because I don't feel like I am learning anything and the workload is too much. At first, I was just going to forget about it and not do it, but then I started thinking about how this one assignment could affect my entire future. My plan is to get it done no matter what even if it's late because I have been given a second chance and that doesn't happen a lot in college.  So what do I do when life is challenging, I keep going until I reach the finish line even if it means I'm the last person to finish. I move forward at my own pace because the only thing that truly matters is quality and I like to take my time so that I am giving/showing the best of my abilities.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1286,"When life gets challenging for me, I tend to shut down mentally because if everything is coming at me all at once it feels like a weight on my shoulder and everything is really overwhelming. There are some days where I don't feel like doing anything at all and I know I am mentally exhausted when my room becomes messy and it's one of the way I like to keep track of my mental health. On the days I feel exhausted, I like to spend my time in bed and resting and doing whatever else to keep my mind off things for a while because from past experience, if I were to force myself to continue dealing with stress then I tend to breakdown at some point. Some days are better than others but right now it is still a learning process on how to pick myself up. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1310,"When life gets tough I simply take time to myself to evaluate what issues I am having. Whether it be school stressing me out or something going on in my life outside of school. I try to think of the issue, then evaluate what the issue I am having. Sometimes it helps to write out my frustrations  before I do evaluation. Self evaluations are always helpful for me because I know where my mindset is and what needs to change. Something that I want to do is meditate. I am not sure how to do it the correct way, but eventually I will get into it because I want to be more relaxed with everything in my life at this point. I know school is putting stress on me, though I ignore it. So, I think finding effective ways to cope with any new stress is important. I noticed a decline in my physical health last semester because I was ignoring my stress. I do not want to make these same mistakes, so I will continue my journey on finding ways to take better care of myself. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1306,"When life gets challenging, I take a deep breath figure out what I can control in the moments and just take care of those things. If I am being honest during these reflective journals, I used to handle ""my business"" in the moment but held onto my stress to be released through substance abuse. The substance I would use is alcohol. Challenging ""now"" vs. challenging before is very different. I still drink but I try to direct my stress towards solving school problems and having that be my relief. Who really knows what the next form of stress relief or ""fight or flight"" response will look like. I do try to keep my family in mind as I navigate tough times. Having a perspective but also acknowledging at times are difficult is very important to me so I am not too hard on my self and allow myself to feel in the moment. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1289,"Katya Candray 6 October 2020 Professor Ghosh Physics 112.02 Reflective Journaling #3 When life gets challenging, which is pretty often haha, I like to run or eat my feelings or take a nap. Running is part of my sport so I do it anyways, but it helps me clear my mind and focus on the run and music rather than the other things poking me in the back of my head. I love to eat so stress eating is one of my coping mechanisms. Because I run so much, I also don’t feel guilty with what I eat and how much. Napping also brings me a lot of joy and it definitely takes my mind off things that are stressing me out. I know they’re unhealthy coping mechanisms but they really do help me bring down my stress levels at the moment. Running is the only healthy coping mechanism but sometimes that also gets overwhelming, so I like when I have backups like the stress eating and napping. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1281,"When school gets tough, I like to take breaks from my work to relax. I get a snack, talk to my family, play with my dog, or go on my phone. I like to light candles or use my essential oil diffuser to help me relax and put me in a better mood. It also helps if I listen to music while I work or study. Sometimes the music will help motivate me to work faster and concentrate better. Also, music helps my lift my mood so the work doesn't seem as daunting. I reach out to my classmates if I am really stuck on an assignment, so having a community of other students with the same experiences is helpful. Sometimes talking to my family about my struggles is helpful because they listen and offer advice. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1304,"That's a really interesting question. I think for me, life is challenging everyday. I didn't come from a wealthy family, but I'd say we're living decent, however, it can still be tough at times so what we do is that my family and I talk it out and we solve our problems together and I think communication with the family is the key to survive a challenging aspect of life. I also use communication to solve any problems in school. I'm not a smart guy and lazy at times, so there are a lot of times when I don't get a problem, since this happens a lot. I tried to practice my social skills so incase I need help from someone, I don't have to feel shy asking them and it usually solves my problem. I think the key here is to never lose hope and always try to find away to communicate with people because that's how we learn and how we get through things. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1291,"Normally I pause, take a deep breath and then relax. I want to do a reset. Then tackle the problem.I would normally encounter a lot of challenges. Some are easy to solve, some are difficult to solve. When faced by such challenge, there is so much confusion. I encounter a lot of ideas that enter my mind non stop. I dunno how, but I become overwhelmed by this. It doesn't help at all if I don't know what to do and what to think. I cease to function correctly.The only way for me is to get out of this state. So resorting by relaxing and then do a reset and approach the problem at another way is a clear way to get things done. It can offer insight as to why you can't work earlier, but can be more engaging and get more things done."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1292,"We all experience bad and rough times in our lives but what  is important is to learn how to get through them. When life gets  challenging for me I try to understand that change will come and it will  not stay the same forever, so I face these hard times and overcome  them, as they say rain will not last forever, once the rain is over, the  sun will come to shin. I also try to focus on what I can control,  rather than focusing on the problem and trying to blame or find an  excuse to get away from it, I choose to focus on the solution and on the  things I can do to fix the problem. Another important thing I try to do  when life gets tough for me is try to regain motivation and remind  myself of my purpose in life. I do that by listening to motivational  songs, drawing, or reading inspirational materials. Lastly I try to  remind myself that there are no failures, only lessons. I used to  struggle with that a little bit because I used to look at failure as a  defeat rather than feedback to learn from, until I realized one day that  It doesn’t matter how many times I fall as long as I choose to get up  and learn the lesson."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1293,"Lately, life is constantly feeling challenging. It seems like there is no end to the drama of the world. Though, I do not feel like I have a concrete plan on what to do when I feel like life is getting too much, I do have some things that make it better. I enjoy working out as a stress reliever, night walks with family always calms me as well, and I really enjoy cooking/baking. I am a real foodie so I try not to resort to food when I am having a bad day but sometimes a good medium fries really does the job. I am working on talking it out with the ones close to me so I do not keep it all inside because then I get even more stressed than before. This year I have a lot of supportive professors so school has not been as big of a worry for me, however staying focused is a lot harder. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,710,"When life gets challenging, there are two main things that I like to do. I like to take a moment to figure out what is challenging and why that thing is challenging. Identifying the problem or obstacle in my life allows me to figure out possible solutions. I also like to talk to others about the situation. For example, during my first semester I was facing a lot of issues in my personal life and was having trouble adjusting to college life. I did not have many friends to confide in yet, because it was very early in the semester. But as I was always early to my eight am philosophy class, I began to talk to my professor before the rest of the class arrived. My professor genuinely cared - he still does care - about my issues and how they have affected me. My professor provided new and philosophical perspectives of the issues that were challenging me. Talking to him and hearing his unique ideas about my situation has definitely helped me work through the challenges."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1290,"When life gets challenging, I try to have a self care day and take the day or even just a couple hours to myself and disconnect from the world. I try to stay away from my phone and focus on things that I enjoy doing or haven't had the time to do. Depending on the day, even some tidying up around the house can make me feel like I have brought some order back into my life. My favorite thing to do is watch movies or go to the beach with my favorite drink and have a nice day. Sometimes I like to seek the company of my friends and spend the day with them doing something out and about. I am extroverted so being around other people helps me out when I am having a tough day. I am trying to incorporate more self care days into my schedule so that I am not only doing it when I am feeling bad."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1288,"When life gets challenging, I tend to push forward and work towards my goals. Every now and then it gets hard, but I don't let it stop me. I do have breakdowns and I do have moments to myself, but that is something that everyone should do. Everyone should make time for themselves. Everyone should always check up on themselves and others. There are always going to be hard times or when life challenges you, but you cannot let that bring you down. When life gets hard, I stand up to it and face what comes my way. Sometimes it gets to me, but that is normal. I try not to look at the negative things and focus on the positive things. The positive things, vibes, etc. are what keeps me going. I know I am not the only one that is struggling that is why I push myself and pick myself up. Not only that, I also like helping other people up on their feet when they are at their lowest. I just keep telling myself ""you can do it"" or ""you got this"" and push forward. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1300,"Since the whole pandemic lately and that classes have moved online, I feel as though this semester has been more challenging than the previous semester. This semester, I feel as though the classes are more demanding now than last semester and I feel burnt out already. So far physics has been really challenging for me and everything is moving at a fast pace that I can't keep up or understand the material. I guess when things get challenging, I'm not sure what to do, usually, I'm the type of person that just lets it flow through and I'll deal with it later to not cause me as much stress. But then the workload catches up and I get really stressed. I want to email my professors so that they can be a bit more lenient on us especially what is going on. I've been really harsh migraines lately and looking at computer screens have been making me really tired. I try to keep myself unstressed by knitting but that takes too much time from doing my course work that all of my professors are assigning every day. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1282,"Throughout our lives, we always face challenges. We can either let us negatively affect us or learn from it. I really do believe these challenges help us become better and stronger versions of ourselves, I learned this from personal experience. Life never goes as planned, we must be prepared to come across obstacles no matter the situation. Being younger than I am now, I used to let all the bad things in my life get the best of me, until I realized it was a waste of time. I decided if I wasn’t going to learn from the situation I was never going to allow myself to grow into the person I aspire to be, a happy one. Whether it be personal or school related, we can always learn from something, no matter how big or small. In the end, all we have is ourselves and our thoughts, only we have the power to change our lives and it all starts with our mindsets. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1297,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?"" When life gets challenging, I tend to get stressed out and overwhelmed, I get burnt out very easily and my motivational level decreases as well. During this time it has been very difficult to stay on top of things and at the same time manage living on my own and taking on responsibilities as a young adult. I have had some terrible weeks and some perfect weeks. But as the school year is continuing, my stress level is also continuing. On top of that, adding on a job makes my life even more hectic and trying to balance school and work has never been a problem, but I don't know why it has so much harder than previous years. Recently, I have been getting sick or just not feeling my best because I am constantly stressed and trying to make a living to support myself and that has taken a huge toll on my overall health, both mental and physical. These past few months have been really challenging, but I am still here standing. I think what keeps me going even when I hit rock bottom is my end goal, making it into the PA field, so that I can provide for my future family and as well as my parents. I want to reduce their stress so that they don't have to work as hard since they have already done so much for me and now it is time for me to take some weight off of their shoulders. I think wanting to provide my adulthood with the best life possible is pushing me to continue forward. I still have moments of doubt and want to quit everything I do, but I know that won't get me anywhere. Life right now is truly testing my determination and if I can get through this I can do anything with my life. "
