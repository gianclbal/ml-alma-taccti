2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1285,"My goals in general at this time are just to graduate and get my bachelor’s degree. This class is helping that because it is a requirement for me to graduate. I do generally enjoy this class though. I was a little concerned that the physics lab would be online cause I was not sure how we would do this, but the simulations we use are actually very helpful. And I can relate this class so far to how these concepts might be used in the real world. My biggest thing would be for like police officers. You would be able to tell by graphing the speed of the car over time to see if the car was accelerating or if it was slowing down to see if the driver was distracted while driving. Or something like that, not one hundred percent sure how to relate the class to real world problems yet. However it is very interesting and I am looking forward to the rest of the classes."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1300,"My goal is to become a vet. I love animals and I hope that I can help them whenever any animal is sick or hurt so that they are in better health. I hope that physics can help me achieve that goal not as only as a prerequisite for my major. So far, I don't really understand physics this semester but I hope that I can push through and pass this course. Physics deals with gravity, motion, and energy. I'm not sure how physics will help me in that path but it does deal with a lot of math and conversions. I want this class to help me with my goals because I do not want this class to be a class that I'll probably never use in my life, but due to wanting to study veterinary, I need this class and the main components of physics to help me become successful."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1297,"My goal is to finish undergrad by 2022 with a BA in Biology and hopefully a minor in Chemistry, so that I can apply for PA school and become a Physician Assistant specialized in dermatology. Finding a career in the medical field has manifested in my mind ever since I was a child and I think it is because I enjoy seeing the way the body functions and how small factors can cause major differences, whether it be beneficial or not, I am excited to pursue this route. This class is helping me achieve these goals by making me a well rounded individual and the more obvious reason is to fulfill my undergraduate/major credits. Not only will this class help me understand a core concept but also learn to apply it to my daily life which will give me practice in being able to apply the things I know to my daily tasks and hopefully in my future career. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1291,"What are my goalsMy goal is to use various knowledge to help me understand Physics. This can be done by using various problem solving techniques. Think like a scientist. Start with a question on what are you learning. Then move your way to hypothesize and theorize on what you are learning. Then the next approach is to device a way to explore your hypothesize, make protocols, test your theory, and understand more. Be able to argue, criticize, and re-evaluate. You need to justify and be able to explain scientific techniques to problem solving. In the case of let us say a projectile motion concept, try to figure out what makes a certain object behave the way it is, then utilize your understanding on how such idea would be reinforced by experimentation and analysis. In addition, you need to be able to use different aspects of physics as they see fit to your inquiry. This would enable you to explore and further look for other answers that may intrigue you. When you finally come to realization, then you can be very well understood things and you have a achieve on what you are trying to accomplish."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1306,"My goals is to still become a better person. Part of the process to achieve that goal is to concentrate and succeed in each individual class that is necessary to get to my end goal of going to vet school. Part of becoming a better person in the future, is to become better today. I am concentrating to do well in this class because it will help me achieve my goal. Physics is not an easy topic, especially with learning online and outside of a traditional learning environment, but I think this goal can still be achieved. The interesting thing about goals is that there are usually distractions and speed bumps along the way. Those are suppose to make us better at reaching our goal. Also make it more valuable when that goal is met. What isn't said about goals, is that it is also a moving target. Who knew that the world would come to a halt during a pandemic. So instead of trying to reach a goal that is straight ahead not the obstacles and blocking us from reaching a goal that is to the left. This class is a necessary learning experience to reach our goals."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1310,"My educational goals are to be admitted into medical school or a neuroscience graduate program. This class specifically will help me by completing my prerequisites and it will assist me when I start studying the brain. I read an article on the Science blog of a physicist who uses concepts from physics and math to describe dynamic connections in the human brain. Although I am having a difficult time in lecture, I find it easier to practice those concepts in the lab and to clarify my confusions. I tend to revisit the lab simulations to practice those problems again (challenge problems specifically). Lab has helped me meet new classmates that I can contact during the semester who can help me clarify any of my confusions. I met someone with the same major as myself and we exchanged contact information. She was able to tell me the difficulties of certain classes I have not taken yet, so I found that helpful. I hope by the end of this class, I will be able to make connections between this class and several other science classes that I have taken and will be taking in the future. My ultimate goal is to expand my knowledge of science and use it to make a difference in the world. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1294,"At the moment my goals for this class is to get a basic understanding of physics and to see if I still like it as much as I did in high school. I have not taken a physics class since high school, so I am relearning a lot of the material. In order to complete my lower division classes, I have the option to take physics 2. I am still debating on whether if I should take calc 2 or physics 2, at the moment I cannot really decide. This semester I am just trying to learn and understand as much in order to prepare me for physics 2. As well as to see if I am good and actually enjoy the subject. Math is not my strongest area so when it comes to these math classes, I have to choose wisely and I want to actually enjoy the class. Even if I do not take physics 2 next semester, I still want to learn and understand as much as possible. I can see a lot of ideas/concepts from physics that can be applied to other areas in my education career."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1311,"My goal is to better understand the world around me and a lot of that has to do with understanding the mechanics of physics. This class is letting me put some of the ideas I learn from my physics lecture into practice and connect it to my everyday life. First, the choice for each lab so far has had a use in the real world. The simulations given do help me visualize the context, which helps me learn better and an idea of how this can be used in my life. The lab explorations let me understand the subject from different angles and use many problems to let me practice until I get it right. The knowledge check puts my skills to the test to see if I really do know what they are asking. And finally, the summary is where I see the real world purpose for what I learned in that lab. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1307,"At this current moment in my life, my goal is to do well in my classes this semester, and pass all of them with a good grade. So far I am doing well, but it seems like I am struggling in physics and physics lab. This is my most difficult class so far, so I'm hoping I am doing all right.  As far as my future goal, I do not have a long term goal at the moment because I still do not know what I want to do in the future. I haven't decided what career path to take, and have no interests in anything. I feel a heavy pressure from family and society that I need to have everything in order, but I don't. I have a constant stress lingering over me, because I don't have a future goal or plan set in stone. I guess another one of my goals is to find guidance and help me through this obstacle."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1290,"My ultimate goal is to become a marine veterinarian. This class is a stepping stone to my goal because it is a prerequisite for my major. I hope to expand my way of thinking from this class because I have never taken a physics course and trying to think like a physicist is quite difficult. I have a feeling that this class might be difficult because often times I get in my head about subjects that others have said is hard for them. I let it get to me in the way that I am not smart enough to comprehend a different way of thinking. I hope that by the end of this class, I am able to get out of the negative mindset and become aware of how intelligent and smart I am. In the long run, I also hope that thinking like a physicist will help me with my career because in a way, physics requires a lot of critical thinking which is essential for my major."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,615,"My goals are to finish my under graduate degree within the next two years as I am a 3rd year. Eventually, after getting my bachelor's degree in Biology concentration in Zoology I want to get into veterinary school because I've always loved animals. I've had dogs all of my life and I hated to see them sick. Even if that does not work out I am still able to work with animals with my Zoology degree. I believe animals are a big part of our lives and deserve to be treated properly. I just want to find a stable job that has to do with caring or nurturing for animals or even go into research and travel to different countries. This class is helping me achieve my goals by fulfilling my under division requirement and also expanding my knowledge in physics as I've never taken the class before and it's also helping me meet my peers who are also interested in my career path."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1303,"My goals are to understand how the three graphs relate to each other, being the position vs time graph, the velocity vs time graph, and the acceleration vs time graph. As well to understand how acceleration works in the system, because I know about F=ma and how they all work well together. My other goal is to understand how the F=ma equation works, because I want to see how increasing or decreasing wither F, m, or a effects the equation as a whole and how that plays into physics. This class can help me achieve my goals because I had a hard time in AP Physics with understanding acceleration, so this lab can help me understand acceleration by doing the lab so I can understand how acceleration works in Physics. This class can achieve my goal of understanding the F=ma equation through testing the inputs of the equation and how they all relate to each other and how they each effect each other. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1292,"I have a lot of goals for example my health and fitness goal is to try to workout everyday and keep up with a healthy diet, for my financial goal is to try to save money for future plans and try not spend a lot of money, and for my personal goal is to try to become a better version of myself and never be afraid on pushing myself to a successful life. But my long-term main career goal in life to become a successful dentist. I know it will require a lot of hard work and dedication, but I am up to the challenge. My first step in becoming a successful dentist is to take classes that will help me  succeed in this career. Considering my major is general biology there are required classes that I have to take and one of them is physics which comes with a lab. This class will help me achieve my goal by simply passing it and understanding each lesson in the class."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1301,"My goals are to fully comprehend the material and ask questions. In the past I have been to scared to ask for help from professors and even students. Since I have never taken physics, I am a little behind on having background knowledge and understanding the concept right away. For me, I had no idea what physics even was before I started this semester so what I do to review is watch back the lecture recordings and read my notes to understand. This class is helping me in many ways. Because we do more examples in the lab and use interactive websites to help my understanding it does make it helpful. At times, the professor in lecture won’t do enough example questions in class so the lab helps me understand by working with other people and visually seeing and doing it with helpful websites. Also the professor makes us aware that she is there to help us and if we need help we can ask her questions at any time and is very flexible with us. Also, being in groups and helping each other out is very helpful."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1295,"My goals for this class is to obtain a better understanding of physics so that I could apply it to the lecture class. This has helped me already though, especially the last lab. I applied what I knew about the graphs and slopes of position v. time graphs and velocity v. time graphs and used it to help me with the homework. Another goal I want to complete from this class is to better understand how to use the various programs assigned. So far we have been using programs on our computers for all the labs. It almost makes me wonder if we would’ve been doing the same thing is we met in person. But through experimenting with the various programs I have a better understanding of the material. It helps me learn when I can manipulate simulations and situations. This lab for example, although long and tedious, helped deepen my understanding of velocity, acceleration, and position graphs."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1281,"My goal in this class is to get an introduction to Physics and learn new topics. My future goal is to get my Bachelor's Degree in Biology and pursue a lab or research-based career. This class is helping me progress towards earning my degree because it is one of my prerequisites. I hope that by taking this class I can increase my scientific knowledge and gain critical thinking skills I can use in the future. Topics that I learn in this class will probably help me in other science classes. I hope that the new techniques I learn in this class will help my learning of more difficult subjects like upper division chemistry. I think that this class will give me more experience with drawing graphs and diagrams, which will help me in future Biology and Math courses. This would help me in the long-term, allowing me to succeed in my other STEM classes, further enabling me to get my degree. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1288,"My goals are to understand and learn about physics. I have never taken physics before so the things that we have been learning are new to me. The class is helping me achieve these things because we are going step by step with every topic. I love how the professors are posting up slides about every topic because whenever I am confused about anything I can go back to these slides. The slides are not detailed a lot about what we talk about but they do provide information that we need to learn about physics. These topics that we are learning are very interesting and it makes me want to learn more. However, my confusion is some places also makes me want to learn more because I want to be able to understand what we are learning. Other things that this class helps me achieve in learning physics is my classmates because whenever I am confused or need a further explanation, I can always turn to my classmates for help. The assignments also help me achieve my goal, even though some of them are challenging, but that is what I like. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1289,"Katya Candray 14 September 2020 Professor Ghosh Physics 112.02 Reflective Journaling #2 My goals in this class are to learn as much as I can in this class. I want to be able to fully understand all or most of the topics and know the ‘why’ of how things happen the way that they do. I would also like to be able to pass the class with an A by doing all the work and trying to learn as much as I can and be able to apply it to real life. This class is going to help me achieve these goals by going over what we learn in lecture. We also do a lot of sample problems which will help me be able to understand how to do things and figure out ways to apply it to real life. The mini lectures in lab also help me understand more about physics, so I’m able to know the ‘why’ things happen the way they do and the constant practice helps me fully understand things."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1302,"Reflective Journaling #2  For this reflective journaling prompt, I am asked “what are your goals? How is this class helping you achieve these goals?” This question can get a little confusing because I don’t know if I should talk about my short term goals or long term. I am guessing the short term so I will explain the goals that I plan to achieve within this class. For starters, physics is a course that I have to take in order to fulfill units for my major. I am striving for pre-med and one of the things that I will be studying for soon will be the MCAT. Looking back, I have looked and read some old pre-med study books and the first study section was physics. Right then and there I knew that taking physics and understanding it was important. I hope to gain much-needed knowledge from this course because physics is used in everyday life. I not only want to learn in this class but I would like to retain the information as well. This class is helping me achieve that goal by simply being apart of it and actually learning."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1284,"Tiffany Chang  PHY 112-02  18 September 2020  What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?  My goal currently is to get good grades in all my classes this semester although this is my goal every semester. I hope to achieve them by doing more than what is asked for in all of my classes. My future goal that I hope to achieve after my undergraduate is to go get  Doctor of Physical Therapy degree so I can practice physical therapy as my occupation. Before achieving that goal, I will definitely need to work hard on my undergrad studies so I am able to learn the things necessary for the DPT program. My other future goals are to get a good Graduate Record Examination score that is qualified to apply for DPT school. Right now, I am trying to get over with this semester as it is online and the physics lecture and lab I am taking right now can help me achieve these goals by learning the mechanics of why things move the way they do. This course gives me a foundation of General Physics II along with biomechanics. If I don’t master the basics, I will be unable to go on and learn much more advanced material. Learning the basics and foundation is very important as without it, learning new things won’t help me fully understand them. This class will also help me achieve these goals because it is a requirement to take General Physics I along with lab when applying for DPT School and to get a Kinesiology major here at SFSU."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1293,Sometimes I feel like I have too many goals to achieve and at the same time I feel like I do not have enough goals. I am most passionate about being a Mexican woman in STEM because I have always struggled with math and science but there is not enough hispanic representation in STEM so achieving my goal of having a bachelors in Biology will help me contribute to that statistic. Another goal I have is getting into a Nursing school after I finish at SF State. I could not get in when trying to transfer but getting my degree was my goal so I put Nursing school on the side until I achieve my first goal. But this is why I take physics so seriously because I need to do well in this class so that I can keep my GPA up and ready for me to apply to schools again. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1299,"My goals are to understand Physics better and learn how to solve problems related to physics.  My goal for this class is to practice physics problems and practice problem-solving.  This class is helping me do so by providing me with many problems and giving me lots of opportunities to practice my problem-solving skills and improve my skills in physics.  This class also helps to give me a different perspective on physics.  Some lessons are taught differently in the lab compared to lectures. This is helpful because different ways are being taught to solve a physics question, I think it’s essential to learn new approaches to problem-solving because it helps to understand the questions better.  Another goal of mine is to do well in this class and this class is helping me because there are lots of practice problems and is a class that has a large impact on my grade in physics."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1282,"I am not 100% sure of what my goals are for the future, but some of my present ones are passing all my classes (hopefully with all A's) and actually gaining knowledge after this semester. We are all working very hard while adapting to all the changes around us, it is not easy to keep track of all of the assignments assigned but here I am trying my best. It really is interesting learning things you didn't know before, how the things around you work and why. It almost refreshes my mind, although it can be overwhelming when it comes to exams and time limits. I really do believe we learn best without time limits, since we all learn in different ways than others. This class is helping me reach my goals because I am learning about how my interaction with the things around me work and vice versa. It really is amazing that everything is made up of smaller components and how everything has a reason for behaving the way they do, even our own bodies. I am a very curious person, this class is one of many things teaching me how our universe works. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1283,"When I think of my goals, I usually only think about my long term career goal - but in order to achieve that goal, there are smaller goals that I want to attain along the way. One of my short term goals is to get good grades, while my long term goal is to enter the medical field and become a surgeon. This class can help me achieve the first goal because it gives me the opportunity to do exactly that - get good grades. Although I do like physics, it can be a bit challenging at times, especially with this semester being online. These instances (though frustrating) teach me to be more patient and determined to persevere and achieve my goals. This class helps me achieve my long term goal because it is a requirement for my major, which I need to apply to medical school. While I do know that people can apply to medical school with a degree in any major, I chose cell and molecular biology because I wanted to major in something I am passionate about."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1296,"My goal for Physics 112-02 lab is to learn or follow each week's class time and find educational videos to help me with the lab exploration if I am stuck instead of giving up easily. I plan to get started with my classwork and studying ahead of time to manage my other classes, as well. Another thing to do is take more notes on both computer and writing from lecture so I can make sure I don’t fall behind. Time to time I should review my old assignments before entering class and understand what questions to be asking or a way to answer questions. Strategies to keep myself from not falling behind I will check ilearn assignments due dates and time manage better. From this class it has help me achieve setting up better equations I would need for physics problems while understanding the purposes of each usage with graphs and cover presentations terms/etc I might have confusions of."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,710,"My goal in life is to become a doctor of veterinary medicine. I have always been fascinated by the many different species we share our planet with. I am especially interested in avian species, because birds are such unique creatures. I am also interested in working with exotic animals, such as rabbits and guinea pigs, and wildlife animals. In the past, I have spent many months working at a wildlife center, and I absolutely loved it! I learned so many incredible things about animal husbandry, nutrition, and rehabilitation. This experience truly inspired me to continue pursuing a career in veterinary medicine. In order to achieve my goal of becoming a veterinarian, I need to complete my undergraduate coursework and be accepted into an accredited veterinary school. I also need to continue gaining as much experience in the field as I can. Besides my experiences in wildlife rehabilitation, I also have been gaining experience with companion animals from working at a small animal hospital. I am very excited to someday achieve this goal and I cannot wait for the day that all the hard work will have paid off."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1305,"Kelsey Hauf Reflective Journaling #2""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""	My goals are to graduate hopefully on time, Get some lab experience, Get a job that involves lab work, and to someday retire as an old lady who did lots of groundbreaking research. This class is helping me achieve at least some of those goals by filling in a requirement I need in order to get my general biology degree. This class will teach me the foundational skills I'll need for the next lab class I'll need for my physics requirement. Maybe I'll use what I learn from this class in my everyday job someday. My short term goals also include trying to manage a lab class over zoom calls. This class will show me how to adapt to this new online format for labs. Some of the lab at home activities will also help me get a better idea on how to work with what i have at home in order to do a proper experiment. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1309,"My goal is to get a bachelor's degree in Kinesiology at San Francisco State University as my backup major. I am taking Kinesiology classes while I am trying to apply to nursing schools. In order to obtain that goal, I would need to pass physic and the lab portion because this class is a prerequisite for biomechanics. Biomechanics is one of the major classes I need to take for the Kinesiology degree. By the end of this semester, I think I will have some background knowledge for biomechanics and I think that will be helpful with my other kinesiology classes. In addition, I hope I can become better at solving word problems and improve my math. With the help of physics, I think I will be able to get more practice and become better at it. I have never taken physics before so this experience is also expanding my knowledge."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1286,"My ultimate goal is to become an ultrasound technician. To be in a position where I'm able to help a mother through the process of her birth in the OBGYN field. Personally, I'm not interested in physics but it keeps me interested enough to wonder about the physics in our world. This is just another class for me that I have to go through in order to graduate and hopefully learn something useful along the way. Other goals is to truly involve myself in my classes so that way I can understand better and breeze through classes because it'll help in the long way. I don't think physics will matter to my degree or job in the long run but since I'm taking this class, it doesn't hurt to learn about something that I don't take into consideration from my everyday life. Even if this does not completely relate to me or my degree, I hope I can also succeed and pass this class this semester."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1304,"My  goal for this class is to learn all the materials that I need to be ready to take Physics 2. I know Physics could be a really hard subject to learn but I'm trying to learn the best way to solve the problems. I'm not really good with math and critical thinking so I find Physics really hard and I take long to do and solve all the problems. Although it takes long for me to do it, I still work hard and try to finish all my work. I know that this class would not only help me get ready for physics 2 but also help me with everyday life. Actually, taking the pre req for physics made me gain more knowledge in math which I forgot along time ago, so I'm really glad that I'm taking this class because gaining a lot of math knowledge could also help me get ready to take other math class like calculus, which I need to take in able for me to graduate. "
