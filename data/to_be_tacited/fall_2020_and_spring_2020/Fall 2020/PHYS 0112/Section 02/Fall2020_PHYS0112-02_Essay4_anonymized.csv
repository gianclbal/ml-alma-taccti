2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1289,"Katya Candray 20 October 2020 Professor Ghosh Physics 112.02 Reflective Journaling #4 The resources I have to support me is my family, my friends, my teammates, and the school. My family are the first people to support me, whether it’s to make a big decision or to help me through some issues. My friends are always there for me, as long as my teammates. Most of them feel like family so I can tell them anything. I know that I won’t be judged by them, and that they will do whatever they can. They can listen to me or they can also give me advice when I ask or need it. They’re definitely there for me when I also need to rant. The school can support me through multiple resources like counseling and even physical therapy. They have multiple resources that can help us even in this online pandemic situation. I definitely grateful for all the different resources that I have access to."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1310,"Some resources I have to support me is my professors, the library databases, resources offered on the SFSU website , and my family. I use the resources on SFSU website to help me find opportunities. My professors sometimes provide us with opportunities that I find helpful too. For instance, one of my professors in Biology gave us an opportunity to do a plant taxonomy lab internship in the Spring of 2021. Of course it will be online due to Covid 19, but it is still helpful for me because it can open up more lab opportunities for me.  I use the library database at SFSU because it has helped me find sources for not only English papers, but also research papers that I do in other courses. My family are always here to give me good advice and to support me. They sometimes find resources for me that can help me with finances. Sometimes they teach me helpful tips for finding internships, etc. These resources have somehow played a role in my success today."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1305,"Kelsey Hauf Reflective Journaling #4""What resources do I have to support me?""	The resources I have around me to support me are my parents, my friends, my professors, as well as my electronics. My parents live very far from me but they often call to see how i am doing. This is a small action but really encourages me to try my bed in order for all their efforts to be worth the trouble. I do not get to see my friends very often due to the pandemic but they are in the same classes as me and it is so nice to have people going through the same situations. They will often help me with assignments or tests if I ask. My professors have been so lovely this semester. They have been very understanding and have been quite lenient when it comes to due dates. I've never had a teacher who hasn't answered a frantic email or has misunderstood the actions of their students. I feel very supported by the science professors especially once they get a load of my 19 unit course load. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1293,"I have a lot of resources to support me. Starting with my family, my parents are always willing to help me financially and emotionally by being super supportive and great. My siblings are constantly motivating to be better than them and to strive for greatness. They are also always there if  I need help with homework. My work is a big resource for me as well because a lot of my coworkers are SFSU students and without them I would be lost without their help with iLearn and other school problems. As well as my bosses being understanding with giving me a schedule that is flexible with my school schedule. This is my first semester at SFSU so I do not really know many of the resources I have on campus since I have not really experienced it but I am sure if I looked hard enough I could find some of them online. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1295,"I have my family to support me. I live with my mom and brother and they are usually around and I also feel comfortable talking to them about anything. I also have a really good friend I open up to.But I mostly rely on music or my hobbies to support me. It makes me feel better when I listen to a nice song, to make up a tune. Since we have so much free time, I've been focusing more on making my own stuff from a few genres. I also enjoy going to the gym and weightlifting and I find that whenever I'm bored or feel bad, sometimes I'd go and every time I've felt better. My gym opened up last week, so I've been going there quite a lot. I can't wait for things to start opening up, but at the same time, I hope I don't lose this weird drive to make music because I'm usually not this motivated."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1282,"Our tuition includes several tutoring and support resources, such as eop and caarp. My personal resources would be my friends and the internet. I have friends who have taken classes I’m currently taking and learning from someone who is similarly at the same level as me helps me have a better grasp on the concept and learn it from a simpler point of view. The internet offers thousands of resources, some of my personal favorite ones would be youtube videos, such as Khan academy ones which explain a topic thoroughly and offer visuals as well, I learn really well visually. An additional resource would be study groups (group chats), we have one for this class and it is really helpful because when you forget a due date or an explanation from a problem, there is always a classmate willing to help out. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1294,"For life in general, the resources I use to support me would be family. I go to my parents and siblings to talk about personal things or just in general. Family plays an important role in my life. For school I am taking a physics sci class and it has been really helpful so far. It not only is helping me understand physics but I view them as peer help. Since they are students themselves, it makes it a little less intimidating to go to them for help. My biometry class, my professor has a couple of PAL students. I haven’t had to go to any of them for help yet, but it is really helpful knowing that they are there whenever I need help if my professor isn’t available or I just would rather go to them instead. I know SFSU has a ton of other resources available to its students, but I just never got the chance or felt the need to go to them."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1301,"The resources that I have to support me is definitely having a computer and wifi in our current situation. It is basically a necessity to have those 2 things right now because of the pandemic and most importantly since school is online. Another resource I have is having the opportunity to have a job and pay for books and other supplies that I need to succeed in school such as notebooks, pens and pencils. I have access to the internet and I have access to help when I need it. Professors are able to do office hours at certain times and help their students with any questions that they have. I have a workspace where I can do my homework and join my classes, even though my workspace is not that quiet all the time, it is quiet enough for me to do my homework and be able to listen to my professors teaching."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1309,"The resources I have to support me in this class are my friends who have taken physics before, the professor's office hours, and Chegg. Whenever I need help with a concept, I would always go to my friends first because I am more comfortable talking to them. I like discussing problems with my friends because they will time their time and provide examples to help me understand the concepts better. I used Chegg and it's an online website that has tutors. Chegg is helpful when my friend does not know how to explain the concept to me. The professor's office hours is helpful because it allows the student to ask questions during non-class time. However, sometimes office hours do not match the student schedule because they are not free during that time. Extra problems from the physics textbook is another resource because it will give me more practice on how to solve the problems."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1290,"I believe that I have a strong support system consisting of family and friends that keep me motivated to do well in school, even when I feel like giving up. Academically, I do not have many resources other than the internet. Being a first year transfer student at San Francisco State University, I am not too sure as to where I can look for resources to help me with my studies. However, in my marine biology class, a librarian taught the class how to use the SFSU library database. The database has helped me with more than just biology class. Having access to so many researches and studies is very beneficial being a STEM major. Hopefully over time, I will have found many more resources not only academically but also personally while being at SFSU. I believe that the pandemic has been a huge obstacle in my search for resources to become a better student. However, by the time I am back at SFSU in person, I hope that I can continue my search."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1302,Since going virtual for school I feel like I don’t have as many resources as I did before the pandemic. I know that there are resources out there it's just harder to find them. The resources I am referring to is tutoring and different workshops that introduce students to resources. I know that if I am in need of help immediately then my only resource would be the internet due to the fact that if I need help and is looking for a resource from school I have to schedule an appointment which doesn’t really help if I’m running low on time. Another resource that I know I  have is from some of my professors. They will help me if I had any questions by the next day or a few days it just all depends on when I send the email.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1284,"Tiffany Chang   PHY 112-02  20 October 2020  What resources do I have to support me?              There are actually a lot of resources SFSU provides such as the career advising center, advising hub, and lots more but I don’t necessarily use it. Although there are times where I attend workshops held by my department so I can obtain more information regarding the program. SFSU provides a lot of resources for me but instead of using it, I go on their websites more often because instead of seeing a person, I try to look for my answers through the websites. Often times my answers are already there and I just needed to take some time and look and read through them. I also have my family and friends to help me through their connections so I can get information for some opportunities open. I have my job at the moment because my sister worked there before so it was convenient to have my sister guide me through this job as well as through college sometimes. My sister is a great resource because she will help me (most of the time) when I ask her questions regarding my school, major, or work.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1303,"The resources that I have to support me are many, as there are a variety of ways I can be supported in this class. For one I have my fellow students, whom I can ask about a variety of questions relating to the class. Another resource is the teacher, whom I can ask either during class, during the office hour, and through email. Yet another resource that I have is the internet, which has numerous ways to learn about Physics, from videos, to PDF’s, to online classes and information providers. This all can give me a wide berth of information, which is necessary for success in the class, as I have had issues with the subject in the past as a result of my troubles in AP Physics. It is important that I have several means of resources so that I can ensure that I can succeed in this class which is important for my grade."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1288,"The resource that I have to support me would be my family and that I have my own space to do my homework. Being able to have my own space for my homework really supports me because I will be able to study and do homework in a some-what quiet place. This allows me to get my things done, even though things can happen. My family does support me because with things that can happen, they are able to do what it takes for me to be able to get my things done. Sometimes it might not be able to happen but since I work, they usually give me time and don't bother me as much. Another thing that supports me would be the professors. Things sometimes come up and I won't be able to attend class or I have wifi problems. The professors I have at the moment are very understandable and I appreciate it so much. All I need to do is communicate with my professors if I ever have a problem. Another resource that supports me is my laptop and my phone. These two things are very important because they are what allows me to get to class and it is also were I can do my assignments. It is a hassle sometimes but I do not have a point since everything is online now. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1311,"For my lab, there are many resources that support me to understand the subject. Normally the labs have these online simulations that help me visually see the physics at work. Getting a theory or movement explained to me in words can sometimes be confusing so to see an example of what actually happens helps me understand what the teacher means. I also can a further much more in depth explanation of each week's subject from my lecture class material. I have group chats with classmates from both my lab class and lecture class, that are taking the same even if it is with a different instructor, so we can work together and help each other clarify some problems we have. Of course, I can always email my instructor to get the help I need since they are mainly there to help support me. Lastly, there is always the internet where I can find the best source that makes me understand what I need. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1300,"I have many sources around me. I have my college counselor from a college program that I am attending on a scholarship and I feel as though I can really trust my college counselor and tell her my problems about school. Also, I have a college advisor for my major which will help me follow a road map for the next couple of years that I will have to complete due to me falling behind and deciding a new major in my fourth year."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1297,"I honestly do not have that many resources to support me. For one, I am living on my own and I have to pay for everything for myself and take care of all of my responsibilities by myself. For school, I have office hours to help me clarify material that I am either confused on or do not understand. It has been a really rough 7-8 months for me and I am sure for everyone else as well, but having limited resources to do anything that I need has been challenging. School has been a lot harder and finding a job then landing a job has caused me to be more stressful and exhausted. On top of that, I enjoy working out which takes a large chunk of my day and by the end of the day I am already too tired or lazy to want to do homework which makes me procrastinate. Procrastinating causes me to fall behind and falling behind makes me overwhelmed and that adds to my stress levels. Essentially everything is a domino affect and they all depend on each other. Not being able to review some of my class lectures because the teachers do not record the lecture makes it more difficult to find time to understand the material and on top of that, with the busy schedule that I have it is hard to find office hours that match up with my schedule. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,615,"For this semester or even life in general, I have many resources to help me. In this semester, I have classmates or even friends from school that help me out whenever I need help or even I help them out when they are in need of help. If they can't seem to help me then I would try to email my professors for any questions that I have. In life, I have my family and friends that support me. Whenever I am not feeling all that great they try to lift me up and keep me distracted. My friends play a huge part in my life because they only like us to grow as people and become the best versions of ourselves. Another person that plays a huge role in my life is my sister since we do have a close bond and she supports me and my decisions no matter what."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1281,"I am lucky to have my family, friends, and boyfriend to support me. I can talk to them if I am struggling with school or work. Also, my professors and classmates are available to help with homework, studying, or extensions. I am thankful that some of my professors are understanding and flexible during these uncertain times. If I feel overwhelmed by assignments I like to take a break and come back to them later. I think that although remote learning is very different from learning on campus, my professors are making an effort to be accommodating. The group chats that I have with classmates are useful. I think that additional support like study groups would be helpful. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1292,"""What resources do I have to support me?""    Living as a college student can be hard sometimes if you are doing it all by yourself, but that may not be the case for everything. For me the resource of support I have are my family especially my sister. My sister has helped me a lot this semester from figuring out how to do my assignment, how to submit them, and teaching me new information that I have not known before, and I am so grateful for that. My Dad has also been a great supporter of me, he always stood next to me during my hard times. Another resource I have that supports me are my teachers, I actually believe my teachers have been my biggest resources that supported me. My teachers always made sure that we are on top of our game, and made sure that we understand the lesson, and most importantly whenever a student needs their help or if they have a question they teacher made sure to support them with everything and make sure they are safe and not stressed. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1308,"Resources that I use to have support me are the resources I have from my physics lecture course. In my physics lecture course, my professor has our class do a forum entry and find a resource we find useful from the web every week. I find these resources very insightful, especially when learning to understand our lab topics. Sometimes I will ask my peers for help on the lab assignments. An outside resource I use that has always been very helpful for me is Khan Academy. The instructor on that website has always made any topic I could not understand very easy. He always provides many examples and even allows you to provide feedback in which he will reply. The lessons taught in my physics lecture always correlate with my labs so I find them very understanding to follow. Sometimes I will ask my physics lab instructor for help, but sometimes it is not enough. I would always recommend Khan Academy for anyone who is struggling."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1296,"The resources I have are the presentations, online and myself. If I don't get it I just go back and review it till I get it from instructions/presentations. If I still don't I look it up or just come back to it. Another way I deal with this is writing down my issues. I use youtube to have some guidance to see someone else do something similar or just explain what is the purpose of this assignment. If I can figure out the purpose of the labs I tend to have a better grasp and want to learn it. Because usually I do not find a purpose to even learn and it takes longer which creates this long cycle of waiting constantly. I try my best to learn now I believe so I can expand my mind and be able to handle more so I even make a daily log to help myself to know how much time I wasted during the day. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1283,"My primary resource to support me is myself. I am very independent and pride myself in that, although I know it is okay to have other resources for support (which I do). Some other resources I have are my friends. I have many friends that are going through, or have been through, similar experiences - this makes it easier for us to understand and support each other. Another resource I have to support me are some of my professors. Although not every professor seems approachable or willing to help, I have been lucky enough to encounter some of the most supportive professors in recent years, especially in a class that I was struggling in. I know that I have multiple resources to support me, including my family, although because they cannot fully understand what I go through and the amount of work I have to do, the extent of which they can really support me is limited. Support can be found in various sources, one just has to know where to look and in some cases, ask."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1306,"What resources do I have to support me? This is a very broad question but, in terms of mental health, I have my fiance and I use an app called betterhelp for counseling. With school, I have group chat with other students, although, since we are all learning the same thing it can be difficult to rely on fellow students. It is nice to know that someone else is going through the same thing as me though.Other than that, I guess I have myself. I've always relied on myself and even though there are people that are willing to support me, one of the toughest things to do is ask for help.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1285,Provided by SFSU there are tutors available to help understand concepts or problems. As far as the class in concerned many of the students try and help each other out because at some point or another everyone has questions. I think that is what is great during this pandemic. Everyone just wants to help. I also have chegg study because they have tutors to help understand problems or solve problems that I don't know how to solve. Every teacher also has office hours and is more than willing to help students if they don't understand something. Youtube also has some great videos. There are so many online options to try and understand something if you don't. There are also the recorded lectures in case you need to go back and review a class you missed or a concept you didn't quite grasp. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,1291,"As a student there are things that would require me to perform my studies and get through with them. As in previous semesters, I learned that having access to resources is essential. They can help and assist me in more ways than I would do alone. On the part that working thru homework, the campus tutoring center is one the most important resource centers that is available to any student. If you require a quick or walk in tutoring or an hour long tutoring they have that resource readily available.Another resources is the library  and access to digital information. It is self explanatory especially if you want to do quick look up on things even before you meet an actual tutor or even your professor. Professors can even assist you even outside class, such as job recruitment and Another resource is your college professor. They can be somewhat helpful but they can show you the way to perform a better way to your education.If other things that are available would be your peers. They can assist you in many ways even outside of campus. They can assist you in many ways that even looking for a job or a place to live.Pretty much every student struggle in college, so it is important that they can be access alot of resources."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,2,710,"Resources I have to support me include my family, my friends, and my job. My family provides me with safety and comfort in the place we live in. My family gives me unconditional love and encouragement in my pursuit of higher education and in my career. I am very grateful to them and I appreciate everything that they do for me. My friends are resources that support me with their kindness and understanding. They know me very well and are always there for me when things get tough. They always remind me when I am stressed that I work too hard and everything will pay off in the end. They also remind me that I need to take time for myself; to relax, de-stress, go out and be social, and have fun like a typical teenager. Another fantastic resource that I have to support me is my job. I work at a veterinary hospital and doing so has given me countless opportunities to gain hands-on experience in my field and talk to veterinary professionals. My job also provides me with financial stability, which is nice."
