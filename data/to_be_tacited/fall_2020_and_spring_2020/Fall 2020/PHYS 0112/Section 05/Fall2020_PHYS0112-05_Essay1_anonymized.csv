Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1357,"Why am I here?I am here to learn about physics, because we live in a world that is constantly moving and everything within it as well, and for this it is important to understand how things happen. By this I mean that we have to measure everything, quantify the everyday tasks. I one took a physics class Back in Mexico and I actually like it, because it basically explains every movement but with numbers, making it an exact replication rather than just words or imagination. I am genuinely interested in how this works, but I don't think that would be enough for me to grab a physics textbook and try to understand it all. I am a stem major and my general education requirements require me to take this class, so the fact that I find physics a little interesting will help me get through this course and learn a lot."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,625,"I am here to learn and to have a clear understanding of physics. I am currently taking physics lectures, this class will help understand the material a lot better by having one-on -one discussions with people in my lab and asking my instructor for a more detailed answer if I am stuck on a problem. Learning physics applied in everyday life even if you don't know it because for example, say you drop a ball that is physics being applied in the real world. Another reason why I am here is because in the future I want to get into the medical field to become a pediatrician and also work in a lab. By taking this class it will allow me to get to where I want to be in the future . Lastly, I am here because i enjoy learning new things and the concept of physics is very interesting to me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1358,"""Why am I here?""I am here because I want a lot of money in my life. I used to want to be a doctor but I changed opinion. To graduate with a degree that will get me a job in the area I like I have to graduate in Biochemistry. To graduate in that major I need to take a whole bunch of physics.  I will be taking physics for the next two or three years of my life and I should begin to have a good relationship with physics instead of being a stubborn procrastinator. This is a big challenge because I do not know a lot about physics and I'm learning through a computer screen. I was never the best at math but I will do my best to learn everything and get the A I want. Another benefit of completing this goal is making my family proud and inviting them to do anything they want because I will have enough money."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1359,"Jackie HernandezSeptember 2 2020						“Why am I Here”	In life, I believe that each of us has a meaningful purpose. Everyone’s purpose is different. No one has the same purpose in life. We are here to have an amazing, meaningful life that can be contributed to society. We are here to love one another and to make discoveries regarding the world. I am here to discover the joy of life. To create a life for myself in a way that helps contribute a major discovery to the world of science. As a biology major, we are here to find new ways to cure diseases and find ways to make the earth more livable in. There are two major reasons why we are here on this earth. First to create a meaningful and wonderful personal life that can be shared with another human. Second, is to create and find discoveries that future populations can use to make more discoveries in this world. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1360,"Why am i here. I am honeestlly confused on if its talking about this class or in general. If its about the class i am here because i have to be,not because i want to be. Physics is honestly a really hard class for me, i hate math and this is math on a second level it involves you to be more aware and it is a really fast paced class. I do not like physics, but i must be here.If we are talking about in life, i am not sure. I am confused n what my purpose is in life. Right now my purpose in life is just to succeed in school because this whole pandemic has made it so much harder. I feel like the professors sometimes forget we have other lasses and work, and i hate being on the screen all day. It hurts my head and eyes, not only that it is much harder to do online learning because i feel like i am pretty much teaching myself everything, as opposed to actually learning. Right now my purpose in life is to just get through this pandemic because i just want it to end and i want things to go back to normal. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1361,"I am here to further my education in science. I want to learn about physics because it is an important factor in my major and in life. I can use the information I gain here in real-life scenarios and maybe even a future job. I also would like to practice my lab work and my work ethic and doing labs each week will help that. I am a hands-on learner so this is the best learning experience for me. Even though it is online, I am learning new programs to work with and still getting a new lab experience. I wonder if I will enjoy the online lab experience better than in class. I am excited to see what I learn and the labs we will work on. I also hope to become good friends with my lab partners since we are not able to see each other in person."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1362,"I am not sure what specific aspect are we suppose to talk about whether it is personal, or about the class but there are a couple of reasons of why I am here. If we are talking in regards the class, of course I am here to learn, In our lecture class we are learning about vectors so I am guessing that is what we will be doing for this weeks lab. I am excited to see how the format of this class will be laid out since it is a Lab course.  But if we are talking about the personal matter, I am here also to learn and it is one of my requirements to take this course. Overall I am here to learn. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1363,I am here because my long term educational goal is to get a PhD in Food Chemistry. I am excited for my future goals and excited about learning Physics as a whole. The reason I am pursuing a PhD is because I do not know anyone that as one in my circle. I have several cousins that have a BA but that is all. Then I have my share of families that finish high and then start working. I want to see the other side of success. I want to go all the day and see what happens. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1364,"Why am I here? This question can have an honest and straightforward answer, which is “because this class is a requirement for my degree.” Therefore, I must complete and pass this class because I need it to receive my diploma. I also need a certificate to get into dentistry school. Why do I need a dentistry school? Because I always dreamt of becoming a dentist; therefore, this class and all my other classes have a significant impact on my life. This phrase reminds me of such purpose, I have learned before in my life that having a goal means everything. I genuinely believe that without a plan, humans would go mad. Maybe that is why many people in jail end up committing suicide? Because their purpose is no longer there, they have been there for a long time, and they no longer have a purpose. Does purpose define life? If we pay attention to life, you can see how every person serves a purpose. That one worker at Starbucks who made your coffee this morning might have a sense for obtaining that job. Their goal might be to save up money and buy a car or to buy clothes to go out. The truth is, if we lose sight of our purpose, we might lose the opportunity to achieve whatever it is that we want to accomplish in life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1365,"Ever since I was a little girl, I’ve dreamed of becoming a veterinarian. I loved animals so much that I couldn't think of anything else that would make me happier than to work with the animals that I loved so much. This is the main reason I’m here; because it is a requirement in order for me to acquire my bachelor’s degree. That being said, I plan to do my best while we are in the middle of a pandemic. On a broader note, I think about why I am in college in the first place. I’m an at SFSU because I come from a family that did not have the privilege of attending college, so I am doing it also on my family’s behalf. I hope that one day when I graduate from college and become a vet, my family will be proud of me and know that I didn’t only go it for my own benefit, but theirs as well. I also want to be able to give back to my family as much as possible, because they sacrificed so much to get me to where I am today. I am incredibly thankful for all they've done for me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1366,"I am here to gain knowledge and simply learn about the world. I find the world/earth a very fascinating place and how things work and operate blows my mind. Although most things are man made like the computer I am typing on, the earth itself is not, in my opinion. I have also wondered how things work especially how humans and our body function. As a biology major, thus far I have found the subject incredible and has allowed me to open my mind to many things and I am really excited to start practicing what I am learning. Physics on the other hand is a very confusing subject for me but i think it is very important in understanding how things work. I am still trying to find a connection between physics and biology. I see physics more as a quantitative subject and a subject that focus on number and movement. I see biology as more of an internal subject and how things live. So I am here to expand my knowledge and the connections in life because I feel like everything in this world works together one way or another."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1367,"I am here to learn the material taught in this class. I am here to do my work and turn in all my assignments on time. I am here to be an active peer and participate during my time in this class. I am attending this class to fulfill the prerequisites needed for my major. We are all here for a purpose, and as of right now my purpose is obtaining the best possible grade in this class and learning as much as I can. We all have many purposes that we must accomplish throughout our life time. I am here to gather as much knowledge as I can from this class so that I can use it in my future career. I am here for a purpose and I am here to learn. I am at the university to get a quality education so that I can accomplish my goal of becoming a Dermatologist and Plastic Surgeon. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1368,"I am here to fulfill my pre-reqs for my major, environmental science. But I do have an interest in physics. I took honors physics in highschool and I remember struggling a lot in the class but I enjoyed the challenge. Hopefully this time i'll be able to take in the topics more better than I did in high school. Disappointed that we can't have any hands-on experiment with the topics. However, I look forward to taking physics again at a college level and interested to see how it will go with an online setting instead of meeting face-to-face. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1369,"I am here to learn more about physics and motion by putting it into practice via labs. We can learn more about mechanics in physics and how it applies to everyday life, like in our machinery and other stuff. Today I assume we're going to learn about vectors and how we can use them on a coordinate plane to view motion in a simple manner.I'm here to further my education and complete requirements for my major in order to graduate. We have a lot of subjects that we need to cover and this class is another stepping stone towards that goal of being able to attain a degree that I could use in the future.I have the goal of becoming a forensic scientist or to be in some field of forensics. I just find it to be an interesting subject that we could apply everywhere else. Physics, chemistry, biology and other scientific subjects need to be applied to it in order to figure out problems in the real world."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1370,"Why am I here? I am here because I want to learn more about physics. This class has been a challenge for me because I am weak in pre-calculus. I am also here because I need to take this class to fulfill my GE as well as a requirement for my major. I want to use my skills learned in this class to learn more about the world (mostly how physics affects the environment and how we can better sustain and grow our earth) and how physics and laws of motion and angles dictate the body. As a kinesiology major I want and need to know how our body moves, the limitations of our body, and how our body reacts or its relationship with the world (such as gravity). The importance of understanding forces and motion will help me better understand how our muscles grow, certain exercises and why we prescribe them, and why our body got injured due to certain forces. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1371,"This essay is meant to connect you to your purpose. This is not meant to be a formal essay. It should be stream-of-consciousness writing from the heart. You will be graded on participation only, not on the specifics of what you say. 5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150-200 words.  After you finish your essays, we will provide some class time to discuss your thoughts, to the extent that you feel comfortable sharing.I’m here in physics 111 to learn to analyze raw data, keep a lab notebook and improve my critical thinking skills to further my progress in environmental science.  I need the prerequisite just as much as anyone else and besides, that’s a pretty mundane reason to include. I’m not really sure what else to include here as ill likely have a greater appreciation for the coursework once I’ve learned it as opposed to before having finished."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1372,"I am here to receive my education. I think that physics is a very intersitng topic that is used in our everyday lives. For example, forces when driving and gravity are used contsantly and we never think about it. I think that the concepts behind how motion works is very fascintating. I am taking this class not only becuase it is required for my desired major, but also becuase I find it interesting. I took a physics class durign high shcool and I found the labs to be very helpful. I think that physics is a very visual science that requires labs in order to be understood. Personally, I think that the labs in physics are very fun and educational. My prior experience during my high school was never boring. I am excited to see what this virtual lab will bring, even though I know it will be a little more challenging to get the same experience as face to face classes. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1373,"Answering why I am here is a question that can be taken from different angles. Are we discussing why I choose to be in this class, why I choose to study online, or why I am who I am, where I am? These are variations in perspective, ranging between scientific to philosophic. I am not certain why I am here on Earth. Surely there must be some metaphysical being that allowed for nature to give rise to such a dominating force of animals. Humans grow, adapt, learn from their mistakes, and love. There is no reason or rhyme to why each of us are here, but it is our duty to discover what that means for us, individually. Finding your purpose is just as important as breathing. If we fail to find our purpose, we find questions like ""Why am I here?"" difficult to answer. However, I believe I have found mine. I am here in class because I aspire to help people regain motion in their body by being a physical therapist. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1374,"I am here to learn about the how the universe works in depth. The way that matter and energy interact. I want to learn these things not only conceptually, but mathematically, and understand them in terms of numbers and equations. This relates to my greater sense of purpose as a human being to gain knowledge throughout my life, because I believe that knowledge is power. I am here to learn as much as a can about the universe so that I can eventually contribute to making a positive change for the Earth and/or humanity. The only way I can make a positive change is to understand the way that the world and the universe works, and I can do that with science. This is why I am a chemistry major. I want to either go into research in medicine or environmental science. Science is power! I think that science is one of my main purposes as a human being."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1375,I am here because i'm majoring in computer science and this is a pre-requisite to the other classes i'm going to have to take later on. As well as covers some requirements for graduating. I believe i'm here to better my understanding of physics so it will benefit me in the career I am studying for. My purpose would be to become a video game programmer which requires me to understand physics. I feel as though its important and overall something I wouldn't mind being at. Even though physics is a hard subject for me to learn I am willing to put in the effort in understanding it
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1376,"That is an interesting question to answer ""why am I here"". Honestly, did not expect to answer something on the topic of philosophy in a physics class. That being said I am here because I am here. I am here because a certain sperm reached and pierced a certain egg first. I am here because I did not have any complications in development. I am here maybe even due to some miracle or grace of God. In the end, in my opinion, it really does not matter why I am here but what I plan on doing form now on. I plan on moving forward with the many lessons I have encountered. I will let the experience I have gained so far to be the wind at my back as I traverse the unknown parts of life. P.S.: I thought I submitted this yesterday but iLearn did a goof and now I am here redoing this from my fragile memory, I certainly hope I got the same gist from it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1377,"""Why am I here?"" For starters, I am here for a number of reasons. In all reasons, I am sure that many things happen for a reason, at divine alignment (when you let things flow in the universe).Given that Physics 112 is a undergraduate pre-requisite to my intended M.D. program of study, I am required to be in this course. I have graduated undergrad and completed my physics pre-requisites already, BUT because I completed them abroad in Europe, the credits are not valid for admission into U.S. M.D. medical schools, therefore I must use this opportunity in my post-bac program to revisit these courses and do the best I can before the upcoming application cycles. Second, I also am here for another reason besides technicalities...but on a universal level. When I say that, I mean: the idea of revisiting Physics is not solely to make a living hell in my life, but to allow me to refine my quantitative reasoning skills before taking MCAT, and to thoroughly learn physics in its bits and pieces like I did not receive that chance to before. Previously, I was rushed through an 8-week Physics program and received a decent grade in the end. BUT I did not really learn the topic how I should have. Therefor, this revisit of the course allows me to step back and learn the topic better in time for the MCAT where I will need these skills. This class was chance for me to 'double-back' and practice more on perfecting my craft. Although I did not ask for this process at this time...it came to me at the perfect timing. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1378,"My name is Laura Ornelas and I am here to help complete my degree and graduate so I can be able to work along side athletes or become a personal trainer. I am very nervous cause I constantly wonder if I chose the right major or not. Sports is the only thing i know a lot about and staying active is something that has always been a part of my life and i figured since i have the most knowledge and i love it, it would be the best option for me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1379,"I am here for a purpose. I strongly believe that we are all here for a reason and finding your purpose is what life is. many are lost within themselves because they have not found their purpose. Your purpose doesn't have to be changing the world, it could be something as simple as bringing joy to someone by providing your delicious donuts, simply because you owe or work at a donut shop. Finding meaning to what you do bring enjoyment and clarity to your life because you aren't constantly asking why am I doing this or why am I here. I got into the mindset of I am here for a purpose and try to find the importance from everything I do in life. Also I got into the mindset that I am choosing to be there and that is why I am here, in middle school we felt forced to go to school. College is completely up to you so I don't go into my classes with the mindset of why are we even learning this. I know I am there because I am choosing to learn and pursue the career I want. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1380,"I think I am here as of right now because I want to be able to do well in the present and in the future. I want to be able to help my family, be able to graduate, find a good job in the future, etc. I guess it's called the ""American Dream"" that people would believe they'll be able to achieve. I want to be able to make my parents, family, and friends happy because of what I can do and show them that I can do it. Even though I struggled throughout school, I was able to make it through even if it doesn't go my way. I think the saying you learn and you grow is kind of my motto. Hopefully, with these mistakes that I made, I will be able to grow and improve. Though I can't really predict my future, I hope I'll be able to make people happy and find a career in the medical field since I'm still unsure now. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1381,"I'm here to move through my degree requirments. But also because physics plays a huge role in our daily lives so I want to be able to have a deeper understanding how it works. This is my first physics class I've taken since freshman year of high school and I didn't do so good in that class because I thought I wouldn't do anything with sciences or math so why bother learning this. As I got older and figured out what I wanted to study and do my life, I grew an interest for all science courses but especially physics since it's an everyday thing.  I'm excited to learn about physics and finally gain the understanding that I should've gained in high school. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1382,"I am here because physics is a pre requisite for applying to physical therapy school. Though I need this class for a pre-req, I have enjoyed taking physics in the past and I hope to share this positive experience with this class as well. I'm also here at SFSU to pursue a career that I really enjoy, I have worked in a physical therapy clinic for the past year and it's something that I really want to do. Hopefully through my time here at SFSU I can meet new people and have an overall good experience. "
