A lot of my family work jobs all the way past their 60's here in America and back home they'd work farms well past their 70's (whether it's just to manage it or toil the fields as well). My mom was the first to go to college here in my family and me and my sister will be the second generation to do so. She went to SFSU so she can be a big help a lot, but most of the time she says to contact advisors as they'll be the best help we can get in the school. I'm fairly independent as well so I have been able to navigate through college just fine by myself. When in doubt, I turn to the internet. If the internet doesn't help, I go to my school sources."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1377,"During college, I experienced a lot of self-navigation, having to rely on extrinsic resources in order to succeed. Like many students who would have a support system to guide them and catch them when they fell, I did not have that. However, I was blessed in alternative ways, being able to go to mentors and peers when I needed anything. I felt alone, but I was not totally alone. I had my community for support. ""It takes a village."" I have no one but God to thank for that. Amen. "

My parents have always taught me as a kid to be self-determined, my dad grew up in a poor country where he was the only one in his family to reach a higher education.

2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1364,"I come from a poor family and lived more than half of my lived in Mexico. When I was about 12 years old, I came to live in the US with my stepdad and my mother. As a kid I never saw my self attending college much less pursuing a career in dentistry. The main reason I did not see myself attending college was because my parents never finished elementary school. My parents lived in rural areas as kids and they were never interested to attend college or pursue a career. Now that I’m older I notice that I’m the first one in my family to attend college and even the first one to pursue a career in the medical field. I never really noticed this, but it is really hard to stay focused and to do well in school especially when you do not have anyone in the family who has worn those shoes before."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1374,"The values of my family have kept me motivated and focus to do good in school so that I can be independent and stand on my own two feet, hopefully within a few years. I come from an Indian family, and in the past, women were expected to move from their parents house to their husband's house. My parents and my aunt have always told me that this is not what they want for me. They want me to be able to make my own money and be able to fully support myself, and if I do want to live with someone I love, it would be by choice. I would still have the option to live on my own. "

I soon realized that I wanted to major in Biology so from then on they have also helped me with just being there for me when I needed help. Also, when I needed someone to talk to and was feeling a little frustrated they have been there to calm me down and believe in me as well. Lastly, my parents have graduated from university, so they would always give me some pointers in having better study habits and organization. Honestly, both my family and my community have been a huge support system and I will always be thankful and appreciative of them for it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1373,"The values of my community and family helped me navigate through college by pushing me to stay persistent in my studies. It's difficult to adhere to their standards, which comprise of straight A's, no sick days, and no excuses. It was like that growing up, I never missed a day because I was sick and I never gave myself an excuse to earn anything less than an A. In college, these standards have helped me maintain good grades while juggling two jobs. However, most of what I learned by navigating through college was mostly from stuff I had learned myself. I'm the eldest child out of my siblings, and my dad transferred into SF State in the middle of his college career, in a whole different major (computer science) than what I'm pursuing (kinesiology). I didn't have much guidance coming into the university scene."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1370,"My family values helped me navigate through college because I grew up believing that learning and gaining knowledge is significant for personal development, career, and societal understanding. My Asian household has always valued and praises those with high levels of education. Which is why I tend to take more challenging courses in college. Though offered to take the less challenging classes, I tend to gravitate towards the higher level courses. I think this is due to how my family views education but also how I view myself. I want to hold myself as someone who can take on challenges and succeed. Although this is not true all the time. This physics class is an example. I am not naturally talented in math and physics and so this class is extremely challenging for me. I wish I could understand the concepts from the first time that I hear it but I find myself often studying the concept multiple times. I have to put in a lot more effort into this class compared to others and sometimes it makes me feel unmotivated and depressed because this is not how I usually am with my studies. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1378,My family has been very supportive of me entering college and they motivate me to complete my education as far as I can go. Having all of my closest friends also enrolled in college with similar majors as me is also very helpful and fun because we are able to have intellectual conversations about what we are learning in each of our classes. This is all important to me because if I didn't have these people in my life motivating me to continue my education I would have dropped out by now.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1365,"Growing up in a predominantly Black/ African American neighborhood, my family has always taught me that I should strive to be my best. This means that they expected me to go to college, help out in the community, and everything else to aid me and my community to grow and stem away from the negative connotations that come with this ethnic background. Throughout my years I have come across many people who have said hurtful and nasty things towards me and I find that getting my education and working hard is my way of proving them wrong. African Americans are one of the many minorities that are underrepresented in the education system and looked down upon in academia. With my education, I want to show the younger generations of my family that anything is possible and that it is worth it. I want a chance to prove everyone wrong who doubted me and thought I wouldn't amount to anything. I want those negative connotations surrounding the Black community to go away and show others that we can achieve just as much as everyone else if not, more."

They definitely do push me everyday to be better. Since the very beginning they have been supportive and attentive with everything I needed. The values from my family and my community are very different. I live in a predominant minority community. Many of the people here do not go to college the highest school level they ever finished was high school and that is if they didn't get dragged into a gang. So my community has really made me push harder to finish college.

However, know more then ever, I am happy that I have a broken heart, because right now during the corona virus, there are other people without food, shelter, and medicine. I am very grateful. Other countries like Honduras is covered with water because of the weather. I am grateful to have my family  with me.

2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1359,"Throughout my life, I have watch my family make major milestones. My brothers were the first one to graduate high school, this was really inspirational because they believed that we could do better than they did. My sister and I were the first ones to go to college. We excelled really well in high school and we had bigger aspirations so we believed that college was right for us.

2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1366,I come from a family who hasn't had the luxury or ability to attend College and both of my sibling have decided to take different paths so being a first generation Latina college student and the first child to go to a University away from home has been challenging but I think what keeps be going is my desire to show people like my self and people within my community that it is possible for a low income Hispanic women with no higher education family background to keep pushing forward and get a degree and work in the career of her/his dream. Knowing that I won't only have the job of my dreams but be a role model to other in my community and be a resources for the next generations helps me stay motivated and navigate me through college. Lastly what also keeps me going is knowing that my parents didn't have the luxury and that I do and that I have the ability to take advantage of it I should and make them proud !
