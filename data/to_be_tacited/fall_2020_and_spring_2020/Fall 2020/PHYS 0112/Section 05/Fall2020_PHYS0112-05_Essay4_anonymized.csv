2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1362,There are many resources that I have to support me. When it comes to this class i have my professor to help me If i need help with something but of course i have my classmates to help me. It would be easier if we all work together and asked each other questions if we do not understand the concept. Another resource that I have to help me/ support me would be the power points that are given to us and the stimulations that are a really big help to understand the concepts. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1365,"Some resources I have that really help me out is the group chat for this class, a GroupMe. There aren't many people there, but the people we do have, they are very helpful in explaining things to the best of their ability. And since we are in the same section, we can compare answers and see where we messed up or made a mistake when calculating something. Another resource I use quite often is google and youtube. I use google when I forget a formula or when I need to find more in-depth explanations about certain concepts we are learning about. I use YouTube when I need a visual to how to solve problems like the ones we are doing in the lab. Sometimes I have to hear something being explained more than once to really get a good understanding of what we are looking for in certain problems, especially word problems. But other than that, I sometimes ask my peers from my lecture section if they are going over similar things in their labs, and go from there. Overall, most of my resources are the internet and my peers, and they have been very helpful so far. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1378,The resources I have to support me are the group chats I have and sometimes the videos by prof. Anderson. I also get a lot of help from my mom who took physics as well she's a bit rusty but she still somewhat understands what I am doing. I also enjoy the simulations we run during lab because I am a visual learner it helps seeing what we are applying the concept to.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1376,"I have a lot of resources available to help me. I have all the resources on iLearn that each of my professors provides me. This includes powerpoints, recorded lectures, quizzes, tests, and homework. There really is not much worth going deeper into this. I would say the counseling offered for emotional support could also be something to mention but I do not make much use of that.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1381,"I'm lucky enough to have a bunch of resources that can I help either physically and/or emotionally especially when it comes to school. I attended a high school that when you graduate, you are offered a $10,000 scholarship plus college support counselors. I'm able to meet with them if I have any troubles regarding school and they help me find resources that are offer at my school. I have family as a resource if I ever need help, my mom tries her absolute best especially during covid making sure that I have strong wifi. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1367,"I have many resources that support me. In this class alone, I have the support of my classmates as well as the support from my professor. It especially hard during these times, due to the pandemic, but with the support of those around me I am doing well and excelling. I have the support of all my professors since they are very understanding and work with us so that we do not stress out more than we need to. I also have my class resources such as the material that really help when I am confused or stuck on any problems. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1370,"I personally know and have a lot of resources around me because I was active in my communities, including at SFSU. I know that SFSU has a tutoring program called TASC which is usually located in the library but still offers online tutoring help for any subject taught at SFSU. When we were in person the health center also helped me when I had a sore throat or was not feeling well. The health center also give our Band-Aids and hand sanitizer free to all students. Additionally, for my major we have the Kinesiology Student Association (KSA) that hosts workshops, career and academic events, and more for those in the department. It is also a way for me to get to know other Kinesiology students so we can build friendship and resources. In my community I have the Vietnamese American community center which offers resources for the elderly, viet culture awareness, and celebrations including our annual new years festival (Tet). "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1357,"WHAT RESOURCES DO I HAVE TO SUPPORT ME?Our everyday life disappeared with the pandemic as well as many of our resources. Learning has been quite challenging for me this semester since I'm more of a visual learner and all our science classes and labs are being taught through zoom. Despite the changes we've been through we still have new ways to learn and new resources as well; like the lab simulations which we can see in line, we have youtube channels that could reassure our knowledge and we have textbooks. Another resource worth mentioning is office hours , and supplementary classes, which I think are very helpful. I have been learning much easier with the supplementary class I'm enrolled in. lectures and labs have been more difficult now more than ever to me so i also appreciate the reading and information that is posted before our lecture meeting in order to be prepared to understand the information we will be given. This is like a heads up of what we will be talking about and helps me be acquainted with the information on lectures. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1372,"I have many resources to support me. Some of these resources include the interent, my classmates, my professors, and the online lab simulaitons. All of these resources are helpful for my understanding of the class. I find the simulation most helpful because it allows me to see the graphs and vissually see how some of the examlpes talked about in class would look. The graphs that come along with the simulation are also helpful to help me understnad the topics talked about in class. For example, the graphs for potential energy and kinetic energy were depicetd with the simulation and I found it very helpful to help me understand when each energy is at their maximun and minimun. I also find the powerpoint slides about each topic to be vey helpful as well. I wish they would show more examples. I also tend to watch some youtube videos about each concept and topic I find challenging. I think that hearing a different explanation can be helpful to my understanding as well. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1359,The resources that I have in this class is to support is the lecture and lab professors. I also have textbook resources that I can use to fill the gaps of information. I also have my peers that can be useful when studying for an exam or for simply asking a question that doesn’t required the professor to ask me. I also have the internet which is a very important tool right now since it is online school. I also have all the notes from class that can help when I need reminding. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1358,"What resources do I have to support me?The most valuable resources I have available to me are my family. My parents and my brothers are biggest supporters and always help me get through my day. Whenever I do not find the strength to complete a difficult task I remember them and always try harder. My family makes sure I am being responsible and that I eat well. For example, my mother would always make sure I went to school early and with a clean uniform every single day of class. I am also very lucky to have enough food in my house to spare and not fight hunger. Other resources I have to support me could be my friends. Although I do not expect them to always be there for me, my friends make me feel happier. Having other people to talk to outside my family is great because I get various perspectives on everything. My friends push me to be better and also worry about my well-being. Another resource to support me is myself. I have pushed and carried myself to grow stronger and better before, so I should find no reason to stop."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1371,"I want to refrain from a simple wrote memorization list, though the topic tempts me. As I do not have the use of my laptop's webcam I'm relegated to using my phone for zoom and all things virtual. My old phone would overheat and throttle my video and consume 40-60% battery per hour. Recently I was able to upgrade to a phone that supports my ability to participate virtually much better. I'm presently blessed with a quiet space that doesn't infringe on my ability to participate, though it is often lonely. I have the resource of office hours and professors available by email though this is a meagar substitute for in person interaction."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1377,"In order to succeed in academics, I not only rely on my professor and self-study for understanding, but also on my peers to engage in material and exchange ideas from one another. I like to work with other students to find understanding, given our similar levels of education and language spoken to one another. I sometimes find it easier to understand material when taught by my peers, rather than the actual professor. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1374,"I have lots of sources to support me. I have my classmates, friends, family members, and my boyfriend. During quarantine, I spent a lot of time feeling alone, I admit. It has been very difficult for me to keep my mental health in check, and it got so bad that I began having a lot of the physical symptoms of anxiety. It has been very scary, but I must remember that I do have a support system. When it comes to school, I will succeed if I reach out to my teachers and classmates when I need help. When it comes to moral support I have the people in my life who I love, and who love me. I am grateful for my friends, family, and my boyfriend. Even though I can't see them all the time due to current circumstances, I must remember that they are still there for me. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1363,"The resource I have to support me right now would be food stamps, stipend money, free counseling online, and access to free food banks when and if needed. I also have the support of my professor, family and friends. Other then these mentioned here I do not have any other or at least none that I can think of right now. However, I think these are sufficient for me at the moment. Oh, yes another resource would be YouTube. I can always look up a meditating, ""I am"" affirmation and positive speech videos online. Books are a great resource to find other help or other resource that I might not be able to find online."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1364,"What resources do I have to be able to succeed and have good grades in all of the classes is a question that I do not quite ask myself a lot. Given my circumstances, the only resources I ever used before in this university are the VA assistance; they are always an email away to help me resolve any questions I might have in mind. Other different resources that I think SFSU used to have been like a dentistry group that allowed all the students to consider a path to dentistry to really communicate and help out one another. I Have tried to look for the group in our school but apparently, they no longer get together due to the small number of students seeking help. I also recently, like this weekend, receives an email about tutoring for different classes. I think this would have come in handy when the semester was barely starting. 3 weeks before the semester is over might not be as helpful to the students as it would be since the beginning of the semester."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1375,"I would say that I have a lot of resources that support me. The resources I have are mostly online. Some examples would be youtube, Khan Academy, links that the professor gives. These resources are very beneficial and helpful to me because sometimes i struggle understanding the material that is being taught. I am able to teach myself and understand during my free time. I don't usually ask questions because im a reserved person, so these resources are very helpful and when i am somewhat lost "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1366,"I haven't really thought about this but in general when it come to my education if I am willing to expand my network I believe that I would actually have a really good resource list like my family, friends, EOP, Metro, Biology department, my Physician society and more. For me I think it is more of just getting out of my comfort zone and stepping out there and start to communicate with people and ask for help rather than struggling on my own. I feel that I haven't really used my resources that are available to me  just because I don't know hot to get out there and people students like my self aren't really taught how to expand their network and how to communicate with people to ask for help when it comes to educational academic or even real world. Im currently struggling to find a clinic to work on my hours and i think one main reason i am struggling so much is because I haven't utilized the resource available to me, so I guess what I learned today an came to a realization about is that I actually have good resources to support me in my academic and  personal life I just have to get out of my comfort zone and be willing to step out there and work for what I truly want."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1373,"I have a lot of resources to support me. I adopted a cat last night, and animals help with emotional and stress relief. I named her Honey, and she is the sweetest, calmest cat ever. I also have a boyfriend I live with, and I tell him everything and like to keep an open dialogue about things going on in our lives like family, school, food, etc. It's lovely to think about how both of these support systems are in such close proximity to me. I'm grateful to wake up with them and sleep with them. The quarantine has helped me appreciate all the little things I have back home. I don't know if I'll acclimate to going back to normal very well--I am very much enjoying myself here at home. I love being near the two support systems I love the most. They keep me calm, level headed, and particularly elated throughout these days of staying indoors. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1368,I have my family to support me in these difficult times and I also have my teachers and school resources to aid me in my times of needs. I go to the ones I love when i find myself in a difficult position and they always lend a hand for me. I have no doubt that my teachers and counselors will do the same. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,625,"Resources that I have at home to support me would first be my family and friends. My family and friends are a great support system because when I am feeling down or if I need help on an assignment they try figuring out ways that can help me. Also, another resource that I have would be my phone, laptop, and ipad. Without these resources it would be hard for me to do assignments or even be caught up in all my online classes. Another resource that supports me would be music, and listening to podcasts because it helps me calm down and I also realized that when I am listening to classical music while doing an assignment I fell a lot more focused and motivated to finish my work. Podcasts also push me to do better because the ones that I listen to reassure me that things will get better and to keep working hard even when everything seems like it is difficult."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1361,"Some resources I have to support me are people such as my sister, my parents, and my friends. They can help me through emotional and mental problems and problems with school. I also have my professors to reach out to in case there are problems with school. I have my advisor as well, who can help me with my questions about college."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1382,"The resources that I have to support me are my friends, the internet, and my professors. Generally I try to ask the internet first if I can't figure out a problem but if that doesn't work then I try asking my friends. Luckily for me one of my closest friends is a physics major so if I have any questions about our class I just ask him. But I also do try to ask you (the professor) some questions through email whether it be homework related but I don't always get a reply back but it's okay. I feel lucky to have resources like this to support me and I feel like they have really helped me with this class. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1369,"I believe that SF State has a lot of resources that I could use whenever I need help in my studies if I'm falling behind or am just not able to grasp the material that is being taught to me. I'm not sure if they're all closed down due to the pandemic or if they have virtual versions, but if they do then if I need them then I can surely look for them online. If I can't use those, then I have the majority of the internet to help me with my studies, like YouTube or online websites that can help with specific topics and subjects I'm having trouble on. If all else fails, then I do have people I can rely on that can support me and recommend stuff that can allow me to do better in my studies. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1360,"I feel like I have a lot of resources to support me. I am a bit confused o what context we are talking bout but i assume ti si referrignt ot school. If that is the case then I feel like sources have been provided by the school and all that. I dont use them as much as i should becuase I honestly just dont have time for anything these days. But i do use youtube a lot. I think that is such a resourceful tool that we have and its great because it is free. When i have a hard time understanding soemthing I look up youtube videos on it and there are so many that i am bound to figure it out. I also use google to help me understand as well. But yeah other than that I dont really know of any outside resources, I know we can also email professors tohelp us but as for me I think youtube is really helpful."
