2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1365,"Over the past several months I have been trying to find ways to keep my mental, emotional, and physical health well while being in quarantine. Being stuck in the house and being afraid to go outside has been one of the main problems I have come face-to-face with since the whole pandemic started and I've had to become creative in order to stay sane. Also, being stuck in the house with my whole family can be a little sticky sometimes so I had to be sure to keep myself happy. One thing I do regularly to keep myself in check is to take some time from myself and meditate. No phone, no tv, or anything, and at this time I reflect on my days. Sometimes when I meditate I also do a face mask or light a candle to relax me even further. But since it is not just familial problems and school has been back in session, I have learned that sometimes I get very overwhelmed and when this happens, I have to take a step back from what I'm doing and take a breather. And aside from this, music, and physical movement, like dancing, also helps me when I have a lot of pent up energy or emotions."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1363,"When life get challenging, I cry. There are days when I will journal or meditate, however, on my breaking points, I simply cry and stay in bed all day despite that fact that I have a lot of homework due. During this semester in quarantine, it has been difficult in that my internet connection can be very good one week and then bad another. I watch motivational videos to uplift me at times. I try to re-evaluate my time, schedule and classes. But sometimes the quarantine simply makes me feel lonely and I stop everything and just cry my pain away. I know this is temporary and no matter what I do, I will not stop, however days of break down are important for the well being because it is not healthy to hold things in. After my phase has passed, I go back to catching up on what I missed in all my classes and trying to get my rhythm back."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1370,"Something that I do when life gets challenging is that I try to have some alone time to myself. I think the space where I can think and freely recognize my emotions are important. I am also an introvert so being alone is helpful for me. I sometimes try to reach out to friends to talk about the issue but often times I find it hard to share. I think I am also afraid of their judgement and I find myself not ready to hear what others have to say, because often times they are trying to fix the problem when in reality there is nothing to fix sometimes. I also like to listen to music when life gets hard. My pets are also a really good emotional support system, so I like to be with them and take care of them. When I am with my dogs, I feel cared for and I can also care for them even when I am feeling down. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1371,"When life gets challenging I sit down and update my calendar, it keeps me organized and releases some of my anxiety. I also tend to go for drives to nowhere. This isn't particularly good, but it makes me feel better. I also tend to organize, im not sure if this is to genuinely facilitate my productivity or to simply distract from whatever it is that's stressing me out. I end up staying up later which can contribute to a positive feedback loop of poor sleep habits if I don't make an effort to get ahead of it. I also tend to my plants, I maintain a collection of carnivorous plants and they require a higher than average level of specialized care that's quite rewarding when done right. Currently I'm culturing fruit flies alongside the plants for a natural, self sustaining food source. They also require some care and seeing the whole thing work takes some stress away."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1372,"When life gets challenging, I like to write a list of tasks I need to complete. This helps me organize the different tasks I need to do into different categories such as homework, chores, and miscellaneous. When I cross off one of the tasks, I feel more motivated to do more. I also like to organize my room when I am feeling stressed. Reorganizing my room helps me clear my mind before I decide to be productive. Sometimes I decide to sleep to aviod my problems. There are also times where workout in order to feel better about my life when it gets challenging. I will also taslk to my friends and family. I will also try to do yoga or meditate becuase it helps clear my mind when life gets challenging. I try to use my resources to the best of my ability when I am stressed and when life is challenging. I will try to go outside more or play with my dog. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1368,When life is challenging--like in these times that we're in--I have my family and my wife that supports me through thick and thin. They are always there when I feel myself falling and are always responses/willing to help when I call for them. They are my pride and strength and I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for my family and especially for my wife. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1382,"For me, when life gets tough I try to think about all the positive things I have going in life. I also try to think of ways that I could put myself in a better situation for when something like this happens again. I also like to revert to my hobbies as a stress reliever if I really can't do much about the situation. I try not to worry about things that I don't really have any control over or if something already happened then you really can't do much about it. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1377,"When life gets challenging, I tend to do whatever I can to make that present situation better. Depending on the challenge, I act accordingly. From small scale to large scale, I would either look into myself for the solution (which can be a blessing and a curse) or I look into mentors or peers for insight on a solution. Before I go to others to help with my situation, I would try myself and depend on myself to find a solution. This can be a good thing if I have the proper tools to overcome an obstacle, but at the same time, I do not always have the proper tools to do so. With that, it would limit me from the many forms of help I could be receiving had I been open and vulnerable enough to go to outside resources. I am working on trying more outside sources for help when life gets challenging because you never know where a gem is hidden when you step outside of yourself. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1364,"When life gets challenging, I always choose between two things either to act right away or not pay too much attention to whatever it is and move on with my life. Both of these I consider bad examples of what someone should do when times get roughs. Now that I look back at some choices I have made in the past, I can acknowledge that many have been poor choices. Let us take a break and breath; I feel like as a human when life gets challenging, the first thing we want to do is act most likely because we feel trapped and underwhelmed by the challenges around us. After taking a few hours of breathing and being calm, we should think about our options and make a pros and cons list of our different options. Next, we must carefully pick and option and follow. This last step is pretty important; we should stick to the planned, re-read why we have a plan in motion, and why we must follow it. I want to implement this plan in my life because I feel like I would get the best results."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1374,"When life gets challenging, I look within myself and let my intuition guide me in my next steps. I rationalize what my best option would be. One thing I learned from taking Holistic Health was to think of what the worst case scenario is, and how unlikely it is to happen. This helps to ease my conscience a bit. I always try to ground myself to prevent over-thinking, so I meditate a lot. I try to clear my mind of negative thoughts and emotions so that I have a clear and rational state of mind.This might sound funny, but positive affirmations also help me. I repeat phrases that reflect a positive mindset, even if I do not necessarily believe them at the time. The more positive affirmations I listen to, the more positive and relaxed I actually become. I struggle with anxiety, and this only gets worse when life becomes challenging, so these are some things to help me manage that."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1381,"When life gets challenging, I tend to get extreme anxiety because I'm not sure how to figure out the solution to the situation or even approach the situation.  But I learned how to calm my anxiety and focus on my thoughts to approach the problems. So depending on the challenging situation, I could face the challenge in different ways. For one example, when I have a lot of homework from my classes with a short time period to do them all, I write down a list of the assignments in order of when they're due and how long it will take the assignment to be completed. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1375,"When life gets challenging I take a step back to see what I can do to overcome this challenge. I also try to make time for myself to relax and destress. This includes doing things i like such as, listening to music, playing video games, just relaxing and watching videos on my phone, and napping. All of these things help me to relax so I can later face the challenge and have an open mind on whatever the challenge is. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1369,"When life gets challenging I just try my best to get it back under control by taking simple steps into achieving that goal. If I'm overloaded with obligations and tasks that need to be done, I write them all down and make sure I don't miss any. This way I can see everything that I need to do and pick and choose which to do first to make sure that I get everything done. I can get overwhelmed many times, but this helps me lift some of the burden off by seeing which is easier to complete and then giving myself time for the harder ones to do.For other times that aren't related to school, I would just immerse myself into other things so that I could get my mind off of whatever is making my life challenging at that very moment. Whether it be in school work or videogames or some other hobby that I'm into at that very moment."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1376,"In the end, there are only two options when it comes to answering the question ""what do I do when life gets challenging?"" You either give up and roll over or you decide to push back against the fate that has been dealt to you. When I break it down to these simple roots, the answer may seem obvious. However, hardships are never easy, it is in the name after all. The answer more often than not is to keep fighting, especially for the goals you have in life. However, sometimes knowing when to give in and be humble about your situation is a different strength in its own right. In the end, a simple question with two possible answers is really not as simple as one could think. I would like to believe that I make the right of the two decisions more often than not, but an added facet to that is sometimes you will never know if you even made the right call ultimately."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1361,"When life gets challenging I keep trying. Although it hurts every time it does not work out, I keep going. I think what drives me is success. I want to see myself succeed because I know I am capable of achieving anything I put my mind to. I feel confident in my abilities so I use that to drive me to keep trying."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,625,"When life gets challenging, I try to take a little break from what I need to do so I don't over react to that situation and try to treat myself. For example, I would probably do things that would make me happy such as having a self care day, put on a face mask, get my nails and toes done and probably just read a book. I also find working out a really good option to release some stress that I have because it helps me clear my mind. While running, I would listen to either music or podcasts that keeps me motivated and not to give up when things become hard. Another thing that helps me would be creating a music playlist with all my favorite songs. Lastly, I like to cook, so I would either cook something healthy like different vegetables with rice and chicken as comfort food instead of ordering unhealthy food."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1373,"When life gets challenging, I like to take a step back and remind myself who I am. I say, ""My name is ___, I'm __ years old, I love to play volleyball and do a long skincare routine, and I'm in school because I want to become a Physical Therapist."" I remember my purpose and what I need to do to achieve my goals. I practice being appreciative and thankful for what I have in this point in time, and for the events leading me to where I am now, and who I am now. This is a process I usually do to calm myself down before I sleep for the night, or whenever I'm outside feeling mindless regarding doing mundane things like chores or running errands. I'm grateful that I'm alive to experience what I am able to experience. All difficulties given, I believe we are in a great period of time to be existing. I don't see wars in my front door, younger generations are speaking up about freedom and equality, I have a checking and savings account, and I have people that love me. These factors help me through challenging points in life, especially when I feel like I'm drowning in things to do and deadlines to meet. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1366,"As we all know life isn't easy at all especially as a college student trying to balance your academic life and your personal  life. I am a very out going and adventurous person so I love being out doors and now that classes are online and we are living in a pandemic its so much harder to do outdoor activities. When I start to experience hard, stressful moments and life   starts to get challenging whether it's due to my studies or my personal life I get into very spiritual vibe, so when life gets challenging I love to practice yoga and meditation. I found that prating yoga on a daily basis and practicing yoga Nidra (mediation) once in a while really grounds me and makes me feel more at ease. I am also a Professional dancer so dancing  also really helps me when I am facing a  challenge. Dancing is a curative outlet that allows me to express my self not through words but through movement expressing my emotions and expression which i think is more impactful than words can ever say."
