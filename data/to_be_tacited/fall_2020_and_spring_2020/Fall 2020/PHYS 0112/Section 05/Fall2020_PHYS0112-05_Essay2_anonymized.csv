2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1370,"Some of my goals are... Personal : short term goal: to grow my relationships with family including my dad, mom, siblings, and cousins who live in San Diego. Although it takes a lot of effort to spend time with family who are far away, I hope to learn how to prioritize them in a way that does not disregard myself. Personal and academic short term goal: To get into the UCSF and SFSU Physical Therapy graduate program. I hope to attend this program in order to become a certified PT and I hope that I can stay in the SF. I enjoy the city and have friends there, I wish to be near them in the future. Academic long term goal: to challenge myself with the question, ""How to better engage (1) young people to participate in physical activity and (2) Asian Americans folks in physical activity and the mindset to ask for help with physical needs. I want to be able to dissect this question in graduate school and in the working field, I think it is important to not only learn in school but also out of school.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1366,"I have many different goals in life. One goal I think about is simply gaining more knowledge and an understanding of the world we live. I have always been interested in how the world and the things around us work. Although I do care more for like the anatomy of humans I believe that having knowledge about everything that you can possibly think about will benefit everyone and this world. I think this class is helping me achieve this goal because one, its helping me understand how things are working and secondly I am gaining knowledge about something that I have never really specifically found an interest in but because my goal is to gain as ,much knowledge as possible taking this class is helping me achieve that goal and its also helping me with one of my bigger goals which is getting my B.S to become a Physician !"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1371,"For 5 minutes, journal reflectively on:  ""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""  This essay is meant to connect you to your purpose. This is not meant to be a formal essay. It should be stream-of-consciousness writing from the heart. You will be graded on participation only, not on the specifics of what you say. 5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150-200 words.  After you finish your essays, we will provide some class time to discuss your thoughts, to the extent that you feel comfortable sharing.  Student Learning Outcomes:1.Apply appropriate methods of analysis to raw data.   2.Carry out common laboratory procedures correctly and adhere to instructions on laboratory safety; recognize hazardous situations and act appropriately.   3.Maintain atimely, comprehensive laboratory notebook, including any outside or background research, with sufficient detail to permit repeatability of experiments.   4.Explain the scientific method, including concepts of hypothesis and experimental controls, and why objectivity is essential.  5.Apply critical thinking in the laboratory and recognize whether results and conclusions make sense.  I’m here in physics 111 to learn to analyze raw data, keep a lab notebook and improve my critical thinking skills to further my progress in environmental science.  I need the prerequisite just as much as anyone else but I look forward to improving my written communication skills as they relate to my ability to articulate the values and conditions as they relate to the specific concepts in physics the most. Thus far we have been describing problems dimensionaly and that style is new for me, different."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1379,My goals are to excell in all my courses and put my best effort to get straight As. I want to get straight As since I will be going into medical school it would look nice to have the best grades. Another one of my goals is to full grasp all the information I am being taught and remember it and not forget 2 months later. This class is not only helping me mentally becuase we do these times of discussions to talk about ourselves and not just school work. It is also helping me mentally hecuase I am getting a chance to actually sit back and think of why am I her and what my goals are. It is also helping me educationally becuase I need this class to continue onto my studies. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1378,My goals are to get my degree in kinesiology at SFSU. this class is helping me achieve that goal because it is a prerequisite for other classes I need to take. My goal is to be able to work with athletes and help them train for their games. I would also like to help them after an injury or at least make sure I am able to help them on their road to recovery. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1362,"If we are talking about goals for the week, then my goal is to really grasp the concept of this week and finish all of my assignments. I know last week I did not turn in one assignment because all of my work had erased and I was not going to be able to finish it all on time to turn it in. So for this week I will make sure that I turn it in a little extra early so if this does happen again I will be able to work on it all of again. This does not just go for this week but for the entire semester. I also want to be able to learn and understand all of the topics being taught to my classmates and I. This class is helping me achieve all of my goals because once I learn thee concepts and pass this course then I will be able to get my degree. Yayy! But again I am really excited and looking forward to the rest of the semester."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1365,"One of the main goals I have set for myself is to graduate with a BA in zoology/ animal sciences. It has always been my dream to work with animals and going to college and getting my degree was a must if I wanted to do that and have a steady income. But since we have been in quarantine, I’ve made more goals for myself which is to make connections with people that can help me in the future, whether it be classmates or professors. Another goal I have set for myself is to do the best I can and pass my classes. Before the pandemic hit, I was not prepared to go fully online, so I am going to push myself and try my best to be well in my classes. This class will help me accomplish these goals because it satisfies the requirements in order to get my degree. It also helps me make connections with people in my class, since we are usually in break out rooms for about 2 hours and 2 hours is a good amount of time to make friends and get to know each other. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1369,"My goal is to obtain my cell and molecular biology degree and this class is one of the required ones. However, I also want to gain a much better understanding of the basic concepts of physics so that I can always have this knowledge if it ever comes up in my field. By taking this class, I'm able to fulfill both of my goals at the same time. It's basically a win-win situation. I also really like physics and like learning about it. This class's homework system, lab and lecture are doing a really good job of helping me understand many of the concepts we're learning about."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1360,"My goals are to graduate and succeed in all my classes. This class is helping me achieve this goal by the way you have made all are assignments visible and accessible to us. It really helps when an instructor is very organized and has all the dates and the work is consistent. I feel like this class has taught me to work on something everyday which i really appreciate because I am being productive and actually sing the information i recieve in class to apply it to the lessons. Not only that but I really enjoy the daily blog post. I know it is not really academic wise but it helps me to be more organized  and ask myself what i need to do for the week, what it was i learned that day, and also how was my week. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1375,"My goals is to better understand physics and be able to apply it to my other classes. I also would like to get a passing grade in the class, preferably an A. I feel like physics has a lot to do with logic and so its easy to apply to everyday life or other classes. This class has helped become more engaged in my work and as well as not procrastinate. Its something that i think i need a lot of work on because its a bad habit. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1381,"My goals in life in general is to succeed in my life. My first goal is to finish college on a strong note and go to veterinary school. In my life, I want to have my DVM but also continue my school to have my doctoral degree. I will be the first in my family to finish school so I want to be a role model for my little sister and my cousins so they can follow my foot steps to go get an education. This class is helping me achieve these goals because for me to be able to move on to my next courses on my road map I need to take and pass this class. Also taking this class will help me having a more understanding in science. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1373,"My goal is to attend Physical Therapy school in the future. Physics is the science of how external forces/external environment affects objects. So, when studying the human body, it is important to consider both external and internal forces that contribute to human functionality. That being said, physics has everything to do with the way we digest food, to the way we walk, to the way molecules in our bodies interact with one another. This class is helping me achieve my goals by setting a foundation for myself to build upon. Understanding the general physics behind these concepts will only help me succeed in the long run, despite class being remote. I am adjusting to this new 'classroom' environment well. I understand that not all concepts will be easy to understand due to this change, but all my classes have been very accommodating for everyone's needs. This helps me achieve another goal of being able to adapt to any situation."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1372,"My goals include becoming a physical therapist and finishing this semester with all As. This class helps me understand some of the concepts discussed in lecture. I think that this class helps me understand physics with real world applications. I hope that this class can continue to help me grow and help me become more familiar with physics topics. This class is also required for kinesiology which helps me reach my goal of becoming a physical threapist. Some of my other goals include maintianing a good work ethic. One way this class helps me is to complete as much work as I can durign class time, so I can focus on studying outside of class. I try my best to do this woht my other classes when possible. I think that this is s good habit to maintain, especially since next semster is online as well. I am learning a lot of new methods to stay on top of my work, which will help me reach my goals."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1377,"My goals are to refine my quantitative reasoning skills and come out from this class better than when I came in. Throughout early grade school, I was not taught the proper way to deal with numbers, equations, and variables. Although a side note, my schools were often under-resourced, underfunded, and underprepared. These factors managed to impact the students' learning, due to most professors not having the proper tools to instruct students and prepare them for higher education. While there, I mastered what I could, but I still had some impediments in my performance. This class has helped me to dive deeper and learn how numbers and variables work together. I feel much more equipped to handle my career in the real world.. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1361,My goals for this class are to strengthen my abilities and knowledge in physics to continue my studies and take more physic classes. I want to be able to solve problems and understand how I got the answer and if my answer makes sense. This class is helping me achieve my goals because we are practicing problems on homework and labs. We are also learning new concepts to extend our knowledge.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1364,"Physics 112 is helping me achieve my goals because it is a pre-requirements my major Biology and it is also a pre-health requirement. By completing and passing this course I will meet one more requirements to graduate with a Biology degree at SFSU and it will fulfill one pre-health requirement for dentistry school. I aspire to attend dentistry at King’s College in London. I have done research on the pre-requirements to dentistry school at king’s college and it is a ver prestigious school; this is by I plan to learn from this class and pass it with an A. In all, I need to take physics 112 to move forward with my aspirations of becoming a dentist. Once I become a dentist I hope to open up my private practice in a working class community and offer services to those who are denied from or are health care. I hope to specifically help my community back in New Braunfels."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1376,"What are my goals? I feel like this question has been plaguing me more as I grow older and older. I really don't know how to answer a question that astronomical. Some people go through their whole lives never finding what they are truly meant to do and who knows I may end up being that person. Do not get me wrong, I hope beyond all hope that I do not end up as part as that statistic but the possibility is there and it is frightening, to say the least. I guess my current goal is to be a very open human being and try many things in search of that one true then I was made for. I have recognized so far many talents at my disposal but I suppose the burden of choice and the lack of unlimited time has frozen me into wanted to hopefully make the right decision from the get-go. Right now its finish my school and getting a bachelor's in microbiology, and I only have about 2 years left. Completing physics will be a step towards that current goal. However, beyond that, I seek to improve my humanity and understanding through the arts. For example, I plan on taking a crack at learning piano this coming winter break. That's all I really have for this now, here is me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1382,My goals are to graduate SFSU with a degree in Kinesiology and hopefully get into PT school. This class is helping me achieve these goals because it is a pre req for PT school. While those are my main goals I also would like to learn more about different subjects so this class is also helping me with that. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,625,"My goals are to pass all by classes with at least an A this semester and being more organized and productive. This class is helping me achieve these goals by being able to ask for help when I need it. Even though I do sometimes get overwhelmed by all the work for all my classes it allows me to be more focused in all my classes and work a lot harder since everything is online now. And to get those A’s I know that I need to be very observant in all my classes by checking ilearn consistently and asking for help when I need it. I also feel like being in a study group with people from all your classes will allow me to succeed in my classes and have a better understanding of the materials that are presented. Lastly, I feel like this class will help me achieve my goals keeping in track in physics lecture."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1363,"My goals have remained the same, to get into grad school. However, due to the pandemic, I am slowly losing interest in continuing my education. I want to start working and making money. I have to save up as much as I can so that I can retire. Perhaps, convert a van into a camper van and live in it. We only live once, why do I need an education? Why work for 40 years and then retire at an old age when my bones are to weak to enjoy traveling. I am lost with what I want to do now. Is PhD the answer? My grades are not as high anymore, I struggle looking for a tutoring. Office hours are not enough. Internet connect is not stable. I feel more lost than before. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1359,My Goals is to gradate with my Bachelors degree in biology and chemistry. I plan to attend medical school for 4 years then become studying for my career. My career is becoming a pediatrician. This class is helping me achieve these goals because physics is a fundamental topic that will be discussed in my future classes. I will need physics to add these theories in the future. This class is also letting me sign up and take more advance classes to earn my degree. Dynamic is very important in learning and understand  the circular system in the body. It also teaches me the scientific method which is very important in med school. Mostly important understand this class will also help me get an understand in chemistry which it is important because it is my major.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1367,My goals are to one day become a doctor for dermatology and plastic surgery. I plan to one day get accepted into medical school so that I can further pursue my education into becoming a doctor. I would like to one day have my own dermatology and plastic surgery office where I can practice medicine in peace. This class is helping me achieve my goals by teaching me the necessary information and knowledge needed in order to help me in my future career. This class is also helping me work on my work ethic by constantly keeping me going and doing work so that I do not lose track. This class is really helping me by teaching me many things that I will need in my educational and career journey. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1368,"My goals are just to pass this class since it's a prerequisite for my upperdev classes. However, as I stated in my first journal, I do want to leave this class knowing the subject and have a better understanding of the world around me through physics. This class, both lecture and lab, have been helping me reach that goal. By making me practice real-life problems and having meaningful discussions as a class, occasionally break out rooms work too but I prefer working as a class. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1380,"My goal for this semester is to try and understand the topics/concepts that are going to be discussed in class. I know that Physics (for me) can be confusing at times and the math can be a bit challenging but hopefully, I can manage. I have never really been big on math which is why I'm still considering my major, but I really hope to do well despite the difficulties. I think this class is helping me by seeing how you break down the materials. By explaining, the words step by step on what we're learning in class. Since classes are online, it's kind of hard to stay focus and manage my time well because I tend to forget stuff. My motivation has kind of decreased and it's been hard trying to keep up. Overall, my goal for this semester is to manage my time well and hopefully understand the materials for this class."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,5,1374,"My goals are to find a career in chemistry, whether that be in research, or something else, like the environmental/marine sciences. I am not quite sure what I want to do yet, but I know it involves chemistry. This class is helping me because chemistry involves physics, and I am required to take these classes for my major. Understanding the concepts in physics will help me better understand chemistry. I also find physics very interesting and I wanted to major in astrophysics when I was younger. Being genuinely interested in physics will help me with my future career, and improve my math skills. Math is something that I have struggled with in the past, and I think this class will help me practice and strengthen my math skills. I am grateful for the opportunity to take this class, and will put in the effort I need to be successful."
