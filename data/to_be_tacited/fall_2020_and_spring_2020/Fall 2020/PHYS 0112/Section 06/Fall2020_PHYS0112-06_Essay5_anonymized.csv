2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1387,"As a first generation college student school was ingrained in my head from the start. My parents instilled in me that school is the gateway to becoming successful in life where I can live without a struggle. This has always motivated me in school because my achievements are also my parents achievements, ones that they couldn't get themselves but pushed me so I could strive for it. College is by far so different from high school but it's also an experience, I have enjoyed it a lot. In college I have made a lot of friends and we have worked together to succeed. They have taught me to have fun but also to study hard. My values are respect, integrity, responsibility, etc. These values have been instilled in my brain as a child and continues into my adulthood. It teaches me to value myself and those around me as well. We are all a cohesive society (as we should be)!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1396,"The values of my family and community have shaped my thoughts, words, and actions which help me to grow and develop as I navigate my journey in college. As a first-generation college student, these values become more important to me as they help me to work toward the future I want to experience. Growing up, my family and community value education extremely highly as the only means to a successful life. I would say family values influence me more than community values as my family members are the first group of people who teach me what I need to know. I learned how to deal with people, how to approach work with a positive attitude, and more first hand from my own family. If my family had not done their part in pushing me harder and harder every time I reached my limit, perhaps, I might give up when I encounter challenges in my academic career."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1412,"My family has always supported what I do and played a big part in my success in college. They help pay for my tuition, which I'm grateful for cause not everyone's family can provide them the money for college. I grew up in San Francisco, and I do believe that the community you grew up in plays a big part in what you want to major in and do. As, for me I am unsure of what I want to pursue at the moment, but I am leaning towards computer science because its blooming right now and there are a lot of jobs available with high pay. Communities can play a big part in motivation like if you didn't grow up with much you can use that drive to help push for a better education and to be successful in the future. I don't live in the biggest house, but we are doing well and appreciate how close I am with my family."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1395,"I'd say that I'd have the privilege of being surrounded by people who are involved in the sciences. Since I am a bio major, I've always felt that it's important to be around people who reflect what I may be in the future. In order to prepare me for being a Biology major, I’ve surrounded myself with all things science. Having several relatives in the healthcare field, I’ve practically been surrounded by science my whole life, and it has had a major influence on me choosing to go into the sciences. It’s a tough challenge no doubt, but it’s the benefits you are awarded that make it all worthwhile."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1383,"Honestly, I don’t think the community nor my family helps me with my studies.It is not a good thing nor is a bad thing. I think the best help i can get for studying is the internet and really asking the professor. I think the student who actually studies are the ones that can succeed. From my personal experience, I had to work on everything myself. I did not get any help from my family besides providing me basic needs like shelter and food. But with education wise, all they said was to finish college and get a good job. I had to do everything else. And that is also okay. My family are all college graduates and they all did it by themselves. We value education that I get so pressured. But I think I can do it despite the lack of help. I am just grateful that I have this opportunity in my life. But I do wish I got a little more help. . . . "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1384,"As a young child, hard work has always been ingrained in me. I would always complete my homework and finish all my assignments, and this habit has carried onto college. I am also grateful that my parents pushed me to try my best, but never put too much pressure on me. This allowed me to have a balance between free time and homework. The community I surrounded myself with in high school also helped me navigate through college. Being the first in my family to attend college, I was lost and confused. Many of my friends were also in the same situation, so we would spend time with guidance counselors and help each other towards our college careers. My friends also valued academic success and this inspired me to also succeed, as I didn't want to be left behind. I am grateful for my community and the values they have instilled in me as it has helped me navigate through college and the values helping me push forward. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1413,"The values of my community and my family helped me navigate through college by supporting me through my journey, aiding my stress levels, and encouraging me to pursue activities out of my comfort zone, such as research. When I was in community college last summer, my college encouraged me to pursue research, something I thought was out of my reach and was something I felt that I was too dumb to do. My family supported me when I had no idea what I wanted to study or major in college by stating that they would support what I do no matter what I do and encouraged me to pursue a career I would love to do. I am incredibly thankful for that support, as it led me to the position I am today and helped build my confidence (somewhat). I hope through the SFSU community I will also gain support in my academic journey and help me through life. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1393,"My community and family have helped me navigate through college in different ways. My community like my friends or my peers have helped me immensely. They help by either forming study groups, helping me decompress with some fun after a hard day, and even tutoring me when I need it. My family helps support me a lot as well. They also help me decompress after a long day. But they also help me financially when I need it and give me a place to stay when I want it. Overall they provide a stable learning environment especially during the quarantine due to the covid-19 pandemic. I think having a strong community and family have helped me immensely and I am very lucky to have them. I would encourage everyone to seek out a community or build a community of supportive people to help them through undergraduate or any big life challenge."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1405,"In my family, education is seen as a really important step in order to achieve a successful life and career. Because of this I have always been very pressured to work really hard in school and commit myself to my work. I also think the stressing of importance of education in society as a whole is a big factor in continuing my education into college. Because of the importance of a college education in society I think resources to help in the process of entering college have expanded and resources are available in my family, community, and through my school. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1415,"I'm the first generation in my family that goes to college, so I did not receive a lot of help in navigating through college life. Don't get me wrong, my family is supper supportive, it's just that I have to figure out everything on my own, and that sometimes can be challenging. However, having to know that I'm the first one in the family to ever reach this far, it reminds me that I have to keep trying, and putting more and more effort into studying, so that I can benefit myself later on in life, and be able to help other people as well. For me, college is not simply an opportunity for a brighter future, it's also the unfinished dream of others as well, so I live and study for those dreams, and it becomes a great source of motivation that encourage me every time I feel stressed or depressed. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,693,"My family values have greatly impacted me in my journey through college. By having unity, responsibility and ambition be the cores of family, I am reminded that despite the obstacles I face, I can overcome them. Initially, I did not realize how helpful it was to have a support system that reminded me of how worthy I am. Sometimes classes and the school can be so overwhelming that I want to ignore everyone around me. Depending on who it is, sometimes that works, but talking about it especially with my mom helps a lot. I don't want to say that I owe my mom, but she has helped me so much that I know she deserves the world and more. I am able to do great in my class despite online learning because my passion is school and my mom can lighten the load of chores at home. I appreciate my family so much, I know I will be successful in the future because I can lean on them."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1404,"I come from a single mom who took care of me and my older brother while also running her own business. She is one of the hardest working people I know and I have definitely acquired her hard work mentality for college. If I am going to do something it should be done right, so I aim to make sure that I am doing everything in my power to fully pass my classes and keep up a high GPA. Her hard work has influenced me to put my all in everything I do and not to be afraid to put myself out there for any opportunity I can take. This is shown in my work habits I am a full-time student, I run my own personal training business(if you looking for a trainer you know where to look). I also coach CrossFit as well as competitive weightlifting, as well as applying my self into internships as a strength and conditioning coach. I also am a competitive weightlifter who competes on the National level. I don't think I would have the drive I gave now if it was not for my mom."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1397,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""My community at sf state has many values I will focus on just a few. For one we treat everyone with respect. We always invite people in on conversations in class. It is very difficult to find people fighting on campus. I think SF state is a safe environment. It's values are good and always true. Another place that has created me to be the person I am today are my parents. They have molded me to be a good and caring person. I hate fighting with people. It seems like a waste of time to me. All though it can be at times very constructive. I would say most times it is not though. People are always fighting whether it is in politics the news or with beliefs. These are somethings we need to be focusing on. We need to learn to treat everyone with respect. We also need to start compromising more since we have forgotten how to."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1408,"I find that my own values and intuition have helped me come this far. I took time off in between high school and college, so I feel that in some ways I can be behind because I am trying to relearn how to be a student. I've always been a dedicated person to whatever I am committed to at the time, so this holds true with being in college too. I find that this year has been extremely challenging to the overall person that I am as my motivation and reasons for attending school have dwindled. I think this question is very interesting and makes me reflect on why I began in the first place to help reinstill those values to move through and past these challenging times. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1398,"I personally do not believe that the values of my community or family have affected my college experience very much. While I do believe that they of course want me to succeed and do well in school, I also have that same goal. I cannot be motivated by other people very well when it comes to completing assignments or course work. When it comes to homework, I most definitely cannot be influenced or motivated by other people to do it. When it comes to other things like projects and exams, of course, I like to study and with my peers in order to help each other succeed. In that case, I am very motivated to help people who are also helping me succeed in the course. So depending on the situation or work thats needs to be done, as long as I have a motive and I am in a group setting where we are all receiving help, I will also be motivated to put in the work."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1402,"The values of my community and family have pushed me through college in efforts of ending my life off, better than where I started it. I was torn from family at an early age, by my step parent and isolated in a very rural area of southern California during an economic crash that left my small family in a financial bind that was too great for my parents to handle. Unfortunately, our town was so barren of life, that the small close knit community our 3 person militia invaded was very closed off. I resent my parents for moving me out here, because before it was as populated as it is now diversity was shunned and often found myself feeling especially alone. I vowed to myself that I would get out of this community, and make a better life for myself where I could feel included and celebrated with happiness. My past has taught me that a closed mouth doesn't get fed, and that life is all about making myself visible through my academic career i have work to reach out to professors for help, scholarships, labs, research, and with other students i have reached out for study buddies, help, tutoring, recommendations, etc. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1406,"My family helped me navigate through college was seeing the things I have gone through especially during college. In the beginning, I had my doubts about what I wanted to do after college, it was the experience that I have faced that made me lead to where I am today which is I want to help people mentally and physically. In the past 3 years, I have been in situations where people have died either while I was there or they were all close to my heart. Most were family members of mine. My grandma, cousin, uncle, and my uncle who is sick who is a role model to me. My uncle was a neonatologist and anesthesiologist in Germany and neonatology or pediatrics is what I have always wanted to do as I love kids. I know I want to go to medical school but I will decide what fits for me when I am there soon. Thank you."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1394,"I think that the values of my family that I was raised with have been very useful in college. Growing up, my family has always emphasized being a genuinely good-hearted person. In many ways, that is an attribute that I carry around with me in all aspects of my life. I do my best to make sure that I treat everyone with kindness and fairness. This has allowed me to meet many genuine people throughout the first 2 years of college. It has been very fun and I am glad to have met the people that I have. Another value that I carry in college is self-reflection. It is always important to know when you have made a mistake and to understand how to grow from it. Having missteps can make one feel down, but it is a big part in learning. The ability to self reflect on what mistakes you made can help in doing better academically."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,700,The values of my community or my family have truly helped me navigate through college. Some of the ways that my family vales have played a role is by focusing on hard work when given the opportunity to be in college. College is not someting my family had the opportunity to do for may generations so me being the first in my family to go to college is something that we don't take lightly and we value a lot. Some of the thing we like to do is pray and be thankful to god for our blessing and just another day that we get to be here. We find it important to work hard in school and having good grades to be a good example for our younger siblings and family. We usually pass down clothes to younger cousins or siblings when they don't fit us anymore and being in college is kind of the same because we set an example that we should be able to pass down. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1390,"The values of my family have helped me greatly to get through college. I have had the benefits of my mom being a high school counselor and knowing a lot of how and what to do for college. She mostly helped with the part of getting ready for college and I used a lot of what she told me during my first semester. She encouraged me to go out and explore the world which is why my family was very excited for me to get out of the town we live in and go to San Francisco. As the pandemic began, my family knew how stressed out I was because of the online schooling and what an impact it had on my mental health. Till now they have been super supportive to accommodate me when I'm now still struggling to concentrate in school. After some strategizing, I am able to get my work done on time and I am able to understand the material. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1411,"I originate from an Asian household and culture, that being said I was under the rule of the so called, ""Tiger mom parenting"". Thinking back I dreaded it a lot, even now I come from a strict household. It was mentally straining, however if it wasn't for my parents, I don't believe I will make it to where I am today. My parents would buy me workbooks to study out of and learn, it was interactive. We would always work out of it however 2 grades above of what we were learning in elementary through middle school. This helped me learned easier and adapt when I was in that grade level, since my parents also tried to teach me. My family, even though they don't make the most money, they never give up and are always resilient. This has to taught me no matter the hardships, I will get through it even if it's just barely or little at time. Of course, I didn't meet my parents standards, in simple terms, I looked up to them. This helped me navigate in college and remind me not to give up. Their sacrifice and time spent on me, I don't want that to go to waste. They put their effort and time into me because they did not want me to live their lifestyle and live a good life. The values of hardship, and resilience helped me navigate through college."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1407,"A big value in my family is finishing what you have started, and this has come to motivate me throughout my time in both high school and college. It is really easy to start something, whether it be a project or even school semester, but it is quite hard to finish it. So whenever i am complaining about the work i need to do, or how i have no motivation for the end of the semester, they remind me that school is just one of those things that you need to keep going on. Although it is difficult when there only a few weeks left and the motivation is gone, but this is the time when people do give up, and it it totally worth it to keep going to the finish line. A harder moral to follow is always giving my best work, and i am the first to admit that this is not met all of the time. Sometimes, especially during the last 8 months, life gets in the way. But even though always turning in your best work is not followed through every time, it is nice to have a goal to shoot for."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1386,The values of my community have been a big factor into me being able to be successful in college. I stay on campus so all the resources that are available to me are always super helpful and needed. I love the free tutoring and all the great resources available at the library. Also my family has been a great support system and their values is what pushes me to finish school. They always say a degree will get me very far in life and that I will feel very accomplished after I finish all my hard work in school. Thankfully I have always had a good set of core values to not only get me through college but through life as well. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1388,"My family values kindness. It has definitely helped me in class with teachers and students. It has really helped me at work because I started working for Starbucks and being nice to customers is very important. I have made many great friends through work too. I also value my grades and education so it was really nice finding friends who also put school first. I really miss studying at the library with my friends. It has been tough having to do all my work at home and alone but I don’t have many other choices. I never thought I would ever miss going to class but I definitely do. I miss our campus, the library, seeing friends and teachers. It’s been hard communicating with some teachers only via email and zoom. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1400,"I am lucky enough to have supportive and hardworking parents.  Both of my parents obtain an incredible work ethic and are currently business owners to a handful of businesses.  I appreciate their hard work because they have provided a very comfortable life for me and that would not have been possible without their capabilities, skills, and determination.  As for the people around me, I have recently noticed that as we continue to get older my friends and colleagues have aspiring goals that they are currently working towards.  Being able to see the people that mean the most to be achieve goals or working towards their goals, whether it be pursuing a higher education or getting hired at prestigious companies has really inspired me and pushed me harder.  I find that it is very important to surround yourself with people that instill confidence in and inspire me to be better and work harder.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1401,"My family has helped me through college a lot and I am super grateful, if I was all on my own I think I would be a lot more behind and Im glad I can always ask anyone for help and even with the pandemic we grew even closer. I think having support from home is very important, but not always necessary because there are a lot of people that are doing this all by their self perfectly fine. Im glad my parents were super patient with me especially when I was undeclared my whole freshman year because I had no idea what I wanted to major in for quite a while. I got the freedom to choose whatever I want and they encouraged to literally be and study anything I wanted. I think this played a huge part of where I'm at today and obviously I would never want to let them down, so I try to stay as motivated as possible."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1389,"In my family, education is highly valued. Although my mother and father did not attend university, me being the first placed a lot of expectations on my part to succeed. They expected me to pursue careers such as doctor, lawyer, nurse practitioner, and so on. These expectations encourage me to work hard through college to meet these expectations. However, because they are not as familiar with the college system, I rely heavily on my counselors, friends, and mentors in order to navigate through my years here. Because I am majoring in biology, I often look to people from my same cohort for help on things such as what classes and programs to partake in. In particular, I talk to the counselors and mentors often simply because the different pathways for the careers I am interested in are very complex and different from each other. I try to talk to my counselor before enrolling in my classes for the next semester, and my mentors for planning out my more long term goals such as my 4 year education plan and the different pathways that occur after undergrad is finished, such as with graduate courses or masters. "
