2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,700,"I have many goals in life and eve goals for today, tomorrow, and in 5 years. One of my goals for this week is to finish all my work for this week with no trouble and not that much stress. My goal for the end of the semester is to have all my classes at an A and most importantly I hope I learned a lot. This class is helping me prepare for the end of the week, the end of the semester, and even my future. I am using this class to improve my knowledge and do well on both physics classes and have good grades by the end of the semester. This class is also helping me reach my long term gaol which is becoming a PA (physician Assistant) by teaching me the basics of science and the basics of physics in general. I hope to accomplish all these goals tomorrow, by the end of the week, and by the end of the semester, at least for now. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1388,My goal in life is to become a nurse. I want to graduate from SFSU this spring and then attend an accelerated nursing program after. I need physics because I need to learn about motion to help me understand movement of the body.  This class and my lecture are both very important for my future career. Hopefully both my physics classes and all my other classes this semester go smoothly so I can stay on track for graduation. I have kept a good GPA and enjoy most my teachers so I am not too worried. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1412,"My goals in this class is to get a better understanding of physics, how it works and the reason behind it. This class is helping me achieve this goal through labs and with these labs I learn new concepts and evidence of these things happening in everyday life. As, I said in my first reflective journal this class is also helping my goal of being able to graduate since it does help fulfill my general education requirement. Another goal of mine is to be able to pass physics because in high school I barely passed physics. This class will also help me determine if I want to pursue a major regarding physics since I am still undeclared at the moment and not sure what I want to do. This class is also helping my goals because I am also learning new things as a student and continuing to learn more knowledge. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1385,"My goals are to genuinely understand the content in this physics course but also my other classes, so that I don't have to constantly rely on notes or even the internet. I've noticed in some of my chemistry and biology classes that physics is present, so this class is helping me better understand those classes as well. It's hard for me as it takes me longer than most people to understand a concept and I feel defeated, but this semester i'm really trying my hardest to understand the first time around. I try to stay after class often if I need the extra help, and this class helps me because we come back and discuss problems and their solutions more than some other classes I have."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1407,"My goal in life is to end up being a successful lawyer and father. I want to be able to provide for a family that i will eventually have, and to do that i need a job that will pay well. I want to give my future wife and kids the best life i can, so this means i have to word as hard as i can right now to ensure i will have a good start. This class will give me the critical thinking i need to graduate from san francisco state and go on to law school. Not only that, but it is necessary for my major of earth science. I am looking forward to this class, and the rest of my time here at sf state. But as of right now, i am taking it one day at a time and wishing to myself that covid ends quickly."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1406,My goals are to be able to pass this class and graduate on time. I like to make small goals to be able to reach for my big ones. as of now I would like to be able to learn more about physics and pass the class. After I would like to pass all of my classes that are needed for me to be able to graduate on time. I would like to get into genetics and hopefully I would get a career into genetic counseling. This class will help me achieve these goals is by helping me get the prerequisites I need in order to take the classes I need to graduate on time. I would like to also learn as I am interested in physics and the way about it! Physics has always been interesting to me as it is part of our everyday lives and it helps answer all the questions I have wanted answered. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,693,"My goals are to graduate from San Francisco State University and obtain a PhD. Hopefully this class can teach me about the universe connecting to my day to day life. Science for the most part can be connected to a majority of aspects. However, from a perspective of life holding a meaning, I want to be happy. I want to be so happy and filled with joy that I find beauty in everything. It is almost silly to say that life has no meaning or purpose, but in reality for each person, life's purpose is different, we end up deciding what the purpose it, not anyone else. It's scary to think about the future in relationship to your goals. I begin to wonder if what I am doing will lead me to my goal, will my goals change, is change okay and have I learned something from overcoming obstacles. I always seem to have existential crisis when writing in these journals. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1390,My goal is to get a full understanding of the material that the class provides in order to do better in other classes as well as further knowledge in physics. Physics has not always been my strong knowledge subject but as I learn the problem solving mechinism to do problems I start to get better the farther we go. This class will help me achieve my goals as far as meeting the requirements to graduate with the degree I am working for as well as helping me study for the MCAT in order to get accepted into medical school. My ultimate goal is to become a doctor.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1409,"My goal at the moment is to manage my time in completing all the assignments I have in this class and others. I also want to do well, so another goal is to schedule some study time and to review all of the assignments to get a better understanding. This class is helping me to better understand the material from my physic lecture. It indeed puts the ideas shared in that course from a different perspective and has helped me to better comprehend the concepts. I never regret making the physic lab class, because it does truly help me. In addition, these journals also help me reflect and motivate me to re-evaluate myself."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1394,"My goal right now is to get good grades and boost my GPA. I am not someone who has amazing grades, so I am really working on trying to bring those up in all the ways that I can. I think this class doesn't really help me in much ways as we only meet once a week, and there isn't much to do. But I try to do all the homework that is given to us. However, there are times where I do miss homeworks as I just fail to see them which makes it harder to have good grades. I think my long-term goal would be to get high enough grades and a good enough GPA for a scholarship. Besides that, I wanna get through the pandemic as it's hard on all of us. I wanna be able to get back to where we were pre-covid. Everything feels very forced, so I think we are all doing our best."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1396,"One of my biggest goals at the moment is to finish this semester strong and continue to stay motivated in order to keep up with all the school work until the end of the semester. Another goal I have for the next few years is to join a research lab on campus and getting an internship at a biotech company or something related to technology. This class will prepare me to be ready for working in the research lab. In this class, I will have a lot of practice with problem-solving techniques and actively asking scientific questions to further study the concepts. These skills are essential in preparing me for my future science classes and contribute to honing my critical thinking skills. I also hope to strengthen my understanding of physics by the end of this semester. This will also help me to have a stronger foundation to understand other scientific disciplines. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1402,"My goals are to improve my understanding of physics so that i can apply it to my degree of biochemistry. I want to put my education toward developing medicine for people that don't use unnatural products or chemicals that only serve specific purposes for maintaining the human body. With complexities regarding how different bodies work and excel in different environments. I think it is important to note the various physicality's that work as both external and internal forces that agree and/or disagree with the human body and to fully and adequately understand those forces, I should start with a basic foundation that touches upon related and rooted concepts. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1415,"I want to be able to explain Newton's law of motions, because I've been thinking about it recently, but it still doesn't make much sense to me. Also, at the end of the class, I'm expecting to learn some new laws and concepts in every day life that I've never noticed before. The application of Physic is unlimited, so I'm hoping to be able to use the knowledge to make work easier for me, as well as doing work in other classes, because we'll be dealing with a lot of math and formulas. This class is perfect for me to practice my algebra skills as well as analyzing the problems, because the way we set up equation is very similar to what I've been doing in Calculus 2. The people in the class are very friendly, so I'm expecting to make some new friends as well. Hopefully, they will help me to understand the subjects and explain to me whatever that I'm confusing. I'm not saying that you're not helpful, don't get me wrong, it's just that friends' advice is just somehow more understandable. I came into the class with no intentions of any of these, but now I feel interested in the subjects and I want to know more now."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1395,"My goals in this class are becoming more knowledgable in physics. Like many other sciences, Physics is about our way of life. Everything we do; movements, forces, and behavior, all correlate to the study of Physics. Hopefully, after completing this class, I can have a new outlook on the world and how it works. Since this class is required for my degree in Biology, it will help me to become more open to how the two sciences are related."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1400,"Due to the fact that I graduated from the University of San Francisco in four years with a kinesiology degree was already a goal in itself.  In respect of short term goals going forward, it would be to finish this semester strong and get accepted into a physical therapy program.  In addition, to score well on the GRE.  In regards to long term goals, it would be to graduate from a physical therapy program of my choice, begin working at a private clinic or hospital.  Once I save enough money and gain adequate and sufficient experience I would like to one day open up my own private physical therapy clinic.  In terms of this course, physics 1 and physics 2 are requirements to get into graduate school.  However, physics is crucial when it comes to the human body because our bones, joints, and tendons are very similar to vectors.  In addition, the ideology of force, gravity, etc. are all topics that can be implemented into my graduate studies and life in general. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1389,"My goal is to go to medical school and become a doctor. I need physics in order to graduate from my major. Overall, physics is a stepping stone in my career pathway. Although in name the class is mostly helpful for me in terms of being a required course, I also get to practice and gain important skills such as cooperating with a group, editing a PDF, and active listening. These are skills that I can use in multiple settings outside of physics. Additionally, since I plan to specialize in trauma, it would be helpful to have a basic understanding of physics in order to more completely understand how something may have occurred in the body, and use that information to determine a better course of action. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1404,"My current goal for this class is to have a better understanding of all of the things we are currently learning. I also want to make sure that I am understanding all my other classes, so I'm prepared for classes that work off of them. I want to be able to solve a lot of our current equations and concepts we have learned. I know a lot of these things might show up in future classes and I want to be prepared for it. This class is allowing me to get a lot of practice with both lecture and lab work. This extra practice we get through is course work that has helped me gain  better understanding of all of our concepts. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1398,"My goals are to able to be successful in my future career when I finish college. I plan to go to graduate school and then research different bacterial and viral illnesses to help find cures for diseases such as COVID-19. This class is helping me achieve my goal by allowing me to be able to perform well in the future major classes I will take here at San Francisco State University. This class is a pre-requisite that I have to take in order to be able to take those major classes. This class also helps me practice my math and critical thinking skills, which is not my strongest suit when it comes to academic practices. I have always been poor at math and fail to practice them often, so this class enables me to work-out my brain and retain the ability to do mental math at a better rate and capacity."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1405,My goals include graduating college having made positive efforts and with a degree that I am proud of and finding a career that I enjoy. This class is helping be achieve these goals because it is helping my become closer to completing my degree and it is also pushing me to challenge myself with subject matters I have never come across before and prove I can do more than I thought. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1384,"My goal for this year is to pass all my classes. Learning through zoom has been pretty difficult and I feel like I'm learning materials through self-study. This class is required for my major and I would need to pass physics 1 in order to take the next physics class. I am required to take 2 physics classes for my major. I can hope I can learn a lot and understand the core fundamentals that will help me in my future physics classes. My math skills have also never been the best and since physics is heavily math-based, perhaps it will also help me improve these skills. I hear from friends that physics is super important and there are a lot of real-world applications that can be applied, so I can also look forward to learning about that. Hopefully, by the end of this semester, I will be applying physics to my daily life and thinking more about how the world works around me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,541,My goals are to hopefully one day become a pediatric surgeon. It been a little difficult and I've had a lot of setbacks along the way. This semester has had a lot of them and of them being online classes. ANything to do with virtual classes has gotten me strugling big time. Becuase of covid19 and everyhing closing I needed to pick up a lot of shifts and another job inorder to be able to pay for my rent. Even those this obstacle is very challenging I will be making sure I can I reach these goals no matter how long it takes.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1386,"My goals are to learn new things about our bodies, life, and anything science related to help me become more well rounded as a person and in my career. Also another goal is to pass my classes with As and Bs especially because this semester is a little bit less motivating since it is online. This class is going to definitely help me to learn new things about physics and life that I never knew before. Lab classes are my favorite because we get to learn new topics but we get to actually physically do them and see why things work the way they do. It helps me understand physics so much better. Also the lab will help me get a better understanding for the physics lecture and will make it easier to pass both classes because I know physics can be hard to understand. My biggest goal of course is to become a physical therapist and to get my PHD and this course is a small part of helping me to achieve that future goal. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1403,"My goals right now are to graduate and major in Biology. I've left it broad so that I have many avenues to go down as I learn more and possibly find something the especially catches my interest. But for now, I've left it as just Biology and plan to do something along the lines of working with animals or in conservation. I hope to be graduating in two years from now, so I am excited about what classes I have left to take. I am taking this class as part of a prerequisite; however, I think I will enjoy the course a lot. I have somewhat of a math brain and am very good at spatial thinking, so I believe physics will support that, and I think I will be able to enjoy the subject more than others can. I'm excited to learn how things work the way they do and how I might be able to apply that to real-world systems and problems."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1401,"My goals at the moment are to keep a good motivation for my classes and to not fall behind. Being at home and doing this virtually can really take a toll on motivation and its easy to just loose sight on why we even want to be here, but my goal is basically keep going. The world right now is in a very weird place and part of me if happy I have school to keep busy, but it tends to be very easy to get lazy at home. This class in particular is better than others because it tends to be more interactive and its nice to get that tad bit of social interaction in even if it is during class. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1408,"My goal overall is to receive my Bachelors degree in Biology, with a focus on Zoology. Taking this physics course is helping me reach those goals by fulfilling degree requirements for graduation. This course is also helping me to understand the world around me a lot better. It puts everyday activities into perspective of what is really going on and how things are operating, moving, and functioning. I think that applying the connections between the physics course material, the lab, and things in everyday life makes the learning process fun and also helps to better understand the material. So far, it has been "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1393,My goal for this class is to pass my other class physics 111 the lecture. I have been finding that this lecture has been helping me understand the topics we cover a bit more. With the test coming up I really need some extra help and this class provides it. My other Goal is to pass this class with flying colors so I can take the next set in this series physics 121 and 122. I need to take these course to graduate so I am looking forward to making that happen for me. I am beginning to get stressed about the class because the test is coming up and usually I score the lowest on my first test throughout the semester so maybe that’s good and I get a low score out of the way or I set the bar way to low (which has happened before). While I am in this class I have really enjoyed being able to converse with my peers about the labs. Only downside is sometimes I am not listened to or talked over. But that is nothing I’m not used to and am very good at making my presence known.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,704,"My goal is to be a provider and working at a job doing something I love, helping others. I want to provide for my grandmother and mother, they worked so hard and they deserve the world. Without them trying their best, I wouldn't be in college. I grew up seeing women work so hard without giving up, so I have a similar mentality. This class is teaching me topics I should know about physics, and preparing me for medical school. I do want to be a doctor, so this class is essential to my learning."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1397,"What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""  My goals are to be the greatest human being that I can be. Whatever that may entail is really unknown to me. However, I don’t mind what happens so I can try to make plans however there’s always that little thing called life that happens in between. All thre plans you’ve probably ever made. Maybe it’s looking at someone do something that seems really easy but as soon as you try to do it, it seems impossible. I think that has happened to everyone. But just keep trying and maybe just maybe you might get it right. Who knows you might even fall in love with what you’re doing and eventually forget about that old goal you had before. All though you can make as many plans or goals. Just never forget to enjoy the ride to wherever you end up.               This class that I am taking today I have no idea what its helping me with however I know it is helping in some way shape and or form it is. I just have no idea exactly how it will do that. So here I am at my computer (Laptop). Pondering what will this one class I take today of the many I will and have taken do in the grand scheme of things…"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1391,"My main goal for completing this class is to finish my BA in Chemistry. Since it is the final course I need to do so it is extremely important to me to do well in it and give it the attention it deserves that I obviously did not the first time I took it. Beyond that it is also giving me the opportunity to understand the type of science that my fiancee is so passionate about (she has her masters in physical chemistry and teaches physics at Mills College) and that has been a really valuable experience. As an organic/wet bench chemist I have always been fairly disinterested in physical chemistry and physics as it is more math based rather than the conceptual “lego block” way I have viewed chemistry. Her being my de facto tutor in this lab when I have any questions (which I sometimes have as it has been quite awhile since I took the adjoining lecture) has been fun, since she gets to help me through topics that she is passionate about. I am excited to do the experiments you have planned because it will help me apply these topics to real world examples. Ultimately I need to take this class for my degree but doing the work, often with the guidance of my partner, has made me much more interested in the subject than I was the first time I took it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1411,"My goals are to have a career in the medical field. I want to be able to give back and help maybe prolong my parent's health, with the knowledge of medicine. This class will be able to help me achieve my goals by fulfilling the biology bachelor requirement needed for medical school. In addition, another goal of mine is overcome depression and start focusing on myself, in order to not procrastinate and progress well in school. It's really hard when you have nay sayers constantly telling you, you will never get through college much less become a pharmacist or nurse. It's hard to have a good mindset, how am I supposed to learn and be motivated when I am pushed down all the time. I block it out I try to but every time my wall just comes crumbling down again so this is an important goal for me. In addition, this class will be evidence of my progression, prove that I can and will succeed. This class is one of many obstacles for me to overcome and pass with flying colors. Okay, not flying colors but pass with effort and dedication. Needless, to say this class will assist me in gaining knowledge and understanding in the medical field where I will later utilize and gain beneficial skill sets."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1387,"My goal is to either become a nurse or work in the biotechnology field. This is my first time taking physics ever and it can be quite confusing and so I find myself asking friends/family lots of questions because I want to have a better understanding of it and to pass the class. To be honest, I'm not sure what Physics has to do with me in my career goals but I do know that physics is present in our daily lives. This class has given me the opportunity to reach out to classmates and ask questions even if I'm slightly confused because at least then I will have a more concrete answer for the problem. This is the 5th week of school and it's picking up and I want to make sure that I have the concepts of Physics that we have learned down because it's only going to get more confusing from here. I also like breakout rooms but only when people actually talk... it's hard to talk to other people if they don't want to participate. I know I need this class as well as one more Physics class after this in order to get my degree so here I am!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1413,"My goal is to pass all of my classes, have time to study for each class, and adequately prepare myself for exams. My goal for this class specifically is to understand how these labs apply to the lecture in PHYS 111, how to properly use the equations given, and to complete all of my assignments on time. In trying to achieve this goal, I will go over the slides given in lecture, do practice problems from Mastering Physics, and go over class recording in case I have missed a topic or just to go over the topic once again. This class is helping me achieve these goals by the laboratory assignments we are given every week, as it makes me understand the material that was given during the lecture more in depth. For example, I was confused on the position vs. time graphs, velocity vs. time graphs, and the acceleration vs. time graphs, but the lab where we had to use the moving man simulation helped me visualize these graphs understanding how they differ and how they relate to each other."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1399,"My goals are to learn about motion and force. I have always came across Newton's laws of motion but I didn't really study them. It made more sense applying his laws to physics. The laws are really straight forward and common sense but they all are important to know. Everything so far has been understandable. I like how the class involves a lot of break room sessions because it really encourages me to talk and get my people from my group's knowledge instead of only my own. Especially during in this time of the pandemic. This class surely helps me move forward to learning more and more about physics for my future. My goal is to understand how things work, the simplest things, it just takes skill to understand the problem and reasoning. Physics is a science that I never really looked at, only biology and chemistry but now, I see the importance of physics."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1410,"I take this course because I am taking the General Physics course at the same time. First of all, the initial reason for taking this course is because it is one of the prerequisites for the graduate program that I am interested in. The second reason is that I am in the Kinesiology major which is mainly learning about the human body and motion. I believe having a better understanding of the physics behind our movement will be very useful in my future education or career. Also, I think having a Laboratory session will always be helpful since we actually get to apply the physics concepts into real-life experiments. Hopefully, I will be able to apply any physics concepts that I will be learning right now into my future field of study. "
