2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1413,"The resources I have to support me are basically me, my bird, my professors, and Japanese animations. Currently, I am working two jobs, one job contains of 9 hour shift, the other is essentially the same since I go on overtime quite frequently due to the work load, which really drain me to the core. On top of that, I am a full time student so It gets difficult to submit work on time, such as this class. In this reflection, I would like to apologize for not submitting the assignments I had due the last 3 weeks, but I will try to submit them this week or whenever I have time. I am going to quit one job as it gets in the way of my school work and I need to focus on my academics. As I struggle through physically and mentally, things that essentially keep me going is when I think of how cute my bird is, me thinking about my future, how lucky I am to have such sweet and understanding professors during this time, and Japanese animations keep me rooted in enjoying some of the things in life when it gets too heavy, such as pushing through to the final season of a Japanese animation called Attack On Titan, which premieres the final season on December 7th of this year.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1389,"Thankfully, because of SFSU, I have many resources to support me. There are Gator Groceries and the counseling services at the school. There are also a variety of clubs and mentorship programs. However, the resources that I utilize the most are the research opportunities as well as the advising services. I am not well versed with how to navigate the college pathway, so it is always helpful to have the ability to ask someone who is. For my emotional help, I also talk to my friends almost daily via Discord or otherwise. This is especially helpful because of my poor wifi, so even when I get dropped out of classes, I can still participate. As for materials to do my work, I am very fortunate to have a laptop and IPad that are working. Editing PDFs are much easier on my IPad than it would be without it, so I am extremely grateful for that. If it were not for my electronics, online based learning would be a nightmare. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1401,"Resources I have currently for support is my family since I am at home right now, usually at school I would be surrounded by my friends and piers that would really help build a good support system, but with school online its a tad harder making those connections. But being around my family and have a couple study groups for some classes, helps out a ton. Online school makes it harder to build a strong support system, but its not impossible. I have been really struggling to stay motivated with my school work recently and I think if school was in person I wouldn't have this struggle as much, but being around my family and siblings and friends from home tends to help. I also can reach out to any of my professors for office hours all of my professors this semester seem to be very welcoming and helpful for the most part. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,693,"I have many resources to support me: Metro, my biology advisors, my therapist but most importantly my parents are my support system. I give most credit to my parents, they are my constant environment that financially, emotionally, and affectionately support and care for me. Without them I feel like I wouldn't be where I am today, they have struggled with me academically, and when I would doubt myself. When I thought I was alone, my parents were beside me. I used to feel like the world was too large and too complex for someone as simple and silly as me, but they taught me values of happiness, responsibility, and kindness. My mother deserves the world and I hope to become half the woman she is when I am older. There is a strong sense of belonging and nurturing when I am with them, they are my foundation. I also used to think I never had a best friend, that I was always the second option to someone else, never really wanted, but I always seemed to forget who truly was there for me despite my flaws. Aside from my family, I have a strong dependency on music specifically KPOP, the Korean culture and language amaze me each time. Whenever I listen to specific groups and artists I am filled with happiness. The music always has an aesthetic and transports you to wherever the artist is and feels. Overall, I have people and music to depend on which is not too bad, in fact, it is lovely to feel a strong bond with both."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1402,"The resources I have to support me are my parents, unemployment, my friends, and my Pinterest board.My parents support me by encouraging me to put my best foot forward everyday so that I can ultimately achieve the lifestyle that i want. They had instilled a strong sense of capitalism within my everyday dynamic that motivates me to get up everyday, worker harder than i did the last, and create new streams of income in hopes of reaching a financial stability that will allow me to lead out a semi comfortable life like theirs. My unemployment, supports me education by allowing me to forgo working until my job opens back up so that I can focus more on my education.my friend support me emotional, and encourage me to keep pushing through my current onslaught of existential crisis and read for the future that seems to be layer out for me. They ease my mind and anxiety of having to laid out the rest of my life working to make someone other than me richer than I'll ever be by tagging me in photos of people who look like me but cant be me because they will never have to be like me. My Pinterest supports me by allowing me to collect photos under the notion of goals, displaying the life i will always want yet can never achieve. Those collections allow me to exist in the false reality of my mind where I am happy. fin."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1394,"I am honestly not too sure what resources I have to support me. Currently, we all have so much requirements to do and it is very overwhelming. It is not easy that every single thing thing we do is being graded as sometimes it feels like there is so much pressure to do things perfectly to get a good grade. I think the student hours is a good resource that would be able to support me in my classes, but only to a certain extent. I like that the professors are pretty nice and patient when we do not understand things, but it also feels like we are going so fast through the topics that I almost forget the last thing we discussed. My family is supportive as well I think. And I think having friends who are going through the same thing helps me feel a lot better as well."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1407,"I think that during this time one of the most important things we can do is have the right resources to continue doing well and keeping us in good spirits. Especially for classes like this one, it is so important to get these concepts down, that when you miss one, it is very easy to fall behind and not have that strong foundation you need. We discussed today in class the ways we can be productive during this time. We have youtube videos that are a great help to us. Then there is the book itself that contains all of the odd questions answers in the back of it, so we can definitely use that to practice. Third, Mr. Sturner told us today that if we want to email him about being in a study group, he would find us a few partners and have us exchange info so we could make a zoom study session. That was really nice of him. I think that we definitely have many resources that we can take advantage of, and i am very grateful for that. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1410,"I am grateful to have all kinds of resources that supports me throughout this difficult time. I have my professors/ instructors who teach me know knowledge everyday. I have good home-cooked food from my family. During this time is hard to find a job, but I have enough money to survive and do not need to stress over it. I am grateful to have all these supports. In terms of academic success, I received a lot of information and help from my professors and supervisors who are currently leading us in this virtual learning setting. For example, we have virtual college fair for students who are interested in going to grad school. We have virtual office hours for most of the classes. Professors or officers from school always provide information regarding education after graduation, and how to succeed in education. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1397,"What resources do I have to support me?""The resources I have with me today are my parents, school, friends, teachers, and family. All these people support me in school and in life in order to give me a better future. I am often thinking about whether or not these people are trying to help me or not. Because in this world there are people who would like to see you fail instead of succeed. It may seem harsh but it is tru. friends come and go often but once in a while you get a few good ones that will stay with you through thick or thin. Those are the ones we cherish the most and the ones that mean the most. of course parents are there as well and they will never turn on you. Parents (good parents) never turn there back on there children. Teacher are also important but there are also bad teachers who will make you feel dumb. I have had very few of these teachers. They often stay in your mind the most. You have to go through bad and good teachers in life in order to find the great ones which all of us know which teachers were the best. They may not have been the easiest but you sure learned a lot."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1406,"The resources I have to support me are well you since you are my lab instructor lol but other than you then getting the information from my physics professor powerpoints which has helped me be able to figure out what I am supposed to do. The PowerPoint and looking at videos it helps knowing how to do step by step as well as understanding how this works and why it's important to learn. Outside of school, I will try to use khan academy videos or look up videos on how it works so I may see from a different point of view how it works. To get the overview, Lab instructor, Professor, Online, and lastly other students. As we are all on the same level we are able to teach each other and have a better understanding of what we are supposed to do. I would say each has been helpful especially the student as we all want to pass and have an understanding. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1408,"There are many resources that are out there whether it be provided by the college or elsewhere. I've come across many resources in regards to overall courses, homework help, tutoring, exam prep, as well as resources for this year in particular like financial assistance, campus job opportunities, food assistance, and healthcare to name a few. I also have a good support system within my friends and family that I know I can depend on if I needed. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1386,"The resources I have to support me are I would say my parents are the biggest resource I have that are always supporting me. They believe in me and always encourage me and support me in anything I decide to do and trust that I will make the right decision. Another resource I have to support me is my friends, they are one of my biggest support groups and understand how hard school and classes are so they are always there by my side helping me get through my classes. I would say another great resource is the internet, it is very useful and helpful to find support from tutors or youtube videos that help get me through my classes. I feel like I have many resources around me whether it is people or internet resources, I have a lot of support systems that I am surrounded by everyday. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1392,"I have a lot of good resources to support me. I have my grandma who supports me both academically with school help by helping me find scholarships, and financially by helping to pay for my tuition. My boyfriend is my biggest emotional support and supporter as he wants what is best for me and always supports my goals, whenever I am feeling down I know that I can count on him. Academic resources that I have are other friends from high school who are taking similar classes in college. If classes were in person I likely would have joined a study group but that is challenging with online class. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,704,"The resources I have that support me would be my professors, lab partners/colleagues, and tutors. The professors can provide feedback on my assignments and teach me where I went wrong to have a full understanding of the concept. My lab partners/colleagues help me with the labs/classwork and are there during the process of understanding and after. They correct me if I am wrong, or f they/I have questions, we are always happy to help. As for tutors, they are a resource, but it is sometimes difficult to schedule an appointment with them at times because of the lack of tutors and availability. It is disappointing at times, but I have the professors and colleagues to take on these tests and assignments. If I do have a question, emails come fast, so I do not feel lost or alone. The professors are doing great making us feel like “we” are taking on the class, not just me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1409,"Two weeks ago, I would have told you that I did not know I had resources to support me. I recently started to fall behind my courses because my emotional stability had taken a toll on me due to the toxic people that surround me and due to the pandemic, I am forced to cope with the anxiety and depression I have been going through. A week ago, I was overwhelmed with negative feelings, that I could not sleep or think straight, but I knew that the pain I was feeling emotionally I needed someone to listen to me. I needed help and I told one professor and she provided me with the resources I did not know I had. I was too ashamed and too scared to say anything, as I feared I would be called crazy, but I found out, that what I was going through was called distress and there is someone out there to help you. That one professor, change my perspective and helped me get control of my mental state by providing me the resources to get help and if I ever fall down again, I know who to call."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1400,"In terms of educationally, I have the lecture slides, the internet, and my past knowledge of physics from my undergrad.  Due to the fact that I work at a physical therapy clinic, I am able to translate what we have learned in lecture and lab into every day life and in the workplace.  In terms of socially, luckily I have a wonderful group of friends that keep me motivated and are a good distraction with everything that is going on in the world right now.  For me, personally, maintaining a social life is crucial in times of stress because constantly thinking about future assignments and exams can become mentally unhealthy.  Another great distraction is work.  Lastly, my parents are a huge resource in terms of support.  They financially provided for me all four years while i was studying at the University of San Francisco and are still supporting me as I am taking courses here at SFSU. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1387,"This is my first semester back in college after taking a gap year and as a transfer student who is forced going into full online courses due to covid-19, it has been quite the shift. I am lucky enough to have a laptop and internet at my house which is a vital resource for me to succeed in class as well as to use it for homework. I am also lucky enough to have friends that have graduated from SFSU who are able to teach me how to use all the resources that SFSU has to offer such as their library which is very important for me to be able to find resources and books that help support my essays and researches. If I didn't have my friends who went to SFSU, I have also received lots of links that are workshops as well as contacting the information desks which can both provide me a lot of information. Specifically what has helped support me in this class is creating groupchats with classmates so that we can help support one another. It really helps when somebody is confused and someone is able to explain to them and they get it. The labs are also very much in tune with the lecture so that also makes it easy to go along in class."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1391,"I am actually very fortunate because my fiancee is a physics professor at Mills college so I have a great tutor at home if I ever have any trouble with this course. For the most part however I don't rely on her because between the slides, simulations, and explorations this course is structured in a way where the concepts are built upon step by step and I don't often have many questions. However, sometimes during the knowledge checks it's helpful to have someone to reassure me that I am understanding the material."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1396,"Perhaps one of the biggest resources I have is the support system from my family members, friends, and staff/faculties in schools. This form of resource comes in many different ways such as academic, moral, and financial support. Having this supportive network helps me becoming a better person, my parents and my sister are the ones who mostly push me closer toward my goals every day. In addition, every goal can be acquired and obstacles can be overcome with a certain set of skills that I have at my disposal. Hence, my time management skills and being bilingual can be other useful resources that would definitely benefit me in the long run. In terms of physical possessions, owning a laptop and having a reliable wifi network to access the vast internet databases is a huge personal advantage that can be used effectively to boost my creativity, productivity, and even to help me overcome problems. These days there are a plethora of online applications and websites that help organized, manage my time, and possibly systematize my entire life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1412,I don't really have resources to support me. I just started learning physics and all of this is new to me. A resource that I have is the internet. If I am really unsure usually the internet is able to help me. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1404,"My main resource of support resources in life would probably be my girlfriend. We have been together for almost 8 years now so since we were in high school and she always there for me. This includes school support, work, emotional, etc. whatever I need she usually there for me the best she can. We live together and have a dog so we both equally support each other in a lot of ways. Another resource of support would be my weightlifting coach, as a competitive weightlifter, I rely on him a lot to help with training, competition, and whatever else things. He is also my mentor as a coach, and I have learned a lot of the things I know now from him. He is always there when I need a job, training, and any other advice I might need. I guess I could also say my dog is a resource of support too. I can always rely on him to brighten up my day."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1395,"For support, i'm going to assume it means mentally. Since I do feel drained from the last few weeks of school, I've pretty relied on tv shows and grocery store trips to make me feel somewhat alive, since I pretty much can't go anywhere. For the most part, I do have plenty of friends who understand the struggle I'm going through and are supporting me through this time. I also know the school has resources for students who need help, and I would probably consider those if things ever get bad. I also have family to talk to. I also have a lot of understanding professors that would be willing to make accommodations for me if I reached out to them for help."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,700,"The types of resources that I have include financial, family oriented, friendships, and my own personal motivation. I am very Lucky to have a job where I can make money and support myself on my own things. Unfortunately I do not have enough to pay rent and my tuition out of pocket, but I do have the opportunity to get my tuition paid for by FAFSA. This provides a huge support for my education and also my family. I also have my family who can push me to be the best version of myself and who support me through everything I do. I am thankful to have people who acknowledge my success and goals. I am also very grateful for my friends who are there whenever I need them. Last, I am grateful to have a strong positive view towards my successes in my educational journey and of course my other journeys. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1390,"On the topic of resources for school that have supported me depend on how I choose to review for the material. At the moment since all the materials for the exam have been gone over and completed, I'll write down the topics and subtopics that correlate with the main topic and review from there. I use resources like youtube, websites that provide practice examples, and a calculator. Those items have benefited me greatly for taking exams and doing the homework.As resources for my mental health I have a lot of amazing people to talk to that always give great advice when school work starts to overload and stress me out but they have helped me alot through this semester. Another resource I have is my dog and he is an important factor since he is the one that helps me the most and honestly just makes everything so much easier."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1383,"It's really hard to prepare for an exam. A resource for an exam is always the book, but that get too overwhelming especially when exam day is nearing. So I always try to find alternatives. I like to focus on the main points of the exam and from then on, I always look at the lab explorations and summary's that may relate to that topic. I only skim through all the examples and focus on the one's that Professor usually emphasizes during lecture. In addition I think khan academy is a very good resource for the topics that I questioned during the lecture. If not khan, prolly a video that has a better explanation than khan academy, maybe in youtube. But if all of that does help me to prepare for the exam, I think joining study groups is also important. But if I'm  really having a hard time, I think the best resource is still the teacher. I think the teacher is the most crucial and important resource to succeed. Asking questions and getting clarifications. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1384,"The resources I have to support me are my family and friends. When school and all the assignments I have been stressing me out, I can take my mind off that by playing games with my friends or eating lunch with my boyfriend. I am fortunate to have a good support system of close friends that help me through tough times due to academics or problems in life. I can also rely on my friends to help me with assignments and homework if there is anything I don't understand. We often do study groups and help each other in physics or any other classes. I know that there are always office hours and tutoring that the school provides if my friends can not explain a certain topic.Other resources I have are textbooks, the library, pre-recorded lectures, and also the internet. Almost any question can be answered with a quick search from google or videos that explain the topic thoroughly. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1385,"I have friends and family as resources that support me, but other than that I don't have any other resources I can think of. I use to have other people like my therapist but now I don't have that (just a personal preference). I feel like as long as I have the closest people in my life who help me when I need it and support me with any decision I make, I will be okay."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1415,"I usually do not seek help academically from another human beings, my most favorite strategy is to go online and try to figure how to do it. However, I still acknowledge that there are many sources of help that I can count on whenever I need. There's an Advising center, which I haven't checked it out yet, since we're in a difficult situation right now, and I prefer in person meeting more. In general, when I need some helps academically, I would go straight to email my professors, and they usually respond and be able to help me out. I sometimes also stick around after class for quick questions and concerns, and I think it's the best way to solve your academic problems. Emotionally speaking, I've never had the need to talk to anyone, it's probably because I'm an introvert. But I'm not saying emotional support is not important, some people value the meeting with an actual human being more than me, and it's totally fine, and I want those people to know that, emotional helps is all around you, just ask. I'll be willing to talk to you if you need help, your professors will do the same, and almost every single person that you see on the street as well. Resources are all around you, it's just that you have to let people know that you're in need for help. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1405,"Resources I have to support me include my family, friends, classmates, and more resources that I have at school. When I need help with a problem relating to school or in my personal life I have people and resources to go to. Resources includes school provided resources like tutors for help with my academic struggles and support services for mental struggles as well. I have many resources available to choose from but probably don't take advantage to these services and people that are available to support me. It's important to remember there are so many people available to help me succeed in life and emerge through difficult obstacles Im facing in any part of my life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1393,"I have lost and gained resources since covid and shelter in place to affect. At school I had physical access to my lecturers and lab instructors who were able to answer questions in real time using effective demonstrations. I was also able to have access to the library which is a quiet study place that I definitely could have used last semester and this semester. But I have also gained the physical support of my parents a bed that is comfortable (because a rock hard twin extra large was not cutting it) . I also don't fear being in a hotspot anymore, because I would pack into a lecture hall with an enormous amount of students and they were all coughing and such so that was so not good. But now that I am here I am able to pull resources that I am very privileged to have. I always have food to eat that is warm and tasty, I have access to a backyard, access to pets, and the use of a car. Which are things that I did not normally have if I was still living in the dorms."
