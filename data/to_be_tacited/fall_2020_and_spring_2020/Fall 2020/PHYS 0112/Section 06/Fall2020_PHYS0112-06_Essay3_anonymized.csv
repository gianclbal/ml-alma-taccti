2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1384,"When life gets challenging, I try to take my mind off of my problems and distract myself. Sleeping and taking long naps help me pass time and forget about my problems for a bit. I would often lay in bed after I wake up, just thinking about all the stressful and difficult things in my life, unsure of how to solve it. When I can no longer sleep, I will distract myself with video games. Submerging myself in countless hours of nonproductive fun, I forget about my problems. Video games are also a source of outlet, to alleviate stress. I can have fun with friends or by myself and not worry about all the worries I have in life. Another outlet I have is through art. I can spend hours working on a painting or project. Most of these things are a distraction from the challenges of life and distractions are only effective for a certain period of time. Afterward, I will need to face these challenges and tackle them somehow. The stress of these problems can be forgotten but does not go away till I actually do something about it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1401,"I like to go on a run and just take a break from whatever is stressing me out at the time. Usually I like to distract  myself with friends, but with the pandemic, I have been very more introverted which has been very hard to adjust to. I wish life can go back to normal before coved hit, but I have to adjust to focusing on myself and taking care of school. I was excited when school started actually so it can keep me busy, even if it does get stressful at times. But running and swimming is a good way to get my mind off of things as well as baking too. All of those are good distractions when a lot is going on."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1383,"When life get's challenging, I honestly get emotionally and physically stressed out most of the times that my coping mechanism is a breakdown. In some ways, people would think that I would talk to my mom about it and ask for help. But my kindness does really kick in during those tough times that it allows me to hide the burden that I could bring to my mom, so I would not tell. Instead, I always keep it to myself. When I have a challenging problem that I have to face, I do exactly two things. I take a shower and I think for a long time. I cry if necessary, but most of the times I become practical and think of alternatives. In the early (still) years of my twenties, I find myself to rely on alternatives when I find my life in a challenging situation. I cry if I have to, I just never show it to anyone. It's sad, but that's just how life is. We move on. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1385,"when life gets challenging honestly I don't have any plans on how to handle them. that's a flaw that I have and that everybody else knows that I have. I try to suppress any negative emotions I have and just bunker them down inside and pretend as if i'll deal with it later. I have depression and anxiety so i've found those are my coping mechanisms for everything in life which I know is not good and it never helps me. I was a dancer for 18 years and even that didn't help me so I stopped, i've been singing my whole life but I just save that for the shower and long car drives now. I watch too many movies and shows i've seen 100 times but somehow I still like watching them when i'm in distress. I eat food that is really bad for me and will drink wine while doing so. all of these habits may be bad but honestly it's things like that that make me feel like life isn't as challenging and it's just another day. then I have an existential breakdown and do it all over again."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1394,"When life gets hard, I take it as a sign that I need to take breaks to keep my sanity. Especially during weeks wherein school work piles up, and I’m having to keep up with a lot of work all at once. I take breaks and am patient with myself. I also make sure to do things I enjoy that help me relax a bit. Some of these things are watching youtube videos and eating good food. When things get hard, it is very easy to overwhelm yourself by thinking about all the things that you have not yet done but need to. So, it is best to not think about all the other requirements and focus all your attention on what you have to do. When all else fails, I might kindly ask my professors if they could extend a deadline for something, so that I would be able to catch up on the work that I need to do. This also takes some of the pressure off of myself."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1415,"There are multiple times that a person might feel like they're desperate because of life's challenges. For me, that rarely happens, and I'm talking about serious challenges, not just a bad score or a bad luck. I usually look at the bright side of the challenge, to remind myself that I have enough courage and energy to get over it. It's a very effective strategy that I've been using for years, and it often work pretty well. Of course, sitting calmly in the room alone with some kind of drink would definitely makes life easier, and I always do it that way. It's important to have a mindset that is ready to be affected by hardship, and my advice is that you should take some time to think about the problem, so that you can find a way to solve it, sometimes the answer is very easy to find, it's just because of the burden that is occupying your mind that's causing stress. Relieving those stress would definitely help you to heal your mental health, and from there giving you the fresh and healthy mind to come up with a solution. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1405,"When life gets challenging, I take time to clear my head and do something for myself. When I'm stressed with a lot of homework I might take brakes and clean or organize my space, go on a walk, run random errands, or in today's case I sat repotting some plants in my room. Doing small things lets me take some time away from what is stressing my out but still let's me feel like I'm accomplishing something meaningful or doing something that relaxes me.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,704,"When life gets challenging, I try to meditate and recollect my thoughts. I have bad anxiety, so I have to relax and think all my situations out. I start thinking and reminding myself why I am here and calm my nerves. Reminding myself why I am here gets my mind straight and it lets me know I have to overcome it. I also love to listen to music. I have a broad genre of liking to music, and It just sooths me. I can jump to classical to reggaeton really quick, all soothing. Makes me happy. I dance to it and blast it in my room, just makes me energetic and makes me feel like life is carefree. I am a musician myself, so music is literally my serenity and gets my mind together."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1392,"When life gets challenging I first have a mental breakdown about it and will probably get a little mad and a little sad and will most likely shed a few tears. However, to help myself when life gets challenging I be sure to hang out with peers who motivate me such as my boyfriend or other friends who can relate and are going through similar struggles. However, I just moved to Washington with a close friend so I have her, but I will have to find other friends to be outlets and help get me out of the house as well. To be honest I don't have the healthiest coping mechanisms for when life gets challenging and I often times find myself really overwhelmed and stressed out. One thing that I do that helps is using a planner and making lists of all the school work and other things that I need to do, I then prioritize by what's stressing me out the most. Another thing I do when life is challenging is to just take a step back and breath because most of the time in the long run it will be okay."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,700,"when life gets challenging I try to not cry because I cry a lot. Instead I try to be optimistic and positive towards the situation and I try to see what solutions can be done to fix the problem or issue. In my current situation, I have been very stressed with online learning and fish myself having no break whatsoever. On my time off I work so that I can make money but what sucks is that I don't work enough to make the money I need. I have 3 complete days off the week and the other days are all day for classes and homework. The amount of homework that we have been given due to online remote learning is insane. I don't even find myself learning anymore as much as I try. I find myself staring at screens trying to figure out how to finish all this online hw on time. I have terrible eye strains and irritation from staring at screens 24/7. it has gotten to the point when I can't even use my phone well because it has gotten so difficult to see. so in this situation I am going to try and order some blue light glasses to help with the eye strain and headaches, but it sucks because I also need prescription glasses and I can't get some with my prescription because it costs too much. Which brings me back to my main point about money. I can't e spending the money I barely have. So now that life is currently challenging, all I can do is continue to check off my duties and do what I have to do. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1402,"When life gets challenging I tend to invest my time put in overtime to whats causing me problems or contributing to the ""challenging feelin that im having to over ease the tension. Things that usually make me feel this way often revolve my future. A lot of the time i find myself worked up over school, finances, my career, my living circumstances, and independence. In response to these challenges, I take brakes from time to time to increase my confidence/ footing by researching how to increase to be successful and I play building and point of view living/ lifestyle games that I work towards the life I have (virtually).  For now, this routine is working for me because I don't get too deep in self doubt thoughts and my anxiety. This also really works for me because I don't tend to get hung up on my games that I escape to, to the point of not being able to focus. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1391,"I don't really have many effective tools for that. Mostly I take what I call ""stress baths"" where I sit in a bathtub until I'm less panicked. One thing though is talking with and just being near my partner. It makes it easier to ignore the existential dread and mundane challenges of life when you have someone to share it with that is on the same page as you. I guess that's somewhat codependent but it's better than nothing. Lately I've been doing a lot of physical labor helping my dad refloor his whole house and that has been a good distraction from real life. I wish gyms were still a thing because I could really use the distraction and exercise. Maybe I should get a bike. I don't know, again, I'm not great at coping when life gets challenging and life is always challenging.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1406,"What I do when life gets challenging is I stop what I am doing and I try to go step by step and take things slowly at a time. There are different types of challenges I would go through. For example, if I too many things going on at once then I plan and organize what I need to do to get each job done and on time. If there are hard decisions I have to make then I weigh out all of my options and think about the future. What I mean is that I think if I make a certain decision then what the possible outcomes may be. The challenging points I had to go through this semester were organizing my time with school, work, and personal work. Figuring out what to do and make time was challenging, side school work to graduate on time, and the career I want to focus on becoming. I had a lot of challenging times but I am getting out of it by taking step by step and planning/organizing.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1396,"When life gets challenging, I usually take a break from everything by having a long nap and allow myself to have a little mental break. While I spend some time relaxing, I also try to reflect on my inner world such as where I am mentally and accessing my own abilities to see what I can do better. For the past months, since the pandemic heightened uncertainties, I often feel overwhelmed, experiencing higher than normal stress and anxiety levels, and sometimes to the point where I felt powerless over the direction of my life. There were moments where I almost gave up with online classes and I could not keep up with the workloads from classes and my responsibilities in my family. Luckily, I was able to share my feelings with others and learn to cope with uncertainties. I learned to manage my time more effectively to get things done on time and at the same time also to balance works and break time. Lately, I have been working on letting go of the negativities to focus on finding the solution for the challenges. I also try to motivate myself to stay on track by rewarding myself a delicious meal after I accomplish all the tasks on my to-do list for the day."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1386,"When life gets challenging I usually try and stay optimistic no matter how hard it gets for me. I usually can push myself, and get myself through anything, so I just remind myself that I have gotten through hard changes before in life, I can get through it again. So far i have only had to face small challenges, and I get very stressed out but when that happens I remind myself that the situation could be worse or harder and I try to stop and relax and try and think clear headed without all the stress. Also if I need to I always ask people for help, I am not afraid to ask for help and if I am in a situation that is too hard to get through on my own then I always have people who will help me out. I feel like I will ever encounter a thing too challenging in life because I can always handle the situation and I will always have people by my side to help me through the tougher things in life. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1400,"I am currently attempting to balance being a full time student and two jobs.  Time management has been my best friend all throughout college and has definitely helped me stay disciplined and organized.  Especially with what has been going on this past year, it is easy to fall into this rabbit hole of challenges and mental and physical instability.  Thus, when life whens challenging, I enjoy surrounding myself with the people that I love and enjoy the company of.  I currently live in San Francisco away from my parents because I am originally from Orange County.  Having good friends and company is a great distraction and can easily lighten my mood instantly.  In terms of things that I can do alone when life gets challenging, I've always enjoyed working out.  Due to COVID, many gyms are not currently open, but luckily I work at a physical therapy clinic that has a fitness center that us employees have access to.  My outlet would be working out and getting proper rest.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1408,"When life gets challenging it really depends on the situation and mindset I am in with how I react and handle myself. I typically like to take as much personal time and personal space away from whatever it may be that seems too overwhelming or stressful for me at the time. I enjoy my alone time and peace of mind so I find myself doing this often - even more so now that we have been quarantined all year. I try to practice self-care and mindfulness because over the years my anxiety has gotten very challenging and can interfere a lot with my everyday life such as work, classes, and trying to understand the material being taught while finding the motivation to get through and complete it. I feel that it is necessary to have several outlets and ways to channel stress when life gets challenging. I also enjoy watching shows to take my mind off things (aka reality) and being outdoors in nature where I can rebase and ground myself. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1393,"Right now life is challenging. I am doing school completely online which involves a lot of self teaching. This is because I don't have the luxury of asking questions live like I normally would in some of my classes. So in the past six or seven months I have tried multiple different ways to deal with challenges. The one that has seemed to work the best is breaking down the challenge. One huge challenge can feel incredibly overwhelming. But breaking it up into smaller challenges that can be fixed with my own actions makes challenges seem much smaller. It is the same way I deal with goals. If I have a life goal that right now seems impossible to me I quickly get overwhelmed and freeze exactly where I am. But if I break it up into more manageable goals, I am able to get closer and closer to my goal without putting an enormous strain on my mental health."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1404,"The first thing I do when life feels challenging or getting hectic including work, school, sports training is prioritizing myself and take control of everything I have full control of. This would mean getting to the gym to train, taking a break from work, and give me a break if needed by finding downtime during my day where I can relax watch shows, or play video games, and find time to hang out with friends/girlfriend/dog. These are my ways to deprioritize the stress I am having and focus on the things that make me happy and I would say about 80% of the time taking time to myself is all I really need to distress or to kind of hit that reset button and get full control of my stress. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1397,"When life gets tough I usually just go for a run. Running seems to clear my mind and allow me to think about it while I run. By the time I am done running. Sometimes I can even have a solution to whatever it is that was bothering me. Not only running but usually teachers are a huge help for when school gets tough. Although in college it does seem to be a bit different. Teachers have way to many students to focus too much attention on just one student. In high school I would have more one on one help and that is when I learned the best. So when ever I was just not understanding something I would go and ask for help. Teachers were usually alone. Not having anyone go to there office hours. However, I was always in there classes. Going from one class to the next. In order to ask for help to a problem or concept we had learned that day."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1410,"During this pandemic, school life is much more difficult than usual. The school setting is obviously not the best for learning since we do not get to physically interact with classmates or professors. Also, we need to be very concentrated on doing schoolwork or attending classes since we have a lot of distractions at home. There is a lot more things we need to adapt to the virtual learning environment. When I get stressed out because of all the challenges in life, I like to take a break from everything and go eat snacks or go take a shower. I will try not to think about the issue nor the solution because I deeply know that I need that time to relax my brain. Otherwise, things will just get worse and worse. After I get out of my bad mood, we can be more productive and efficient at work. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1395,"I have a very bad tendency to drown out my problems in order to avoid actually dealing with them. So when life gets challenging i usually ignore it. This is usually by doing other things, going on social media, basically thinking that if my mind is on something else, then the problems I have wont feel as detrimental. I have friends, but I'm not really a person who likes to open up about their emotions, so I usually keep everything bottled up. It makes me feel like I'm a burden when I tell others about my problems and they have to be sorry or give me advice. I realized most of the people around me don't even know about half of the things I struggle with. It's pretty unhealthy, but I'm trying to work on opening up to others and not being afraid of vulnerability. When I have kids, I want to teach them that it's okay to open up and that they shouldn't be afraid to cry or be sad."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1389,"When life gets challenging, I try to express those feelings in a drawing. I have been drawing for a few years now and have recently transitioned into digital art, but my main medium used to be watercolor. When I would get upset and was not able to talk about it with friends, I would express those emotions in a painting. However, art puts a strain on my body (I had focal dystonia and just bad posture in general) so I cannot draw for too long at a time, and have significantly decreased my art workload.Now, if I am feeling too overwhelmed I will often take a break from everything and put on my favorite sad songs to karaoke to. I was a dancer for six years as well so I dance if I am able (I now live in a studio apartment so that is no longer an option). After about half an hour of singing poorly, usually my mood will improve and I'll sing more upbeat songs instead. Once I am totally relaxed, I'll keep the music going and try to get back to work. I would prefer to rely on talking to my friends when the going gets rough, but there has been some discourse in our group lately which makes doing so difficult. Until then, art and music will definitely be my top two go to comforts. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1413,"What I do when life gets challenging is that I think about spending time with my bird. My bird is my son and when I get upset or sad, I think about him, his tantrums when he doesn't get a treat, when he gives me little pecks (perhaps they are kisses?) on my face, or the way he waddles on the floor and screams for me to pick him up when he has wings. I think he often forgets he has wings since we spoil him too much (take him and place him everywhere). Another thing I usually do when life gets challenging is thinking about how at the end of the day, I will be wrapped in my blankets watching a rerun of one of my favorite T.V shows, Malcolm in the Middle, and just think about how the challenges I currently face will later fade away and the next day will come."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1411,"When life gets challenging, I usually motivate myself and think of it as a challenge to do. I try my best to do it, but at the same time when I am depressed; I shut down and can't think. I'm unable to do the things I want to. I am unmotivated to the point where I just don't care but I do, I just can't bring myself to do the things I want to do. In other terms, when life gets too emotionally challenging for me, I like to remind myself that I am okay, I will be fine. However there's other factors that break down my motivation, causing me to just cry. When I end up in tears, I just cry it all out so the next  day, I will be good as new. I won't let them affect me for long or I try not to, because I want to strive and be the best I can, each and everyday."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1388,"When I am really stressed I like to focus on self care. Try and take some time to relax and do things like skincare, play a game, watch tv, or walk to the beach. Usually skin care and a hot shower works the best but a small jog or walk is nice. Sometimes the fresh air is really needed. Especially with this pandemic I'll be n my room all day. I just moved to a new apartment near the beach so its really nice to get some ocean breeze on a walk. With school being all online I have been more stressed though. I would always take the bus to school and do homework at the library and it really relaxed me and helped me stay focus. But I am finding other ways to focus in my house. I only have one housemate now so its easier to focus without so many people in and out of the house. I used to live with 4 other girls and it was hard to concentrate sometimes."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1399,"When life gets challenging, it's really hard on me. Life is never easy on my side since I've grown up. Every day is hard, whether it comes to school, family, life problems, everything. I always do for a drive around the city. I never have a certain place that I tend to go to but I always result in driving. The fresh air just makes me feel at ease. There are no perfect days but there are perfect moments. I choose to be happy when I can. Most of the time, it's always school or my family that stresses me out. One time, I recall having a major mental breakdown, all I thought to myself was leaving the situation can result to making it worse but I had to go. I left and drove up to mission resort, to take a breather staring at the water. It's not much but it was very relaxing, not a very busy area, so it was fine. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,693,"When life gets challenging I simply hold in until I emotionally cannot function. I try my best to tough it out, accept that life is not easy and others have it worse. Probably not the best outlet for my health but the show must go on. I have slowly improved to let out my feelings by getting a therapist. My mind is constantly going back and forth about what I feel and what I should feel. It is not easy right now to feel connected to others, to wake up, repeat the day without a break, the few moments of happiness with friends, and enjoying the day are drifting into an abyss. It is a reality now to not be at my best, I relied before on music and seeing the campus to make me feel committed to something. All I can think of now is how crazy the world is and how much it needs to improve. Academically, I only have screenshots in my notes with few analysis, I rely on pictures of what to do and rarely my own work. However, despite the loss of sanity, there is a strong urge to get out of whatever loophole we are in. I vigorously clean, organize, or mostly shove things into drawers too, so out of sight, out of mind, head empty, no thoughts. Perhaps venting negative and overwhelming emotions through writing does help, letting go of the emotional baggage we all carry helps."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,541,This question is a little hard to answer at the moment do to the fact that life right now is very much challaneging. I've found myself struggling ALOT with the changes that were put into place because of the pandemic. For example its been hard to balance out school and work as a healthcare worker. Online classes have taken a big toll on me and I feel so emotianlly drained. What I do instead of stressing myself out is going out with my girlfriend on small beach trips or just going out to get fresh air.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1398,"When life gets challenging, I tend to at first, panic and stress out due to mental issues that still linger from the past. I like to distract myself at first by listening to some music or watching some videos. Sometimes, I even talk to my friends. When I am able to, I like to ask my close friends for advice on what to do, or help. If it tends to be a personal problem, I like to write in my journal to get the steam out and allow myself to reflect on the issues I am facing. All of these methods were those of which I had to learn over time as I struggled with my personal problems. I like to vent to people that I closely know and receive any advice or personal critique because if I am in the wrong I’d like to know. I always take time to reflect and think before jumping to a solution or conclusions."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1390,"What I do when life gets challenging really depends on the severity of the problem. For the minor things that happen in my life I usually talk to my mom and she always helps me out with solving my problem whether it be an actual solution or taking me to go out to eat when there is nothing we can do to change the outcome of my problem. For when life gets more difficult I usually just stress myself out and contemplate my life choices and then probably cry because I would want to change my major but it is already too late for me in the semester or in life to make any changes. And when things get unbelievably hard it usually goes along with the phrase, ""when one door closes, another door opens."" My life has always been like that and something comes up where it will make my life a lot more better than it was before."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1412,"This semester itself is challenging with the whole switch to online because of corona virus. What I find challenging in this semester is staying focused, and doing what needs to be done because everything we do is virtual and it leads me to be distracted with my phone. When things get stressful like these past weeks with exam I like to spend my time playing video games. It takes me away from school and I can have fun, while enjoying it with my friends. Video games have always been there to help me well I was feeling down or struggling with stuff. Theres so many types of video games that I never get bored, which I can enjoy by myself or play with friends. What I find challenging in many classes is public speaking I don't like speaking in front of an audience how I try to deal with this is with deep breathes."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1407,"Whenever my life gets hard, i usually want to keep inside. I know this is not exactly healthy, but i am the kind of person who likes to keep things private. Luckily for me my best friend knows me really well so whenever i talk to him, he can tell if something is wrong. He is the person i share things with. Other things i like to do when i am alone is go on walks in the hills. I live near a regional wilderness and it is so nice to just go and get lost in thought there. This usually helps me to feel better because i am alone and able to process everything. The only problem is that my problems are usually waiting for me when i get back. But it is definitely nice to be able to get away from all of the little things for awhile."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1409,"What do I do when life gets challenging? That is a good question, I like to say I do positive things, but the truth is I distract myself the best way I can because thinking of the problems causes me so much anxiety. When I finally face the problem, after so much inner conflict and suffering, I have no choice but to get over it and go through it. Coping with challenges is something I am still learning to do and not all the times I get it right. Sometimes some challenges are easier than others and others are just lessons to learn from. Sometimes they show you that you need help."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1387,"When life gets challenging I like to give myself some me time. Though self-care is important and should be applied to our daily lives sometimes it's really challenging to do. I like to get myself my favorite food, sushi and put on a show and just do that for a couple of hours. I also let myself cry because I'd rather have my emotions come out rather than to bottle it up and act like I'm okay. I used to think I'd burden my friends when I talked to them about my problems but now I know that my friends want to be there for me so I also reach out to them. It's important to surround ourselves with people that we know are a bright light in our lives but also knowing that we can be the same for them. Back in high school I was on the golf and swim team and that was also my get-away. In golf, it's a quiet game so I'd have a lot of time to think for myself or just to be in an environment that is quiet whereas in swim I just kept powering through my laps and letting the frustration escape me. "
