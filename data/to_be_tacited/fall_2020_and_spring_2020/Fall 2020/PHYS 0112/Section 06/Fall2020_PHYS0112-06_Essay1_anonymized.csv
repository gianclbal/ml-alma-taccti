Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1383,"I am here because I needed to complete this course as part of the Biology graduation checklist. I have never taken any physics course before so I am nervous. In high school i had to an option to take physics but I never taken it because I did not like math. LOL. I am super new to this subject and I think I should have not judged it before taking the actual course. I think physics will be interesting if I was the most curious person in the world. But I am not really an in depth person in that way. I focus more on the human body and life. I think that's really a big difference between what I like to do and what I have to do. But I need to pass this class in order to graduate, so I will have to do my best and give my all."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1384,Why am I here? I never thought about this question before or how I am suppose to answer. I guess my purpose in life is to live my best life. To change or impact the people around me. I want to be a good role model for my little brother and care for parents in the future. I want to do things on my bucket list and explore before I die. I have dreams of traveling the world and trying different foods with my friends. I want to do risky things like sky dive or jump off cliffs. I guess I want my life to be exciting and fun. Some of my goals are to become a brain surgeon or a researcher. I want to help people also live their best lives. There are a lot of things that impacted or pushed me towards this route. I don't want to see the people around me suffer from diseases or be in pain. I want to find cures to these diseases or at least prevent them. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1385,"I have always thought about this question, and for a period of time (almost 7-8 years) I really thought I never had a purpose as to why I am here. I always tried to make a joke out of it and say 'I'm here as someone's punching bag', 'I am someone's shoulder to cry on', or 'I am here as a placeholder'. I liked to think I was here just make people laugh, or help them in a math class when they need help because I've been told I was 'smart' (subjective). To be honest I still don't know why I am here or what my purpose in life is but I am only 21, I don't think I'm suppose to know yet. I know now that as of this point in time I am meant to be a good sister, daughter, friend, girlfriend, student and whatever else people might see of me. And that's what I've always felt called to be, just a helpful, good, nice person in society since there's a bunch of bad in the world. And maybe make fun of myself to make people laugh every so often along the way (it's why people find me funny)."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1386,"I am here because I have a strong passion for fitness and for helping others. So I want to become a physical therapist to be able to do what I love while I also help others. I personally think it would be amazing to help someone who thinks they will never walk again to be able to walk again. Also I love the fitness aspect of it and that it still involves movement and it is not a sedentary job. I want to be active all of my life, so I love a job that keeps me moving. Along with that, I just love taking care of my body and doing what is best for it, so taking classes like these, help me to better understand the world and human bodies and how everything works and affects us. I also think that physics is essential to life and to know how the world works is very important in any major or path you take in life. I personally think everyone should take physics to learn more about how things work and why they work like that. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,541,"I am here because I really want to be able to understand physics and the mechanics of it. I am a senior at state and sometimes I feel like I haven't really accomplished much in the past couple of years. I feel that way because I'm a little behind on my studies and thats do to the fact that I used to commute from Gilroy to SF, but this year I recently moved to SF but now its more challenging for me because my preferred method of instruction is in person instead of virtual and now I have t o be able to get used to be in class while being at home. A lot of things have changed in the past couple of years but I do intend to be very interactive and participate during lab. I'm also here because I'm a Biology Major and I want to be able to hopefully one day be able to work with kids and become a pediatrician. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1387,"September 2nd, 2020I’m taking physics because I want to major in Biology and it’s a necessary course. Though it’s only the second week of class, I already notice and understand how physics is present in our everyday lives. I’m here so that I can graduate, pursue my career and expand my knowledge in life. I also just generally enjoy science, though it can be difficult at times. I’m really excited to be taking physics for the first time and see what I learn. I also will have to retain this information as I also need to take physics 2. I’m most excited for the experiments because I like being hands-on so it’s a little sad that most of our labs are going to be done online with stimulations. Nonetheless, I’m excited to be in a lab with quite a bit of fun classmates and to be able to rely on both their help along with our Professor."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1388,"The main reason I am here is because it is needed for my major. Even though I have to take this class I am interested in physics and know it is something I need knowledge in. I am majoring In KIN and want to be a nurse when I’m older, to be a nurse I need more understanding of movement in the body and physics will help me with that. I am also here because I signed up for this class last summer but I was already taking summer classes and it was too much with work. I am happy I am doing this fall and not in the summer, because I want to make sure I do good in this class and retain physics knowledge for my future career. The classes I did take in the summer went very fast and I feel like I retained nothing. I was just stressed and rushing to finish assignments as fast as I could because it was so fast paced and I had to work almost everyday. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1389,"Why am I here?It’s a question that I get a lot in classes nowadays. To be quite honest, this class is necessary for my degree and most likely to get into medical school. It’s a shallow answer, but if I had to elaborate then I would say that this class is a step towards becoming a doctor. I’ve wanted to become a doctor for as long as medical books have existed in libraries. My mother used to quiz me on them from a young age, and I could watch TV excessively if it were medical dramas. I doubted if that was what I truly wanted, but after interning in an operating room over the summer in high school, my passion was solidified. I wanted to be the one doing the procedure- not just watching. Of course, to get to that point, I had to go to college. I am more passionate more than ever to achieve my goals. My friend passed away recently from a disease. When my other friend who was much closer to her said to me, “I hope you become a great doctor so you can help people like her,” I knew that my ambitions were personal. I miss my friend every day, and I haven’t been the same without her. I struggle in day to day life and classes because of the grief. However, if to do well in school is what it takes, then I will power through. I have the chance to do the things she did not. I can’t afford to take this time for granted."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1390,"I am here in this class because I am a Biology major with a concentration in physiology and the requirements for my major is to take this class with Physics 111, and to be eligible to get my bachelors degree. Another main reason why I need the knowledge from this class is in order to take the MCAT I need physics in my academic background. In the career I want to pursue, I have to take the MCAT, which involves a section of physics, to get into medical school to soon become an anesthesiologist. I have an interest in learning physics since I have never been in a setting where I actually took the class and the only prior knowledge I have is from watching the Big Bang Theory and learning from there which is not the best source. Nevertheless I am eager to learn about the science and why it fascinates many others."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1391,"I am here for multiple reasons, the primary one being to meet my last requirement for graduation. That is not to say that I am disinterested in physics. I am deeply interested in the fundamental forces that shape our world from gravity, machinery, and even on a molecular & subatomic scale. While I wouldn't consider physics my strong suit it is undeniable that the same forces at play both macro & micro are what have lead to the universe we find ourselves in. Even in my major (chemistry, specifically organic) physics drives the principals we use to develop novel synthetic pathways. Physics is the foundation science of the universe (though some would argue mathematics is the foundation). Despite me having a lack of enthusiasm for the subject, I recognize without it we would not have the knowledge and skill set to advance the rest of the physical sciences. Due to this, I have a deep respect for the subject even though it doesn't capture my imagination like chemistry does. I look forward to spending the semester learning more through this course and applying that knowledge in my career and daily life. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1392,"Why am I here? My initial thought when hearing this question is why was I born and what is my purpose? However, that is a really broad question that at 19 years old I do not necessarily know how to answer, but hopefully eventually as I grow wiser with age I’ll be able to formulate some sort of answer to that question. In a less broad sense why am I here in this class and in college? I’d answer by saying I am a first generation college student who has alway loved school and who has dreamt of going to college since I was a little girl. I am going to college so that I can get a higher better paying job, and escape having to live paycheck to paycheck, and many other hardships that my parents had to face while I was growing up. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1393,"To be honest the only reason I am here is because it is required for my major. I took physics in high school and absolutely hated it, so hopefully this will be a redemption. So far I am kind of getting what's going on in class. I am very thankful that I have my lecture before this course because I feel it helps me throughout the lab. I am hoping that the information I learn in this class will really sink in because I am taking physics 2 next semester and I assume that this information will be useful and/or needed. I do know that physics can be really cool especially in labs. Because this is an online course this semester I do not quite know how all of that is going to work but I am optimistic. I am preparing myself to work through a lot of issues and hardships I might face doing all of this learning. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,704,"I am here because I want to go to medical school someday. I am here because of my family. I am the first to go to a university within the United States, I want to make them proud and support my family here, and Peru. My major is biochemistry, and this is a requirement for my class. Not here just for the requirement, but to gain knowledge that can be useful in my life and in graduate school in the future. My childhood was in Arizona, and I moved to Long Beach, and I noticed that the education systems were not the best. I want to take advantage of this education and hopefully receive income to where I can support my family and doing it with something I love to do.  I love making others feel better, and I want to heal them from past trauma, so this class is essential to my degree and my life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1394,"I am here literally because it is a requirement that I need for my undergrad. I am studying to hopefully enter dental school and I do like science. I'm hoping to learn more about this field and expand my knowledge as I'm sure it will be used along my future career path. In college, I am just discovering myself and hoping to find what makes me happy in the long run and meet others along the way who are in the same boat."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1395,"If I'm being completely honest, I'm here because I'm required to take this class for my major. However, that doesn't change the interest I have for physics. I've taken physics twice in high school: regular physics in my junior year and AP physics my senior year. I was scared to take a step into a more advanced course in my senior year because I knew physics could get really complicated, but I had a really good teacher who really cared about his students. He helped me all throughout the year and even made some expectations for me because he knew I wasn't the best, but I was at least trying. His teaching skills helped take an interest in physics, although I am a biology major. This is my first experience having a lab dedicate to physics so I'm curious but a bit nervous at the same time. I'm hoping the concepts won't be too difficult to understand."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1396,"I am taking this class mainly because it is a pre-requisite course for the next physic class in the sequence for my Biology major. Besides that, I also want to expand my breadth of knowledge about the world of physics and not simply focus on what I am exactly comfortable with. Taking this class will develop some transferable skills that will help me in the long run. I took physics when I was in my freshman year of high school which was almost five years ago. Back then, I only learned about the conceptual physics and I often gave up when I encountered a word problem that was too hard. I did not actually allow myself to really try to understand the materials before giving up. Therefore, this class will give another chance to explore more about the subject. This is a good opportunity for me to refresh my memories of what I learned since high school physics class. Most importantly, I hope to strengthen quantitative reasoning and problem-solving skills that are valuable in areas beyond physics."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,693,"I am here because this class is a requirement for my biology major. I enjoy science a lot, by learning more I feel like the world becomes both easier to understand because there are so many working parts. Physics can be interesting depending on the student and the teacher. Initially, I didn't know why I am here or what my own purpose is, perhaps it is because I am afraid of my own expectations. In reality, I always come back to the same thing, the reason I am here is to learn. And not so much as academically, but learn life lessons, values and experience what it is like to be human. To feel human, to feel pain, heartbreak, serenity, forgiveness, joy and feel that life is actually so much more simpler than we think it to be. I am here to grow and experience and give life my own personal meaning through my own form of storytelling. I think that is what the meaning of life is, not to get too existential, but the true meaning of life is to give life your own meaning, deliver a happiness relative to your own perspective. Being a young person can be difficult sometimes because as your developing, you start to learn how overwhelming your own emotions can be, how complex the world is, how scary and different it is from how you imagined. Sometimes it can be even be numbing to experience so much in such a short life span but we all have a purpose whether or not we want to accept it is up to us. I decided mine to simply be to experience life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1397,"I am here to learn physics. More than that though because I am trying to become a mechanical Engineer. I need to pass this course in order for me to reach the next class. If I do not, I will not be able to become an Engineer. I hope to be able to pass with flying colors in this class because I was really good at Physics in High School all though I did tend to spend almost every single day after class bugging my teacher on how to solve a problem. He never said that I asked him a dumb question though. To get back to the point though he inspired me to go onto Engineering. His name was Mr. Galaz. He is a huge reason as to why I am here today taking this class. He made Engineering sound like something anyone could do. Not only that he made physics class fun to be in with projects and demonstrations in class."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1398,"To put it simply, I am here because this is a pre-requisite for my major classes later down the line of my college career. If it is a general question, I’d say I’m here to learn more about the things I am curious about. The one goal I have for myself in life is to just be happy. I chose to major in biology because I want to discover more about what’s out there in the world and how it works. I find all kinds of science interesting, being able to see the bigger picture outside my own little world. Physics is interesting as many of the concepts are conceptual and people who are younger wouldn’t really think much about how it works, but once you learn about things like energy and gravity, it opens up so much knowledge and things to discover. All of this leads to a stronger curiosity about how things in the world work and what part we humans take in it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,700,I am here because I want to get a higher education and grow my knowledge. I want to be in the medical field in the future so getting my bachelors degree in biology or a science in general is going to better prepare me for that field and career. I think it's important to understand the basics of science and be able to understand how this all affects us and the world around us in a science perspective throughout or lives and even on the daily. In the future I want to be a physician assistant and becoming that requires a good eduction and a bachelors. Deep down I am doing this also for my mother and my family to have a better education that my family was unable to get. I also want to be a role model for my 4 siblings and show them that college is an option and it can lead to many opportunities. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1399,"I am taking the course of physics to open my learning about the matter of science. I truly have a passion for science and its studies but I always tend to find myself struggling, but I rather struggle and learn rather than to know straight from the point. It is my first time taking a physics course so I am very excited. I do not expect myself to know everything but I know that I do have my resources and instructors who can help me. I would like to widen my knowledge of the branches of physics and to come across how it reflects to our universe. My purpose is to succeed in this class and to take my knowledge and apply it to everything in my daily life. I hope to understand why one does what it does, such as gravity and motion. I am eager to achieve for a deeper understanding of physics."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1400,"I recently graduated from USF in May and I am currently taking classes here at SFSU to meet my pre req requirements.  I graduated with a kinesiology degree at USF and I want to pursue physical therapy in the future.  I will be applying to physical therapy school after this semester.  Physics courses are essential in terms of physical therapy and human anatomy because topics such as vectors and forces can be a good analogy when it comes to the human body and its bones.  I currently work at a physical therapy clinic at Presidio Sport and Medicine and majority of the exercises that i prescribe my patients coincide with physics topics/analogy.  The human body, specifically our bones, joints, and tendons all move in different directions and provide different amounts of force that can be acted upon.  This is essentially why I think I am here in this course.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1401,"I'm here because I would like to pursue a career in bio physiology. Physics 1 is a major requirement which is technically why I am taking this particular class, but the bigger picture is why that I would like to have a career in something medical, maybe nursing, but I still have a lot to figure out before I officially graduate. I am a third year, a little behind because I declared my major as a sophomore, but still excited to expand my knowledge on physics. This is truly my first real physics course which is pretty nerve racking, in high school I didn't need to take it, so I am excited to see why everyone loves this subject so much! Although school is sadly online I can already tell this class will be a lot of fun! Even though my major does not have much to do with physics I still think Ill end up finding this course quit interesting. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1402,"Phelan Glenn  Vernon Wetzell  PHYS112-06  8/31/2020  Reflective Journal #1 : ""Why am I here?""     After hearing so much about the struggles of physics I actively avoided having to take this class sequence. I didn’t want to accept the importance behind why physics plays a hefty role in chemical functions, but after spending time looking over the class concepts and materials I am less intimidated by these courses.   I’d like the imagine physics as an easy general education class, which would have been a lot easier when I was young and immature, but after so many physical science classes over the past couple of years in community college I am unable to take this class so lightly. I now understand how particular this class is to understand and develop my academic career and research career. I am here to extend my knowledge of biochemistry and the functions of organic- chemical medicine."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1403,"I'm going to assume the question of why I am here is related to being in this class. Assuming that, I am mainly taking this class for my major requirements. I am a biology major and thus need to take PHYS 111 and PHYS 112. Even though this is the reason I am taking this class, I am still excited to learn more about physics. I have never taken a physics class before, but I love science in general and am excited to learn how things work in the world and, more importantly, being able to do some practical use in this Lab course. I am not exactly sure what you do in a physics lab class, especially one that is online, but I am hoping to have some fun with what we learn in class and maybe doing some ""experiments"" every once and awhile. Hopefully I can learn things in this class that I can use to help be in both my major and my field. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1404,"If we are talking about this specific class I am here primarily as a prereq for Biomechanics. Luckily I also enjoy physics and learning about physics so I am glad I am able to take this class. I also understand that this is a relatively important class as physics is found all around us and not just in math formulas we learn in class. If we are talking about why am I at SFSU it because of the great kinesiology program that is offered here. I also learned about the kind of fast track program to work on my master's in kinesiology while I am finishing up my bachelor's degree. So to the question of why I am here is that I am trying to finish up my degree in Kinesiology to pursue a career as a strength and conditioning coach at the college level, and to do so I need to complete this class to be able to continue my major classes."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1405,"Directly I am here, writing this response in physics lab, because this is a course required for my degree and I am receiving credit for writing this. However I am here in this physics course and other required classes that I need to take for my studies in order to pursue further education and get a college degree. But this means I am also here because I want to continue to learn and grow and better myself. Getting a degree to me means one more tool I need to move into a career where I can have a good impact and make myself happy doing something I enjoy. In order to achieve my true goals in life I have to be right here. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1406,"I am here because I am a Biology major going into human genetics. I need this class to be able to take the other classes that I need to for my Biology classes. I like physics and learning about physics so I am excited to be part of this class and get a better understanding as well. I am here so I may accomplish my goal to graduate on time and continue on to get my masters (most likely in a different university) which hopefully will lead me to get the career choice that I want. Other than that I am here to get to know people, have fun (when I finish my work) and have adventures when I possibly can. I love hiking, soccer, rugby, and I am a pre-med which will help me get to know more people and know people who are similar around me. Thank You :-)"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1407,"I am here because this is the path of my major here at San Francisco State. This class will give me one of the requirements that i need to eventually graduate from here so i can hopefully go on to law school. The reason i am here today is because i have changed my major three separate times, and i have finally chosen to pursue my dream major of being a scientist. Before i was listening to my parents who told me that a science degree would not give me the amount of job opportunities later on in life, but now i have learned that if your whole heart is not in something, then it is not worth doing. This is the way that i want to live my life, and hopefully it does not come back to haunt me in the future. My dream is to become a lawyer and someday have the money o be able to provide for my family. But looking at how i got here is something truly amazing - as all the accidents and coincidences have led me to this moment. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1408,"Why am I here?I will start by saying that I’m in college to expand my mind and knowledge in various topics. I enjoy the classroom setting and having open dialogue from petiole of all types of backgrounds and upbringings. i’m in the Physics 1 class and Physics Lab to gather a better understanding of the world around me. Though this class is a requirement for my major — Zoology — I have a strong passion for questioning the world as we know it. I enjoy not just knowing that something operates a certain way just because, but rather understanding the underlying factors that causes and aids in the work being done to make something perform the way it is. I am a big nature lover, meaning I’ve grown a passion for the natural world round us, as well as the universe and cosmos. I think this class will help me with recognizing the physical laws at play in real time, in all aspects of life. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1409,"""Why am I here?""I am here to become more educated, so that I may grow as a person, academic, and professional. I was required to take this course as a form of foundation to build on the classes I need to get a Career in Envriontal Science and my Degree. But regardless of this, I know that every class I ever take in my lifetime will be for the betterment of it, and my view of it. I know that everything I learn will make me more round and capable to be more prepared for what's ahead. So, I am here for two reasons only, myself, and my goals to obtain a degree so that it may assist me in getting the career I want."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1410,"I am currently taking Physics111 at the same time. I believe taking the laboratory along with the lecture can help me to understand the material even better. I think that is why this course is being set up in this way. Also, the reason why I am taking this class because it is one of the prerequisites of a graduate program that I am trying to apply. General physics will be highly related to my major Kinesiology as well. For example, body movement or balance is based on the concept of physics. Without having general physical knowledge, I will not be able to accomplish my education goal in the Kinesiology major, or graduate program in the future. At the same time, physics is often involved in our daily life. Learning more about physics should be very interesting and can relate to our environment. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1411,"Why am I? I always or often ask myself that question everyday and in physics. I wonder if my choice to take physics was a right one. It had always given me the impression that it was hard. I still believe it is so, all these formulas, conversions, and isolation thinking, makes it very hard for me to determine. It's pretty tricky. However, it's not too bad I've always excelled in science and math, but due to my poor work ethics, the damage is evident in my past grades. I want to improve myself as a person and be studious. I want to reach my full potential and with this course, I would have to study. It is a very much needed course for my major. If I am to be in the medical field, I would of course, have to take science classes and prevail. The reason why I am here is because it takes me one step closer to my goal."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1412,"I am here because it's helps fulfill my requirement to take Physics 111. I am taking Physics 111 because it fulfills my requirement for General Education. This is currently my second year in SFSU and I still don't know what I want to major in. Physics is interesting and at the end of the day this class will help me figure out if I want to pursue physics related majors. I took Physics in high school and found it pretty interesting, but hard I really enjoyed working on the labs with my friends. I barely passed physics because at the time I wasn't taking it seriously and only to hang out with friends. As for this time I hope I can learn physics and enjoy the labs like I did back in high school and get a better understanding of physics, which I struggled to understand back in high school."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1413,"I am here because my parents migrated to the United States in order to provide a better life to their future family, which would be my siblings and I. My parents wanted to give their children the opportunity to go to college, an opportunity that is unfortunately not granted to many of my family members back in Mexico. Thinking more of where I am today, I honestly do not know if my existence will provide any drastic change to the world, but I do know my passion for science will eventually lead me somewhere in life. I know I want to become an exotic Veterinarian, but I feel like I am not smart enough to get into Vet School. I want to at least help animals, such as my bird and reptiles that need care, as there are not that many exotic vets, only primarily those who focus on cats and dogs. If that is the path I eventually do not take, I am very interested in virology and would like to study them. Maybe that is why I am here, to at least provide a slight change to science, although it may not be a big one at least it is something I can contribute to the world. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1414,"I am at SFSU because I want to get a college education and graduate from a college without having to pay an extreme amount of money for tuition like other colleges have. SFSU is also a college that is relatively close to where I live so I chose to go here in order to be able to stay with my family which is important to me. When getting more specific towards the question of “why am I here?” I would say that I am generally just taking this class because it is required for my major..however, I am specifically taking this lab because I did not pass my lab last semester. I would personally say that after covid started and everything went online last semester I kind of just checked out since I was so used to being in class in person. This semester though, I feel like I have gotten more used to the idea of everything being online and the fact that I will have to keep myself in check and be more responsible."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,6,1415,"I joined this class at first because I wanted to clear the GE hold, so not so much of an expectation of any kind. However, now that I'm in the class, I really enjoyed it, the environment and people are very friendly, and I can really feel that positive energy every time that I join in Zoom. Looking back at my initial purpose, now I think I'm here because I want to study, and that I actually like to learn more about Physics and its application in every day life. I have some experience with studying Physics before, but it was a long time ago and I've forgotten like most of it. So I think I kind of wanting to have like a recap of what I've learnt, and learn more of what I haven't learnt as well, because I kinda liked Physics. So, why is it exactly that I'm here, I think it's the charm of Physics and Math combined that attracts me, and also the class environment as well. "
