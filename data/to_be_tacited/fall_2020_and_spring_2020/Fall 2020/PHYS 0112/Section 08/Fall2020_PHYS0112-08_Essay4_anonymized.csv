2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1434,"In terms of my educational and professional goals, some of my resources include: All of my prior professors, my current professors, I have family to help keep me on path. My greatest resource is my fiancé. She finds away to keep my sane from nearly anything that comes my way. Everyday I am thankful to had met her and she is my greatest resource. When with her, I strive to achieve even more. I see the world to a cleaner lens with her by myside."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1443,"Music, sleep, food helps me stay motivated. The internet is a good academic resource but it can also be a distraction, in most cases it is a distraction for me. Printing out the book and doing problems physically helps me stay focused. I can also use the lecture recordings, lecture workbooks, and the online book as a resource. I like using the online book because it is easy to find things, sometimes reading ahead helps me form a better grasp on the concept being discussed in the lecture or lab. Reviewing the lecture helps me as well when I am stuck with the homework and if my notes aren't adequate I can just take more notes while rewatching the lecture. The homework also helps me learn stuff, and I can always redo the homework for practice if I forget those concepts."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1429,"During COVID-19, everyone is suffering from this fearful disease and cannot go outside or just shelter at home. For me, I still have got some supports either from my family, community, college, and my friends. For example, my family always supports me by cooking food for me and sometimes chat in person with me. In college, hopeful all my professors are able to shoot some video through the Zoom meeting, which well supports my education. Since I have a lot of free time at home doing nothing, so my only entertainment is to play video games with my friends which I feel less lonely."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1439,The resources that I have that support me are my family. Having three older brothers helps me a lot as they become examples for me on what to do and not to do. They gave personal stories/experiences to let me know/ remind me that they have been in my situation before so do not make the same mistakes. One of them may be easier to talk to the other but they can all provide me with the support that I need to either get motivated or to change my perspective. My parents are also people I go to for support. My parents may not exactly know what to say or do but listen and just help me feel more motivated. Each one of my family members provides a different type of support and advice so I get multiple insights on that just help me get realigned. They all collectively guide me on the right path so that I can be successful in life. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1419,"I have a few resources to help me. I now have a hotspot, which still is spotty and goes out on me sometimes, but it's more consistent than I had in the beginning of the semester. I have my computer (that now works), but has been giving me trouble the last two weeks. First it was the hard-drive, then I guess the guy ended up messing up something with my internet connection. Both are fixed now. However I have had an autoimmune reaction this week, and ended up having migraines and throwing up. I don't have access to get medication for the migraines right now, but I have found a homeopathic remedy at the local health food store that helps if I drink caffeine with it. The digestive/ vomiting part I just have to bear through. I am working on moving into a place, because I know a lot of this is psychosomatic from dealing with my mom's mental health issues/ abusive behavior. It sucks because school was my haven, where I could get my work done and connect to resources whenever I was in need. I am feeling overwhelmingly tired. It feels like I haven't caught a break from all this. It's also making me depressed because school was my haven, where I could go to get all my work done in peace, and connect to resources when I was in need. I am hoping to land this new job in a new area over the next couple months, so I can move and have some peace away from this nightmare I have been dealing with here. I really hope to be back regular school again, because honestly I realize being in the safety and serenity of a brick and mortar school is what has gotten me this far, and I know I'm not alone."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1425,"Rather than accepting that i won't sleep until 3 or 4 AM, I could try to get into bed and at least rest instead of staying up on my computer. Also, when I study and i don't understand a concept, I have email and I have access to office hours during the day, and if I'm unavailable during said professor's office hours, they're usually willing to schedule an appointment outside of their usual time or are able to answer the question through email."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1435,Some resources that I have that support me are this program that helped me through my college apps which is called College is Real. This program is at my old high school but even after high school they still contact us and help us with our college journey whether it is for essay or figuring  out which class to take. They give us opportunities  to receive  scholarships and are there for us even if it is just to talk. At this point I think they have been very helpful and they are familiar which helps me communicate with them better. Another resource that supports me would have to be my family because they always encourage me to do better and they always remind me that they believe in me. To me I think it is important to have resources that support you even if its just going family because  of how understanding they are.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1426,"I do not know if they would be called resources but in life, of course, my family and my friends. I think they are the most important, most relied on, and also the most supportive. I think no matter what kind of support I need I can always go to them for some kind of help. For school, I have a peer mentor who I have been contacting and meeting up with monthly. She helps me get and find resources for school I might not know of, she is there to just talk with me if I need someone to talk to. More than a peer mentor, that is a title that they give her, I consider her to be more of a friend. There are also counselors on campus and many different counselors as well. I would say these people are my most sought out and helpful resources, they are always there for me. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1432,"The things that are resources for me are the programs that I was in during high school that offer support and tutoring for college, also my professor and instructors and just talking with them so I don't feel as if I am doing this alone for now. Yes, it is tough but it will be worth it no matter what happens. I am pushing forward and am also just consulting my own schedule to see how I am doing and doing weekly entries to keep my thoughts gathered because it is time that I change and get serious about school and also about my career going forward, mistakes are welcomed but failure is not an option! "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1417,"In terms of school, I have teachers/ office hours, group chats with other students, I'm pretty sure school has tutoring online somewhere now, and google. In terms of mental health, I have HPW workshops and other school resources. I also have my friends that I can text or vent to, and I have family members who will make sure that I am eating and staying somewhat active. I have my dog to distract me when things get overwhelming. It's definitely easier to feel unsupported due to online learning and social distancing because we're all a little less active, and can't connect to as many people in person, but if there's a will there's a way. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1442,"i have online resources that i use to help me doing homework when i get stuck and good thing that i have the teacher's recording, i can go back and review the part that i miss. i have friends that are willing to help me and explain to me when i get confused and they are nice enough to help me out with it "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1422,"Resources that I have around to support me is mainly my partner. He provides immense support wherever or whenever I need it. We are also currently living with his mother, so she provides us support by housing and buys most of the groceries. I have the support of my friends although they're very far away, they are always there for me when I call or text. My family also always picks up the phone when I need them. Another supportive resource I have slight access to is the VA, I am still under my disability evaluation, but once I am cleared I will have access to medical care like a psychiatrist through them as well as compensation for any physical or mental damage I have received while serving. Thankfully, I am still under the age of 26, so I have health insurance provided to me under my father. So I have access to medical care when I need it. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1444,"I see myself as very lucky, as I feel that I have access to many resources that not all people do. I have access to an education, school resources that are offered on campus, and much much more. However, the main resource I have is my family. I truly see myself as very blessed as I have such a big and great support system behind me. My parents, and the rest of my family are my biggest support system, and without them, none of this would truly be possible. I feel that I am very supported in all decisions that I make, and I am so lucky to be able to say that as not all people have that. I am very supported, and I am so grateful for everything I have access too, and plan to take full advantage. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1433,"The resource that I have that support me in my mom and my sister. The reason for it is that they have been there from the beginning and especially my mom since she's obviously older than me and knows a bit more about life. They are my resource because when I need help in something or I'm stuck I always go to them to ask for advice and to be able to see if I'm doing it correctly especially now that Im a first time mom and I can go to my mom for advice. Now that Im a mom there's a lot of things I need to focus on, not like before that it was only me and that was it like ok I'm not hungry lets go, now I have to make food and give my daughter food so that she is full and we can actually leave the house. My mom has taught me so much and always guiding me, my sister is the one with the more like you want to be tired every single day or you want to full energy later in life? She's the type to ask what you want in life and like make me reflect on to why Im doing it for a reason."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1423,"I feel like I have many resources that support me, one big resource is my family. They have supported me financially my mom has supported me for as long as I can remember. Emotionally I am blessed to have a strong foundation of friendships, family, and other loved ones that support me. Through school, I know there are resources like my instructor's office times or even SCI classes that will help me excel in school. I feel like it is easy to get overwhelmed and not see the resources that are in place to help you but when we take a step back there are so many resources that can help an individual going through anything. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1416,"One of my biggest resources that I have to support me are my family. They are always there for me and I can count on them for anything. We are very close and I can tell them anything. Of course, some things you just don’t feel comfortable bringing up to your family, so I also have my friends. They have been there for me in my times of need as well. Lastly, the resource I have for any medical issues or anything that may be going wrong with my physical or mental health.I rely on all of these resources every day and am so thankful that they are all there for me. I feel like I have a very strong support system and hope that other people can find that to help them through their difficult times as well."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1445,"There are plenty of resources at school that can support me. There are math tutoring labs at school that are doing online zoom meetings. I have been to a tutoring sesh before and I found it very helpful. The same can be said for office hours where I can chat with my teachers about subjects Im having trouble with. I feel confident after discussing with my teachers for help. The Tutoring and Academic Support Center (TASC) is available via Zoom for tutoring appointments and drop-in, workshops, and group study sessions via Zoom from September 9 to December 11, 2020. I think its great that the school still offers tutoring even during a switch to online learning during a pandemic. Tutors will assist you in completing specific assignments as you strengthen your overall academic skills. There's also Learning Online 101, a self-paced workshop developed by TASC and offered for free through iLearn. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1440,Jessica Yepezsection 810/22/20Reflective Journaling #4The resources that I have to support me are my friends and family who are always there to provide any sorts of support resources that I may need such as hearing out anything I may need to say and then offering any advice or tools that need. My friends and family also provide me with this sort of safe space that I can always rely on and come to for resources and for any help that I may need in that moment. I also have academic resources that support me such as my mentor who has been there for me since high school and who is always there to ease any academic confusions that I may have as well as guide me towards other academic resources. I also have my EOP consolar at SFSU who always checks on me and makes sure I'm on the right track towards graduating and guides me towards which classes that I may need to take next. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1430,"The first thing that comes to mind when thinking about resources was primarily (1) resources for school in terms of dropping a class and (2) mental health respurces. Both of which, have been in mind recently.  I recently scheduled an appointment with a therapist and have reached out to professors who I am not doing well in their class."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1437,"I honestly do not use my sources like I should be doing. I like to learn how to do things on my own, however in college that may not be the best idea because I am paying for it. If I really wanted to there are office hours in each of my classes where teachers will be more than happy to support each of their students. All of my teachers say not many people use this resource. The resource I often choose to use for math and physics is Khan Academy. They give the best explanations of problems, and they also give difficult problems which help me understand the topic better than when the teacher explains it. Since I am an athlete we have an academic counselor who can help us get help when needed, but I never use her because there are others who probably need more help than me. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1436,"Office hours have really helped me a lot, as well as family and friends. It's been really hard to keep up with school with. everything going on, but family and friends have. supported me throughout everything. I know everyone is going through different things and face different obstacles, however without them, I wouldn't be able to do this. Office hours have also been very helpful. If I miss a class, I can ask questions instead of waiting for an email. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1421,My major department recently sent us a survey to do that asked us to provide feedback on how they can help and support us during this difficult time. They also asked us to give suggestions on how they can perform and lecture better and keep us engaged in classes and classwork. Sometimes they send emails with links to resources that may help us get through. Some resources include my friends and family who support me with every decision I make. I always go to my friends for advice and we cheer each other up whenever one is feeling down. Despite not seeing each other for a while we are still very close and talk to each other as often as we can. My family also supports me and cheers me on because they know it's hard having online classes and having to stay home. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,699,"The resources that I have that support me is EOP which have been great with providing advice regarding my classes and my education plan for the next four years. As well as having tutoring, it's a little tough getting a spot but it's possible. I also have my family and a friend that have been very supportive and assure me that I am capable of getting things done and if anything happens, I'll be okay. I also have another college advisor but it is more of a career one, which has been great because I feel lost in my education and volunteer work but he's helping me be more in track."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1418,"On my educational journey I have had many experiences that have molded me into a better person. Many of those situations are learning lessons from mistakes that have not contributed to my academic success, nonetheless those are the ones that have guided me to comeback with more tenacity. I have had great professors, mentors, and family o help me along the way as a resource that supports me. When I was at my previous community college, I would say my soccer  coach was a huge resource to me. He helped guide me as a student athlete as well as a human being in order to better serve my community. He was always around to talk to and discuss ideas and offer grounded, simple advice that calmed me down when I was anxious. Now at SFSU, I no longer play college soccer so having the coach or teammates to support me is new but I share this online semester with a couple of buddies from high school so we constantly keep in contact and discuss how the semester is going and keep each other focused. Also, being unemployed because of the pandemic has allowed me to be more focused on school since I have way more free time to dedicate to my studies. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1427,"Resources that I have to support me are definitely my friends and family. Especially throughout quarantine, they’ve been helping me stay safe but also occupied, having something to do. I’m really grateful that my friends and family have been so supportive of me in whatever I do and I know they will always have my back for anything. Many of my close friends are alway people that I rely on for practically everything when needed, and of course they can rely on me too. They’re always there to help me with anything, whether it's personal problems or something like school. In terms of academics, the teachers and staff at SFSU are also very resourceful and willing to help. It’s also been helpful knowing that professors are also understanding (ex. with deadlines) and relating to us students in that the pandemic has affected many of us and altered our daily lives a lot."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1424,"If I am in trouble, I do have a community and neighborhood that look out for each other. I also have friends and family. School community is also there to help out, like professors, counselors, advisors and school friends. It also may not seem like it but we also have a world of such giving and nice folk that are here to support you if you ask for it. But resources are only there when you ask for it when you search it. Nothing ever comes to you on a silver plate. There are many types of resources from help financially, mentally, weightloss (fat help), legal help, help with depression, help with love, help with happiness. But again you must get out there to receive help. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1431,I’m grateful for the resources that I have during this chaotic time. My parents gave me the opportunity to move back home because I couldn’t afford housing and they have also provided me with a positive environment. It’s easy to build tension in an household during this time but my parents have made it such an open environment. My friends have played a huge role in supporting me as well. We are all struggling to stay motivated during this time and I’m happy to know know that we have a supportive friendship. I’m also starting a business and everyone in my life has been giving me abundance of support. The professor has also been really understanding and communicating their best so we are all on the same page. It’s a hard time for all of us and  knowing that we are on the same page! During this time it’s also easy to feel low and get in the funk but don’t be afraid to communicate/ talk to someone. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1428,"Being a student at SF State, I truly feel like I have an abundance of resources to support my learning. There is the tutoring center, the Leonard library, the instructor's office hours, access to Zoom, and, of course, class mates who are kind and willing to help each other out. Back in spring 2020, I went to the SEPAL office once or twice to study for a biology class and the assistants there were friendly and welcoming. When the campus was open, there were plenty of places to grab a snack or lunch. It is nice that the academic counselors and psychological services are still here for the students when we need them. During these tough and stressful times due to the pandemic, mental health is very important and, thankfully, the professionals at psychological services got our back. Though I have never used these psychological services, I know that many students are probably seeking help from them right now. Though SF State has a large and diverse student body, there is always a helping hand, no matter the issue, for every student. I am grateful to be a Gator."
