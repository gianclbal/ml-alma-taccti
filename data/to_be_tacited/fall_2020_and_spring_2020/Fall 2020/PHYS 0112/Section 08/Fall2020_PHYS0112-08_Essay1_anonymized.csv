Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1416,"I feel like “why am I here” is a very straightforward question to so many people but it can mean so many things. The way I interpret it as is, why am I here in the world today. Well, for one I believe that I have a purpose, as does everyone else. I want to make a change in the world that’s so big that everyone would be happy with. I really want to be a nurse in my future and I was to show the goodness in my heart to others and show them that I am there to help them. Who knows maybe one day I will actually go off and create or find a cure for something like diabetes or cancer and I can be the one who was put here on this earth to fulfill something big in life. I feel like I am here to serve a purpose and show people what I can provide and who I am."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1417,"In terms of physics, I'm here because I am hoping to go to medical school and become a pediatrician. Even though I'm a psychology major hahaha. I don't have some big life defining event that made me want to be a doctor, but I do have a bunch of little things! I'm hoping to have a good foundation of psychology before working with children because I believe it is important for them to learn about mental health, and not be invalidated by others when it could be more than ""teen angst"" or any other excuse. I want to advocate for them learning about mental health and taking it seriously. Also, I'm a week away from being a certified EMT which is exciting! In terms of SFSU, I'm here to save money. With SFSU I'm able to live at home and save a lot of money that way, even though it does affect my mental health to be honest. It definitely was not my top choice school, but if I'm trying to apply and go to medical school I definitely need to save as much money as I can. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1418,"My name is Arnie Maravillas and I am a first generation college student here at SFSU. I am at this college because I want to further my education through this institution in hopes of graduating with a bachelors, and masters soon after, so I can have the knowledge required to be an adequate member of my society. I believe that I am seeking the tools to help me with my craft as I venture into life. With these tools that I hope to sharpen up during my time here at sf state I would love to enter the medical field either as a physician assistant, lab researcher, pathologist, etc. I think being her stands as a reminder that I would like to integrate myself into something bigger than me. I want to give back to the people that helped raise me and I would enjoy being a symbol of hope for the youth (younger generation) especially given the culture and beliefs that surrounded our upbringing."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1419,"I am here to learn about physics so I can become a better scientist. I am also here because this class is a requirement for me to complete my BS degree in Earth Sciences. I am majoring in  earth sciences with a focus in geology, and physics is an important part of geology. I am hoping to learn as much as I can so I can apply it to the real world problems I will face as a professional geologist. Physics is especially important when understanding the structural mechanisms of geology. I find physics to be really interesting, and important to understand what is happening in the physical world. I hope that this class affords me with the knowledge I need to excel in my field as a scientist. I am excited to delve deeper into physics and learn more about the intricacies of how the world and the universe works based on science."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1420,"Ever since I came to San Francisco State I constantly ask myself this question. Not in a bad way, but just to remind me on my motives. I always tell myself that the reason I am here and not home going to a community college is because I wanted to experience and learn new things so bad. I didn't think I could do that back home, because home was a comfortable spot for me and I needed to be pushed out of my comfort zone. I am always so eager to learn new things weather its from a Biology class or Philosophy or Physics. I always think to myself all of the things that have happened to me since I moved to San Francisco last year, good or bad, and all the new things I learned and how there was no way I would have done that back in San Diego. As far as why I'm in this class, of course its a requirement for me to take this class but even if Physics isn't really my strong suite, it's still science and I love science and I'm excited to know other science other than Anatomy."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1421,"I am here at SF State because I am here to learn and improve my skills and gain experience needed for the career I want to pursue, as well as other skills that will be helpful in the future. I am extremely grateful that I have an education because not many have this opportunity. Going to college is an amazing experience not only for learning but to make connections, friends, and making memories. I was able to join the speech/debate team last semester which gave me a lot of experience in terms of presentation skills and how to present yourself as well as being able to speak and learn about important topics in the class. Some goals I have are to make more friends and to be able to graduate and earn my degree. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1422,"Why am I here? I am here in California because this is home for my partner, I am originally from Ohio. I met him while we were both enlisted in the US Air Force. Now that we have separated we are both attending school using our benefits that we earned through serving. So far I love the idea of California, the idea that people are open and accepting here. The idea that health is more important by living a more active lifestyle. Although I haven't experienced another ""season"" yet, I am already worried about missing out on my beautiful Ohio autumn. Fall is my favorite season and I adore all of the activities that come along with it. I am here because I chose to follow my heart and see where this beautiful relationship will take me. I am thankful for all of the opportunities we have to look forward to together in California. I am here in this class because my major requires it, as well as PHYS 2, I hope to enjoy the things we will learn here. I am looking forward to staying here for the next couple years and building a new life, making California and SF State my home too. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1423,"When someone asks me why am I here I think about the present moment, I am honestly in this class because its a prerequisite for my major. I did not like physics in high school because it was really hard for me to comprehend it, but now I am actually starting to understand physics and enjoy it. I am curious and intrigued by how things work and come together, I didn't know how many things actually involved physics. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1424,"I am here in this class because it is a required for my degree. I am also attending school because there is an expectation of me to go since I am a first generation. I am also here because I chose this road, I wanted to do science and become a botanist. This was the most interesting to me because of the research I could do, and the things I can accomplish. I am here to help make a better life for my parents. I am here because I was born in this world. I am here because I messed up in the first two years of college and now I am graduating later than planned. I am here because I failed two physics classes already at skyline. I am here because my financial help would cover the costs of this class and not a class in skyline. I am here because of covid-19. I am here because this room is my sanctuary. I am here because I chose this lab. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1425,"I'm here because I want to be a nurse and help people with their needs, and so that I am able to support myself without having to worry about how much rent is going to be a dent in my wallet, so that I can learn as much as I can, especially in university where I have access to knowledge and resources that I may not have again. I'm here to make myself content as I can be and to travel. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1426,"Getting to where I am now at San Fransisco State University with my current major and with my current goals definitely was not an easy journey.  Right after graduating high school, I ended up not going to the University I was going to go to and instead took a semester off doing many things thinking about what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  After, I spent another four years at a community college going back and forth and ultimately figuring out my life goal and what I want to contribute to this world.  With that in mind, for some reason, I felt I had to attend SFSU to get to where I wanted to go and to learn what I had been missing.  I have never spent too much time in SF to know the area, but through SFSU I am very excited to get to know the city and continue my journey. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1427,"I am here taking this course because it is a requirement for my major. I am currently a pre bio major planning to concentrate in physiology. Despite it being required, I am also here to learn just like for any of my other courses, whether they are required GE's or required for my major. I have taken physics before during my junior year of high school, but if I’m being honest, it wasn’t exactly the best. I do anticipate learning something new in each of my classes, including this one. As for why I'm here at SFSU, I am here because it seemed like a school with a lot of diversity and opportunities. Also it is relatively close to my home here in the East Bay of California. I am here in the East Bay because it is where I was born and raised my whole life. Most of my friends and family are here as well."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1428,"I am here in this class because it is a prerequisite for my major which is Biology (Physiology). I decided to major in Biology because I really want to be a medical doctor one day. I think I will have financial security working as a physician, as there will always be people who get sick or injured. I decided to attend San Francisco State University for this major because the major was not impacted, it is an easy commute from home, I like the city of San Francisco in general with its historical places and famous Pier 39, and SFSU is where my brother attended and he graduated from this institution quite quickly. This is ideal for me because I do not want to waste more time and need to obtain a Bachelor's degree. I have taken physics before and I did struggle, especially with word problems. This class, though, is presenting the material in a clear manner and the instructor is explaining the concepts well. I should be fine this time!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1429,"So why am I here, I don't know yet. I am just a Biology major student who needs to take a physics and physics lab to fulfill my requirement. Personally, I do not like to take any physics class in high school and in college because I don't like math and I am just bad at it. But I like to do some experiments that are funny and interesting since I like to learn how things move. The most interesting stuff to learn in physics, I would say I like to learn gravity and movement. For example, how can the ball move from point A to point B in how many time, or the experiment I did in high school that was we threw a water balloon from ceiling to the floor and could see the radius."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1430,"It’s been quite a tumultuous journey now hasn’t it? Why am I here? Boiling it down to it’s bare bones, I’m here because I’ve finally solidified what I wanted to major in and have finally made the commitment to myself to go for it. Why am I here? It was out of the question to *not go to college for my family, at least my Asian side, so I knew I had to go to college but I never knew why. Not going to lie, I fooled around a lot in the beginning and it took me quite a while to find my footing. It took me quite awhile to figure out what I wanted to do. But why am I in this class? Well.... I’ve finally decided that I want to pursue science. I’ve accepted that I *can do science and that has been a journey all in it’s self. I’m a biology major. I’m 25 so I’m late in the game. And I am pursuing veterinary school. Why am I here at SFSU? College of ethnic studies and because it’s local. Being biracial has been a huge part of my identity and experience of who I am growing up and so learning that SFSU was so hyperaware (example, I took a mixed race identity class) was a huge reason why I love SFSU. Also"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1431,"I’m a 5th year here at SFSU, majoring in kinesiology and minoring in anthropology! I plan to get my doctorate degree in physical therapy. I used run track until my freshman year of college and with that experience I was able to see PT’s at work and I fell in love. I initially was planning on going into athletic training but two semesters ago I decided to go full throttle. I’m here in PHYS 112 to complete my requirements for graduate school! After SFSU, I plan on taking a year to catch up on all my requirements and also get more hands on experience."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1432,"Why am I here? I think I am here taking this class because it is a requirement to go into my major. But that not the main reason why. Even if I have to do this class I had many options and I have to make the best of it. It may not be the most ideal semester of learning but it all we have right now so I have to push as hard as I can to do the best that I can. We are all here for a reason. Some believe god, others think its the universe but something brought us all here and we are better being community then anything. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1433,"Jessica E. Guizar09/03/2020Why am I here?	Well to start off I'm here because obviously my parents made me. But my mom raised me and my sister. Also I was given the opportunity to be the first one in college and prove my family wrong that even though I was raised by a single parent I still made it to college. I am here now to teach my daughter the right and wrong as she gets older. I am her leader as well as her dad even though her father is from another background (Im Mexican, his Salvadorian). We have different thoughts and opinions on things which is why we crash too much so when we take turns with her we go by what we were taught. I am also here to provide for my daughter and be around her to take care of her from everything. I am here for a big reason to prove to everyone that I was going to drop out of college after I got pregnant my second semester in my first year of college. I was a bit scared but I was able to make it work out even by bringing my laptop to the labor and delivery room to get my work done. If I was capable of doing my work while in labor I have tons of reasons why I am here!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1434,"I am enrolled here because it is apart of my pathway of life to lead me to my goals. I always knew I was to go to college, but I wasnt sure for what. After taking... a bit too many courses for G.E.s I committed to a  Major that i had wanted to do long before, Biology. I am here to learn and grow. The past few years at SFSU have allowed me to grow up and truly learn what it means to be an adult. While I am almost 22, I am just becoming what I call a real adult. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1435,"Why am I here? The reason why I transferred to San Francisco State is because I was not entirely comfortable in my old school. I felt very isolated in that school and felt like there were not enough programs to get involved in. I came to SF State because it was closer to home and it was going to save me a lot of money. Another reason why I am attending this school is because I feel like there's more programs and internships to get involved in, I feel like this school has so much to offer. I am here because I was getting home sick and I did not want to be far away from home. I hoped to find more internships around SF but since covid began there haven't been many opportunities lately. The reason I am in this class is to fulfill the requirements for my major in order to graduate and go to nursing school. That is why I am here."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1436,"I'm here because I plan on becoming a veterinarian in the future, in order to do that, I have to take physics in addition to a few other classes. I love animals and I am 100% sure I want to spend the rest of my life helping them. I plan on going to UC Davis Vet school after graduating from Sf State. I have also never taken a physics course before and i'm very curious and interested in learning about what physics is. I love science, so I'm excited for this class. I also plan on taking other physics courses in the future, so it is important for me to understand this course well."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1437,"I am here for only a few reasons. I am at SF State because it was the only baseball scholarship I received. I wanted to save money and go to college so here I am. I am in this physics class because I do not know what I want to do with my life, but I am good at math and science. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,699,"I am here because I want to study biology. I am passionate about learning about animals, humans, and things such as diseases and viruses. I am here because I want to pursue a career that I enjoy doing, I may not know at the moment but that's what college is for, to figure myself out a bit more. I am also here for my parents who had made a lot of sacrifices to get my siblings and I where we are at right now. I want to be the first to graduate from college to make those sacrifices worth it but also to provide a good example to my siblings since I'm the oldest. I want to do what makes me happy while making my parents proud and I would like to give them back for all those years that weren't easy and to show them how much I appreciate them for everything."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1438,"If I'm being completely honest, I'm really only here in this class to fulfill SF State requirements. I wanted to take physics 111 because I took physics in high school and I'm more familiar with these concepts then say chemistry or biology. However, because PHYS 112 is mandatory with PHYS 111, here I am. Also, another reason I wanted to take physics is because I want to be a music producer and I know that dealing with frequencies and sound waves is a big part of that so I figured that understanding the science behind it would help me improve. I know the music business is a harsh one to get into, so if I can master that I can still have a career as an audio engineer or something along those lines."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1439,"The reason that I am taking general physics is that I need the class as a pre-requirement for medical school. At pretty much all the medical schools I am looking into I need one year of general physics, general chemistry, and general biology. But I am really excited and nervous to take the class because it is my first physics class ever and I wish it was in person instead of online. With that being said even if I did not need it for pre-requirement for medical school I would have still taken at least a semester of this class during my four years at college. I hope that after taking this class I will see how I can apply physics to my daily life or how it is important in my life. It will also be interesting to see if I use physics in the medical profession in some way or another."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1440,"Jessica Yepez Rangel PHYS 0112-08 9/3/20Reflective Journaling #1:""Why am I here?""I am here taking General Physics Laboratory because I have always been interested in learning how the universe works. I was going to take physics in high school but did not get the chance to before I graduated. I am also a biology major and taking physics is one of my general ed requirements. I think that once I get to my upper-division classes it is important that I have an understanding of physics because after all, it is the foundation for all-natural sciences. Also physics ties back to all branches of science. I also think physics is important because it helps build on skills such as creative thinking, problem-solving, and lab skills. I am excited to be able to see the world in a different way through the eyes of physics. I am also here studying at SFSU as a biology major because I would eventually like to go into doing my own research. I have always been interested in the research side of science because I like being able to collect data, use that data to find something, and then see the results of that. I also really love nature and animals so I am also thinking about becoming a wildlife biologist."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1441,"The main reason I am here is because it is a prerequisite for what I want to be, which is a clinical lab scientist. I want to be a clinical lab scientist because when I was younger, I have always taken an interest in science, how the world worked, experimenting, etc. After taking a microbiology course when I was a nursing major, I fell in love with it and thought it was fun. My professor told me he used to be a CLS and what he did, and I knew that I could see myself doing it long term in the future. Now I am here in this class because I am willing to do what it takes to get to that spot. If physics is going to help me better understand my job and what is going on in the world, I will take my time with it to get there. I would love to work in a lab and be able to look at samples (tissues, blood, urine, etc.) in the microscope and tell whether someone has cancer, AIDS, etc. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1442,"There's several reason why i'm here, Mainly is because i'm enroll in this class and i have to present in the class to follow the lecture. if i miss a day lecture, i feel really uncomfortable since i will miss some important information. Another reason why i'm here is because of my parents that decide to have two kids and that i ended up born as the second child and therefore i am here on earth and have an older sister that sometimes really annoying, flying far away from home to pursue my education in the states and that will be another reason that i am here in the states. In addition to that, i am here in the class because i need this class to fulfill my GE requirement for graduating with biology physiology major. Although i don't like physics so much before, but i try to learn as much as i can from this short class. I am here because i am destined to be here, by fate, by my parents and by God. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1443,"I am here because I want to take a physics class. I took AP physics in high school 3 years ago, but I didn't pass the test. I am also taking this class because it is a requirement. I didn't put that much effort when I first started taking physics to it became difficult for me to catch up with the content. I know learn that I need to start trying at the beginning of the class because physics builds up upon itself. I think I will do better in this class because of that. I forgot a lot of things I learned so it should be fun relearning all those things again. I am also here to participate in and refine the information that I learn from the lecture. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1444,"""Why am I here?"" I am here at sfsu making my family proud as I am the first in both sides of my family to go to college. I am here as I am now setting an example fro my younger family members as they will now have someone to look up to. I am here as I will be graduating in just a few months and all my family members will be able to see me graduate, virtually or on stage. I am here for myself, as I knew I wanted to be that example I never had. Growing up I knew no one that went to college, and therefore didn't have anyone to ask questions to. I am here for not only myself, but to make my parents proud as they sacrificed so much for me as I was growing up. This is all for them, and I hope to continue making them proud and give them everything and more. I am here to make a difference in my family's life. "
