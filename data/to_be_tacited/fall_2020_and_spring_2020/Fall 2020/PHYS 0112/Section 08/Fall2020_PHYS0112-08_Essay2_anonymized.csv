2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1433,"Jessica E Guizar09/17/2020""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""	My goal is to become a Doctor. It doesn't matter how long it takes me or at least to become a nurse. I've always wanted to be in the medical field. Also another goal is to be able to pass the lecture of physics because I don't understand my professor, she's confusing. Also this class is helping me out because I am able to understand how it's done in the lab and I can just use that in my lecture to help me out and get what she's saying because there's times she wants extra things added and that's where it gets all confusing. This class will help me with other tests that I may have later on when trying to get into nursing. Also this class is a prerequisite for my major. To fill that section is the reason why this class is going to help out so I don't fall behind."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1430,"Academically, my singular and primary goal is to finish my undergrad. My shorter goals are to excel in the classes I am in. As a whole, my goal is to become a better person whether in my relationships, working on my own limitations, getting a better education, giving back to my community, working on my health both physical and mental, etc. I’ve always valued self improvement and it is a driving force in all that I do and I always hope and strive to achieve more. It’s been challenging right now to stay motivated with long term goals because reality right now seems so fleeting and inconsistent. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1435,My goals are to be able to get my dream job that I have been working towards. My goal is to become a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner. This class is helping me achieve my goals because it is a requirement of mine in order for me to graduate. This class is also helping me understand how things work around me. Another goal of mine is to pass all my classes this semester because this whole online system has been kind of stressing and hard. With this online system I have begun to be more organized because I think it's easier to forget that some assignments and I have learned to prioritize my study time for each class. My goal is to be able to understand every topic discussed in this class so that when I take physics 121 I will be prepared and this class should be able to prepare me for my next class.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1425,"One of my goals in life is to be successful and be able to live comfortably. This class is going to help me with that in allowing my to understand the world and its mechanics just a little bit better. While physics isn't the most important science (relative to biology and chemistry) when it comes to nursing, it's still important for me to have a basic understanding of it, in order to be well-rounded. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1445,"My long term goal is to finish the classes I need to change my major from Biology to zoology or Pre-veterinarian. This class helps will that because physics is one of the math classes I need to take to be a step closer to my goal.  MY short term goal is to understand physics. Math has never been my strong suit so I will find this class challenging, but I hope to overcome it and leave this class with not just a passing grade but an understanding of the subject. I have missed two weeks worth of class due to two family members death so I'm very behind then my student peers. I plan on catching up to them and being able to follow along with everybody else. I’m also behind in my physics lecture class as well so I hope the physics lab will also help me understand the homework for that class."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,699,"My goals are to get good grades throughout my college journey so I can graduate, majoring in general biology. I want to be either an oncologist or do something within forensic science. In order to achieve my goals, I have to meet the requirements and take the needed classes to get my degree. This physics class is a requirement if general biology is the major I want to graduate with. It is also going to help me with some critical thinking skills and understand the concepts of velocity and gravity as I have two career choice I am debating about but one of them will require for me to know these concepts pretty well. It will also provide with more math skills that are needed in any biology/STEM field."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1429,"So what is my goals, my goal is to be a medical guy or hope to work in some medical field. By that, I have to take my requirement class, such as Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. Upon that, I think Physics is the hardest class for me because it is involved in some calculations there. My goals for this class are getting an A, turn in all the assignments on time, and do well on the exam since I want to get the highest grade as possible. Although we have a class online through Zoom due to the pandemic happening right now, I will try my best to pay my full attention. Besides, the stuff we learn in this class would definitely make me understand more clearly when I do for the mcat test later on in my education field."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1436,"My biggest goal right now and one of the things I am striving for everyday is to become an exotic animal veterinarian. I'm currently majoring in Zoology, and physics plays a huge part in my major. This class will help me learn, understand, and prepare for my future. I am taking a couple more physics classes in these upcoming semesters, so this class is important in order for me to be successful in those classes. I have never taken a physics class before, so this is all new to me. I want to graduate with good grades so that I am able to get into UC Davis vet school, one of the best vet schools. It is important for me to do well and understand this class to the best of my ability, I feel as if I can achieve this by asking questions, studying, taking notes and completing my work in a timely manner."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1437,"At this moment I do not know what my goals are. I want to graduate college I guess. I still do not know what I really want to major in. Right now my major is chemistry, that is why I am in this class. Obviously my goal for this class is to get an A, but I have other goals in this class as well. I would like to learn more about how things work. Another goal I have for this class is to get a better understanding of physics so I can create a better learning foundation for the more advanced physics classes. This will help me graduate college. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1438,"I have a lot of goals that I hope to accomplish both long term and short term. Short term I obviously want to be successful in my classes I'm taking this semester (all 8 of them). However, I'm really only in this specific class to fulfill the GE requirement. Distanced Learning is a bit of a challenge, but I'm managing so far. In the Long term, I want to accomplish so many things. I want to be a music producer, short filmmaker, etc. Currently, I'm working on getting these things started, and hopefully they'll work out. I also have a job on top of all of this, so I'm hoping that this season of my life will help me grow a lot. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1421,"Some goals that I have are: to be able to graduate and be able to take what I've learned and apply it to my job in the future. I plan to be a clinical lab scientist and although physics won't necessarily help me, this class will help me adapt and get used to working with others since that is a huge part in working in a lab setting. This class will help me exercise my communication and collaboration skills with others as well as my critical thinking on abstract problems. My other goal is to be able to graduate."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1422,"My goals are to survive physics this semester, this class is helping me achieve this goal because it's also a physics class where my learning is reinforced. My phys 111 course has been a little more challenging for me than I had originally expected, mostly the homework because the Pearson site uses much more challenging questions than what we are given in class. A previous student has slightly reassured me that my professor doesn't use those harder questions on tests. I sure hope not or else I am doomed. I've been trying to study extra outside of class by watching a YouTube channel called The Organic Chemist, he also has a physics playlist. Wish me luck!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1443,My goal is to learn about physics. This class is helping me achieve that goal by helping me apply the knowledge from the lectures and it helps me by having other people to do it with. Another goal of mine is to pass the class. I think passing this class is important because it will save me sometime later on. I also want to develop my problem-solving skills by applying myself with problems that I haven't encountered before. This class can help me get better with problem-solving skills by allowing me to think differently.  
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1426,"My immediate goals are to pass the many classes that I have, one being physics. My physics 111 class has been a bit of a struggle for me. It might just be me but I am not able to completely understand the Professor's explanations which make the assignments very difficult to complete. The homework does not 100% line up with the Professor's lecture so I find myself relying on Physics 112 for explanations and clarification. Which in fact, has helped me tremendously. The lab questions we work on go over every bit of that chapter/subject so I have a more solid understanding than I did. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1434,"My goal is get into medical school. This class will help me learn the necessary skills to increase my score on the MCAT. I am a bit worried about the MCAT, as it will be by far the hardest test that I will ever take. This class will give essential knowledge to solving basic level physics within the exam. I am very excited to make my way into the medical field. I have always enjoyed learning more and more about the community. Another goal is to use this class to do better in my lecture class. This course will help me ease into exams from my lecture professor. While very few examples have been difficult, im sure it will ramp up soon. I will be able to use this course to aid my confusions, especially since my professor for lab, is also my professor for lecture. This helps a lot with communication and assignments."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1423,"My goals, I feel like there are multiple parts to this question right now my goal is to pass this year with good grades. Another goal of mine is to learn and understand physics so I can take the MCAT because there is a physics portion on the MCAT. A future goal of mine is to get into Med School, performing well in this class will not only better my GPA but equip me with the tools I need to get into Med school. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1418,"This class is helping me gain the knowledge and understanding I need to be successful in the career that I wish to go into. I believe that this class will give me the tools to understand life and how it operates on a scientific and factual level. This class will help me see and understand natural phenomena and I think overall that learning new, challenging topics help a person self-reflect on what they contribute to society. I plan to attend PA school or go into research and understanding the laws of physics (life) will help me tie it back to my planned area of expertise. This class affects everyone and everything that happens in the world so I wish to take the opportunity to master it and apply it to my life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1417,"My goal is to get into medical school and be a pediatrician! I want to be able to help families and their children, and with my psychology major background, I'd like to help identify and reduce stigma around maintaining and bettering mental health. If not that, then just be able to be happy  with my job, have a greater general knowledge on physics and be more knowledgable on STEM concepts. This class helps me fill prerequisites that a lot of medical schools have. It also allows me to build critical thinking knowledge. Thankfully, this class has mostly been examining concepts that I have learned in calc 1 a couple semesters ago, so nothing is too new or difficult yet. Hopefully I'm not jinxing myself. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1428,"My goals, currently, are to graduate, get a Bachelor's degree, apply to medical school, and hopefully get accepted and continue on there. Ultimately, I want to work as a doctor, save some money and buy a house and a car. A good way of putting this would be that I want to achieve my American dream. I was born in Peru and I was brought to the US when I was a young boy. This class will help me complete one of the physics prerequisites for the Bachelor's degree in biology and for admission to medical school. It will also help me prepare for the MCAT, which is very important that I do well in later on. Also, if I get a good grade in this class, it will boost my confidence in my physics understanding. I remember that I took a tough physics class in high school and I was always behind in my work and struggling to learn the material. This is my second chance at physics and I need to work hard to get that A grade and fulfill my career aspirations. I know that these things will not happen overnight, so I need faith and discipline as well. Thank you."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1424,"My current goal is mainly to obtain a bachelors degree. So this class fulfills a requirement that is needed to reach this first goal. Although getting a graduates degree sounds good, my preferred goal is trying to earn money after I graduate and start enjoying life. Like earn money to be able to live by myself in a good area, or get a house, and travel and work in something I like and or enjoy. I hate customer service and since I was in 8th grade I have been working in customer service and I don't like/ enjoy servicing people or being fake nice. So that is the main reason I wanted to earn a degree in a field where I don't need to be fake. I also don't like too much repetitive motion or labor. I also would like to help my parents out financially. Eventually I would also like to have my own business. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1416,"In a few years, I want to be a nurse. I want To be a nurse one day so that I can help people the way that I was helped as a child. I want to graduate soon so that I can actually achieve this goal. The main reason that I am taking this class is so that I can graduate and get a degree in General Biology. This class is one of the requirements to achieving that goal, so it is very important that I pass it. After i graduate from SFSU I am planning on going to a graduate program to pursue my nursing degree and hopefully pass everything to become and RN. I really hope that I can pass this class and all of my other classes so that I can complete these goals for my education. Then I can focus a little more on my career goals and other major or minor life goals."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1440,Jessica Yepez Rangel PHYS 0112-08 9/3/20Reflective Journaling #2: GoalsMy goals are to eventually graduate as a biologist and probably go on to be a wildlife biologist or a vet. I really like animals and to be able to study them would be really interesting. This class will help me achieve this goal because physics is the basis for biology physics helps tie everything back together. It also helps to build on ones understanding on how the universe work and build on problem solving skills which is important in no matter what field one may ended up going into. Without physics one may not be able to understand major chemical principles that are important as a biologist. Physics will also help me build on my technology skills and my maths skills. My maths skills need a bit on improving and through physics so far my math skills  have been improved being able to use the math learned in physics and then apply it to the real world situations has been helpful.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1442,"My goal is to be successful and be the best. By being successful, meaning i want to become a doctor and help many people that needs help. This class, besides one of the requirement for my major that i need, it gives many information that i can relate to my interest and everyday life. This class is interesting and what makes it a bit easier is that i can see it in everyday life, relate it and that group discussion also helps me. Although i might not need it so much when i enter med school, but i believe this class will give much more than just theoretical lecture."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1441,"My long term goal is to become a clinical laboratory scientist. I have other personal goals as well, such as being better with time management, being less distracted and focusing more, and becoming a well rounded person. This class is helping me with those goals because this is one of the prerequisites I need to be in the program. It will help me understand the work that I need to do in the future, and it will be a This is also helping me with my personal goals because this class takes up a chunk of my week, so I have to learn how to schedule out time to get to class, study, etc. on top of what I already have to do. It helps me learn a lot, especially about how life around us works. This class will not only lead me to my long term goal/career, but it also plays a part in my daily life to help round me out into the person that I want to be. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1419,"My goals are to become a field geologist, and become better at solving real world problems. In field geology we use a lot of math mostly centered around trigonometry to measure thicknesses of bedding, as well as understanding where is an appropriate place to drill a well. Geology is important, and we need geologists to help with construction sites, and to use their knowledge of math and physics to help in harnessing natural resources. This class is helping me achieve that by allowing me to look at physical problems in the world, and apply what knowledge I know about math and physics to solve them. I know that I will be dealing a lot with physics in my future profession. Geology is a spatial science, to where the understanding of physics is very important. I know that this class is preparing me to be a better scientist. As well as this class is preparing me to better understand the physical world."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1432,My goals are to have a good academic year this year so that I can pick up steam for once I am on campus and just fit many classes into my schedule as I can. I changed my major this summer from Business to Bio and I want to make sure I stay on track with my classes so this class and Bio 230 were the first steps to actually commit to this major and are helping me see that I can go to med-school in the near future. This class alone isn't really doing much to teach me what I'll see in med school but I am definitely doing my part to pass this class by setting reminders for when labs are due and also collaborating with others when I am confuse in class.  
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1431,One of my goals in life is to become a physical therapist and hopefully get my PhD. I’m a little late on understanding how to be a student in general so I know this will be a tough path but I’m here for the challenge. This class is part of my prerequisites for PT school so that’s why I am here. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1439,"My goals are to graduate with a BS in Kinesiology and go to medical school. Those goals are my two biggest goals for academic wise as of right now I know later I will probably add more. But more personal goals for myself is to continue challenging myself and making sure I am comfortable with being uncomfortable. So like getting out of my comfort space and doing things I would normally nerve do and this is the first time I am taking physic so I want to continue being daring. But my most essential goal is to be able to travel, learn new hobbies and continue practicing mastering self-care.  This class is going to help me achieve these goals because I need to take a year of general physics for medical school as it is a requirement. This class will be helpful background knowledge to have when going into the medical field so it will be cool to see how it affects the medical field."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1427,"A goal of mine like many others is to graduate and get a degree. I hope to get a degree in biology and get into a good pharmacy program afterwards. Although this class is not my main focused major, it is helping me to get to where I want to be. It is required to take this class, but I also know that a lot of these physics concepts can be applied to many day to day things. Another goal of mine is to be able to travel in the future with friends and family. However that unfortunately won’t be for a while because of covid and the costs of simply traveling somewhere. As for a short term goal, I hope to be able to get through and pass this semester of online zoom classes. Since spring semester will be online as well, I hope to get through that too."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1444,"My overall goal is to graduate from sfsu and be the best person i know i can be. After graduating from sfsu i plan to go to graduate school, and maybe my doctrine degree. These have always been goals of mine as i am the first person in my family to be graduating from college, and to me this is one of my biggest accomplishments, because all i want to do is make my family proud, as they provided me with everything i needed to pursue a great education. This class will help me with my overall goal as i need this class to graduate, as it is a pre req for my major. I was never a fan of physics, but i will be doing my best to make this goal a reality. This is a goal i do not want only for me, but my family as well, so they are really my motivators through this whole entire process, and i am truly so lucky to have such a great support system in my life. "
