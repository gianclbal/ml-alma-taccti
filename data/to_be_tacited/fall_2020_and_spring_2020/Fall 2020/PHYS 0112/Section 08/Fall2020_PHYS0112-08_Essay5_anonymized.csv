2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1419,"The values of my community and/ or family I was born into have helped me navigate college by showing me all the things I don't want to do with my life. I saw the life I didn't want to have and knew I had to do the exact opposite if I wanted to excel in life and college.The values of my community and/ or family of choice that have helped me navigate college by knowing when to ask for help, staying true to who I am and my goals, and being grateful for the good people and things in my life. I used to never ask for help, and it kept me struggling for even longer than I would have if I would have asked for help. I still struggle with asking for help, because I feel that I won't be helped even if I do ask. However, it is getting easier. I have had to make a lot of sacrifices to stay true to who I am and my goals. Although, the people in my chosen community/ family have shown me that if I stay true to me, the right people will stick by my side. I have also learned to be grateful for the good people and things in my life. It is gratitude that helps me realize that I am cared for, supported, and realize all that I have achieved so far. It is being grateful for what I have that keeps me pushing forward."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1443,"My values of my family are to get work done before I do any other thing. This value helped me get things done when I feel like procrastinating. Respect is also one value that we strive to embody. I guess respecting the amount of work that goes into learning and respecting the deadlines helps me stay on track. Respecting the mind and the body helps me out as well because I learn the best when my mind and body are in good shape. Taking breaks when needed and exercising helps me stay engaged in class. Staying responsible, no one keeps me accountable so I have to rely on myself to get work done. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1431,My community has been a huge support when it comes to me navigating college. My parents are really supportive and has provided me with a safe environment to express myself. I was born and raised in Sri Lanka and moved to America when I was nine because there was a war down there and I’m so grateful for my parents. My friends are always there for me as well. We are supportive and also super positive. There’s no judgment or any kind of negative energy and I think that helps all of us feel accepted. Especially during hard times. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1416,"The values that I’ve held and that have been passed down to me through my family have helped me be more understanding about sometimes not succeeding. They’ve also taught me that being successful isn’t just about getting through, it’s about the way that you handle things and how you are able to take a bad situation and do your best to turn it around. This one I’m mostly focusing on my school grades and how I’ve had bad semesters in college but my family helped me to learn from those mistakes and not to dwell on them but to work harder to try and fix them. Just because you messed up once, doesn’t mean you can’t get back up at try again. My mom and my dad have always shown their supportive side and they help me by being understanding for whatever I may be going through and let me try to figure it out myself before they give a helping hand."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1445,"My family has given me the opportunity to pursue the education of my choice. Not everyone can afford to be in college so it's a privilege to have these types of resources. My school before college had an AVID program that helped navigate students to decide about college, and how to get there. I found this to be very helpful since I didn't have a plan originally. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1435,"College has been tough especially this year since we had to go on online and adjust to all these changes. My family has really helped me navigate through all of this especially my mom and brother. I can really say that they motivate me to do my best and to keep working hard. I think when I look back and see what my mom, dad, and brother went through I just want to succeed so I can give them everything that I know they deserve. My mom always helps me believe in myself, I think she really helps me gain motivation and she always helps me with everything. I wanted to make my parents proud, so the fact that they always support me truly helps me navigate  through college. The main values from my family that has helped me navigate through college is how much my family motivates me and also believes in me, they always offer great advice."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1423,"My family and community values have helped me in a lot of ways. In my family, we value hard work, and through the hard days when I don't feel like working, I remember those values and I strive forward. I also learned to surround myself with people who strive to be better, having a growth-minded community is really important in developing your own growth. My family also values relationships, relationships with family, friends, and peers. Prioritizing these in life is important it adds value to life. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1440,"The values that my family and college mentors have helped me navigate through college is teaching me not to give up when things get tough and not be afraid to ask when help is needed. To learn from my setbacks and to celebrate my successes and failures because there is always room for improvement. They have also told me to always strive for something better such as higher education. My parents never had the opportunity to go to college so being the first in the family to attend college is something that all my family has been proud of. I have been fortunate to have a community of people to fall back on when things get tough and or confusing. They have also taught me to always look for networking and join clubs and not be afraid to put myself out there especially in college where it can be very beneficial to do so. In high school, I was very shy and was always afraid to get out of my comfort zone. Though in college I have been able to break away from that."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1418,"Having values to help guide you through challenges is extremely important. For one, having values that implement and require you to be the best version of yourself at all times is critical to being successful in college because it has taught me to remain calm and to use my resources whenever a problem gets difficult. I should not give up and I should not find the easiest way out. To me having values is like having morality and integrity. Without without any of that I would not be the person I am today. My community has taught me to overcome adversity and to thrive off of limited resources. My family and growing up as an immigrant family, has taught me to work hard and to be grateful every day. Each opportunity I have to be successful in this country I must take full advantage of it because that opportunity was not even an option for my parents. Its the sort of values that reminds me to treat everyone with fairness and gratitude and never discriminate. Growing up in a catholic household as well taught me to love everyone equally and to spread love not hate."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1417,"I come from a family of immigrants on both sides. Although none of my immediate family has graduated college, they push me to do my best. For me, my best is getting this degree and being the first one in my family to graduate from a university and hopefully attend medical school. My family has worked hard to be where they are today, whether that be in terms of moving across the world, or living through less accepting times. or any other hardships they have faced. They always remind me that I have an amazing opportunity to have a family that will support me in whatever ways that they can. It is hard navigating through all of this myself since I can't ask for their advice on college applications or things like that. But I am happy that through this experience I can help the future generations of my family be less lost through this process."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1439,"The values that my family has given me to help navigate me through college is motivation, encouragement, and reminding me why I am here. My parents and my brothers have been a great supportive group throughout my life because they have always been a judgment-free zone and have only wanted the best for me. They always give examples from their lives to help motivate me to be better than them because they never want me to be in the same position that they were. Also, my family is easy to talk to whenever I am stressing about school so whenever I mention some stress or doubts I am having they stop me from having negative thoughts. Instead, they somehow always turn my negative thought into positive thoughts and basically prove to myself that I do fit in college and should never doubt myself. It is a real blessing to have such a supportive family group and hopefully, I can do the same for my family later in life. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1424,"The reason I am in college is largely due to the influence of my family. My parents didn't have a chance to attend college or some school even, they didn't graduate a high school in Mexico. So their wish was that their offspring took the chance and studied what they wanted. My dad said he wished he could have finished school but in Mexico you must pay to attend elementary, middle or high school. His family didn't have money for it so he ended up working. My mother when she was around elementary age was given an option to study or work, she already has a taste of school and didn't like it so she chose work. For their choices they wanted to provide us with education. I am a fast learner and I have always loved studying and learning new things so the story they told me resonated with me and so I wanted to study a lot because I knew that not everyone has a shot to study even if they wanted to. I knew it was an opportunity rather than a set back. Which is why I am here today. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,699,"Their values have kept me going through college because sometimes I feel like I won't make it. It has made me realize that I can do it if I try my best, I will understand the material more, but get a grade that is what I want. They have helped more, I know my priorities, but sometimes I have trouble giving the important ones more time. They have helped me take one thing at a time and do them at my pace so I won't get too overwhelmed. Also, so far I haven't been too scared to ask for help when I need it, I remember I would be so scared that I would just ask a friend or two. Now, I can go to tutoring and ask questions during office hours. This has definitely helped me navigate more through college."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1438,"I grew up with a very big extended family, and since my parents had me when they were young, I grew up around a lot of adults. I didn't really have a ton of cousins my age that lived in San Jose, which sucked at the time, but looking back I am grateful for it. I felt I had to grow up fast, which kinda helped me in the long run. My family taught me to work hard and with a purpose and not to steer outside of myself in order to please people. So far I am keeping these two lessons close to heart as I go through college."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1421,"My family helps me navigate through college by encouraging me with positive words and saying that I can get through the tough times. That helps me stay positive because it gives me a boost of confidence that I can get through things and I always remind myself that I been through tougher situations in the past, so I can get through another. My family also loves to give me advice on what I should do in a situation if I'm stuck and I usually need a second opinion so I can decide what to do at the situation at hand. My parents always tell me to go out of my comfort zone which helps us grow."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1427,"The values that have been instilled in me by my family has been very important to me in navigating through college. Values such as always trying your best and to work hard to achieve goals have been taught to me from a very young age. Because of these values, I have always worked hard in school and even through times like these where classes are online, it does get hard to stay motivated to persist on working, but I still know it’s important to stay on top of my school work and do my best. The community around me has also been a big part of instilling values in me, such as being respectful to all people, you never know what a person is going through so it's always important to treat every person with kindness. I’m grateful for all those that have been around me setting a positive influence throughout my life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1426,"If I am to talk about my current college SFSU, I only just started here not too long ago as a transfer student so I cannot really say much in terms of community as I am home, but family, community, and the online community I have met definitely helped me through this semester. In the very beginning starting off college I had a very tough time navigating through college in terms of which major to continue my path on and get a degree in. I had so many things I wanted to do, but nothing I was set and stone on. Thinking back I honestly regret wasting so many years trying to figure out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. When in the end I found that what my family had recommended was the right path for me; I was just so ignorant and young I did not want to listen to them. Back then though, the community at the community college was pretty bad I had to do everything myself pretty much, but I am glad my family was there to help me navigate my way towards my current path."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1428,"The values of my community and family of origin have helped me to pursue a college education. My parents, since I was a child, have told me to always continue studying because it is the key to getting ahead in life. I am not extraordinarily talented in any thing, so the best way for me to acquire a well-paying job is by getting an education and a degree. I have had a few jobs in food service and restaurants where the work was hard and payed little. I was not content in these positions. After these experiences, I knew that I had to follow my parents' guidance and attend the university. I know that after graduating, I will have more doors open and I will be more competitive for the job market. Of course, money is important, but it is not everything. The greatness of an education is that it facilitates working on what you enjoy doing and being paid well. Sometimes, the two do not go hand in hand, but the knowledge gained from a higher education allows for both positive circumstances."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1444,"My family is a very big part of who I am and the reason I am in college today. Since I was a little girl college was always something my parents mentioned and to make that a reality was a very big thing for them. I am also the first to go to college from my dads side, and I will be the first to graduate on both sides, so that is still a big thing I am proud of. I am so blessed to have a family that supports me, and the amount of love I get from them is amazing. Whenever I feel down or feel as if I can't do something, they are always there to lift me back up and tell me that I can do anything. Their words of encouragement have gotten me through many rough times, and now that I am back home I can actually go and talk to them physically which is a big help. I never would have imagined spending my fourth year at home, and its been really though having to adjust to this reality, but with the help of my family I am getting through it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1433,"The values of my family has helped me navigate through college is by having a positive mind and giving our selfs respect to achieve higher goals. This has helped me navigate through college by being able to Get to where I am now, since I come from a single parent, which my mother has taught me a lot by seeing her being able to do sacrifices for me and my sister as she took us forward in life. My mom has done so many sacrifices for us that has made me think of being able to go into college and do something positive with my future so here I am putting my effort to show my mother that her hard work has done something beautiful and positive for both of our life’s and my sisters since she’s also in college but at a San Diego State."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1442,"My family will always reminds me how much they support me, since i come from a long way to pursue my study and remind me that home will always be open for me when i need them. The support for example that i can call them and talk to them when i feel down. especially my older sister. she always told me how much she care about me and even if i call her in the middle of the night, she will pick up and talk through everything. she's been one of my support (even though she's a bit annoying)"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1422,"The values of my family and community that help me navigate through college are encouragement, patience, and immense support. My family believes in hard work due to being on the lower side of earning income as well as doing fulfilling careers like my father is a firefighter and my mother is a nurse. In these careers you have to really work hard and I believe they aren't paid according to the effort they put in, but that's a whole other essay. The values they've instilled in me is to be patient with myself, if I get frustrated with my schooling to take a step back and remember to breathe then give it another shot. Another value is their support and encouragement, for example I am taking a speech course and my mom will let me call her to practice my speech with her, she always gives me positive feedback. If I want a bit of a harsher criticism, I go to my partner's father, he is really good at public speaking and always offers me strong critiques so that I can hone my speaking skills. My family pushes me to be the best I can be and sometimes even further, I am so thankful for the amount of support and love I receive from them."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1429,"I appreciate that my community or my family helped me navigate through college especially during the pandemic right now. Since I am stressing very much at school at first, but then my family always support me or be with me all the time, or maybe they are also sheltered at home. Also, I make an appointment with my advisor talk about my fall 2021 plan, and she not only help to suggest to me what classes should I take, and she even asked how am I doing during this tough time and what she can do to make me less stress in order to support me navigate through college."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1425,"The people that I choose to surround myself with in my college years help me get though my semesters, whether it be video calling while we study to ensure that we stay focused or being a support system for each other "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1437,"My family values have helped me for a number of reasons. My family's first priority is school, which usually sucks but it helps when going through college. Some of my friends also value their education so I can ask then questions when necessary. This makes school easier. The combination of my family and friends caring about school allows me to focus on my schoolwork rather than getting distracted. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1441,"The values of my community have helped me navigate through college during this pandemic. These values include hard work and time management. Lately I feel like I have not been on top of things because I have been drowning in homework and work lately. I have been working extra hours in order to make up for tips lost during the shut down in order to pay rent, I just moved into a new house and spend chunks of my days organizing and putting things together, I have been taking an accelerated phlebotomy program because I want to have income that will not be affected by the pandemic, and I have 14 units this semester going toward my SFSU microbiology major. It has been extremely hard keeping up with everything, but I feel like I am still doing well considering all of the things that I am attempting to juggle in a day. Time management is key in keeping up, however I do admit that I have missed some deadlines and I can not blame anyone but myself. I can only hope that I get better, faster, and more efficient as time goes on."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1434,"I learned the importance of a good work ethic. In all of distance learning, I have only missed 1 class 1 time. I think its very important to go to class, even if you don't want to or have a more fun option. I am here to learn and advance my education, which will aid in a successful future. I have always thought that people who are slackers are always going to be a slacker, so I make it a point to always make sure I go to every class, at least go to every class. I am so surprised that people just don't go to class and still are confused why they aren't doing well in their academics. I am now engaged to an amazing women who also never missed class either uwu."
