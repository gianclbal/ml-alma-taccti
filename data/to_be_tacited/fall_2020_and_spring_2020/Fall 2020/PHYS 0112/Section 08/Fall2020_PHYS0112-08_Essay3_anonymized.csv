2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1426,"To be honest I do not know what to do a lot of times when life gets challenging. I like to just organize my thoughts, my options, my plans, schedules, and what not, to get everything out to where I can see them in front of me because my brain will not be able to process everything properly. Many times I think I will be able to solve everything on my own, but that is obviously not the case, so I also talk to my parents if it is something they can help me with, which is almost all of the time. I also talk to my friends who might have had the same challenges. I read articles, look up videos, pretty much anything from anywhere I can get information. Lastly, I spend lots of time thinking, self-reflecting, listening to music, and doing what I enjoy to calm myself and process things; but also because I will most likely be a little stressed. Then hopefully, I am able to solve this challenge or overcome it in someway. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1425,"When life gets challenging, I usually go back to sleep so I don't have to deal with anything, but when I can't fall asleep, I like to read or game with my friend just so that I have a distraction from what's stressing me out."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1424,"When life gets too challenging, I just need to vent to someone. Then I will get on with life, and watch some anime that has it way worse than me. I will pick my self up after. I really just wallow when I have it hard. It also affects my school and work somewhat. Like the things I wanna do in that respect end up being too much of a burden for me at that moment that I will just disregard it. I never looked for assistance cause I mean, what can I do when its my emotions that make me do what I do. I have to fix the emotions before I can function normally again. What does help for me, is venting, not only that but having a load of friends who are supportive will not bring the subject but will encourage me and hangout with me so I don't feel lonely. My family understands to leave me alone too during hard times. Like they know love them but that I don't want advice at all. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1418,"There are moments in life when things do not go your way and the climb seems more steep than it was in the beginning. For those moments where life is challenging it is okay to ask for help and reach out for support. These are the moments to gather your thoughts and your knowledge to make a conscious decision on whether or not you are going in the right direction. If you are on the right path then be humble and grateful for all that you have. It will not be easy but your sacrifices will pay off in the long run. If your path is going no where, allow yourself to have the space to accept new things and transition into a new beginning. Try, try, and try again until you succeed. Some things in life do not work out on the first go, as long as you persist and remain calm, ask for help, and use all your resources, the climb will be easier and you will get over that challenging hurdle."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1440,"Reflective Journaling #3What I do when life gets challenging is usually turn to family for support who is always there to support me through whatever I may be going through. I think having a family there is really important for me because they have always provided me with a sort of safe space that I can go to when things are getting tough and provide me with advice and hear out anything that I may need to get off my chest. I also love to go out into nature and just clear my head for a day if possible I have always found nature so refreshing and calm and as a place to get away from all the commotion especially since I live in the city, it can often be hectic and hard to think at times with all the noise. I also like to turn to friends and mentors for advice which they are usually able to give me and is always very helpful."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1434,"When life gets challenging, I look to the ones I love for help. Primarily my Mom and my Fiancée. When I feel lost on my path, stuck, or defeated, I look to them for the support I need to power through whatever comes my way. Sometimes, that means just a short pep talk over the phone, or a several hour hangout starting near 3am. When life gets hard, I lean on those who help. Once I am study, I make sure they can lean on me whenever they need as well. I dont trust many people, but for those who I allow into my weird little world, I go to the ends of the earth for them. When life gets hard, its even harder not to want to further sabotage your happiness."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1443,I will take a break then get back to what I have to do. I will work on what I have to do even if it's just a little and take a break if I have to. If that's not enough I can look back to the past and see if I have encountered anything harder than what I am going through in order to motivate myself. Seeing what I have gone through helps me go a little further than what I think I could possibly do. Another thing that I usually do is talk to my friends about it because it is nice having someone to relate to and they provide what kind of help they can. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,699,"What I do when life gets challenging is taking space away from mostly everything, even if it's for a few hours to do what I have to do. I can't do anything when I am not in the right mindset, or at least do it at my fullest potential and for best performance. I look at cooking videos which help me distress but then I'm like I wish I was that healthy but it helps. I do some self-care things that will make feel good about myself while relaxing me enough so I can do my school work."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1422,"When life gets challenging, I often do my favorite thing which is watch YouTube. Usually I do this until there is no choice but to log off and do whatever is stressing me out. This is known as avoidance; thankfully, I have mostly overcome this issue but I haven't had another major life event since starting at SFSU to induce this behavior so I honestly don't know if it is completely gone. I still watch YouTube plenty, but now I make sure to complete my assignments with extra time left so that I am able to ""treat"" myself with the reward of relaxation rather than use it as a tool to avoid my responsibilities. Now, if life gets challenging, I think I would go to my partner for comfort, he usually helps me with any issues I am having as he has a ""fixer"" mindset and always has an idea of how to achieve a solution. I am very appreciative of this quality and wish I possessed more of it myself, luckily he is in my life to help me out. I usually shut down and begin to panic when something is really stressful due to anxiety and PTSD. I am able to use tools I have learned after years of therapy to help me collect my thoughts and emotions, but the initial shock of the stress usually puts me down for a day or two. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1417,"When life gets challenging I end up distancing myself from people so that I don't spread any negativity to other people. I sleep a lot, and try to go out and take more walks because it helps to improve moods. Spending time with my dog, and focusing on taking care of him is nice to help take my mind off of any challenges. If I'm struggling with school I don't usually ask for help, but I go over the homework more in depth and break it down and look for youtube videos that break down concepts as well. Spending more time and effort on hard topics is helpful for sure, and I haven't needed to go to teachers or school tutoring yet. However I'm sure that the time will come for that eventually and it will be a weird topic to navigate for me because I'm not used to asking for help."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1421,"When life gets challenging, I try to do activities and hobbies that will ease my stress and take my mind off the stressful tasks. I like to draw and journal and recently, I started to bake to help ease the stress. I also like to listen to music as it helps uplift my mood and I talk to my friends and family when life gets challenging because they make me happy. They're always there to support me and I always go to them advice when I need a second opinion or another person's perspective or viewpoint on something. In addition, my friends and I like to do zoom calls and stream movies together every other weekend to catch up. When I am faced with a challenging task I always approach it with a positive attitude because although it is tough, I know that I can do it and I know that I am able to accomplish my goals."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1442,"I am the type of person that keeps everything in me. I used to share to my friends when something gets challenging and ask them their opinion (or more like what should i do) and i would rant and vent to them. I use to do that to my sister a lot of times too. However, i change and i'd keep everything to myself. sometimes i overthink but when i fell sleep i forgot about my problem keep moving on with life. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1431,When life gets challenging I like to just take a step back. Taking a step back gives me the time to refocus and see the challenging problem/situation in a new perspective. This will allow be to be more successful and help get a better understanding of what it is going on. I also love to talk it out with a someone because trying to explain your thoughts can help rearrange them and also you are getting a second input. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1444,"When life gets challenging I simply just stress out, and feel as if my life is ending. When I am stressed, it is all I think about and it really just takes over my life. Recently, I am taking a holistic health class that really just helps with time management and how to stop procrastinating. I am a huge procrastinator and tend to leave everything last minute, so this class has really helped me find ways to not do that. One thing that has really helped me is journaling, and planning out a schedule for the week that includes assignment due dates, and what I need to do that week. I have also tried meditating, but I am not the best at it as I tend to get distracted very easily. I still et stressed out, but these few things have calmed me down a bit. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1445,When Life is challenging I try to find logical solutions. This means that I look for different perspectives when facing a problem to see what the best outcome is. I'm also not afraid to ask for help. I always go to people who I'm comfortable with for advice. This applies to school work as well. I feel comfortable asking for help from students or even teachers. Some teachers I know have question cafes where students can go to write whatever questions they have and have other students or the teacher answer. I find this to be very helpful since it's harder to work with others on online classrooms. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1435,"When life gets challenging I usually take a break from work that is stressing me out. The thing I don't do is give up because I believe that when things become challenging it might be because you are reaching your goal and might be steps away from achieving something. Another thing I personally like to do is pray, I find it soothing and I can say that it truly helps me. I like going to take walks and just try to get some fresh air and talk to someone about how school has been stressing me out. When life gets challenging I like to remind myself of the things that motivate me to go to school, which is my family and me. Honestly I do it all for them. They motivate me to be the best I can be and always tell me they believe in me which helps a lot."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1432,"I think that I just do the things that I have to no matter how much I am struggling with things. This is true for all my classes. Before this semester, I would usually give up and not really try my hardest but now I try to do my best and try my best to complete what I am struggling on. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1439,"What I do when things start to get challenging is just take a step back and breathe. I usually listen to music to help me calm down and not stress. My favorite album to listen to for this is Mac Miller’s Circles it just really helps me gather my thoughts together and eases my mind. If music doesn’t help me then I usually workout. Working out, playing basketball, or running really just helps me escape reality while still being on in it. It just helps me to focus on something else that I know I am good at before things I have to do. Running specifically just helps me get the confidence I need whenever something hard comes up it’s just like a reminder like yeah I can do whatever it is even if I don’t get it eventually I will. The same thing happens with basketball like once I get shots going in and in a rhythm, it’s like I can do anything. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1429,"Due to the pandemic that happening right now, it has a big impact affecting all students and teachers. While we cannot have face-to-face classes anymore, so we decided to have an online class for like a year, which is a tough time learning stuff at home.  Study at home has a lot of distractions, such as your pet, your family, cell phone, food, wifi issues, etc. By that, so what do I do when my life gets challenging, maybe I try to find a study group or play video games to increase my loneliness. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1419,"When life gets challenging I do my best. Which looks different at different time periods of my life. If it's something minor I usually recover pretty well with journaling, baths, walks, and music. Sometimes certain things take a lot more effort and work. Heavier things that come up I usually get help from my therapist, or my physical and energetic healers in my network. I sometimes have a hard time recovering when life throws me major curve balls. As it did this past year, when I had some very traumatic and huge changes in my life. Those changes required all hands on deck from my healing team. I am still recovering, but it gets easier everyday. I feel a lot more peaceful now that I am separated from the toxicity of my family. Although it does feel al little hard this time of year, especially with the holidays. However, when I just remind myself that if I want to have a healthy life for myself and in the future with a family of my own, it was absolutely necessary to leave my birth family behind."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1433,"What I do when life gets challenging is that I take a deep breath and try not to think about it. Which I know its impossible and then your head starts to hurt even though you have ate, well that happens to me and my solution to it is just take a nap or go to sleep early. Once I wake up I find ways on how to organize myself and move on from there. If its to challenging then there's times I ask for help from my sister or mom on advice on what I should do when I feel stuck in a challenging situation. Its rare when I find my self in a challenging position, now that I'm a mom I try my super best to not get in challenging positions so that my daughter don't see me stressed put about it but I mean she's still small and doesn't know about it but as she gets older she can realize what was happening before."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1437,"There are numerous strategies I have in order to cope with difficulties in life/school. I try to ""live in the now"" which means trying to be present. This is a Buddhist philosophy, and it help decrease stress. If you are living in the ""now"" or are present there is nothing to worry about in the past and there is nothing to worry about in the future because you are only worrying about now. I did a poor job of explaining it but I hope you get the idea. also stay up late in order to complete all necessary assignments and studying it school life gets hard. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1427,"When life gets challenging, I usually like to take a step back and relax a bit before going back to whatever is challenging me. A lot of the time, something is hard because I’m too focused on one thing rather than looking at the bigger picture, so taking a small break really does help sometimes. It can also get really frustrating when I get stuck on something challenging for so long, causing a lot of stress. Taking a break helps me feel like I’m getting a fresh start again with the possibility of a new mindset, thinking that I can do this, rather than stressed out thinking there’s no way I can do this. Another thing that helps when life gets challenging is to think back because I may have missed something. For example, when it comes to solving an equation, it helps to go back from the start and go step by step."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1428,"When life gets challenging, I try to get organized and see what needs to be done. Sometimes I can get discouraged, when there are too many tasks to do. When this happens, I like to remember what my motivations and goals are. I think to myself that if I do not keep moving forward, I will never accomplish my aspirations. I know that life always presents problems and complications. Though my struggles are not too hard, I believe that just being persistent and making a strong effort to overcome challenges is always the best thing to do. It is better to not ask for too much help and get working by oneself. This gives a greater sense of accomplishment and gratification. I learned that life is a competition in every aspect. The more motivated, productive, engaged, and prepared one is, the more likely one will win in the game of life. Time is very important as well and one should take advantage of as much time that one has at disposal."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,8,1441,"When life gets challenging and my to do list gets stacked, I'll usually pull out a planner (or even Microsoft Word) and start organizing everything that I need to get done. I am a full time student with a job, a steady side hustle, and am trying to do a phlebotomy program on top of my microbiology program. I'm technically in 2 schools with 2 jobs. It's definitely challenging to squeeze everything into a day, and there isn't really a time when I get to relax. It'll relax me when I organize everything that I have to do and find out I can fit everything into 24 hours.I just organize everything into time increments and go at it, and hopefully nothing spills over past any deadlines. When I get burnt out, I'll step aside and meditate for a bit, then continue. I personally feel like when life gets challenging, yes it's important to find ways to relax, but it's especially important to find ways to make it work. This may not be the answer you were looking for, but when time becomes a factor in the challenge, there isn't much to do but figure out how to manage it and keep it moving. While rushing does not always produce the best quality, I believe moving like this will eventually train myself to be swift yet thorough. I hope it will train me to be sharp, quick, and hopefully I will be able to produce quality work at the same time. "
