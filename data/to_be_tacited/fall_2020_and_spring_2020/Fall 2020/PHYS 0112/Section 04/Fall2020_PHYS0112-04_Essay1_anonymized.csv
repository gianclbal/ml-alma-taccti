Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1338,"I am here because it is a requirement for taking the Physics-111 course. I took the Physics-111 course because I had to take a physical science, and I actually like physics, while I absolutely hate chemistry. As for why I chose a class so early in the morning, i think that is a question for past me who thought that forcing himself to wake up early everyday was a good idea. That's the practical reason for why I'm here, as for the educational reason why I'm here, it's to cover the parts of physics that are better learned with real examples, rather than lecture."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1339,"Physic has always been the one subject I find so interesting and yet I have always been avoiding taking in, since it was not a needed course for my previous major. When switching from a nursing major to a microbiology major, I find myself needed to take a physic course. Physic 111 and physic 112 are my first ever actual physic class. I’m here to learn what I’ve been trying to avoid learning, but enjoy it so far. I love seeing how things I learned in trigonometry and calculus applied more to the physic aspect and how it is relevant to our everyday situations. I’m specifically in this class because, first, I enjoy the atmosphere that the professor provides to the class and second, to apply the physic concepts to a demonstrative aspect. Today, I am here to discuss about vectors in 1 dimension and 2 dimensions. Although vectors are briefly mentioned in my previous math classes, the concept of it still help me understand this physic aspect of it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1340,"Why am I here? Not necessarily sure. But if I had to give an answer I would most likely say it is for my future and to make my parents proud of me for achieving a goal, especially within the science category. I am originally from San Diego (SoCal) but decided to go to San Francisco State not only to be in one of the most beautiful cities in California but because I love the energy and environment San Francisco offers. I love that I can be independent and away from home that teaches me life lessons and not to rely on my parents for everything so it gives me a sense of responsibility and responsibility. Also because I love the cold weather ;D"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1341,"A huge part to why I am here is because I need this class for my undergrad to be completely honest. I need because it's required or else I wouldn't be in this particular class. But I am here because I want to be here, I believe that a huge part of achieving a higher is that you want to be here, you want to be in a University. I like to believe that people are here to achieve a higher education and aren't here forcefully, whats the point in doing something that you're forced to do or dont want to do. Im here because I want to be in a university, I want to be here because I want to get my undergrad. But at the end of the day im in this class because I need to be here, but I'm in the university because I want to be in higher education. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1342,I am in this course because it is a required course. I made a choice to continue my education after high school. I am here because I want to be here as I create the life I want to live. Physics can be confusing at times but I enjoy the math part of it for the most part. I am also here to further my education so I can work in the medical industry. I enjoy helping and taking care of others. Growing up I helped my mom care for herself as she battled cancer and helping seemed so natural to me. My goal in life is to ensure I live a life my mom would be proud of. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1343,"I am here to learn about physics. When going into a career where science is involved I think it is very important to know every bit of science, including physics. Although physics is a mixture of science and math I think it'll come in handy for the future. This lab is here to help me grow my knowledge which will also help me in my future school years because I will have to take more physics class due to my major. Although it is a little confusing as of now I have faith that it'll get easier through out the semester. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1344,"I am in this class to fulfill my general education area. After the first lecture, however, I thought this class is the one that it has a lot of connections to our real life and that is helpful to understand how things work in life. I want to learn a lot of things by the end of this course until the point where I can use the context I learned at some point in real life. I hope learning physics can help me to do better in stats because I am a statistics major and I believe physics is related to any kind of source that we are exposed to. Lastly, I want to further my education and broaden my perspective to the world. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1345,"Today, I'm here as a fourth year senior trying to graduate on spring. Taking this class because I need to meet SFSU Kin major requirement and also my DPT program requirements. Sitting here in my desk doing a physics lab online is something I never though about and never thought I would do this. I didn't know if science labs are ok to do in online. But here we are doing the lab online.Due to COVID that we never expected, I'm sitting here in my  room taking class online because all of the campuses are closed due to the virus. I'm sitting here thinking that when we will go back to normal and able to go to class at campus, and hang out with friends without bring worried about the virus that is going around.   Im here to finish the lab today and get the assignment done for this class. Trying to be successful during this class so that I could take physics 2 and finish my requirements. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1346,"I'm here because this is the requirement. Honestly, i'm not good at studying Physics. So i think it is also a good way to help me understand how things work. It also helps me to express my creativity. . "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1347,"I""m at SFSU because I love the opportunities that the city offers and the diverseness as well. I am a biology major because science has always been my favorite subject. I want to get into medicine whether that be an MD, midwife, or any other higher-level job. As a biology major one of the requirements is Physics. I have been worried to take this class as Physics is always regarded as one the harder subjects you can take. Now that I have math done it is the only subject that I am worried about not being able to understand. Because of these worries, I will go above and beyond to ensure that my knowledge of these concepts is strong before attempting to learn a new one. As the knowledge I learn in this class will completely determine how well I do in the next Physics course. Having a good understanding of Physics will also help me in my biology career as they share many of the same aspects."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1348,"I am here because I have a goal of becoming a physical therapist. To be able to do so I need to first accomplish my goal of obtaining a bachelors in kinesiology which requires me to take physics. At first I did not understand why this course was a requirement but now know that it is crucial to know physics to be able to understand how and why things move and to what extent that movement effects the thing or object. I have began to open my mind to the idea of becoming well acquainted with physics, even though I am scared of how hard it might be. I am willing and able to put in the time necessary to do well in the course."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1349,"""Why am I here"", the reason why I am here taking this class is because I need to take this class as a requirement for my major which is Construction Management. I didn't know that physics had to do something with my major. I know nothing about physic, never took a physics class in high school so this is all new to me.I started off by attending SF state as a business major but always had a passion for nursing so I started to take some pre-reqs for nursing but after figuring out the process in order to get into to nursing program it brought down my hopes of majoring in nursing.I started to think what other major interests me and after doing research I decided that Construction Management was a great option for me since I had plans of owning a construction company in the future."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1350,"I am here in physic 112 because it is a visual way for me to understand the concept of physic. In Physic 111, its mainly lecture therefore, this class is designed for me to visually see how the concepts and definitions are applied to the ""experiment."" Not only that, I feel that this class is in a small setting where you can interact with other students to understand their view points of physic. This is good because you can gain a sense of understanding of this class through your peers and helps you be more aware of areas that you don't understand due to group works that is provided. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,558,"Why am I here? Well, there are a few reasons, I guess. I never really considered going to SFSU when I was filling out college apps. I had filled out the CSU general app and thought, “why not click the SFSU box? Claire (my sister) goes there.” After ruling out, other schools I got into, it came down to SJSU and, to my surprise, SFSU. I compared their programs and chose SFSU for their amazing Kinesiology program. I’m in PHYS 111/112 because it is a class I will have to take for my major. I could have taken a lower physics course, but I know grad schools like to see more challenging classes. I have never taken a physics course before, but I have always been pretty good at math.   "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1351,"I should be at City College because making me pay full tuition during a pandemic is an awful thing to do. My only purpose is to live what else am I supposed to do. Also, why should this be that long? I think that says enough. I don't know why you're asking me this question as if the world doesn't make college a requirement to get a simple job. I'm just here. Is it on my own accord? To a certain extent, yes.  For me, school is just a way of surviving. I'm already in this deep though. Two more words."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1352,I am here for many reasons. Ever since I was young I always believed in helping others who could not help themselves. As I continue to grow I see that that is possible as a career in many ways. As I pursue my biology major I realize that although difficult as I continue in this path I come closer to my goal of help people in my own way which is why I think I am here today. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1353,"I am here because I have a dream, and in order to reach that dream I have to make certain steps. One is take up the major leading to my dream--Kinesiology. In order to be fully enrolled my major,  I need to meet few pre-requisites and one fo them is Physics 111-112. I am here because part of reaching that dream is not only to follow steps without learning from them.  I am here because I want to learn and gather experiences so that when I need them someday, I am able to apply it in life and help make me a wiser and better version of myself. Now that I am here, I am one step closer to my dream-- to become a successful Physical Therapist in the future. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1354,"I am here to fulfill my major requirements. Other than that I chose to take physics because I took it in high school and I really enjoyed it. I love to learn about science and why things in the world around us behave the way they do. I am at SF state because I want to further my education and hopefully become a doctor one day. I am also here because I want to be the first in my family to attend and graduate from college. I'm here to learn and prepare myself for the future by gaining more learning skills such as problem solving, team/group work activities and critical thinking."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,322,"I am here to finish my studies in pursuit of achieving an Environmental Sciences degree, though, I am still unsure of exactly where I’d go in the field and what directly interests me, I still feel I have time to figure this out. Talking with an advisor in the department would help, which I’m grateful that the scheduling is finally available now."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1355,"I am required to take this class for my major but also to reach my goals such as attending med school. I am here to learn more about physics and more about the way it plays a role in our daily lives. I am here to learn how things in this world work and how everything functions, who figured certain aspects in forces, mechanics, etc out. I am here to learn how gravity plays a role in our lives, our bodies, and in space. I am here because this class is a stepping stone to my future goals and this will help me get a bit closer, a semester closer into becoming a doctor. A semester closer into helping others. I want to help others get better, have hope that they can overcome a disease such as cancer, and try to give children their lives. A big goal but it is also what motivates me to continue my daily routine. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0112,--,4,1356,"I am in physics 112 becasue it is a corequisite for physics 111. I have to take these classes for my BIology major, as it is a requirement. I find physics to be the hardest subject for me to understand. I was never good at physics and usually get very frustrated. I have been to several tutoring centers and extra help in school, but never seem to fully understand the concepts in physics. Therefore, I am not a huge fan of physics.  Honestly, I did not look forward to taking the physics classes, but the professors seem cool, and they can teach. I want to pass this class with a high grade, so I will try my best to stay on top of my assignments. I know that physics can be quite a challenge for me but I will not let it stop me from trying hard in this class. I'm looking forward to understanding and growing my knowledge of physics. "
