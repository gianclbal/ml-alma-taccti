2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,138,The topics we learned in this class was really interesting and I really understood the logic behind every experiment that we did. The main thing I learned was how to do the experiment online by using simulation.  That was something new and interesting to me. It was fun doing that.  
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,122,I have learned about the Newton's law and stuff  like that. I really like doing the simulations because you have given in the labs. They are actually quite interesting and fun to do. They aren't very hard either which is good but they still help me understand the topic. The simulations also give a good understanding of the topic and is very clear so I like it a lot and has helped me understand the values and why which values go where and why.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,128,"I have learned many things in this class particularly how to manage a heavy load class like this physics class. I am also able to learn how to get out of my comfort zone. Growing up, I was able to be very quiet and not much of a talker. With this class I was able to outgrow that especially during these trying times. I was able to meet many new people and make new friendships this semester. That is very important because in this world, connections are very important and it  matters who you know. I was also able to learn how to successfully conduct labs. Even though most of the semester was online I was able to learn how to conduct in person experiments from the comfort of my own house. This not only helped me progress as an engineer but as a student. Since the COVID outbreak, it has become evident that virtual classes are the new way of learning and it is crucial that we learn how to do them from the protection of our home. Since the first covid case in the US, it became apparent things would never be the same."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,136,"My greatest take away from this class was being able to in a way get a hands on experience. Yes, even though most of the labs were still stimulations online, it really did help better understand the different concepts we learned each week. I learned from the notes of course, I mean it's what would help me complete the lab, but doing the labs is a whole different experience. These labs really required a lot of time, and paying close attention and noticing details, For example, looking closely into what is happening, like what is being consistent and what's changing. The easiest part was that but the most difficult was sometimes plugging it into the formulas. I always had to double check just in case I got the numbers wrong, but all labs were fair enough and did help us better understand the topics. It made it easier to know what is what, and what should we notice."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,131,"Taking this class was a truly different experience as having a physics lab online  was not something i ever imagined happening. It was a unique experience but was tough one at that. This lab was not necessarily hard but it required sheer time management and which i struggled a lot during the whole semester. So my biggest take away from this class would be that in life unexpected stuff  happens but how we deal with it is what defined us and improves us,"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,145,In this class I have learned alot from friction to springs and to collison. I have enjoyed this class since it is focusing on the real world. Since most of these lessons are based on Earth it becomes a whole lot more interesting since I can be able to experiment at my own home and test things out. I have also found out that learning at home does have its pros and cons. Overall I felt like the class was running pretty smooth and although I am still adjusting to this whole new environment of learning I felt like this class was nice and simple on it’s lectures making it easy and understandable in the first lesson.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,149,"I do believe that the collision of 2 objects in one dimension itself are a lot more interesting since I've always known the idea when one object itself is a lot greater mass to collide with another object at equilibrium velocity as the secondary object while that secondary object itself with lesser in mass then the momentum will be a lot more different than it normally would. but if both objects are equilibrium in both mass, and velocity, then they're both equal amount of momentum meaning no changes in their momentum whatsoever."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,135,"What was my greatest take away from this class?My greatest take away from this class would be that I am a visual learner. I learned that I was a visual learner when it comes to physics because I have seen that I obtain a clear understanding after interacting with the labs. The labs help me understand concepts better because they usually have some sort of interactive graphic that is used as a tool to break down concepts within my physics ebook. I like that I can clearly see what is taking place and how the laws of physics are important and fundamental in every day life. With pictures to go with the words, and the ability to play around with different experiments, I am able to make real life observations in real time as well. Quarantine has been rough and many of my classes are hard to follow due to the lack of resources and alloted time."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,147,"I honestly enjoyed most the labs on potential energy and kinetic energy. A lot of the simulations used real life example such as skateboarding and the throwing of the ball. Being able to look at a visual representation of something and retrieve some sort of data is a tool you will use in any career, even if its in the opposite way. I wish though we had more labs were it was not just simulations, like the coffee filter and Pennie lab which was fun to do. Although excel was a program I had to refresh myself on how to use."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,129,"My greatest take away from this class would have to be learning formulas and different physics concepts. A lot of the simulations we have done in the class so far have been things i've always wondered about but seeing them explained and seen through experiment has been very eye opening. This class has taught me a lot of patience so far. This is a very challenging class but with patience and the will to learn, these concepts are maintainable and fascinating. This is my first physics class i've ever taken so it's been quite the experience learning all of these new concepts and being able to apply calculus concepts. So i have been taking away the fact that calculus is very vital in many stem fields and learning the importance of higher level mathematics."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,124,"What was my greatest take away from this class?My biggest take away from this class is communication/group work with my fellow classmates. Being able to work with multiple people onto a project or lab is not only easier for me to learn but also have a nice to time socializing as well. Being able to work with classmates on the same problems allows more amounts of critical thinking and possible solutions onto how to solve them. Different ways to tackle a problem is crucial in physics or in any fields of studies in my opinion because having a different approach onto solving a problem is better than just sticking with just one. In addition, I also liked the past labs we have conducted so far, I am able to grasp the crucial concepts of them and also enjoy doing extra research by watching Youtube videos with commentary of how it all works. Seeing a visual aid in work with commentary helps me understand the material better too."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,148,"This class has introduced me to the concept of forces and the differences between a force being applied versus velocity and acceleration. This opened my eyes as I generally did not think of forces that way. For example, a ball being thrown up in the air has no force moving up after it is thrown. It just has the velocity and momentum from the force of being thrown."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,137,"My greatest take away from this class is that I still managed to learn and understand the concept and physics in general without actually being in a lab. I thought it would be more challenging and I wouldn’t be able to grasp the information. I still do think in-person would do a better job, but due to the circumstances we’re in, it’s pretty difficult and risky to do so. I think I had a really good understanding of specifically energy in this class, as the simulations helped a lot. When I finished the lab, I tried playing around with what else I can do in the simulations and try to understand what’s happening and why it’s making this action. I think the simulations helped a lot since they were basically an online version of an experiment, and there were a lot of simulations for the energy lab so I think that’s why I was able to get a good idea of it. I know how it’s used in real life scenarios and how it’s never created nor destroyed, but is instead transferred."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,132,"It's honestly hard to narrow down my greatest takeaway from this class. In part, this is due to the fact that we have covered a lot of material in these lab sessions. To be quite frank, the regular physics class (not this lab portion) that I attend  has been quite difficult, and I feel that it has become exponentially more difficult being taught online. Most of the concepts from that portion of the class need to be taught by an instructor, but instead, we are assigned textbook readings and problems to figure out and read by ourselves. I'm not sure about the other students in that class, but I am honestly having a tough time learning and deciphering these concepts for myself. I would say that this is mainly where the lab portion of the physics class has helped the most, covering the basics of these concepts. In addition to this, the questions and labs show me how the concept could be applied to the real world (if that makes any sense), helping me grasp the overall concepts being taught in class. With this being said, I still have to say that these classes should really be taught in person, as it has been very tough trying to keep up with and to truly learn anything from them. Although I realize it is an issue that we cannot currently deal with, I just wanted to add this statement regardless, as I fell that it has heavily impacted my learning. Other than the basic concepts that this course has covered, these are a few other ways that this course has helped me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,146,"My greatest take away from this class is to not do my work as early as I can and not to procrastinate homework or lab work. With my other classes, I have a problem of forgetting to do work and putting it off till late. I haven't been late to turn in any of the lab except week 9 because I just forgot to do it and on Wednesday, I took a power nap that lasted for 6 hours and missed my calculus 2 class as well. Hopefully, I can get more sleep and now I have no idea what I am writing anymore. I just hope I can continue turning in my work on time and with the last few weeks until fall semester is done, there is a lot of work that needs to be done."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,133,My greatest takeaway from this class was the relationships between different forces and how they interact with each other. Incorporating aspects of calculus in this class has helped me put together the real life applications of calculus through physics. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,144,"My greatest take away from this class was how approachable the application of physics was. As anticlimactic as it sounds this course has really helped me feel confident about what I have learned in the lectures. Reading from course text books, and participating in lectures teaches the equations and concepts but the actual application in labs like the napkin falling lab, or any of the simulations confirming the computations we have made really give me a sense that I am not only retaining what I have learned but encourages me to continue learning. An great example would be the application of friction and how that relates to the conservation of energy. During the lecture it was clear that friction is a non conservative force, that transfers kinetic energy into thermal energy but using the simulations and models to see that occurring in real time not only helped me retain the lesson but provided a way for me to observe it, which encourages me to continue learning and retaining my interest!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,143,"What was my greatest take away from this class? That's an interesting question to be asking now instead of at the end of the actual semester. Does the existence of this question at this current time mean something? Because if you were to confirm that, I would have to assume that it meant that we had essentially covered the ""meat and potatoes"" of this course and that everything going onward is simply fluff. Wouldn't that be interesting. Getting back to the question at hand, I would say that my greatest take away from the class is that there are some very specific simulations out there, and specifically a good majority of what I would've been actually showing up in person to see, I could've just simulated from the comfort of my own living quarters. While I can't say I prefer this method of ""laboratory"" teaching, I do have to say that not having to deal with the BS that's involved in group work with lab mates is definitely a large positive for covid. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,127,"For me personally the biggest take away is how we can use this in the real world or when in class you ask us to give examples. this is a big take away for me because it gets me know that i use this almost everyday in my life but it something so small that you don't notice it, but now i know what it is and its functions in the real world. for me i am a visual learner so talking about an example the whole class could visualize help me with understanding the material and also helps me understand it better. Other big take away are how to use each topic in there's perspective field and how to use the equation. now that i have a good understanding of each topic because of how you laid out the material and also how you explained it to us like we were students with good real world examples. thanks again."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,140,"What was my greatest take away from this class?My greatest takeaway is how physics works in everyday scenarios, and that it is easy to identify and calculate solutions to different problems or situations. Also just having a basic understanding on how physics works and what makes sense and what doesn’t. There has been a lot of experimenting and data collecting allowing us to get a deeper understanding in what happens, figuring out how much force is in friction, or the loss of energy in a system due to thermal energy, or the pathing of an object in orbit and basic force equations for determining the transference of an amount of force or force needed to move an object. My greatest takeaway is the studying of force and verifying the amount of force one objects acts on another or determining the direction of a force or quantity inorder to move an object."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,130,"My greatest takeaway from this class has to be the problem solving and equation breakdown. As we have gone through the different simulations along with all of the homework from the lecture part of this course has helped me visualize all of these problems we come across. Most of these problems, we encounter in our day-to-day lives. It is nice to understand how things work and what makes them the way they are in terms of physics. The most important thing that I think I have taken away personally is the Forces section we have gone over and continue to go over. Understanding forces and how they act on systems really helps me dive into these problems and situations. One example of this that comes to mind is 2 objects held together by rope and a pulley with one on a frictionless surface and the other being held up by the string and the pulley, suspended in the air. "
