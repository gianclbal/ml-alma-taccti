2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,124,"One of the concepts covered in class I want to discuss is the effect of acceleration of an object. When an object has no acceleration, the change of velocity will not occur and the object will be going at a consistent rate. When acceleration is incorporated into the object's motion when positive it will increase the object's velocity at a rapid rate reducing the travel time with the amount of distance being covered. When acceleration is reduced/negative it will decrease the object's velocity at a rapid rate until the object is at a complete stop then it will change in direction of movement and go the other direction with faster speed as time passes. Acceleration lab we did two weeks ago observed what occurs when changing the man’s acceleration. What will occur? How is the rate of which he traveled changed? These were answered by doing predictions/experimenting with the online tool seeing a visual aid and graph to the changes of speed helps understand the changes. In addition, we answered some scenarios of what is needed to be altered to fulfill the story (ex. Man walks to the house slower until he stops, turns, and goes towards the tree fast). Using an initial velocity with a negative value acceleration will result in this scenario. The negative acceleration will keep reducing the initial velocity until there is no positive value remaining making the man stop. When velocity is negative its direction is opposite and travels the other direction."

One wouldn't be able to walk without any friction force or one would automatically fall. Friction can be seen while one drives a car. The friction from the rubber tires on the street is caused by friction and it refrains the car frim gliding on the ground and able to brake. Friction can also be seen when one is writing, the friction can be seen when a pencil or pen glides over paper."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,139,"Newton's laws consist of three laws. The first law states that an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion unless an unbalanced force is exerted. We experience the first law everywhere we go from the moment we wake up to the moment we sleep. A door will stay closed until you exert a force to open it or when you accelerate the car from rest. The Second rule states the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of that object times its acceleration. A great example of this would be in racing. Race cars or formula one cars weigh less than average cars allowing them to be more powerful. With less weight and increased power can increase a car's acceleration. The third law states that for every action, there is an opposite and equal reaction. Again when it comes to a car you hitting the brakes is an action and the reaction is the brakes slowing the car down. The tires push against the ground causing the ground to push up. Due to Newton's laws, we can improve our tires for better traction or better brakes."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,127,"so this goes hand in hand with the extra credit option in the other class that i choose to do potential energy and choose to do a informational video on it. so when i was choose this topic i choose it because there's is no much potential energy around us at any giving point, the stuff on you desk all of it has potential energy. light hanging in the ceiling, etc, there so many that we just don't think about. as i was researching and trying to get a better understanding of the topic, potential energy is the amount of energy a object or thing has stored or build up at some height respective to zero. so when i throw a ball at the air at the max height it will have its max potential energy and when it comes down its inverted into kinetic energy. factors that come in play are the  weight of the object and the force or gravity pulling it down and like i mention as well as the height it travels. all those factors lead up to you figuring out the potential energy of an object."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,140,"Why is ice a frictionless surface?Ice unlike other surfaces is made of water and needs to stay at a certain temperature to stay frozen. The surface texture of ice is smooth, thus with this smooth surface the objects on top of ice move with ease and no friction opposing it. Surfaces with more roughness or rigidness have a higher presence of friction. This is due to the shape of the object and the shape of the surface. Looking into it further the surface has varying sort of peaks and the spaces in between are where the object fall into slightly locking them into place only force applied allows for the object to break the barrier or move over the roughness. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,134,"I would say last week's objects in motion are the most applicable to real life. It tells us how objects interact with each other and we can see how fast they can be. We know that objects slow down whenever the object is touching another object that has friction. We saw a video on how air resistance affects objects being pulled down by Earth's gravitational pull. The video also showed when there was no air resistance applied, with a feather and a bowling ball reaching the ground at the same time."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,147,One subject we talked about that I enjoyed the most was the friction lab. However I did have a question about the simulation. The man was pushing a cart with wheels with a box on top of it in the simulation. Doesn't this mean there will be no friction. I thought there would only be friction acting on the box if the man was pushing the box forward on the bare ground. I understand that normal force is still there but would there be no friction or just less friction. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,137,"Subject: Newton’s 2nd LawMy question: How does change in mass or force affect the acceleration?First I will talk about if a change in mass were to occur. If there was an amount of force being applied to the right, and at one point another object was added, thus the mass increasing, yet the applied force is the same, the acceleration will decrease, since as mass increases the acceleration will decrease, which makes sense when you think about it because when when you are the one trying to push the two objects, you’ll notice that if you apply the same amount of force, you are moving at a slower pace. To have acceleration remain the same, you need to increase the force by the same amount, or push the objects harder. The concept also works if there is less mass, because if you are pushing multiple objects and take a few out and continue to use the same applied force, acceleration will increase. Now if force were to increase, meaning that the force you apply when pushing an object, and keep the mass the same, then acceleration will increase, which makes sense because when you push the object harder to the right, you’ll notice that you are moving faster (increasing at a constant rate). However, if you apply less force then there will be less acceleration. This is generally applicable to people’s lives because we all have this understanding that the heavier the object, the more effort it will take in order to move the object."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,144,"How are position, acceleration and velocity related?The concept that really sticks with me is the mathematical relationship between position/velocity and acceleration. This concept applies to everyday life because it provides 2 ways of understanding the relationship between position/velocity and acceleration. The first way would be observing how acceleration affects velocity and acceleration and visa versa. The other way would be understanding that the derivative of position over time is the velocity over time curve and the derivative of the velocity over time curve is the acceleration over time curve. Understanding this we can then make more assumptions about the relationship understanding the mathematical relationships between integrals and derivatives. An example would be if I had constant acceleration I can then expect my velocity curve to be linear and my position over time curve to be parabolic (even if you only use half of the parabola). Knowing the mathematical relationship also provides context for the kinematic equations, which are oftentimes simplified versions of the differential or integral of velocity, acceleration or position! This can benefit society by providing another way to think about physics. There are some concepts that are difficult to understand strictly from examples (like force) but seeing the math behind these concepts explain the relationship in a way that makes a lot more sense. Knowing the mathematical relationship can also help you estimate the velocity and acceleration of objects in everyday life. Recording the position over time is much easier in everyday life than recording a velocity curve. So by understanding the mathematical relationship and producing a position over time curve for any given object you can derive the object's velocity and acceleration at any time you had previously recorded."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,132,"The concept that I will be discussing is related to Newton's laws, or more specifically, the types of force that we learned about in the previous lab. The concept I wish to discuss relates to the topic of contact and non-contact forces, which I thought was a very interesting and important lesson from last week's lab. The question that I have decided to formulate is: What is the difference between contact and non-contact forces, and what are a few examples of each type of force. In addition to this, how would you identify whether a force acting on an object is contact or non-contact? Based on my own knowledge (and also consulting my notes), I found that the main difference between contact and non-contact forces, is that non contact forces are forces that don't require objects to physically touch, while contact forces are forces that are exerted when objects physically touch each other. A few examples of contact forces would be normal force, tension force, spring force, applied force, and air resistance. Meanwhile, a few examples of non-contact forces are gravitational, magnetic and electrostatic force. With these forces being identified, the easiest way to differentiate between contact and non-contact forces, is to see if the objects exerting force on one another are coming into contact with each other."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,149,"the one question that I would ask is that how will those concepts or formulas that I've learned in the past weeks in this lab will be helping me achieve my data for this week lab? I understand of the acceleration, velocity, position work, and Newton's Laws of motion. however, things can be somewhere fluctuating in this lab for the data obtaining experiments due to restart from beginning to obtain the absolute data set can be tough."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,145,Last week I learned about friction and forces. This can be applied to our everyday life by knowing how the ground is. Say someone has to move and they have to move a heavy box if the ground has a rug and the box is heavy this will be a two person job. Let's say if the floor had to rug and it was wood this will be a much easier job for two people and can even be done by one person. Since the rug has more friction than wood this will prevent that one person from hurting their back if it's on a rug with a heavy box when they want the box to slide.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,128,"Newton's third law is the topic that I wanted to go over. It talks about how a reaction or force has an equal or greater reaction or opposing force.The law goes on to explain that to any action there is an equal or greater reaction. This law has some real life implications, as when you are pushing something it has an equal force pushing it back and that's why it's so hard to push the item. This information is very important because it explains many things such as why it's so hard to make things like strong rockets or swimming. If you want to see this law in motion just  jump and let your feet hit the ground. This pretty much shows how your legs apply a force to the ground, and the ground applies an equal and opposite reaction force that propels you into the air.  As a result of this, this opposite reaction makes it difficult to make things just work without having something oppose it . That's why like I mentioned, scientists apply this law for things like rockets and other such things to ensure that they function properly. That's why it's very important that we understand that law, because it's crucial to many things."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,133,"What is the difference between Newton's 2nd and 3rd Law?After looking back at my notes the one main conclusion was that Newton's 2nd Law observes an object that has forces acting on it while Newton's 3rd Law observes the interaction between forces. I never really understood the difference in these 2 laws throughout high school physics, they sounded so similar when the teacher was explaining them but after reading the chapters as a part of our homework it became really clear. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,146,"The change of motion and acceleration is the information that is generally applicable to people lives and/ or benefits to society. People that work at rockets and projecting what an spacecraft going through space and all of that will use this information. You have to know when to decelerate and when to accelerate in space in order to reach to the destination. A scientist needs to figure out what kind of motion is needed to send a spacecraft through space and how much to stop it from hitting the planet in thousands of miles per hour. We learned in class that distance and velocity describes the motion of the object and that acceleration is velocity over the time interval. We also learned in class to graph out position, velocity, and acceleration graphs that the scientists at NASA also does. They need to figure out all the information and present it so they can be checked and be improved if something is needed."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,130,"A question I would like to ask is how do forces cancel out if objects or particles are coming from different angles relative to each other.An answer that I have come to is that if one of the components of the 2 objects is the same in opposite directions, those forces will counteract each other. Say if there were 2 particles moving towards each other and collide. If the x component of the 2 objects is equal and opposite, the objects' forces in the x-plane have canceled out. The same would go for the y and z axes. This is a hard concept to understand unless you break the problem down to 3 different forces working together on that particle or particles. You would have to set up a graph to diagram the collision of the 2 particles. Then, you could break down the particle into the different components of the force that was applied to it. The different diagrams you draw will show the different components, and using the formulas that we have gone over this semester, we would be able to figure out the amount of force that was applied to that particle in each plane. I think that it is much easier to now visualize this type of situation now. I can see where this could be useful in the real world. If you were measuring the different forces on a component of a machine to figure out where stress is coming from to design something more structural."
