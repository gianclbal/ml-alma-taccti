2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,130,"One of my main goals from this class is to understand how calculus and the combination of it with physics work in the real world. Over the past few weeks, I have learned to understand how to actually use calculus in real-world examples to find things like volume, acceleration, and position. Before taking this class, I honestly had no idea where or why I would ever use calculus in my day-to-day, but now I can understand that it can be useful; this can be especially useful in the career path I want to pursue. Computer engineering needs these aspects of math and science to articulate the complex ideas that are dealt with when writing code or designing something. What I have learned will help propel me into my future classes and jobs with the strong foundation it has built for me. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,128,"This class can help me succeed because it is a prerequisite and I need to pass this class to be able to get my college degree. Physics is a key class for my mechanical engineering degree. Physics is crucial in the study of how things move and how they work. As a result of this, this class will teach how energy, motion and other such things work.  I was also reading that mechanical engineering uses physics for the  “principles of engineering, physics, and materials science for the design, analysis, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems.” These things are crucial in engineering because it helps us as engineers solve problems and create solutions that are needed in society. That is why I need this class. I need it to understand what, how and why things work the way they work. This class is not only a prerequisite but also a stepping stone to my future."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,147,My goal is to become a civil engineer in the future. This class is very important because it shows you the different movements and behaviors of certain materials and object. As well as how to calculate values that will help in the decision process of what materials to use. Knowing how to calculate sided and angles of certain shapes will be useful when you need to have consistent measurements on whatever project you are working on.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,135,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?One of my biggest goals this semester is to understand the basic concepts layed out in physics. I want to be able to explain physics to others since it is a common insecurity for many students. I think this would also be helpful for me later in life, although I want to be a data scientist and not an engineer. However, the versatility of understanding physics that understanding it brings is a big incentive for me. Another big goal of mine in general in life is to not waste my time. So, by trying my best to understand the concepts presented in physics I will be saving myself the time of repeating the class, and furthermore will not be wasting my own time pretending to understand a subject I truly find interesting ,complex, and worth the work."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,139,"I have different goals in life. For one I want to grow different businesses in order to have multiple incomes. Another goal is to grow my dads plumbing company to something bigger than what it is. In order to do that, I think a civil engineering degree would greatly help. Physics is a part of that major and a key factor in engineering. This class can get me closer to reaching that goal along with growing the company. At the same time, I am doubting majoring in civil engineering and switching to economics and minoring in civil or business. I would grow the company as just a plumbing company and with my degrees get a better understanding of how to run it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,134,"My goal for me is to land a successful job that's related to computer science. A way this class can help me is to learn more about physics through this lab. This class is also a requirement for me to get my degree in computer science. I'm still not that proficient at physics, so this class should help me understand it more. I could also make connections if these labs were more in-person and I could connect with people better, instead of being online. In the future, they might be able to recommend me or refer me when the job I'm applying to needs it. It would be mutual as I can also vouch for them."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,127,"My goals is to get this degree and work in the technology field. Maybe I'll end up somewhere around there but that's my goal is to graduate and start working probably as soon as I can, might take a small vacation. the way this class help me achieve this goal is by taking the class and understanding the class and passing the class as well. By passing the class i would have understanding in physics and would be able to move on to the next step in my course to finish this degree. then by going to my next course i can get this degree and be able to work and have job that i would like and enjoy. that is my goal for right now and this is one way in this class i can achieve this goal and the same goes for my other classes. yup those are my goals at the moment."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,140,"My goal right now is to graduate college with a BA in mechanical engineering. My dream project to work on is to find a more ecofriendly fuel source, or start to create engines that don't burn fuel. This would benefit the planet with having less fuel emission being released into the atmosphere. Not only for car, but for building and factories, where coal is being burned can be changed to a zero emission factory, completely powering city street with renewable energy is something I want to see in the future and I want to be apart of the advancements made in this field. This class in physics will help me understand force, especially magnetic force and the basics to understanding how to use magnets. I want to also learn more about physics of motion and being able to calculate rotation, speed and the force."

2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,146,"My goals right now are to enjoy life, give back to my parents, and to get a good job using my computer science degree. Physics class probably isn't going to help me enjoy life, but at least it will help me with my computer science degree as problem solving and critical thinking. With the computer science degree, I hope to use it to get a good job to provide for my family. Everything just connects and hopefully everything goes to as planned unless I enjoy life too much. I also want to be less stressful for the time being. I have been thinking about college a little too much and need somethings to take my mind off. I recently got back to drawing and started editing videos as a way to cool my head down and become less stressful. This ties into enjoying my life as I don't want to stress too much in life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,149,"My goals is to become a Data scientist for a gaming company in the future, but also to learn of game development too. This class will help me understand a lot more about math, especially calculus series in general so that I can utilizes the knowledge i've learned of on how to become a better Data scientist but also better at game developing too. Understanding how physics work and apply the knowledge into developing solutions and game design will definitely help me went above and beyond in terms of understanding the instructions about how things work in life. Not to be arguing with folks about how things work, but to also explain and teach folks about how things supposes to work using physics and math.Therefore, I do believe that this class will eventually helps me reach out to folks out there about how the world itself functions, but also to utilize physics into understanding how mathematical functions behave the way they are."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,124,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?My current goals are to graduate with my Computer Science degree, find employment of my dream job, and set a good example in my family. These goals are dire to me because these are the challenges I must conquer to succeed in my eyes and be able to have potential future family to pass down my experiences to them. Doing my best for this class will help with my goals because it will give better preparation and practice of this skill to be used in the real world like a job or even a hobby too. In addition, enjoying what I do is very important. If I don't like doing what the activity is I won't fully contribute of trying to like it but if its something of interest I will put more effort and try to master it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,143,"I guess my main goal is to pass this physics class. So this class will help me with that because it acts as kind of a supplement of certain principles, especially if those principles aren't being thoroughly covered by the lecture professor. Its kind of weird though, I always figured labs like this were supposed to be used to show that physics problems can be very easily converted to real world situations, much more then any other mathematical subject at least. However with covid all we do is simulations. Makes me feel like it kind of defeats the purpose of the lab almost entirely. Don't get me wrong I like having the extra unit bump to my GPA, but at the same time I definently think this is a concrete example of our online learning abilities just straight up failing us."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,122,I am aiming to complete my major in computer science. Physics in one of the requirements that I need to complete in order for me to graduate for my major.

I think even though my major is computer science I might still need physics, maybe the concept might be required. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,132,"If I were to honestly answer this question, I would simply have to say that I have no clue how this class may be useful to me in the future. In terms of goals, I mainly took this class because I'm pretty sure that I want to go into a field of engineering, and am currently thinking about selecting a major that pertains to a field of engineering involving physics. In terms of that, I just wanted to see based off of this class whether or not physics would be a good fit for me, and if it is a subject that I would enjoy. To sum it up, the main goal that this class helps me achieve, is helping me pick my future major and classes. To that end, I am prepared to give my all in this class, fully prepared to pour time and commitment to see whether or not I should devote the rest of my future to a field that mostly just involves this subject."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,141,"I am taking physics in order to better understand how forces apply to civil-engineering. As in civil engineering the forces acting on what is being designed are crucial components to designing something that is safe, and will be safe for a long time to come. Therefore when I take physics and learn about how different forces affect objects in space I directly am improving my ability to more fully understand a design.  Doing these fundamental tasks such as drawing the forces acting on a house that is going to be built on a hill and balancing the forces pushing up on the house so that the house's net force equals zero and the house stays still. Instead of falling down which would be a terrible thing to happen, as many people's safety could be put into jeporday. I am studying forces in this class in order to better be able to apply these concepts to civil engineering."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,129,"My goals are to obtain my bachelors and maters of science in computer science. My career goals are to become a software engineer and to work for a tech company in silicon valley. I eventually would like to have my own company that specializes in video game design and software design. I intend on going to Berkley for grad school. I have always wanted to attend that school because i hear how great of a school it is and that Berkley is a beautiful city. I feel that although this class is very challenging and doesn't necessarily pertain to my major, I feel that I can learn a lot from this class. The concepts and all of the calculations that this class includes can be very helpful in everyday life. These concepts can be seen on a daily basis but this class will help one fully understand the physics and principles behind every day life occurrences. This class can help me and force me to stay sharp with my calculus math which I really enjoy about this class .Being proficient in calculus is a key principle being a computer science major and in many other stem related fields."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,145,My goal right now is to become an engineer and I need to be able to know able forces. In this class I am pretty sure it is going to help me get a good idea such as newton's law and so much other stuff that will come in handy. Physics also helps me know difference between velocity and acceleration which can help when building things that I may later need to know.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,144,"My goal at SFSU is to graduate and become a software engineer. The concepts learned in physics might help me better understand specific libraries, like react spring or other physics based libraries. Physics also helps programmers understand and think about concepts abstractly and logically. Physics, math and programming all share the idea that we understand complex ideas by breaking them down into logical components that interact with each other in specific ways. Physics offers a way to practice this way of thinking which will benefit me in future physics courses as well as my math and programming classes to come."

A requirement for this major is that I need to take this physics course and lab, so it’s a small step for me to achieve my goal. Not only that, but the subject will be important for me to understand in the future, for both my major and to have knowledge of. Another goal I have is to learn as much as I can, and I don’t want to limit myself to only learning about computer science, so I like taking this class. It may help me in the future someday. I want to gain as much knowledge as I can, because I want to learn. Specifically working in this lab class helps me because it gives me a better understanding of the subject, since it’s more of a hands on experience than just reading a book and watching videos."
