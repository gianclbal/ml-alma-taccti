Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,122,I wanted to go into the stem field because I thought computer science is an interesting major to study. My dad is also a software engineer so I guess him working in the field has had some impact in my decision to do this as well. I enjoy working with computers and programming. It is difficult but I enjoy problem solving so I enjoy STEM topics. I also find math an easier topic for me than English so that probably has an impact on my decision to do this as well. I want to learn about machine learning and AI which I find interesting because a machine being able to learn on its own is pretty impressive. I would also like to learn the fundamentals of how AI work and how they come to be like Siri and Google Assistant are narrow AIs meaning they don't have the human thinking capability. I want to know what an AI needs to have the human thinking capability which would be really cool.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,123,"I am interest Stem field as i am a kid. my grandfather shew me lot of experiment. Stem stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Stem is important because it pervades every part of our lives. Science is everywhere in the world around us. Technology is continuously expanding into every aspect of our lives. Our lives now is basically on technology. stem education helps to bridge the ethnic and gender gaps sometimes found in math and science fields. Initiatives have been established to increase the roles of women. also stem worker earn more money than other kinds of job."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,124,"Lesley Alexander928023576PHYS-0222Reflection -1Why do I want to become a computer science major? To answer this I go back all the way to when I was six years old playing one of my favorite video games Super Mario World on the GameBoy Advance. This was a golden gem to me when I grew up being a fun game to play whenever to get lost into this 2D world and enjoy it at its fullest. As years pass I tried to figure out a career path I want to follow and be successful financially as well enjoying it too. Then it struck me that I want to work in the video game industry to help in any way possible. I started narrowing what I enjoy about video games and its the backbone of how it performs/functions, the engine. The engine of the video game is sourced by lines of codes functioning in a complex way that the computer has to understand for the user to access it easier for the general public. So, I want to be a software engineer for a video company one day, enjoying my favorite hobby and learning at the same time."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,125,"""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?""	I am studying computer science at SFSU as a junior. The reason that I chose a STEM major is because everyone told me that I will find a job very easily after I graduate without  worrying about job opportunity. When I was at elementary school, I was very interested in hacking. However, I changed my mind right after when I really got into it because it is such a very difficult major. Also, as most of the STEM majors, we will have to meet lots of math and science requirements which are difficult for me either.  However, I believe that time will pay off if we work hard enough, and programming should stay in the top 5 list of carriers. For example, the most popular electric car brand tesla is the future, and self-driving car as well, so technology is the future. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,126,So the reason why I want to go into a STEM major is because I have always been passionate about the Sciences since I was a child. I have always been fascinated by how things work and the inner mechanics of anything that has a motor or gears. Like I still remember as a kid I spent all my money on Lego sets and RC cars and I always liked building and modifying to make it better by trial and error. Currently I am an automotive technician and I’ve always been into cars because of my father. Also I just really want to invent something that will benefit society one day but in reality I just want to design and recreate something out of scratch and build it better. Maybe one day I can work for Elon Musk for SpaceX but if not NASA would be dope. But overall I have always been interested in the theory of quantum physics so hopefully one day I will be able to do field research to get a better grasp of how our universe works.                                                                                                                                                                                                     Waseem Anwar
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,127,I want to go into the stem field because there aren't many people like me in this field and are dominated by a category of people. Also because I like the stem field and I like science and technology and what can be created to help people. I want to be able to go into this field and make some type of change so other kids like me can go into this field and see someone like them working and making a change. Also since I am a computer science major I want to be able to come into this field and create something with someone or company that would help others. This is why I want to go into the stem field because I can come in and change the faces I see and see more people like me and also create a change. I want to be able to diversify the field. One small step at the time.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,128,"STEM has always interested me and what it means to be in that field. I am a big fan of engines and to major in that, you need to be in the major you need to be in the STEM field. So even if I wasn't a big fan of STEM, I would still have to be in regardless of what I would think about it. Nevertheless, I am a big fan and I enjoy doing Math based things. Its makes everything so simple and keeps everything very objective. I know when something is wrong or right. There is conclusive answers for the most part. I just enjoy the certainty that it brings. Not only does it bring certainty but If you strive and work hard at it, anyone can be in it.There is no need to be gifted physically or nothing of that sort. You can just work hard and succeed."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,129,"I want to dive into the STEM field because i love science and technology. I also believe that there's not a lot of representation of black and brown students in the stem field as well and i would like to be part of that change. I love stem, particularly technology and science because i find it to be stimulating and challenging which is a requirement that i have for myself and the profession i wish to seek. I love that science is an everlasting wheel of information, its a field that will always grown and expand. With computer science and software engineering it will allow me to not only be logical but to be creative as well and to execute ideas i have."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,130,"I want to go into the STEM field because t interest me. Ever since I was young, I've been interested in math, science, and technology. I have had role models in my life who have been in the STEM field so that motivates me to be like them and go into the STEM field. Something else that makes me want to go into STEm is hearing when people say things like ""doctor, lawyer, and engineer"" as the top professions. I never thought that I would be able to become a doctor or lawyer so I picked the next best. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,131,"The reason I plan to go into the STEM field is mainly because I love to be around technology and understand how its works. But before that, my parent had also been into the stem field ( engineer and a doctor) and it was expected of me to be in the same field as well. And although i was always inspired by the nature of my parents field, i never seemed to like their job. My mother was always stressed out because of her patients and my father had to stay long night at field supervising. But the day I learned about computers and how it can solve any problem with right thinking, I decided that i will go into the field of computer science. Moreover, the more deeper i get into this field, the more i understand its importance in the very existence of our society that depends on technology. So the greatest reason for me to go in this field, is to contribute my part as best i can to this global society that will flourish with moral technological advancement."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,132,"Reflection #1 Quite frankly, I am glad this essay is informal, because I have a lot to say regarding the topic of why I want to go into the STEM field. I come from an Indian immigrant family, and all of my family members have worked hard to earn their places in the world. Most of my family members are successful, and a majority of them are working in STEM related careers. Due to this, there has always been an expectation for me to go into a STEM related field. Honestly, I have no idea what career or major I want to pursue, so I can’t really complain about this. Personally, I decided to search for a STEM related major, because I feel like it will align with my interests and hobbies, and lead to me finding a job that I can be happy and proud about. In addition to this, I do hope to someday make a difference in the world, and strongly believe that I can do so if I pursue a STEM related career. All in all, these reasons are my main motivating factors for pursuing a STEM related major or career. 					 				 			 		"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,133,I want to go into the STEM field because I know that I can make the most positive impact on society through innovation and science. I actually plan on transferring out of SFSU to pursue a degree in Environmental Engineering. I'm currently studying under a Civil Engineering degree at SFSU but I want to focus on the material science and carbon-capture aspect of engineering. Exciting and thought-provoking technology is what fuels my motivation to continue to grow in the STEM field. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,134,The reason I want to go to STEM field is that I enjoy science and the things that it has. It amazes me on the stuffs in it as there's still many things that amaze me still. I do however sometimes also have a hard time understanding the concept as I have no idea what's happening. STEM was something I first started in high school as I still didn't know what to do back then. There are still things to uncover and understand in STEM and I want to be part of the team that does it as it's quite a feat.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,135,"""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?""I dated this guy and he was such a tool. Just your average orange county douchebag and it turns out that he was a data scientist for Instagram. He was very obnoxious and acted like he was still in a fraternity although he was 10 years my senior. Despite the horrible date learning what he did intrigued me. I began to look deeper into the background of his job and fell upon computer science. I fell in love with coding as soon as I began learning it. It was the challenge I had been missing in my previous majors, and a new passion emerged. I want to go into the stem field to increase representation of POC in the field who are also women. I want to join a team in tech one day because coding is my passion and I love that there is always something new to learn. I want to join the stem field to break the stigma of jobs in stem being mainly for men, and inspire other women to try something new (I didnt think I would like it at all, especially all the math which I never thought myself to be good at!) Basically, I want to be in the Stem Field to show you don’t have to look a certain way or be this super smart person to succeed. You just have to want to do it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,136,"Even though going into the STEM Field was not my first choice, as I grew up I began to develop curiosity about the things around me. For example, when I got my first ever computer, I was so fascinated by how it can do literally anything I ""command"" to it. It made me question how, and who came up ideas like this. Later on anything with technology drove my interest. I feel like the world is rapidly growing and changing and technology is the main reason why it is. I want to be part of a change like this. Knowing that my work will make a change. I always had a passion for math too, so it just all added up. Like math is very difficult for other and it is for me too but I like the challenge I love the feeling like I solved it no matter how hard and long time it took me. I feel like my head is always working, it so weird to explain but like I just be thinking to myself like imagine if we our phone battery could last longer. Little things like that showed my curiosity basically in the little things. This reflection only gets to show a little bit of my interest in the STEM Field."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,137,"I want to go into the STEM field because I am specifically interested in computer science. I was first introduced to it in my junior year of high school. I learned a lot in the class and always looked forward to learning new topics. I am also interested in learning how to understand software to make games. Even if I was not into computer science, my major would still be somewhere in the STEM field, because I was always more interested in math and science than English and history. I prefer learning how things work than just memorizing a bunch of facts. I also prefer looking at equations than looking at rhetorical essays. I can see myself working in a chemistry lab but I can't see myself trying to write a book (I do like to make my own stories, however, I unfortunately have difficulty on how to write well)."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,138,"Considering and working in STEM implies finding out about your general surroundings, finding imaginative answers for true difficulties, and assuming a function in a portion of the nation's significant disclosures and improvements."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,139,One of the main reasons that I am going into the STEM field is due to my dad's company. My dad owns his own plumbing company so I feel that getting a degree in STEM could help me put the company over the top. A degree in civil engineering will do more than just give the company credibility but also allow it to expand into territories other than just plumbing. Another reason I decided to join STEM was that I don't know what I like or what I wanna do in college. The more college passes by the more i think i just want to minor in engineering and major in economics or something else.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,140,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field?""I want to go into the stem field to be able to learn and understand how the world works. I want to also be able to create something with my own knowledge and craft something with my hands. Science and math have always interested me more than english and history and I feel like this also plays a big part in the reason why I want to enter the STEM field. I am passionate about using what I learn here to improve the world, because I believe that to combat global warming we must create something revolutionary. Science is constantly evolving and improving, but now we need a \nother big shift in technology to be able to help change this world for the better."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,141,"I wanted to join the STEM field because I have always been very obsessed with mathematics and science from a younger age than most. When I was young I always wanted to grow up and become an engineer. Then I began to focus on math and science from a young age. During high school, I took many advanced classes focused on science and math facing majors. In deciding to enroll for those classes and committing for a while it was clear to me that an education in the STEM field would suit me perfectly since I rater enjoyed covering math and science subjects in school. Yet I also really enjoyed drawing; so I decided to choose civil engineering since it offered a heavy focus on math and since while also incorporating drawings of drafts etc. I have always wanted to grow up and become a STEM major because I have always enjoyed exploring mathematics and science."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,142,The reason I want to go into the stem field is due to the fact that my strengths happen to be Math and problem solving. I would love to understand physics better. I currently am trying to major in computer science but I would much rather do electrical engineering. I only chose computer science because I am hoping to graduate soon since I am 27 years old. I have always been fascinated with doing hands on work and trying out experiments. I hope to pursue a masters degree to increase my chances of landing a great job once I graduate. I feel intimated when it comes to physics due to not having a strong background from previous physics class. I felt I mostly had to teach myself how to do everything. I would like to complete the transition to electrical engineering if I can complete this class with a greater understanding and with more confidence in myself.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,143,"When I originally came to sfsu I didn't really have a good grasp on what i wanted to do for my major. I started undeclared and for my first 4 semesters basically just did GE classes. I started to lean towards criminal justice because I come from a decent military family and was thinking I could find my way into a federal field. Unfortunately the courses I found through GE as well as a couple that pertained to my major were in a word: lackluster. So many of these courses were humanities and just consisted of reading and writing, read this book and write this essay etc. I was never big on English class in HS and coming here and realizing that my major was just going to be a one essay after another, I couldn't do it. I took conceptual physics on a whim for one of my GE requirements, and while it wasn't the best class I did enjoy how straightforward it was. I found that I liked problems that had one solution. And from there it was kind of just about finding a stem major that sounded interesting. At first I looked at computer engineering but I had already spent 2 years in school and didn't want to necessarily want to give myself a total of 8 years of school (and debt). So I chose computer science, it still pertains to computers but there's less course requirements and it seemed like I might be able to finish in 2/3 years. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,144,"I want to go into the STEM field because I enjoy solving problems. I want to work in an environment that challenges me, and the way that I think about things. I enjoy learning and working in the STEM field is a constantly changing environment where continuing to learn is important to succeed. STEM jobs generally pay well and the field is rapidly growing, this means that jobs in STEM often offer a quality of life and job solvency which is something that must be taken into account when looking at possibilities for your future. Finally I want to work in STEM because I want my work to be meaningful. I would like to work in a job where the work I do has a direct impact on what the consumer receives, or building tools that are used internally in the company or even simply doing research that either reinforces concepts previously discovered or further exploring concepts that are still being theorized. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,145,"STEM is really interesting to me. The reason I want to be in STEM is so I can learn new things such as reactions in chemicals, but it is also hands on which makes it more interesting. It also helps me improve my math and science skills since they are both put together in STEM. This can also help me in the real world since there is a huge chunk lessons that are based on the realm world such as vectors, the motion in acceleration and etc. I always felt like STEM is also a fun way to learn and can be fascinating how the things around us work."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,146,"I want to go into the STEM field because I have been playing games for a long time and that is what got me into programming and creating things. In the beginning, I started playing flash games online which transitions into more serious games on Steam. I started coding around highschool as my school had an game development academy that taught you about creating ideas of games, programming, and using a game engine. I enjoy coding because I enjoy the feeling of solving a problem. The purpose for me going into STEM is for my parents, like a lot of people probably. I want me to have an easy life after they stop working(hopefully) so I can give back some of their life that they ""wasted""(joke) on me. I do enjoy game design and creating games, but I also understand the difficulty so I am still considering other fields I can work in."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,147,I want to go into the STEM field because I've been around it my whole life. My dad works in construction and I have been lucky to be able to work at the offices of were he worked. I got to work with design engineers and civil as well. They sparked an interest in me to go into this field and I have been pursuing it since then. However I have not taken any major engineering classes yet so I cannot say exactly what I want to go into.  
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,148,I want to go into the STEM field because I appreciate the process of discovery. I like that we can use principles of physics and mathematics to create almost anything we can think of. It truly is very exciting and I appreciate learning new things about the world. I work in the STEM field as of now and I really appreciate all of the new discoveries that can be made using these basic principles. It feels very concrete and not vague. There are things that are knowable and discoverable based on fundamental properties of atoms and the way they interact with each other.
