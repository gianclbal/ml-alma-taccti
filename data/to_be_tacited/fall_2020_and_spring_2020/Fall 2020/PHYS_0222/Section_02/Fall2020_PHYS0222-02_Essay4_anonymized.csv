2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,126,"So I was having internet and zoom compatibility with my older Macbook during the beginning of the semester but I finally got it figured out but I was already over a month behind so I lost track of time and fell behind. Converting to online classes has greatly impacted my performance on how well I am doing academically. Sometimes I just wake up and do not have any drive to actually attend lectures and labs as opposed to actually driving to campus and attending in-person classes. It is very difficult to be able to collaborate with my fellow classmates to see if we are on the same page or simply for help on homework. I work full-time and it is very hard to try and balance both but I am trying my best, hence why I have not been able to do much in terms of labs. I'm doing alright in actual lecture class but I am determined to try and catchup with lab as long as late work can be accepted. I hope to do better for the rest of the semester despite having a shaky start. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,140,"I need to find more tasks that are productive towards learning and also not just spending hours watching YouTube videos or Netflix movies. A big thing also is being able to focus in class and not get distracted easily while in classes or lectures, and also focus on my classwork. I guess some side activities I can do to keep myself busy is practice playing my Ukulele and learn more my piano. I just need to develop better habits and create a schedule to follow for the day, also keep my planner."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,128,"To be quite honest, online classes have made such a struggle to learn the material. I get distracted very easily, and with no actual human interaction to enforce me paying me attention. At least in physical classes, teachers are more attentive of their students and what they are doing in their classes, and now in virtual learning it's harder to enforce these rules. Students are now more prone to get distracted. The good thing about online classes is that we can do things at our time. Take me for example, I work at night. I am a  floor manager at a warehouse and I work from 5-2 in the morning, sometimes even later.Due to that fact, I can’t always be in class or do my work at that moment, so these online classes help me with my hectic schedule. My mental health is really struggling, I am doing heavy classes with long periods of looking at the screen and then i go to work to look at screens and do heavy labor, but i let every weekend so that helps. It also helps that my teachers are very understanding for the most part."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,148,It is much more difficult to learn online personally. Self care is difficult in this time too as I used to try to go to the gym or do yoga and that is much harder now given the circumstances. It is definitely possible to thrive and do well during these times but I think it takes a lot of mental fortitude and discipline which I have been trying to build while being stretched thin by work and school. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,130,"Learning online has been pretty difficult for me to adapt to. It is rough not having that in-class experience, but I have done things to counter that for self-care. I have been sleeping more than I would be if I had to wake up and drive to class. It is nice to roll out of bed and go to class, but I think the lack of a classroom environment makes it very easy to get distracted. One other nice thing that online learning has over in-class is that the lectures are recorded. It is helpful in some cases to rewatch a lecture. Overall, I think that online-learning has its pros and cons; I still feel like my well-being would be improved if classes were on campus. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,138,Even though online classes are flexible because you can plan your own schedule still when we have in-person classes we can interact with our professor easily and doubts can be cleared faster with better understanding. And when you have online classes sometimes you have technical issues. Online class has partially impacted me because now we have a lot of assignments and projects to complete. But I have made a timetable that I follow daily and that keeps me organized. I have got used to this routine.  
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,144,"Online classes have been overall positive for my quality of life and learning. I am able to fill in the time that I used to be commuting or walking to class with more productive things like studying or projects. I don't feel like there is a major compromise in education, zoom accommodates individual questions, office hours and the full lecture format. I do miss the in person components, spending hours on end in your room is a lot less appealing then sitting in a room of your peers. I feel like I'm trading social interaction for more time to work, and at this point in my education building my portfolio while taking 15 units and working its a worthwhile trade. I am concerned that courses taken online might be seen as ""less legitimate"" than courses taken in person to my future employer."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,146,"Online classes to me has been pretty rough. Being on my computer, distractions are pretty much my number one factor of causing me to procrastinate. When I was on campus, I knew that I was there to learn and be active in the classroom because I felt a good uncomfortable feeling, now, I am too comfortable and definitely have gotten lazier. I am more concern about my future now than any other time. I hope that next semester, it would be better than now, as in like my work-ethic will come back. I also hope classes won't be too bad and cause me this much trouble."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,135,"I will be really happy once online classes stop and in class lecture begins. Although I'm learning I don't think I'm retaining as much of the course. Being home brings many distractions, and I have began to procrastinate even more. I procrastinate more and I feel I'm definitely not alone when I say that. My teachers do not teach the same and most of my classes are more of an independent study than a lecture based class. I find it hard to ask questions because I am already quite shy and being behind a computer does not help with that for me. To keep it short everything is different and harder and its starting to stress me out. I want covid to be over, but I get that it's not so we all just have to deal with it. I am sad most days, and that doesn't help with learning and completing school work. But, it's hard to be happy and productive when so many are dying."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,145,Online classes have their pros and cons. Something positive about having online classes is I can be more flexible in adding my classes and managing time since right now it is better if you do not leave your house. Some cons are the comfort of my own home. Unfortunately when I am not in a school environment it can be hard for me to concentrate. It can feel as if I am not at school. I have been slowly adjusting but just being in your own house while in class can come with some distractions. But overall it is a working process and there are some classes that are better off face to face since the professor can help you alot more than if it was online.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,133,"Online classes have been beneficial and horrible depending on the professor. What makes an online class great is if you have a tech savvy professor, if not, the student has to learn the information themselves, which is the case I find myself doing for one of my major core classes. The online experience can become frustrating and overwhelming in this case. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,132,"Frankly, I don't really know what to say for this reflection. Honestly, I would say that the worst part of online classes for me is that I really don't feel like I am involved in the class, and it feels as though I am just learning the course material by watching a bunch of videos and just doing self-learning. In addition to this, online classes are more stressful in the sense that you are forced to spend large quantities of time sitting in front of your laptop, trying to decipher your professor's words because of the poor internet connection. With that being said, my response is the same as my last responses, and I will simply summarize by saying that online classes really do make learning way more stressful, really taking away from the learning experience. I am also more stressed out because everything is online, and I feel like the quality of learning is much worse than if we were to all meet physically. Considering all these points, I feel that I have the appropriate amount of justification to state that online classes have heavily impacted the motivation I feel when I come to class, affecting both the effort and dedication that I put in the class. I am trying to destress by going on walks, interacting with other people and just going outside, but at this point, I just feel a sense of frustration when I am in my online classes. I do wish that we could go back to physical classes, but at this point, I guess that this is just something we need to deal with."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,149,"majority of the classes that i am taking so far are great, just the lab for physics sort of have negative effects on me since i quite dislike with the multiple parts of lab to submit when all could've been in one part, which is totally draining the time i needed to actually concentrate on my other classes instead of doing multiple submissions for the lab itself. I often go for walk or take break by shutting off my computer to get away from it all to relax my mind. i do feel like this is quite time draining with the multiple parts of the lab, like both the lab exploration and the post-lab knowledge can definitely combine into 1 single submission or could be combine with the summary where the lab exploration, post-lab knowledge, and also summary as well to a single submission so that it would save a lot of time. and feedback and reflect just stay as they are."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,127,online classes have had a impact on my learning in some ways. For start i like having that face to face class structure because i just feel like i pay more attention more and have less distraction. Since im at home i tend to distract my self with my phone or other stuff in other classes and sometimes i miss a couple of stuff. Self care im just sleeping more and getting more rest then i would have on a regular. still taking care of myself. concerns i have for learning is that im not getting the full benefits of this semester because we can't be on campus. for my learning concerns i have is that im not asking questions like i would in other classes. Just because i don't want to interrupt while there talking since there's no actual way to let the prof know that you have one bc there teaching. i don't have concern for my well being because i doing good. not stressing just yet and would stress for finals. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,122,"Not going to lie online classes have their ups and downs. Because I live off campus I had to commute before but now that the classes are online I do not need to commute anymore and I can just stay at home and attend classes, I don't need to wake up at 6 and get ready to go to the Bart station in order for me to be on time for class. I can just wake up and hop on my computer. Thee bad thing is that I can procrastinate more because all the work is due at 12 at night now instead of having it due in class the next day which I do not really like because I procrastinate a lot and this sort of makes it easier for me to procrastinate. Otherwise I wouldn't be turning in an assignment from 50 days ago today if I wasn't allowed to procrastinate to this extent. Assignments were usually due when you walk into the class but we aren't meeting anymore. Otherwise I like the online classes only problem is that it makes it  harder for me to break my procrastination habit."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,139,"Online classes have not had a good impact on me, I don't like the idea of continuing online. It would have been so much better if we took the semester off or if the school actually cared about its students and refunded our money. We paid a lot of money for a good education but ended up receiving a mediocre form of learning. Taking school online is not the right move I feel that it has negatively affected my learning and is causing me to miss out on crucial experiences and lessons. I don't think it is worth all the money we paid. I don't even like the labs we do if we were in class I feel that we would've actually done some cool labs instead of simulations and watching a penny fall. Labs are the fun part about science being able to see what we learn on paper works in real-life situations. I do have more time to do personal things but at the same time i have way less time to work which I really need to do. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,129,"online classes have been going okay, it allows me the chance to study material on my own pace and it gives me the chance to rewatch lectures just in case i didn't hear all of the information during lecture. Online class has put a small damper on my motivation during this school year unfortunately but for the most part it has given me the the opportunity of learning how to manage my time and focus solely on school. As far as my well being, i don't believe i have a healthy balance of school and social life since i am constantly at home studying or doing projects. My biggest concern with learning would be not being an active learner as i normally would be in a conventional school setting.There's moments where i don't really feel as if i'm a student but i do understand that teachers are doing the best they can considering the circumstances the world is in."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,136,"Going from on campus learning to an automatic shift to online learning was difficult. It was even more difficult to stay motivated and show up to class when I had family emergencies and could not go to every class meeting, so I would have to catch up on my own. I don't really have concerns anymore but what i realized that I have to do is communicate more with my teachers. For example, this year was very hard on me, and could not get myself to work all the time. I had so many things on my plate and was falling behind in class. Sometimes I wouldn't even have wifi, so the best thing to do next time is consistently letting my teachers know about what I am going through. One thing I did enjoy was that most teachers were being very flexible and understand the circumstance as well and would try their best to get the students engaged and help in any way. What I am doing for my well being is taking care of my health. I have a lot on my mind so meditating and going out for a short run really helps distress a little. Hopefully next semester is better."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,134,"Online classes for me can be really distracting, as I can easily distract myself with apps on my devices. I still learn from classes but I prefer face-to-face learning so I can understand things easier. As for self-care, I give myself some free time to talk with friends and play some games. I'm still looking for a job so that may affect my well-being. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,131,"Taking online classes this semester has been very challenging for me since I had never taken Synchronized lectures from my home country before. The most challenging aspect is to attend the lecture since all the classes start late at night due to the time difference. This Lab class actually begins at 12:00am and finishes at 3:10am in my time. This has effected my ability to complete the assignment on time.In beginning of semester, i was continuously missing assignment due to lack of sleep and major time difference( I am a morning person ), however as time passed i started to develop a routine. What I did is that i shifted my routine to night so that i would stay awake for the lecture and then do all my homework in afternoon when i get up. This was working nicely but after a while it started taking a toll on me so i had to rethink my routine( This is the major reason I struggled during the first half of the semester).As of now, i dont force my self to be awake for the lectures. I do try my best to attend but forcefully attending was not working out"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,141,"Online learning has impacted me in a few negative ways. Mainly no longer living on campus has created a much harder living situation, which is much less conducive to learning. Secondly not being in person in class makes it often hard to focus on classwork. Also there has been a noticeable drop off in the amount of material I feel confident in retaining. I cannot wait to go back to in person classes as that is the learning style I have grown accustomed to in my last fifteen previous years of school. However due to coronavirus nineteen the San Francisco State University system is shut down, and I will be in this situation for the foreseeable future. I have been coping with this new situation by allowing myself time away from studying to pursue hobbies as well as trying to find hobbies that I can do solitary."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,137,"Online classes have indeed impacted the way I learn. Most of my professors don’t really give us lectures, and instead feel more self-taught as I rely more on the textbook and homework to understand and gain an idea on the concepts we’re learning. As for self-case, I’m not really doing that. I’ve been focusing a lot on work right now and don’t have a lot of free time. When I rest for a bit, I only seem to get more stressed later on. I’m mostly waiting for Thanksgiving break so I can do some self-care and take a rest from all school related stuff. I do feel a bit stressed with the workload, as this is my first year in college and everything is online instead of in person, so I came in pretty confused and unsure of what to do. However, I am doing better than the first few weeks as I was able to make a schedule of what I should be doing everyday."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,147,"I feel online classes has its pros and cons. I feel at times it can be easier because you don't have as much classwork, but as a result a lot more hw. Obviously staring at a screen for eight hours is not good. For me I feel like teachers need to explain assignments' better since we simply can't go to their classrooms and ask them ourselves. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,143,"Online school, online school. If it were even remotely better then in person learning then most if not all the universities in this great country of ours would've switched to it by now. Currently the UC and CSU systems are being hit by a class action lawsuit stemming from quality of schooling and an unwillingness to spend the same amount of tuition that one would normally spend on in person classes on these zoom classes. I absolutely fall into this category of contempt. My education has never felt cheaper, but shockingly my tuition hasn't changed at all. I'm no longer paying a hefty $10000 a year for housing of course, but that's only because the school would be in a different lawsuit if they hadn't removed all student housing. Plainly every move and every decision made by the higher ups almost always feels like a decision based on profits, and I'm sure they're scrambling right now. After all one of their larger sources of profit, which came in the form of housing, has now almost completely been removed for an entire academic semester, and now the possibility of having to refund/reduce tuition payments has been introduced. I'm sure this will result in a general decrease in the quality and amount of classes being offered here at SFSU as well as a general decrease in the staffs morale. I'm also sure that most of the executives won't see any kind of reduction in their salary. I sure am looking forward to my next semester at zoom university 😀"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,2,124,"Online classes are a double edge sword for me. It is easy for me to get into class on time and material is accessible easily. However the problems I am having with online classes with the teaching quality and learning quality is affected due to not being able to visit the classroom physically. I am more of a hands on learner and physical contact environment is what suits me best for learning. I appreciate what is given during these crazy times however I do miss being able to be a in a classroom, having discussions, hearing the lectures and getting hands-on experience which is understandable during these wild times. I am also learning new ways of trying to micro-manage with all the online work to handle with. A bit overwhelming but I can manage with it all. A nice thing is to be able to do my work with a good amount of time to get it done."
