Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,178,"Revilo DimabuyuMr. LeonardPHYS 22214 September 2020I chose to do a STEM major because I really like science and math. I also like using my hands for things like building structures or working on my car. I know that the classes and labs won’t be easy in the future, but it will all better my understanding of STEM. I remember learning about STEM back in elementary school. I never really liked english classes and I’m pretty trash at drawing and history, so that’s another reason for me to focus on STEM. My dad was also a mechanical engineering major before he dropped out of college. I feel like I’m completing his work/filling in his shoes. For as long as I can remember, I’ve always loved learning about how things work and how I can go out about constructing something. I heard that the STEM field also really pays well. I feel like the major is slightly intimidating for those who don’t exactly excel at math or are inclined to learn more about science. Even though I’ve always liked both, I’m still kind of iffy on whether I’ll be a good mechanic/technician in the future. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,179,"I have chosen to work on a STEM field primarily because of two reasons. The first is that I am very keen on learning and exploring the aspects of reality. This is where most of the engineerings come into play because these use very detailed formulas and thought processes to accurately depict what is going on around the world. The upcoming value to which I have chosen STEM is because I love maths in general, and understanding what these have to offer as a ""universal interpretation"" through the use of empirical and objective formulas is rather interesting to me, more so than general learning. The sheer fact that it is possible to accurately describe nature with some mathematical equations is astounding to me. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,180,"I am trying to major in electrical engineering. I enjoy doing math and testing things/troubleshoot to get things to work how I want to work. I feel that this major might fit me the best because I have heard that electrical engineers does lots of calculations and test they creations to see if it works properly. In the future, I want to be able to create things that people might use on a daily basis. Or I can try to find better or cleaner ways to harvest energy. I want to work in a place where I can help people's life to be easier or help keep the earth clean."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,181,"The reason for me wanting to join the stem field boiled down to the fact that I like knowing. To me, knowing a lot about how the world works and why is very interesting. Learning the mechanics behind each function gives me greater insight to why things work the way they do. As well it allows me to inform others who may not desire to go as in depth as I might. However, I do hold my reserves when it comes to studying further. Fields of study such as electrical engineering are constantly evolving. Once you get your degree, the learning does not stop. It continues well after. As certain concepts become further understood and advanced it would serve one well to adapt and learn more. While I have no doubts over my capabilities; I do consider it to be a very daunting task that requires a herculean level of dedication and passion. I am not sure if I posses the passion."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,182,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field? This is a serious question that I've never thought about until recently. When I was still in high school, the question that what major should I study was always brought up by my parents, teachers, and even my schoolmates. At the time I wasn't sure what major I was interested in, but there was one thing that confirmed major. I was very interested in computer-related stuff. At the beginning of my college life, I was firstly majoring in Finance because that is what many people majors in. However, I soon discovered that finance is just not my type, so I changed my major to computer science. And now I enjoy it quite a lot. I have a dream that is to learn things in computer science and then program a game myself. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,183,The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is due to mainly my parents pushing it on to me. Since the major I wanted to do was game design but then I realized that computer science is what can help me get a better future. Since with how society is constantly changing and that technology is all over the world I figure that this major is one that can help with me finding a good-paying job. Computer science can also be used in-game design so technically it is part of my original plan. I can learn art on my own time and learn the fun part of game design later but computer science is a skill that I lack so I need to challenge myself so I can not take an easy root and get better in life. These are the reasons why I wanted to go into the STEM field.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,184,"I guess the reason I went into a STEM major in the first place was because that's where the money is going to be in the future even now in present time so many people working STEM jobs get paid really well. To be completely honest that's what I need for myself, my family and for my parents a good paying job that will help me repay them for everything they have helped me in and sacrifice to get me to be where I am right now, not to mention I want to giving them and myself a better life than what they lived when they were younger. I know I may not be super passionate about STEM it's still fascinating the things that I am learning in my STEM major and to hope that maybe one day I  will be a women coding those supercomputers, or creating a software for a big company, or maybe just maybe creating and app that will go viral one day who knows. But that's why I went into STEM."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,185,"I feel like it is kind of hard to describe the full reason as to why I want to go into STEM field, because there are so many reasons. The first and most obvious one is that these fields are needed on more than just a daily basis; they are the basics of life itself, being literally any and every where you can possibly think of. As for other reasons, I have always been intrigued by the world of physics and their law and theories. And the last reason, I need to do this for graduation requirement so this is necessary."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,186,"""Why do I want to go into the STEM field?""When I was younger, the desire to go into the STEM field was largely influenced by my parents and their dreams after immigrating here from Bangladesh. All throughout K-12th grade I knew in my mind that I wanted to do STEM as a way to try to accomplish one of my loving parents' dreams that they sacrificed so much for. It was when I first began college that I started to experience the growing pains of a college student in STEM. Like many students, I got by mostly with lackluster study skills throughout high school, so college was a very rude wake up call for me.I began to really struggle to comprehend math, the same math that came naturally to me before, I started to realize how hard it is for me to study and WANT to study what was in front of me if I was having even the slightest bit of an inconvenience. I was later diagnosed with ADD, and to me it didn't feel any different knowing what I had or not, I still wanted to accomplish my parents dream no matter what it took.Sadly, the idea that I had any sort of learning disability began to shatter my confidence in myself and my grades, my interest, and my dream all started to get out of reach. As a student, I hit rock bottom between 2018 and 2019, but in that time, reassurance from others in the same situations as I was helped me to begin a new resolve and I am slowly beginning to believe that I am capable of learning difficult topics. Being in STEM became MY dream now for a very selfish reason, to prove to myself that I can accomplish something I considered insurmountable at my lowest point. I genuinely want to become a great mechanical engineer for myself, not for my parents, and I want to become a person who can solve problems no matter how challenging, but I have to first overcome the challenge of graduating.(p.s. This sounded so much more dramatic than it was meant to be now that I read it back, but I just let my thoughts flow.)"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,187,"The main reason on why I or other student want ot go into STEM fields are that the Science, technology, engineering and mathematics all the fields are much important in every type of career and its perceived in every part of our life, having knowledge in these area is helpful for every student in pursuing  jobs thus it motivate them and me to develop more passion for  it to be more success in these areas."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,188,I'm going into STEM to fulfill premed requirements.  I appreciate physics for its precision and the power that comes with it.  STEM subjects are exceptionally useful.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,189,"Honestly I want to study in the STEM FIELD as a backup option. I know through this field, I'd be able to make a lot of money, so much as to where I want have to worry about finances anymore. It also makes sense for me because even though I am an artistic person, my creativeness can be sought else where. I am able to teach myself or learn from other people and I don't necessarily need a degree for that. However, for my major, I would definitely need a degree because its smiled upon. In all honesty I am trying to build a better brighter future for myself and I believe that being a STEM major can greatly influence where I'll be in 5-10 years. From my parent's personal experience, I've seen how stepping into the STEM field has greatly effected their finances for the better and I would also want that same experience, but ten fold."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,190,"I chose to go into the STEM field because it's what initially peaked my interest. I was really interested in pursuing coding as I got into coding since high school which connects with the tech part of the fields. Since technology was advancing so much, the thought of being part of that change sounded pretty intriguing. Technology is a big part of everyone's lives and to know how it works and how to make it seemed pretty fun to me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,191,"Ryan RiveraI want to go in the STEM field and more specifically mechanical engineering because I have always been very interested in rockets. My goal is to get closer to them and learn about them. So far, the engineering classes have been really enjoyable and tough. They have been nothing like I’m used to. I always work around computers, but when thinking about mechanics going more in depth than that is just crazy to me. I really have to stretch my brain to learn about these concepts. Recently, however, my motivation has been up and down, and I was ultimately thinking of switching majors. I’m still thinking about it, but psychology might be a better option for me. I think I do better around people, but I’m still very confused about what I should do with my life. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,192,"I want to go into the STEM field because it's the future and always has been the future. advances in tech and software will lead to a world where people can live easily without much waste. I hope to contribute to that future in AI, entertainment, research, software, apps. There are many opportunities that await, and branches will keep expanding from what STEM can do. The only issue would lie with me and my motivation and focus toward STEM. I am known by those close to me to lose focus near the finish line. I hope to change that during my time at SFSU and finish strong with my work and studies. I want to create good habits that will lead into my career and lifestyle. I hope to shape STEM and have STEM shape me. That way I think that the future Is riding on me, so I’d better do my best."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,193,"I want to go into the STEM field because I am interested in technology. The T in STEM represents technology and I have always been excited about new technology. I started using laptops when I was around four years old. Today, some of my interests are computer hardware, artificial intelligence, and energy storage. My interest in computer hardware manifested because I play video games in my free time. I pay attention to the performance per dollar that I can get from AMD or Nvidia. Computer hardware is also relevant to my major, computer science. Strong processors can run simulations at greatly reduced times. Computer science majors tend to get a starting position called “Software Engineer”. However, the work that software engineers do is significantly different from the work of regular engineers. My interests do overlap with the work of computer engineering. An example of my interest in artificial intelligence is Google’s approach to taking pictures. Google’s pixel phones use software to improve picture quality in a way that is unrivaled in the smartphone market. I’m interested in energy storage because climate change is one of the world’s most significant modern problems. Storing electricity is one of the hurdles in replacing fossil fuels. Overall, my passion for the STEM field can be summarized by my appreciation for the ability to solve problems."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,194,"One reason I would really enjoy being in the stem field is because of the major opportunities this field has to offer. Along with all the opportunities they have to offer I also think about how unique the field is and the amount of jobs I can get with these degrees. Not only that there will always be a high demand for science, technology engineering and mathematics. Due to this reason a lot of the jobs within the stem field will pay nicely or have great benefits   in these fields. Not only that I've always enjoyed working in a field that grows with me for example engineering is a growing field that is advancing every day much like math technology or science. Modern day eveloution happens a lot within this field and the day I realized that is the day I realized that this field was meant for me. It will provide me a way to make my family happy and take care of them someday also engineering is very interesting to me! "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,195,"I guess the main reason I go into the STEM field is because of my computer science major. It's interesting and exciting to develop something useful for everyone. Technology has already changed our lives and it will become more and more important in the future. So I think going into the STEM field will not be a mistake. Besides, I kind of like science because I'm always curious about how things are made. Understanding how something works gives me a sense of accomplishment. "
