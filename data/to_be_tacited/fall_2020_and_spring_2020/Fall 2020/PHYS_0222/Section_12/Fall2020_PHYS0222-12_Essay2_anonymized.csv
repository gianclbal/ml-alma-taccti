2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,193,"My goal is to become a software engineer. Of course, I’m open to a management position if I have the expertise to lead others. My main focus is to find a job at the likes of Google, Microsoft, or Amazon. I personally use services provided by all three of those corporations. I am also open to working for Apple although I do not use any Apple products. Physics lab can be useful in reaching my goals because the content I learn may be relevant to job requirements. At the very least, physics lab is required for my Bachelor’s in Computer Science, which is a requirement for most software engineer job openings. Physics lab can help me understand the content of the lecture. Therefore, physics lab can help keep my grade above the graduation requirements. I need to maintain higher than 2.0 for my GPA in order to graduate. If I understand both physics lab and lecture, I can expect to keep a high GPA."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,180,"I am hoping to better understand how the world operates. I want to understand how physics affecting our everyday actions. I am majoring in Electrical Engineering, so I want to be able to use the stuff I learned from physics and apply it to my major. The things I learn this session may not help much with things like atoms, but I am determined to contiune learning more physics in the upcoming sessions."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,179,"The primary goal that I want to set myself to accomplish is to turn in my assignments in a more organized manner because I've been really disorganized in the way I've handled my coursework in general for the last 3 weeks. There have been a couple of major events that have dragged my enthusiasm down and resulted in bizarre time consumption for me, which has set me back in many assignments, to which I am playing catch up on. Currently, I'm trying to implement a system which will allow me to work better from home, and more organized, which will hopefully help me out in sorting my thoughts with more free time. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,195,"Setting up goals will be very helpful in our lives. I wish I could have known it a few years earlier. I used to be the person who does not like setting up goals because I did not see the importance of it. Life without a clear goal is like losing your direction. You don't know where you should go. Now, I have one clear goal, which is to master programming skills. I hope I could beat down every difficulty that I will face in the future. This class can actually help me achieve my goal. It not only helps me understand physics more but also shows me a way on how to deal with problems. Like I said earlier, we will definitely encounter some troubles when you are achieving your goals, and you need the problem-solving skill to help you with that. I can learn the skill from this class, and this is why it can help me achieve my goal."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,187,What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?Physics in general is an experimental science the theories and concept that introduced in the in the physics class or lectures and the goal is to learn the general nature and behavior of real phenomena that are instructed in lectures and carefully observe and analysis in actual experiment and this class can help us in genuine understanding scientific method and method and data analysis so that we get some ideas and to teach us how to make careful experimental observation and show us ways to think about drawing conclusion form these data .
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,186,"My goals for this class are to effectively apply the knowledge gained from the lecture portion of the class, to further cement my understanding of physics concepts. By doing these experiments, a lot of the information that may seem complex can be aided with the supplementation visual aids and repetition of concepts provided in these labs. Sometimes I struggle to understand how formulas are derived, and though fundamentally, calculus is usually where my confusion lies, with the help of the exercises, I am better understanding which formulas to use at what time, depending on the verbiage of the questions given.My other goal for this class is to build a very strong foundation of knowledge that I can carry on to the next series of physics courses. So far, the summary, and the essay questions given in the lecture portion followed by the cool web tools we do the labs on this class, have helped grasp some of the simple yet fundamental parts of this class. What truly helps me from this class is definitely the programs which we use to answer the lab exploration."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,181,"At this juncture in my academic career, I am at a crossroads. I am not sure what my next move is, as such I am not very aware of my current goals. Right now, I am reassessing just about everything. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,194,"My goals In this class are to learn enough to be able to apply some of the material to real life situations. In this lab, I was very surprised about by how much we had to understand the material in order to answer the questions . For example, during the first simulation we were asked whether some of the questions that were asked were refered to again when looking at questions further down the lab. Which I can admit was a bit tedious although did help me fully understand what the questions were asking and I even resorted to going back on some of the questions and changing the answers after getting to certain points during the lab. This lab was probably the lab I learned from the most out of all the labs we have done so far. The lab was also the most challenging but I learned a lot about motion and how diffrent factors withing the motion can affect each other. All in all if I keep at the labs and continue with my best effort I can apply these questions and knowledge to real life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,188,"My goal is to go to medical school and become a neurologist, and this class is a requirement.  It's as simple as that."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,190,"I think ever since attending that first week of online classes back in the beginning of the semester, I knew that my sole goal was to just survive it and see it until the end even if that meant my grades suffering a bit compared to last semester. And boy was it hard haha...Even so, I do appreciate this class especially how convenient it is since labs could be done online via simulations. And how we're able to turn in late work from way back when because here I am now days later doing this ahaha...It definitely took some stress off of me knowing that some of the work that I had for school could actually be done on my own time rather than a set deadline, so, in a way, I would say this class might have contributed the most in achieving my goal for the semester and I really appreciate that."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,184,"My goals for this class have always been to understand the concept being taught, well enough where I can pass the class. But recently the concepts for the lab have been a little harder to understand, not that the professor does a bad job at teaching them. On the contrary she helps a lot during the lectures and getting together at the end to work on the lab helps a lot as well. But since we didn't meet up this past week finishing up the lab was a bit more difficult than I thought especially finishing up the the post lab knowledge check its not a lot to do but i guess it's just me not  understanding the material completely, I know I should ask for help but I've been hesitant because I'm so set on being able to understand it on my own. Hopefully the next lab goes better. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,182,"My goal right now is pretty simple, I want to get a grade that can make me satisfied. In order to achieve that goal, I'll have to use my free time to review the topics in class. However, with the help of this lab, the teacher helps us review what we have talked about in class by either lecturing or giving us review homework. Those things are quite helpful in my opinion. In the future of this class, my target is still as simple as before. I’ll spend my efforts to learn as much as I can from the lecture class and this lab in order to know more about physics and of course, get a good grade. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,196,"My main goals for this class are to be learning problem solving skills and being able to use them in my future classes such as computer science classes, which is why I'm originally in this class. I think that figuring out how to apply calculus to physics will somehow transfer over to seeing how to code certain projects that I'm working on. Trying to apply this knowledge in my other classes will also help with the next class I'm going to be taking in the future as well which will be physics with calculus 2 so hopefully the things that I learn in this class can be applied in the same way in physics with calculus 2. Other than that I think that this class can help me with the main class and help me review more and get better grades overall."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,189,"This class, as fun as it may be, is just a stepping stone for me. I'm using this class as a means to fulfill my graduation requirement. What I really want to do is become a very advanced programmer and and software developer. However, it seems I can't do that unless I  first pass this course. However, I can say that Physics does intrigue me. The reason behind this is due to the fact that physics, in a way, answers the questions of why. It helps us understand how forces directly influence the outcome of different occurrences. For example, why a car moves faster on a slope directed down. It answers the effects of gravity and how it acts on us. It is quite interesting to realize the functions of things around us. I always thought people who studied physics must've been extremely intelligent. I'm saying this because there are a multitude of components  that needs to be factored in when dealing with physics. Regardless though, I am glad I am taking this class and I am hopeful in my success with this course."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,191,"Ryan RiveraReflection 2	My current goal during these times is to actually retain what I’ve learned. It’s very hard. This learning style caters to just getting the assignment done and moving on. These labs have helped me because it is more hands-on, but I still struggle with the fact that none of this is in person. It especially sucks because I’m never in the setting where I feel like I can get work done. So my current goal is to get as much out of these assignments as possible. Using them to actually practice what I’ve learned so far in the semester. When I can do that, I feel I’ll get the most out of these online classes."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,192,"My goals from taking this class is to advance myself further in what I want to do. It seems very general, but this class is a stepping stone I need in order to take the next stone. Yes I will be learning motion and kinematics here, and will apply them to my future, but the main reason I am taking this class is so that I move on to the next one. I can see physics being used in my desired future which is game development and may play a huge role. I want to use this class as much as possible, and do it efficiently. My goals are to complete school and get my degree so I can do what I want more freely. This class will help me do that by being a major requirement."
