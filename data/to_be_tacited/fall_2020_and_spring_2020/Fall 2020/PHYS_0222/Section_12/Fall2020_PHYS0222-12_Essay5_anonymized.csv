2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,180,"My experience of this class was really fun and layback class. I love the labs and see how the physics is impacting our everyday lives, but I prefer going to class because it is easier to learn. I am a really shy person, and is really hard talking to other people. I am afraid that when I get back to school my social skills might be worst (lets hope not). This semeseter was really different because I did was not able to meet my classmate. It felt weird for a long time just starting at a screen with no faces and only names. I hope that this pandemic will end soon and we can start face-to-face classes soon.At the end, I really enjoyable and I learned a lot of new things. I hope you have a great winter break. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,195,The greatest takeaway from this class for me is this class helps me understand more about some physics concepts and theories. I like the simulations when we are doing labs. They give us some real experiences of how physics works.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,190,"I think my greatest take away from this class is that I must really need to work on my time management LOL Our current situation has been pretty rough and it has definitely taken a toll on me for this semester. I haven't been able to turn things on time when it comes to this class and I do feel quite guilty about it. In terms of physics though, I think my biggest take away is that physics is in everyday life. We do these everyday things in everyday life without a single thought, but it all has something to do with physics. Physics plays a bigger role in life than we really think and it is interesting to rethink all these standard things in terms of physics."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,193,"I don’t have any takeaways from this class. I dislike labs in general because they usually reiterate the same content covered in the lecture. It’s a horrible idea to expect students to spend three hours on a one unit, supplementary class. A good way to structure lab classes would be to cover some specific topics with more depth than the lecture. Instead, labs either focus on completely different topics that aren’t covered in the lecture or labs focus on the exact same topics with the same (if not less) depth than the lecture. The lab would have been more informative if the students spent multiple weeks on a single topic (e.g. linear momentum). Each week, part of the topic is introduced so students can understand the content better. I can’t think of anything that I learned from this lab. The simulations are useful for visualizing some concepts. However, I can’t say that I learned something brand new. The lab questions also deviate from the simulations too much. I think the lab would be a better learning experience if the focus were on physics applications. I distinctly remember the one dimensional motion lab being tedious. Currently, the lab is more like filing paperwork."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,179,"My greatest takeaway from this course has been my expanded knowledge of each physics concept, and there is always some interesting phenomenon lurking around the corner, awaiting discovery. After thinking through each lab, it helps a lot in solidifying concepts from the prior weeks in terms of concepts and applications to the real world. Some of the aspects of physics problems are very broad (and these ""multi-angled"" questions posed in the labs help solidify the material). Though there have been a couple of labs that are calculation intensive, these still have served a vital role in the learning process, and are no less important than anyone simple thought experiment."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,192,"My greatest take away from this class is that these labs have applications for everyday life. From projectiles, free falling, torque, force, momentum, work, and energy, they will all have many uses in what we do daily. It is what creates the sports we enjoy, the physics in video games, transportation, and how we evolve. For example, it is important to understand center of mass for sports, while understanding projectile motion and force for the ball of an arbitrary sport. Multiple labs would be relevant maybe one aspect of life. The simulations help a lot with getting an idea of how the physics applies to life. For example, in this lab, the momentum and energy conservation in different types of collisions help understand what kind of material might be more powerful for hitting or softening impact. Overall, this class can be seen as a lens into what a physicist sees in everyday life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,183,The biggest take away from this class is that I need to try and do the assignments a bit earlier as they take quite a long time to do. Since the lab usually takes at least a day to a couple of hours to finish on time. With how some of the assignments are the labs really take up a long time to complete but once I do them I get a better understanding of them. With how my family always wants me to do chores around the house I usually do not have enough time to work on the assignments given but i'll still try to finish them. So the main takeaway from this class is to plan out the hours and day when I do and turn in my assignments since leaving them till the last minute can be stressful. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,188,"I'm always impressed by the consistency of physics.  It's difficult to identify my greatest take away beyond this fact, but I would also say that what we discover in many of these idealized simulations is far from the whole picture in the real world (i.e. when friction and thermal energy are involved).  So I remained impressed that there is so much more to discover."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,187,"Physic help us to explore  the complex scientific concepts and make us connect to real world and help to understand its impact on our life,  in general this class was deigned to understand more the concept and topic that are introduced to us in lecture class and to go over on the important topic to understand it more, the topic that we went over in the class are important for us no matter what felid or career that we going to take over, but to understand the basic of physic will help to understand about  motion  and force works,   gravity , heat ,conservation of energy and momentum and etc… The topic that I was much interested to learn was the energy conservation where energy is transformed form one form of energy to another form and this is happening every minutes in our life these energies are like thermal, electrical energy, mechanical energy , chemical energy , sound energy and much more .And we are experiencing all these energies in our life like solar system, going on space with help of mechanical energy, with help of electrical energy batteries store energy that we use. And so many other things that develop through the help of energy conservation.  As the above topic there is a lot of thing to take way from this class.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,184,"I think my greatest take away from this class is learning the reason behind and how everything moves, how every motion we does starts from some thing things we cant see. But also learning about all the formulas that are needed to identify the movement , momentum, force behind everything is what allows us to go further into the future and how we want to excel and make new things to make the world a whole new better world."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,191,"My greatest take away from this class is that sometimes it's simply easier to just do the work instead of procrastinate and turn it in late. I didn't complete last weeks assignment and now the ominous black cloud is following me. The only way to get the cloud to disappear is to turn in the late assignment, but that's just so hard.. Online classes in general have been hard. Just not knowing how you're actually doing and how easy it is to not care about them. Yet here we are, slaving away at another assignment. Time to get credit. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,194,My greatest achievment was being able to analyze and critically think about all the ways to go about and solve a problem or lab. One of the main things I learned from this class was how to be patient and think about my question before answering it completely. Which is one of the most helpful things I learned especially when doing labs. Another tip I learned simply by doing the labs are to play with the simulation and get familiar with some of the functions to better prepare for the questions. All in all this class taught me how to think critically and inform myself before answering certain questions. I thank this class for my consistent analytical skills that were improved solely of the labs and simulations this class was a great learning experience.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,186,"I want to first and foremost thank you for allowing late work.The reason why this for so beneficial for ME, a student that regularly is on top of deadlines, is because it gave me a lot more time to focus on my lecture portion of this class, where we had to write chapter summaries and essay questions. I decided to shift my focus on that class when you said you would accept late work, and since then, I have gotten 100% on every assignment and thoroughly grasped the concepts while I wrote super in-depth chapter summaries that helped me answer essay questions that much better. In turn, now I am able to finish every lab in 1.5-2 hours because I simply understand the topics a lot better. My reason for saying this is to let you know that I really appreciated that as a student. Your lectures pre-lab were also super helpful, and once when I had a question about my physics homework, you explained the idea really well, which really helped me.I really like the learning tools we used in these labs, such as the PhET tools. As far as remote learning goes, I always performed well when given great online resources and this class really helped with my personal style of learning."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,189,"This class was extremely helpful for me, but the thing that stuck out the most for me was the ability of experimenting with objects and tools in my own home. It may not seem like much but it helped me in understanding how human flaws can greatly effect and experiment that I am conducting. For example when we experimented using the soda cans and the tennis ball. During this time I realized how my timing might have been off and by utlizing my stopwatch with multiple tries, I'd be eliminating possible errors. I also discovered this truth when I had to use my stopwatch for another previous lab. The lab consisted of a mass hanging from the spring and I was meant to find the time of each cycle as it oscillates. I quickly realized that my answers might've been flawed because of the error of the time it would've taken me to start and end the stop watch accurately."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,185,"I believe that  the biggest take away would be the knowledge about air resistance, because it is one of the most helpful knowledge from physics, from rockets to airplanes to basketball this value of this knowledge is immeasurable. Of course every other thing we have learnt are also useful, like momentum and kinetic/potential energy, but I still think, as far as viability and usefulness go, I think this is the most important one of them all."
