2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,192,"For projectile motion and vectors, it is a good way to judge how projectiles will fly when there is gravity, height, and launch speed involved. Something not discussed in class may be a wind resistance vector. If the wind during the time of projectile motion was a vector pushing back the projectile or further launching it, it could change the problem further. My question is: does falling down hurt more when you weigh more? In a way, I'm thinking of free fall and force combined together for this problem. At the same height, is there more force applied on the heavier object upwards on impact? or are the forces the same? They are probably the same when I think about how normal force works with gravity. The returning normal force will equal that of the weight being pushed on the floor, so a heavier person will get more hurt falling from the same height. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,197,"The topic I’ll reflect on this week will be “change in motion” and its “acceleration”. Motion is a wonderful topic and it never fails to catch my attention. We see it in everyday life whether it is ourselves and others walking or running, vehicles moving around, and animals pivoting while playing around. Acceleration itself partially relies on forces of friction, to enact change in motion. So, what would our real, physical world, be like if forces of friction were negligent?	 To understand change in motion and its acceleration, we must also understand acceleration and the directions of its vectors. When an object moves in a straight line at a constant speed, it has a net acceleration of zero. As soon as that object does have an accelerating force, in any axis, it will begin to shift direction and/or velocity/speed. Say for example, a vehicle moves in a circle, or a round-about. Its vector for velocity is pointing forward and slightly towards the center of the circle of motion; whilst its acceleration vector is pointing more towards the center. 	So, what would our world be like if forces of friction were negligent, specifically under the topic of change in motion and acceleration? Well, as one who’s oriented with physics could assume, change in motion would be almost impossible unless the acceleration was inflicted upon by a foreign object. For example, a car on a race track wouldn’t be able to change its course of motion, or even accelerate in either direction either. However if you have a hockey puck on a frictionless air hockey table, that puck will accelerate and change direction in the axis/direction of wherever it gets struck from; be it the wall or the air hockey puck strikers implying a force upon the puck."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,185,"I believe that so far in this class the most important topic we have gone through would be this air resistance one. Without this we would have to use so much more fuel on cars and motorcycles and most probably not even be able to take flight. The question is what sort of world we would live in if this discovery was never made, would we be able to so much of the world? Would we know as much as we do now? All of Earth is governed by physics, so it would not be a big stretch to think that if we did not discover this we would be stuck in 1700 technology."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,184,"A topic we went over recently in last week's lecture was Forces. The concepts of forces are how we study the interactions between two or more objects and how each other's force affects each other's motion. This motion can be contact or no contact, contact forces are created from the interactions between the molecules of things touching each other. Examples of contact forces are tension, normal force , and friction. Then there are non contact forces that can act on each other even if the objects are not acting on each other and an example of non contact force would be gravity. I think knowing what these kinds of forces are relevant to know especially if you are a physicist or a scientist because it's sometimes that you have to use for your job , or simply information to have in general because how are we going to know to move things on different surfaces. For example as a rocket scientist you would have a very well mastered knowledge of forces because you would have to know how much fuel it needs to create enough net force for the rocket would  need to defy gravity and be propelled into space safely in order to learn more about space.   "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,182,"I would like to bring up how the drag coefficient exists in every dimension of our life. First of all the definition of drag coefficient by Wikipedia is the Drag coefficient is a dimensionless quantity that is used to quantify the drag or resistance of an object in a fluid environment, such as air or water. For example, in theory, if a ball free falls for 5 seconds, the displacement of the ball should be 122.5 meters and the velocity should be 49 m/s. However, because of the existence of the drag coefficient with the interaction of air resistance. The ball should have less displacement and a smaller velocity. Furthermore, if an object has a shape that creates less drag coefficient, that object would cost less energy to get one thing done than other objects with a greater drag coefficient. The first thing that should have a lesser drag coefficient is cars. According to Wikipedia, streamlined bodies will have the least drag coefficient compared to some other shapes. All cars should utilize this shape in order to have the most cost-effectiveness. Other than cars, there are a lot of other things that need to have shapes with the least drag coefficient such as trains, swimming posture, and plains."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,194,A concept that was covered in the lab was the position in the lab and how mass was affecting the fall of the coffee filter and how we used equations of mass to find out how much the filter was effected when considering the fall from a certain height. Which was a really interesting experiment to analyze reason being is that I thought the filter would fall much faster but the air resistance of the coffee filter proved otherwise. It was eye opening to do it in person and I really enjoyed analyzing the experiment at different points. One question that arises as to how it falls slowly even with the Pennys placed. After thinking about the question and referring to my notes I remembered how we analyzed the ball and the feathers and how they fell at the same time. When that comes to mind that experiment had no air resistance so when comparing it to this experiment we can obviously see just how much air resistance can effect any experiment.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,188,"Why does the angle at you which launch a projectile change the horizontal displacement?  And why is 45 degrees the optimal angle for maximum displacement?     The angle changes horizontal displacement because a high angle will provide maximum air time, but minimum velocity in the x direction; a low angle will provide minimum air time, but maximum velocity in the x direction (assuming constant gravity and negligible friction).  Launching at a 45 degree angle provides the best of both worlds.  10*80 = 800, but 45*45 = 2,025     This information is useful whenever a projectile is involved, so it would be especially useful for military applications."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,195,"We experience friction every day of our life. When we are driving our cars on the road, there is friction acting on the car. If we do not step on the gas pedal, the car will eventually stop. If you are moving your furniture in your living place, you can feel that the furniture you are dragging resists the force you applied to them. A question comes to my mind that what will happen to us if the friction force does not exist ？Friction is one type of force, so it is a vector. A vector should have a direction and the direction of friction is always opposing the motion of an object. Suppose we are walking on a frictionless surface and moving forward is a positive direction, one of our feet apply a negative force on the surface, the net force will just be the negative force you apply, so you are not likely to move forward without a positive force such as friction. We can see that without friction, we can not even walk on anything. The only way we can go somewhere is through sliding.In the real world, the surface of ice is nearly frictionless. If we want to safely walk on the ice surface, we need to put something under your shoes to increase the friction between you and the ice surface. Or we can wear heavy things to increase friction. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,187,"subject is has its own applicable on people daily life isForce. Force could be defined as an external cause, which impact of the object state of rest, the uniform motion of the object in a straight line and when a force with some amount applied on the object it will start the move, to change the motion of the object we can do as well by applying some force in general the object start its movement when force and apply in and the object can become at rest when force applied to it. No imagine the application of force in our every day’s life, the use of force in our every day’s life is very common, we use force to walk, to left object, to throw something (ball) or we can apply the force to some machines to give them a speed or direction a great example of machines are (cars). And to be more Clear about the concept of force application in our daily life here are some great examples that will make us clear about the application force in our daily life these are;Teams that play pulling rope (force is acting on both side) Opening the doors (individual exert force on doors) Bulldozer that pushes on the earth (force applied on Machin) And many more examples. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,191,"I'm going to summarize and explain the motion of free fall objects and projectiles. A free falling object exists because of gravity and its influence on the object. This influence pulls it down to the ground, creating what we know as free falling. Any object that is free falling, whether it is thrown upward, at an angle, or horizontal is called a projectile, and this is because the only force acting on it is gravity. The course that the projectile takes during the throw is the trajectory, and it shows us a lot of statistics. These include position, velocity, and acceleration. Time can also be calculated if you know the trajectory. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,181,"This experiment is applicable in conceptualizing the idea of free fall and how acceleration works. If charted with stop motion, free falling objects mirror horizontal projectile motion. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,193,"My question is: Why do objects slide the opposite direction of the way that a car is turning? In the lecture, we call this the effect of a fictitious force. Passengers inside the car may experience what is called a centrifugal force, which pulls objects away from the center of a circle. However, this force does not actually occur. In reality, any objects that slide away from where the car is turning are merely continuing their previous trajectory. The car was already moving so all the objects in the car have forward inertia. Those objects will continue to keep moving forward until they are accelerated in another direction. When the car turns, the objects are still heading in their previous trajectory. During the turn, the car’s door faces the direction that the car used to be heading. That explains why passengers describe feeling pushed against the door.This information is particularly relevant for the necessity of seatbelts. Without seatbelts, passengers will be launched toward their windshield like a projectile. When a car suddenly stops, such as during a car crash, the passengers will retain their momentum. Seatbelts counteract that momentum, keeping passengers strapped inside their car in the event of a sudden stop.Physics explains why people need safety devices when they are being transported. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion, unless acted upon by an outside force. This is particularly relevant on public transportation. Trains and buses do not have seatbelts so passengers are more likely to be injured during sudden stops. Ideally, we develop something that can cancel momentum so public transportation can be more safe."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,183,The question that I have come up with for the concept of Forces and Newton’s laws is that at any time does friction not matter in motion and when does normal force happen and why. I figure that these questions can be relevant to everyday life as force is happening every day. Such as when we are standing still the gravitational force is acting on us along with the normal force that keeps us from going through the floor. The normal force is a contact force where there requires a contact for it to be applicable. So that means if you are in the air there is no normal force being applied mainly air resistance and gravitational force. You can see that free fall is similar to having if no normal force is happening and that you are going through the floor to the Earth core as the gravitational force would be the main force acting on the object. As with friction most people are moving constantly or moving objects and friction matters. So by knowing when friction is being applied we also need to know when friction is not being applied since people tend to be brave and drive on surfaces that do not have friction or resistance which causes many accidents.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,186,"Walking by a playground, you may often see a see-saw. Often times, you see children playing on the see-saw in groups, as children impatiently climb on either sides while other are playing; sometimes multiple children on both sides. As you walk by you think, where does the children have to sit on the beam to balance, how heavy do they have to be to be in equilibrium?That can be answered by looking at the net torque on both sides of the beam. If we know the weight of the children, we can balance them easily by placing them on certain positions away from the pivot on both sides. If one side has more net torque, that beam will rotate towards that side. Let's look at an example:A child weighing 20 kg sitting 2 meters away from the pivot will be at equilibrium if a child weighing 40 kg sits one meter away from the beam on the opposing side. If we were to add more children, we can easily balance them by using a simple formula utilizing multiplication of the weight times the distance, and setting both the left and the right sides of the balance beam equal."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,179,"I believe this lab to have been extremely entertaining this week, as well as all of the activities performed for this class throughout the semester. Though unfortunately, most activities have been computer simulations, through thought experiments it is possible to better understand how objects would behave in the real world. Among all of the works we have performed so far, I believe that my favorite has been exploring friction and how this alters the movement of objects when compared to a frictionless environment. It is also impressive in its own right that friction is a varying amount relative to the input force and vector force of movement. The information regarding the study of friction between surfaces is crucial to determining the movement of, especially large-scale objects. The lifting and landing of aircrafts, vehicle safety among different weather conditions, and items as simple as how to avoid your cup of coffee from slipping off a slanted tabletop; there are simply too many applications for friction comprehension between objects. "
