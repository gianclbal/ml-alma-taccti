2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,181,"In truth, I feel like online classes have impeded my learning. I understand that professors are being flexible, and trying their best; however, I feel as if the quality is not the same as attending in person class. I feel as if the sense of cohesion and urgency is lost when learning is primarily remote. I get that I, myself, have to be accountable for getting my stuff done as well but it just seemed all more structured and approachable with in class instruction."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,184,"I feel like online classes have impacted my learning a lot both in a good way and in a bad way i feel like. In a good way because its taught me to have more self - discipline and to have a tougher mentality also how to manage my time a-lot better although I still need a-lot of work on that because sometime I just slack off. In a bad way on how I feel like I'm not even learning everything is just being done for the sake of turning in the assignment and I've actually talked to other students about this in my other classes and it's crazy how many agreed with it. Honestly I feel like I never have time for self-care I think the best I've done to have some self-care for myself was getting a good night sleep at-least once a week, because they're always assignments due left and right lol. My concerns for my learning would be that I'm afraid I'm not going to retain any info."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,183,"Ever since we have started doing online class due to the pandemic I have become a lot lazier compared to when I am actually attending class. Since I have more time to plan my day since I would spend most of my day driving from home to school and vice versa. With online classes, I am still somewhat in my summertime schedule. I am not able to sleep until five or six and when I do try to sleep early I can not. So now I have set multiple alarms to help me manage my time a bit better and with the tired state that I am always in I mistake time and dates. So when a professor changes an assignment date from what it was originally I notice it too late as that usually messes up my schedule. For me right now I feel like a machine that is running on a program that follows a schedule set by a person and follows it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,180,"Online class can be easier and more difficult than in-person classes. I have notice that many people do not ask questions in class, so it might be hard for teachers see what their students do not understand. I have been procrastinating a lot more/getting distracted on the internet and my internet is sometimes not stable resulting in lots of static and pauses. Some upsides are that teachers usually upload recorded videos on ilearn, so it is easier to review what we learned in class. Some selfcare I have been doing are going outside for 30 mins for sunlight(usually to my backyard). "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,188,"While online learning has the benefit of using recorded lectures that can be viewed at any time, I find the lack of human interaction to be draining.  Perhaps it would different if I had more people around me at home, but I don't.  In addition, online learning makes taking notes seem unnecessary; I remedy this by pushing myself to takes notes anyway.  In addition, I'm also gaining weight since I'm not getting enough exercise.  I try to go on walks in the park, but the lack of human interaction remains the most significant drawback.  Furthermore, I don't have a separate work space away from my bedroom, and so it's difficult to get myself into a work mood.  Finally, questions from students are not as forthcoming in an online format.  I lot can be learned from clarification, but students may be less likely to type their questions or say them over the microphone."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,195,"We are all doing online classes now and we can say that online classes have their own advantages that traditional classes do not have. The first thing is, it is easy to record online classes so that I can review them later. Compared with traditional classes, if you missed the class, then you will find It really hard to catch up with the course material unless you brought the camera to the classroom and record the course. The second thing that I feel about online classes is that I can be less shy in the course. This might because I am at home so that I feel more comfortable with what I am doing. I will be willing to ask more questions in online classes. But the downsides of studying at home is that you need to be good at time management. I forgot to join some of my online classes a few times because you do not keep track of time when you are home. One thing I do to solve this is to set a timer to remind me that there will be a class in 2 hours. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,189,"I thought classes would deem easier for me online. However, I have found that I am currently struggling more than I would've thought. I feel bad sometimes for complaining but I truly am having a harder time than I would've. I found that organizing work and school was harder during this season. I've been laid off multiple times due to the pandemic and it's really putting stress on me. I am constantly searching for jobs  on my free time and I've seen that it has had a negative outturn on my assignments and classwork. My sleeping schedule is literally non existent currently because somedays I end up not sleeping. Previously, I've never had such a problem as this however, it started to arise more frequently now. The housing market in San Fran is extremely overpriced and honestly I am looking forward to the crash of the housing market in California because San Fran living is expensive and absurd. I am glad rent prices are currently going down."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,191,"Covid has been a real struggle for me due to the nature of having to move back home. I don't do well when I have to be around people I don't choose to, and that has taken a real toll. Especially when it's my parents. I want to move out, but I'm kind of scared because I don't feel like I have friends since covid. I haven't been talking to that many people, just a few old friends because I'm living in my hometown. Any friend I made in SF I simply don't talk to because we have nothing to talk about really. We're living different lives again. It sucks. I've been keeping up in this class just fine but I'm pretty behind in 2 others. Working on that tho. This isn't formal so I just used 'tho'. Is that okay? I told myself I wouldn't use the backspace key on this reflection so here we are I guess. Is this 300 words? iLearn doesn't tell me until after I submit it. There's no way it's 300. My guess is 210. Anyway, have a good day. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,193,"Online learning is somewhat of a mixed bag. Generally, online learning by itself is worse than in-person. However, I do benefit from not having to commute to school. I can attend class in my bedroom. I can eat lunch instead of starving if I have a class at noon. The greatest upside to online learning has been the efforts by considerate instructors. Many instructors understand that the pandemic is making learning more difficult so they have made some aspects of their classes easier. For example, one of my instructors changed all his exams to take-home exams. The students correct their own exam and the students don’t have to worry about getting the right answer. For self-care, I am relaxing once a week. I need a break so that my home doesn’t feel like a workplace. My concerns are primarily career based. I am worried about not having an internship for summer 2021. I am worried about not having a strong resume when I graduate from college."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,194,The impact of online learning was something I found very challenging at first although after a while I did end up getting accustomed to the idea of learning online although the idea is still scary it is an adaptation I must make in order to succeed in my endeavors to obtain my degree. Although one thing I can say did help as far as online learning goes is the self practice I was almost forced to do because of the fact that online learning is not nearly as interactive when coming to a in person although it did show me to not rely completely on my professors and other students to work on assignments and improved my study skills which I am thankful for. Some concerns I have for my learning situations are the availability of the professors and how the students can attend class if not given the proper resources and how they can participate during those classes although I really don't think it is very hard not everyone is in the same situation given the circumstances.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,187,"Due to covid-19 online classes have gained immense fame and provide advantage for most of the student and as well the universities, form my perception the online classes help me to have my flexibility and autonomy that I have for my studies thought its taking a lot of my time coz its totally depend on the student to be prepared.  The online classes had increased my motivation and self-discipline since   the course are sets goals, deadlines and track your progresses and always can reach your instructor through one in one meeting or emails to ask question regarding our concerned topics. But I miss the advantage the a classroom provide to us, a class structure, direct support from mentors and teacher in concerned topics, and a reward and penalties that enable us to groom and interact with each other physical and build up link and relation with professional student and others for future supports in term of finding jobs and informed from the existing opportunities. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,190,"There has definitely been a lack of motivation. With everything online, I just feel like the things that we're learning just aren't sticking like it would with a traditional class setting. I hear what is being said and I know what professors want the students to do, but that's really about it. It's where assignments aren't being completed because I know what is being taught. The assignments are being completed just because they need to be completed, which I know isn't a good thing, but this kind of learning doesn't help either. I have only really been pushing through just to get this semester over with and I know I can do better, but I just think it's not worth it if I can't learn anything from most of my lectures. It has definitely been tough and, if it keeps being this way in the future, I'm not sure what I'd do."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,179,"Online classes have definitely tested my ability to cope and make myself personally accountable for submitting all of my work on time, and it has been a fun challenge, to say the least. For some occasions, I have been able to, and for others, I have not for various circumstances, but this adaptive process has been useful for me to learn and grow as a person; particularly, to identify my weak aspects as a character and how to improve them. As for Physics Lab specific questions, I have been entertained with the types of experiments being performed, as these are easily done through computer simulations or with around-the-house items. Having this degree of accessibility is most useful, especially for those students taking a lot of coursework. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,186,"I feel that I speak for most when I say that school feels very optional right now. This isn’t my first year of college and although I have taken a lot of online classes prior to this semester, with the pandemic, I have been uncharacteristically forgetful of due dates and my usual study habits. We are maybe week 8 or 9 right now so personally I feel that I have finally gotten a good grasp on what works for me and that is:1. Studying at night when everyone is asleep.2. Taking advantage of this class by turning things that I missed early on in the semester and keeping good pace in the class by sticking around after the instruction part of the zoom call is over. 3. Communicating with professor about any and all issue instead of feeling intimidated."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,12,192,"I have been on a quarter term system for the past few years of my student career, so even transferring to San Francisco State and taking classes here had an impact on my learning. It's a lot slower paced, which I enjoy. I don't have to frantically think about the next midterm as one ends for a class and I have a lot of time in between classes. Learning online I have done before at my previous school, and it never went really well. Now I think I've matured enough to manage my time better with online classes. To take care of myself during this time, I just stay indoors the whole day. It’s boring but it gives me time to study, do homework, and play games. My concerns for learning are on an internship for the upcoming summer, my GPA, and my current classes. Since they all connect kind of, I’m just focusing on my classes at the moment. It helps using a calendar to never be late to things, even though I’m still late to things."
