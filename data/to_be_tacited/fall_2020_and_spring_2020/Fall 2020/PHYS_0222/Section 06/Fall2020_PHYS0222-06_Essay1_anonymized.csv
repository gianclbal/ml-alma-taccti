Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,150,"There are a couple of reasons why I want to go into the STEM field. One of the main reasons is that I am heavily influenced by my role models. My dad, two aunts, and uncle are all civil engineers and I have been to work with all of them and visited project sites, so I knew I would enjoy what I'd be doing. I also really like and enjoy doing math, therefore I wanted to choose a major which included this subject. I really enjoy drawing, so I think Drafting plans in Engineering is something that I'd enjoy doing. One thing that motivates me to also get a STEM degree is knowing that I am a double minority in this field, since I am both a woman and a person of color. Therefore, this is really motivating me to get my degree, and help break these statistical boundaries. Lastly, of course most people who work in the stem field get a reasonable salary, which is something that is important in my eyes."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,151,"I want to go into a STEM field, computer science specifically, because technology interests me. It’s not easy for me to understand a lot of scientific and mathematical concepts, but they’re still super interesting to pick apart and it feels like I’m solving a puzzle. My whole life I was convinced that I’m “bad at math”, but I’m so stubborn that I kind of just decided that I’m gonna do it whether or not I’m good at it, because I enjoy it. I realized after taking discrete math that logic comes much more naturally to me than other types of math I’ve studied--logic gates, knights and knaves, and Eulerian paths all made a lot of sense to me.I’ve worked a couple places doing STEM education, especially programs for young girls, because I never really believed that I could be capable or competent in any STEM field. Did you know that the only STEM field to see a decrease in women in the last 30 years was computer science? And sitting in my CS classes where I see one other single woman, it starts to become more obvious. It’s important to me that the next generation realizes that careers have no gender and just because you’re not a prodigy doesn’t mean you can’t pursue science!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,152,"I am majoring in computer science. I want to go into a STEM field because I think  STEM is interesting and can lead to real change. When I think about things that have changed human lives and made standards of living go up, I think of inventors and scientists. I don’t have much faith in politics or world rulers and certainly don’t see anyone in politics making real change that makes people’s lives better. Instead, I see change come with technology. Only a few years ago almost everyone had begun carrying a smartphone with them. Our communal understanding of our world has changed because of it. Imagine the Black Lives Matter movement couldn’t kick off if enough people didn’t have social media presence to fuel it and share their personal and systematic experiences of racism. If the people didn’t have smartphones or other technologies at hand, they would have an even harder time spreading information. That’s just one example of how I think technology can change the world. I want to enable people with important information to be able to share it with those who need to hear it. And that’s only one of the many aspects of STEM that makes me want to pursue it."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,153,"I am currently a CS Major, which has been my plan ever since I started applying to colleges out of high school. There is definitely the cultural factor; it is often encouraged in the Indian community for children to pursue stem fields, particularly engineering and medicine. In addition to this, STEM fields often lead to lucrative careers that have a good amount of job security. For my particular field of computer science, jobs are in high demand in the bay area as well which serves as a big advantage. Lastly, I have always had an affinity for computers from a young age, which is what lead to my choice of this major. I am quite passionate about the field, and there is definitely something satisfying about creating things through programming that drew me in."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,154,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field?I think that going into the STEM field and making breakthroughs in science can help a lot of people. Because of breakthroughs in the past we have eliminated lots of diseases like smallpox and polio, diseases that have decimated millions in the past can now be eliminated with a shot. Making breakthroughs in STEM doesn’t just saves lives, it can improve the quality of life of many people making mundane tasks that took a long time into something trivial whether it be computers that do millions of computations per second or even new technology that can optimize the use of farm land to grow more food and lowered the price of food for others.I want to go into the STEM field to help people and improve their quality of life. However that’s not the only reason I wanted to go into STEM. Another big reason I want to go into STEM is to solve life’s great mysteries. I know it will be impossible to learn everything, but I am curious about how things in our world works. I want to know the whats, whys, and what ifs. I want to know what’s inside of a black hole, why our universe is so vast, and what if there are other intelligent life besides humans. I have a curiosity that I want satiated. I know we might not even find the answers to those questions in my lifetime and maybe in hundred of life times, but we have to start somewhere. We can’t just wait and hope that someone someday will solve those mysteries for us. STEM is a culmination of all the past research efforts. If Newton didn’t invent calculus we might not have Einstein’s theory of relativity. STEM research is a collective effort that builds on top of each other. If everyone waited for the answer to be given to them, then humans would never advance beyond the stone age. I want to go into STEM to do my part, to add to the collective knowledge, so future generations can use that knowledge to solve the mysteries of life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,155,"The reason why I want to go into stem is because I am in love with science and the world around me. I was always drawn towards sciences throughout my former schooling. I especially love life sciences and marine biology. I have always wanted to pursue some sort of career in either botany or astronomy. Later on in my life after high school, I realized that I had quite an obsession with space and stars, and the galaxies, and materials that make up this universe. I became truly inspired after watching the movie retelling of Stephen Hawking's Life: The theory of everything. The excitement of science keeps me engaged and it satisfies my curiosity in a way that plain mathematics does not. Some day when I graduate I hope to work at NASA, charting stars and galaxies and discovering the secrets of the universe. I also feel compelled to diversify the field of science with more women, since it is predominantly men."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,156,"I have decided to go into the STEM field because I have always wanted to be an engineer. I loved math growing up and that helped as a deciding factor. I have always wanted to major as engineer, but I was unsure what type of engineering I would pursue. I loved building things which made me decide civil engineering, but I always enjoyed working with cars since my dad worked and built cars when I was a kid. Even in school, I tried to be involved with STEM related activities because it had always interested me. Working with cars specifically made me decide to switch to mechanical engineering and pursue that as a career goal. The STEM field has many opportunities for people to choose from and it wasn't difficult finding what to to do. Being in STEM requires a lot of hard work and dedication, that's why I wanted to pursue engineering, I enjoy the challenge."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,157,I wanted to get into the STEM field because I wanted to work towards my dream job. I want to become a game developer and the best way of doing in my opinion was to get into the STEM field. I needed to get a degree within computer science to make myself more competitive for applying for any job in the industry. At the same time I would improve my foundation of the work that I would have to do in the future. I want to join this field and create brand new works that others would enjoy and discuss about. I wanted to be able to have a product that I put a lot of effort into and be proud of at the end of the day. I wanted to learn more about the things and enjoyed and how people were able to design the mechanics of a game.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,158,"I want to go into the STEM field because math and science are two subjects that look the most interesting to me. Math because I’m just at least good in solving math problems and using equations and science because it has interesting topics such as electricity for example. I chose to major in computer science because I love computers and also, I’m interested in technology. And not just that I just also wanted to get an interesting job that is based on tech ( or maybe a job that is not based on computer science, but at least interesting)."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,159,"Deciding to be an engineer is something that I have always struggled with. Originally I wanted to be a computer scientist/ coder and learn how to hack, but after realizing that coding wasn’t for me I drifted apart from that idea because it ended up not working for me. During the summer of 2018 I began to have some interest in being an engineer. During that summer I participated in multiple engineering internships where we learned how to build, design, and create little projects that used Arduino's. That was when I figured out that I wanted to be an engineer. I learned that engineering mostly focussed on problem solving and creating products and tools to help solve those problems. I have been doing this ever since I was young; building, creating, and mapping out ideas of invention models on paper. This aspect of engineering has been in my early age without me even knowing it, and I naturally drifted to that desired discipline unconsciously."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,160,"Weimin ChenPHYS 2229/10/2020Reflection #1 Why do I want to go into the STEM field?STEM stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The STEM field is very important because STEM is by my side. Many things you see live in STEM. I want to enter STEM because the income of the STEM profession is higher than in other normal professions. This is still growing in the United States. I want to become a computer programmer and join computer science because it will be important in the future. As time goes by, computer technology and engineering will become faster and faster. STEM careers have a lot of work to do. Many people now have a STEM education and careers. Every year, new technologies create unprecedented job opportunities. I am very interested in this field. There are many different potential jobs to do. A STEM degree can provide me with the hard skills required for recruitment, as well as the flexibility that is important to me to adapt and pursue."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,161,"Why did I choose the stem field? Well, first and foremost I need to go into the stem field because I am a Mechanical engineering major. I have to pass these other classes or else I will not be able to move on with my major courses. I also think that the things I learn in these classes might come in handy later on in my job field. All the stem classes are closely connected and they intertwine with one another. In order to pass one, you need a little knowledge from all the other courses from stem. Plus stem is also in a majority of the jobs we see today, and many of the high paying jobs are in this field. The stem field is usually challenging and I love to challenge my self when it comes to learning new things. This is the majority of the reason I choose to go into the stem field."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,162,"I want to go into the STEM field because I feel that there’s a lot of creativity and innovation. There are many things to explore, create, and build. In a particular, I am interested in software engineering or game development because I like building things with code and I feel that it is something I enjoy doing. A famous quote I heard is that if you enjoy what you do, you will never work a day in your life. A great benefit of working in the STEM field is that there isn’t a worry about whether I can find a job or not in the future because there are so many job opportunities available in this field and more opportunities are constantly added. Data shows that industry growth has a large increase. Another benefit is that many companies offer a higher salary than other fields,  medical benefits, and compensation for food and transportation."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,163,"I want to go into the STEM field (specifically Computer Science) so I can pursue software development. I’ve always been interested in computers since I was a kid, and I currently love doing mobile app development as a hobby (and hopefully one day a career or job!). Going to school to get a degree and learning the skills necessary to work any related job is what will most likely set me on the path to do what I want in life. I also want to go into the STEM field because of how diverse the work can be. Currently I’m interested in mobile app development, but if that interest ever changes then I’ll have a lot of skills still applicable to other types of work within the STEM field (at least, other types of programming work). The STEM field also seems like the type of field where I’ll always be learning, so hopefully it will be a fulfilling career path as well."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,164,"Just as a basis for information, I am currently a CS major and intend to continue through. But initially when I started, I had wanted to be a doctor, more specifically a pediatrician, but that was only because I had gotten sick a few too many times and had to visit my doctor. After a few visits, I grew a respect for the knowledge that he had and part of me wanted to also be able to diagnose certain common illnesses and whatnot but then of course other things had to happen. My brother who was currently in school for physical therapy said it was not worth the time/money to go through the whole program as there were other jobs that paid just as well if not more. Since I was indecisive, I decided to try CS because I was told to by others. Initially I hated it because I was dumped into the ocean with no idea how to even stay afloat. That left a bad taste so I went back to biology but again, I was told otherwise and have given CS another try but at the more basic level, however my cc teacher didn’t leave a good impression as he was a pretty shit teacher and everyone who had him agreed. So now I’m here hoping teachers are better."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,165,"I want to go into the STEM field because Engineering has been my passion since I began high school. In high school, I was apart of the engineering academy all 4 years. In those 4 years, I learned a lot about what engineers do and the many innovative accomplishments that have been made because of engineering. As the years went by I learned of the different types of engineering and realized in my senior year I wanted to become a civil engineer. In my freshman year of college, I started researching and eventually interviewed a civil engineer and it reinforced in my brain that this is what I want to become, it fascinates me and I feel like I will be happy in this field of work for the rest of my life. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,166,"Well, I didn't necessarily want to go into STEM. Actually, I chose to become a Computer Science major because I want to go into game design, though I'm not sure if I even want to do that anymore. Now, I just want a steady income I can support myself and my partner on. I'm only taking this class because I have to for my major- Physics is actually my least favorite part of science. I prefer biology and chemistry. And, I don't see my occupation as my purpose. My purpose, my dreams, and ambitions lie beyond the realm of academia. My purpose is to brighten the lives of others. Yes, I am here, getting a degree because that's what my family and society expects of me and I know it's something I have to do, but there is so much more life than a career and academics. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,167,"My major is mechanical engineering and the reasons I chose that major and to be in the STEM field ultimately goes down to what I learned to like and dislike in my time in high school. Like mostly everyone, when I started high school, I had no plan for education after high school and beyond. Originally, I did not think I would be in the STEM field because I hated math and science in middle school, but after a series of inspiring teachers in high school that taught me to think about things from a different perspective, I grew to enjoy math. Eventually, I learned that math is a powerful tool to solve problems based on numerical logic derived from simpler problems. In other words, I enjoy math because it is usually logic-based and relatively intuitive which is exactly why I learned to dislike the other fields like arts and humanities. Topics within philosophy, art, and history, for example, can have an infinite amount of right answers and many ways to interpret concepts which are almost never clear-cut. As to why I chose mechanical engineering specifically, it is a great combination of building things (which I love doing) and math and science skills. To conclude, the more I improved and started to enjoy math and science, the more I learned to dislike the things that are opposite to them."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,168,"The question is why do I want to get into the stem field. Ironically, I ask myself this question about once a week when I find myself struggling on courses that are required for my major. Personally, I’m doing civil engineering with a focus on transportation, and I got into the stem field personally for hopes of financial success coming with the degree and due to my fondness of engineering in general. Like most students who are in college the big goal of earning a degree is to give themselves the opportunity to advance in society in contributing to what they are researching or studying and to give themselves the chance to get a better paying job. For me part of being in the stem field is for the financial opportunities that I would be opening for myself because the reality is money is a big part of our lives if we like it or not. Thankfully structures and the way thing were made struck my interest into engineering growing up and when it came time to decide my major and focus I went with transportation in hopes of solving the terrible bay area traffic that I experience on a day to day basis. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,169,"The main reason I want to continue going into the STEM field is because I think the future of our world depends on it. The technology industry is easily the most needed/important field our world is relying on now. The future of technology is very bright and I can see it continuing to evolve as time goes on. My major is computer science and once graduating, I want hope to find a job with a big tech company. Afterwards, I want to branch out on my own or with others to create a new mobile app."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,170,the reason for me was pretty simple my dad was a welder and I wanted to do something in that realm but i didn't like the labor I was kinda smart so I knew if I put my mind to something I would be able to get any kind of degree I wanted so then i chose the thing i considered above a laborer witch is the person who designed the thing and then i chose mechanical just because it interested me more then any other major so now I'm here
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,171,"For the longest time, I've found subjects relating to math to be the easiest to me. Subjects like English I'm okay at, but I've just found myself more comfortable in STEM classes. I took both CP and AP Physics in high school and absolutely loved it. My teacher did a really good job of explaining topics in a way I could understand, and it led to me seeing physics around me on a daily basis, sometimes without even looking for it. Relating more to my Computer Science major, I really enjoyed both Intro and AP Comp Sci classes. Being given an objective and figuring out how to program it felt a lot like solving a puzzle to me, with the pieces being bits of code I had learned. STEM courses help explain so much of the world around us that I'm constantly amazed- it's those mind-blowing moments that really cemented my love for stem."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,172,"I want to go into the STEM field because of the amount of interesting jobs in STEM and the pay you can potentially get. This is the reason I chose to be a computer science major. The field seemed interesting in high school when I took my first programming class and the pay for new programmers seemed pretty good. The STEM field certainly is challenging and I dislike how challenging it is, but getting through will prove that I am prepared for the future. A lot of people who start out in the STEM field drop out because they realize how difficult it actually is and that it requires hard work and dedication. I am also slowly starting to realize how difficult the work is going to get as I progress through my classes, but no matter how hard it gets, I want to succeed in computer science so I can have a better future. Being able to get a good job in programming and making good money to repay my parents for all the help they have given me growing up is my reason for going into the STEM field. I hope I can make it through so I can fulfill this dream."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0222,--,6,173,"The reason I chose to go into the STEM field is because I have always liked learning. That is just one of the many reasons. I have always found the world fascinating and became very curious about how we got here, where did we come from, etc. Growing up I wanted to be in the STEM field. I loved chemistry and engineering and especially the cosmos. In middle school, I wanted to be a Marine Biologist and help sea creatures have better care in zoos or aquariums. In high school I became mesmerized by the cosmos and that is when I decided to achieve a degree in astrophysics. I love space and have grown to love physics as well. My career goal is to work at NASA. Maybe interning while I continue to earn a doctorate and study engineering. I want to be at the front lines of space exploration (it is my passion)."
