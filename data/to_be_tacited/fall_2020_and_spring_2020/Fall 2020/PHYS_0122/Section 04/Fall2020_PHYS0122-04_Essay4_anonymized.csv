2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,91,"""What strategies can I put in place to keep me focused through the end of the semester?""I make a detailed schedule with specific time slots for my daily activities to keep me on track. I currently have a google sheet that lists out my plans for the week and it really helps me stay on track. I never have to worry about what activity is upcoming because I already have it planned out. I have been doing this since the beginning of school and it has helped tremendously. I will always refer back to it before making other plans or committing to certain activities. Another strategy I might put in place is getting to sleep earlier. Sleep is very important to brain development and right now I am not getting enough sleep. As a result, I am tired during the day and not as focused in all my classes. If I get a better night's sleep I will be able to pay attention and be more productive throughout my day. I am also happier and less irritable when I am not tired. Once I get my sleep schedule on track, I am going to try and not drink coffee every morning. Right now, I have it every day and I do not want to become reliant on it. This is more of a health thing than a strategy to keep me focused. The last strategy I will use it to write more consistently in my planner. This will prevent me from forgetting assignments and help me plan for future tests and midterms.¬†"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,97,"Something I do to keep myself focused for being trapped all day indoors is going out for a drive. My sister works from home most of the week but for two days of the week she has to work on site in San Jose. So I go and pick her up from work since she does not drive and I realize this helps me to go out and allows me to get a breather from being stuck at home all day. Another thing that helps me keep track is adding the dates of when things are due onto my phone. The problem though with that is that sometimes I miss out on things that are due and I forget to due them. A major thing that has actually helped me out is that I am able to sit outside in my backyard or front yard and simply admire the flowers and the sound of birds while being in a shaded area. I tried to go to lectures in the backyard (online of course) sometimes as well, but the sun is too bright and I cannot see the screen, so I don't do that anymore."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,94,"Something I always think about to keep me focused through this semester of Zoom University is that I'm still paying a buttload of money despite not being on campus aside from doing my research stuff. I mean this might be a slight rant but seriously, paying full tuition for school despite it being online? It is not easy, especially when some of us are not home studiers because we get too comfortable or our families need us to do something and we get caught up in that instead of class. Some classes like Digel's lecture asked for us to do group work on the practice midterm but I don't know a single person even after asking in your lab lecture if anyone would like to study together. So in a way, the thing that is keeping me focused this semester is the way some professors are expecting us to learn despite not giving any leeway despite they themselves be new to zoom too."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,81,"I cannot do more than I am doing now. My plan is to keep pushing through and do what needs to be done. We are all suffering and nothing is changing. I don't have 150-200 words to write about this topic. I hope things get better after flu season but the worst is yet to come, starting in a week or two. I cannot stay positive and I am not negative. I am just focusing on finishing this semester so I can graduate."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,84,"By setting small goals each week, it can help me stay on top of my school schedule. It can also help prioritize any tasks that need to be done first that require more time to complete. What I struggle with the most is constantly being on social media. One way I can limit this distraction is leaving my phone in a different room that way I am not tempted to check it as much if it was on my desk next to me. With virtual learning, it is harder to connect with classmates and form study groups. I do have a study partner that I have for another class and although we only text or FaceTime to help each other out, it has been very useful to do. Outside of school work, I work a part time job and workout 5x's a week which help me clear my mind and get out of the house for a bit. I also try not to be so hard on myself given the fact we are living in the middle of a pandemic. Positive self affirmations are part of my morning routine.¬†"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,96,Some strategies I can put to keep me focused in class through the end of the semester is having a plan for the day. I noticed that this is an effective way to get things done and not waste time with deciding on what I should work with first as it takes up time. The closer the due date then the more priority I give it however if it's a big assignment then I try doing a little of that each day to have some progress when I start it. Another strategy is thinking why I need to do this which leads to me knowing that I have to push myself in order to get to my goals. My main goal is to graduate on time as well as get into the medical school I desire. It does become stressful but then I think to myself that I am thinking about all the things I have to get done in order to get there and I should just focus on where I am now and what I need to get done so I can move forward to the next step.¬†
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,83,"Being cooped up at home has made it challenging for me to keep focus on assignments and hold motivation. It definitely helps that I work at a job that I really like, so I'm able to get out of the house (carefully), but I've found that strict scheduling works best for me. If I make time blocks for myself, then I know for certain when I'm done for the day. Also, getting outside to go on walks (and look at birds¬†üòÅ) has been really helpful to me, and clears my head. I hate being cooped up inside all day, so its really important to me that I take time to myself to go on walks and enjoy the outdoors. I also find it really important to be forgiving to myself, because even though I try and keep a tight schedule, things can be messed up because we're in a pandemic so what the hell. Something else that helps me is the fact that I like all of my classes; they're all really interesting to me and they keep me engaged. I am a little worried for next semester, because I have to get some classes out of the way that I'm not too excited about."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,90,"The past couple of weeks have truly shaken me up, dealing with school, mental health and now upcoming financial issues with SF's second shut down, i feel overwelmed, but i will focus on what i can do the remander of the semester to possibly improve my final grades.¬†  ¬†    Attend and      Participate fully in class. This will support my learning by actively      engaging and asking questions.  Create a      tight schedule- write down every finals update as soon as it is posted  Keep up on      emails- by staying in touch via the internet, i will be able to be on top      of any important information regarding the class  Attend      Office Hours - by going, i will be able to clear up any unclear topics or questions.¬†  Log off & Study More -      getting¬† back on my¬† studying schedule by turning off my telephone will help me fully      comprehend the material"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,100,"Last semester when the campus closed it was really hard for everyone because the reason why it closed was due to Covid-19. It has been a tough year for the world and millions of people have died due to COVID-19. Everything is still so surreal to me and although it is still scary I feel like I can manage it better than in the beginning. Before campus closed I was scared of life to get COVID-19 since there are so many people on campus and I was glad they closed it. It was hard transitioning to online classes for many reasons such as not having access to a laptop and or wifi, having too many siblings and not having enough room/space, and not having anywhere to live (for the students who live on campus). I personally struggled with having access to wifi and not having space at home to do my work. The strategies I‚Äôve been using are working with what I have and making the best of it and looking at the positive side of it. I live by this phrase ‚Äúcontrol the controllable‚Äù.¬†"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,82,Some strategies that I can put in place to keep me focused through the end of the semester would be pushing myself to do more homework.¬† To not let myself procrastinate or give up at all during these rough times. To make sure that I keep my time management and continue to plan things ahead and not let anything get in the way. To also be clear with the things that I have to do and plan all the due dates. Also to make sure that I take care of myself and do some me time once in a while and not always be on my laptop doing homework 24/7.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,99,"""What strategies can I put in place to keep me focused through the end of the semester?""I think having deadlines is incredibly important for me to keep focused. I am a big time procrastinator, so if I do not have a deadline, and I am not being held accountable, I will not do the work. This is why having a big quiz, lab, etc. due once a week is perfect for me. A big deadline will push me to complete everything and stay on task. In addition to this, I find that attending the live zoom meeting on wednesday mornings is important to keep me invested in the class. For one of my classes, we never have a synchronous lecture, and so it does not motivate me to participate. I really like the kahoots, I think it brings back the fun parts of school. For me the big struggle is studying for the mcat. Between work, school, keeping myself healthy, and keeping up with friends, it is hard for me to motivate myself to find time to study for the mcat. I think having a specific day dedicated to a subject is great for me to stay focused. Tuesday I will study organic chemistry, Wednesday I will study physics, and Thursday/Friday I will do physics lab. Sat and Sun I will do mcat studying. That leaves Monday for me to just focus on work and myself."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,89,"I am struggling with motivation as well. I know I need to stay on track and not procrastinate but it is so hard with remote learning.¬† I have been behind in my classes and rushing to do all my assignments and it really is showing in my grades. one new strategy I have is setting a time to do homework almost every day, even if I do not have anything due that day or the next it is good to start things ahead of time. By setting this time aside will ensure that I get my work at least somewhat done and that I don't skip out on doing homework for a few days and become unproductive.¬† Another strategy would be to keep better track of lectures because that is where I am becoming very behind and it stresses me out when the test comes because I watch the lectures instead of practicing.¬† ¬† ¬†"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,88,some strategies that I can put together that will help me stay focused until the end of the semester is that I can make sure to make sure that I am in an environment that promotes me focusing and an environment that gives me focus rather than an environment¬†that is actually causing me to be distracted. Another thing is to learn where I can go to change up my setting. It is important to do this because my brain has already adapted and learned tat my bedroom means sleep and relaxation and when doing school here my brain is still on the same setting and this does not allow for me to do the best that I can. So in saying this it is important to find a location that it dedicated for school. For example I have found a Starbucks 5 minutes from my house that has outside seating and has a perfect secluded spot that is perfect for school work.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,87,"For the rest of the semester, I feel like I need to keep track of the assignments due.¬† So maybe be more on top of homework and creating time for it because it seems I find out assignments are due last minute. I wouldn't say it is a strategy but actually waking up on time for classes to stay on top of lecture material, my sleep schedule hasn't been the best lately.¬†The last few weeks feel like they have flown by especially with all the exams/midterms every week and they all blend together for me so it feels like school has been continuous for a while now. I just need to held myself accountable and find a balance between work, school and having a break so I don't feel as worn out which can be hard especially when everything seems to happen within the same space."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,98,Help by putting reminders on the phone to remember to do things for school. talking to someone can be helpful in keeping focus or remembering what was the purpose of taking classes this semester. Find videos online to help understand the subject better.¬†
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,92,"If I'm being honest, the only strategy I have is that I want to completely drop out. This isn't a joke too, with knowing that classes are going to be online next semester, it's just way too overwhelming. Online learning has proven to be way more stressful than I ever thought it would be, I am behind in almost every class because I keep misunderstanding when things are due or I just completely miss something because the teacher expects us to just know when assignments are posted. I miss being in class and being able to work on stuff there and know exactly what is happening. My strategy is to give the semester my all and if I fail any classes, I'm just going to dip because I can't spending another semester in college, it's caused a major point of depression in my life. College has made me feel like a failure and that's it, I'm supposed to be graduating next semester but we'll see. It just really sucks."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,85,"This semester was tough because online learning creates a lot of temptations. During class time, I might want to wander and go on other websites rather than listen to class. Also spending hours on the computer causes headaches and most of the time I feel like my eyes are very tired. I have tried to stay as organized as possible because once you get off track, it's very difficult to get back on. Staying motivated is so difficult because when you're home, there could be distractions. Personally, my family has been a distraction. They think that just because I'm home, I'm not doing the same amount of work as if I were in school. They are also quite loud which is irritating. With the end of the semester approaching, I need to sort out all my assignments to make sure I finish them in a timely manner. Procrastinating will make all the work just pile up and cause stress. The best thing to do is get organized and make sure I give myself enough time to work through everything so I don't rush and do the best I can. This is my last semester so my motivation is knowing that when I am done with class, I'm done with school.¬†"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,93,"Being stuck at home with most quiet places that I would usually go to study outside of home, like libraries and indoor seating at coffee shops now closed, I find it really hard to find a place to study. What I've been doing to stay motivated is talking and Facetiming with my friends while we do our homework to keep each other accountable. Also, as a competitive person, I like to set time limits for myself that are manageable and try to get as much of my studying done in that time. The recurring deadlines that professors have set are also helpful instead of everything being asynchronous is helpful too. I know for example, I have time to stay focused on Wednesdays during lab to finish my physics lab, but if something urgent comes, I can still find time to focus on Thursday or the final deadline on Friday."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,86,"In all honesty, I need to start using my planner more. The past few weeks I have definitely started to slip up on schoolwork and just attending classes is difficult. I think putting my phone away and closing tabs on my computer unrelated to class would help me focus tremendously. Also cleaning my area up a little bit because the cleaner and neater my area stays, the more productive I am.¬†"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,101,"There are a lot of things I can think of, but I‚Äôm not doing it because I‚Äôm lazy. I believe I need to change my mental state before implementing helpful things. I‚Äôm always in my bed when I do homework, so I want to rest or sleep. To change that, I should go to my car (where it‚Äôs quiet) or get a desk where I can sit up straight. Also, it would be helpful to listen to music. I saw this thing on Tik Tok where if you listen to Mario Kart music, it will help you do assignments at a faster speed. I haven‚Äôt tried that yet, but I will when I‚Äôm stressed out. It‚Äôs also a good idea to take breaks after completing assignments so I won‚Äôt be overwhelmed all the time. Although it will be difficult to avoid taking long breaks, I can put a timer on my phone to help me. There are bunch of small little things I can do to stay focused, but I believe changing the mentality is most important.¬†"
