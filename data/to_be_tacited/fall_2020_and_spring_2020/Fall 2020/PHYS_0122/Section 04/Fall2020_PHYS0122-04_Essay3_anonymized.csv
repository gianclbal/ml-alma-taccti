2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,91,"How does a closed circuit vs an open circuit work? A closed-circuit will allow current to run through the system, while an open system breaks this flow. We learned this in our unit about circuit and electricity. This is important to my everyday life because it can keep me out of dangerous situations.  A flowing current can electrocute someone if you are what closes the circuit. This is dangerous, and having common knowledge about the subject can prevent disasters. For example, I can start a car safely without electrocuting myself or hurting others. I also know how to go about using appliances in my kitchen with the wall sockets and I understand how they work. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,85,"This is difficult because I have a difficult understanding anything that has to do with physics so it's hard to come up with a question since everything is a question. I'm still not sure about the difference between voltage and current. Voltage is different from current and is also different from power. There is high current which is when a lot of charge passes in a certain period of time. Low current is when you have a little charge passing in a period of time. However, current doesn't have speed. Current is the flow of charge. To maintain current, there is a difference in voltage between the ends of wire. Voltage is the potential difference force between two points in an electrical field which caused current to flow in the circuit. It's good to know how this works because we use electric appliances all the time. This gives us information that can potentially help if there are wiring issues or if no current for a particular plug in the house."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,96,"A concept that was covered in class was electrostatics. When do charges attract and repel each other and why? The differences in electric charge attract each other, therefore the opposites attract and the same likes repel each other. The charge is because of the number protons and electrons.  From my understanding, any charged object is either positively charged or negatively charged and they will have an attractive interaction with a neutral object. Positively charged objects and neutral objects attract each other, and negatively charged objects and neutral objects repel each other. This is evidence on the pieces of tape we did in lab. I know this can be very useful because knowing electrostatics, improves efficiency and it involves electricity and it is important because it helps make our lives easier. Understanding it can help solve a lot of things in our house or anywhere we go. It can also develop our ideas in creations. Electricity is all around us and we use it everyday and rely on it. It is in lighting and technology and it is also our source of entertainment. In electrostatics, we develop the concept of an electric field surrounding charges. Examples with this is being near a plane and having electric potential and voltage "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,95,"I've been a lot more mindful of currents and how electricity works. I never notices just how awesome something that is so accessible to me is so interesting to learn about. How currents actually work and they don't just slow down or go faster it's a flow of electrons going pass inductors. And there's insulators like rubber as well. I find it all to be neat and get to experiment with fake lightbulbs online though the labs I find it to be a blast to sound like a complete nerd I guess. Definitely one of the fun labs, but I should set my alarm more often for this class since i swore i did and i always end up sleeping through it. i hope i got 200 words i was eating breakfast "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,88,"The topic I would like to discuss that we have covered in the past couple of weeks is the topic of electricity and current/voltage. Specifically I want to talk about circuits. Circuits have been an interesting topic to me and I have found how they work to actually be very fascinating. It was really cool to be able to learn and find out that circuits actually come in two different ways, which are either parallel circuits or series circuits. Now the difference that I understand to be the difference between these two are that the series circuits actually all share the same current but with the parallel circuits these are actually different in the way that with parallel circuits are lined up and set up they actually each have their own current and do not share current. This can actually relate to the electricity that we have in our home. In our homes we can imagine our house to be one big group of circuits and each room that you can see that has its own circuit breaker is a circuit, each one of the outlets in that room is a resistor and so the circuit is a series circuit between the outlets but all of the rooms with their own circuit breaker are parallel circuits to each other. I experienced a couple days ago with the heat wave my roommate plug in too many things into the series circuit which caused the circuit breaker to activate and all of our power went out."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,99,"My question is what is the connection between magnets and electric charges? First in the semester we learned about positive and negative charges, and how opposite charges attract, and similar charges repel. Then we moved onto magnets, and how the south pole of one magnet is attracted to the north pole of another magnet, but two south poles will repel one another. I found in my notes that the both electricity and magnetism are controlled by the same force, electromagnetism. We learned that when an electric current is running through a wire, it creates a magnetic field outside of the wire. The direction of the magnetic field depends on the direction of current in the wire. We also learned that a current is created when a loop of wire is moved around a magnetic field. This made me curious about the relationship between electricity and magnetism. I am passionate about neuroscience and psychology, so the ions traveling in and out of neurons, firing action potentials, involves lots of charge. This invites the question about fMRI and how this relates to seeing how neurons are firing. fMRI uses magnetism to see how neurons are firing. This is why I am interested in how electricity and magnetism are related."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,84,"Question: if I was lost in the woods and only had a compass, how would I know which direction is North and South?Bar magnets have two poles: 1 north and 1 south. This allows force to be to be exerted on the needle in the compass, creating a magnetic force field. Just like charged particles, opposites attract and like signs repel against each other. In a compass, let's say North is positive and South is negative.The needle in the compass has two different colored ends in which we can say red end is positive and white end is negative. If I point the compass in front of me and tells me that is the south direction, the red end of the needle will be pointing in the south direction as well. (south is negative and red end is positive). Last week in lab we had a simulation that created a visual representation of this. This is important to my everyday life because I enjoy to be outdoors, especially going on long hikes where cell phone service isn't always reached. Luckily with iPhones, the compass will tell you your location and elevation. It's important to know things like this in case I am ever in a situation where I get lost, I know not to panic because I have a better understanding of how a compass works and can lead myself to safety. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,81,"The lab has been helpful in supplementation with the lecture to reinforce the topics. I am starting to see things differently in my daily life, such as batteries. I will never look at batteries the same again as I now truly understand how they work. I will be going to grad school so this class is necessary for it and the GRE but I feel that this course and Physics 111/112 should be taught as general ed so, the population, in general, can have a more broader understanding of the world around us. The labs on voltage, and static forces taught me a lot. It has been harder to learn this semester due to the pandemic but this class has been well set up and I feel that I am learning almost as well as I would in class. I wish we could have the in person lab, which would really help with hands on learning, which helps me learn the most. The simulations in the labs help and I like how they are interactive. The battery and compass simulations really showed me how they work and helped me to see how they function. My concept question is: Are electrical forces dangerous to a person? At this point in the semester, yes electrical forces can be dangerous but it is not that simple. Voltage can be dangerous but not as dangerous as currents."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,94,"A concept that I think i can link to my own major or something useful in my own life is the fundamentals of electrical fields. Now you may ask, how can you use electrical fields when you're a marine biology major? And I will say, dear reader, that my favorite animals use electric fields to hunt. Sharks and other cartilaginous fishes use tiny gel filled pores on the under side of their snouts to help detect bioelectricity in the water. The tiny little freckles are called Ampullae of Lorenzini, Ampullae like amps because electricity. By understanding how the sharks can detect bioelectricity from their surroundings, I can get a deeper understanding of how their ""6th sense"" works. I think electric fields would be the most interesting to study in sharks because simply understanding how the sharks can utilize electric fields to navigate and hunt is interesting. But another added interest is finding ways to interfere with their sense of navigation and hunting as a way to prevent shark attacks by using magnets on surfboards or something to block the electric waves given off by surfers. Electroreception in fish is actually an ancestral trait that is lost by a few families of fish such as salmon and hagfish but is prevalent in other families."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,89,"The lab I will be looking into and writing about is current, my question is: why is current so important. from the experiment we did online I was able to understand how current works. This is by having a source of energy and a circuit, which can be are parallel, series, or both. Current is important because we use it so much, every day. An example is with our phone when we charge them the battery gains power but then when we use them we are creating resistance and the current becomes weaker and weaker until your phone dies and then you charge it again. Current is also used throughout our house with outlets, powering devices like a TV, WiFi, a toaster, rice maker, chargers, printers, electric toothbrushes, timmers, lights, etc. Another example of current I experienced recently was in an escape room. In the room, there was a dental chair which buttons that you can press to move it up and down, but it was not on and did not work. I knew the chair had to do something so I thought about this puzzle in a physics mindset. I knew we had to find a way to turn the current on which we found and we turned on then we used the dental chair to continue the puzzle. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,92,"This past week in the lecture class we had our midterm, and it was really tough but the one portion of it that I thought was most useful and I understood the most was the circuits portion of it. I'm not going to lie, I got like a quarter of the questions wrong, but ultimately it is the portion I understood the most. . .so take that as you will. ANYWAY. The question I have is: how exactly do you know when to use specific formulas and how do I gain a better understanding of non-parallel circuit boards? Parallel is really easy to understand but as soon as another charge is added on the non-parallel portion of the circuit, I get confused because everything changes. I feel like this is useful information for real life because I could realistically understand the circuit board of my house, and even my computer, to know what kind of power is being directed into it. I figure it would even be useful for setting up a PC because you can know better where to put things on the circuit board for more efficiency for you PC. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,90,"i belive that physics helps us organize and understand the universe around us. Physics is the basis for modern technology, and the tools needed to perform tasks in engineering, medicine and many other fields. It is a fundamental science, where matter and energy are studied seperatly and together. Things that are often taken for gratented like walking or running a certain distance, can be explained scientifically through the subject. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,98,"What is the right hand rule of magnetic field?It is used to determines the direction of the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire and vice-versa. Using your right-hand: curl your fingers into a half-circle around the wire, they point in the direction of the magnetic field, point your thumb in the direction of the conventional current."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,82,"How does a light beam reflect in all different directions on water?How the light beam reflects on all different directions on the water is by the type of angle it is at when point at the surface of the water. Once the light beam hits it can go in many different directions on either side of the water. When the light beam is reflected away the reflection becomes more faint, but when it is closer to the surface of the water is becomes more clear and vibrant to the reflection. On the opposite end, the angle is at a different direction then how it is pointed. It can depend sometimes where you are point it at. How this can be useful in my life is by showing others with a laser and explaining to them how the reflection can give all types of different directions to point at. This particular lesson was useful for me because now I have a better understanding of reflections and how the light source can be changed by directions. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,101,"We learned about power both in the lecture and lab part of the class. I know that power is very different from voltage and current, and this is a term that I’m already familiar with. Power is used everyday in life and it’s measured in watts (other too, but I’m most familiar with that term), since it tells you how much work you get from a device or a source. For example, how much power do you need to survive in a house (for example, electricity, water). Power is so important to us that we have to pay for using it. I feel like this term is very important to our everyday lives because we take it for granted, so it may be beneficial to us if we understand it a little bit more. Without power, we wouldn’t be able to use it to power up our utilities, cars, and etc. It just shows you how important power is. To relate this to my future career (I’m planning to be a physical therapist or a doctor), we need power to turn on our offices, machines, or other stuff to work. Even other careers rely on power because of how important of a concept it is. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,97,What I enjoyed about the reflective essay lab was that it seemed to be something that I would most likely use in real life than other labs. I am pretty sure when you are driving and use your rear-view mirror it is a refraction from the cars that you see and that the blind spot of cars is caused by refraction upon the mirror since the object (car in this case) would be too close from point ? (you) causing it to not appear in the mirror.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,100,"What are Conductors and Insulators? How are they used in Physics?Before learning this topic I honestly did not know what conductors and insulators were! Now I know that they are useful for electric current. A conductor is a material that allows electric current to pass through it. However, an insulator is any material that does not allow an electric current to pass through it. They are opposite to each other but both are useful. Some examples of a conductor include metals, copper, aluminum, and steel.  Some examples of Insulators are plastic, rubber, glass, and cloth. In physics, we study conductors and insulators because we want to know how charges function. In a conductor, electrons flow freely unlike insulators prevent the free flow of electrons. We learn how the charge moves and how it can be by friction or contact and a good example that is a daily life activity for many of us is the example used in the slides. By brushing or combing our hair we are moving the charge by contact. “You can get charges to move within an object because they’re reacting to nearby charges.” that helps me understand how charges work in general but in this case how it works in insulators and conductors.

2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,83,"One topic that has been covered in the last few weeks is the E field. Studying the Ef field and how different particles are able to move in a system is important to understand in ecology and evolution. In an organism, ions move in and out of the cell for active transport to produce ATP, and this is an integral part of biology. Focusing more on ecosystems, various nutrient cycling processes such as the nitrogen cycle depend on ion transport across a gradient, and using physics we can determine how fast or slow, and how far it needs to go depending on the E field and the particle."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,93,"I've always wanted to learn more about circuits and how they work in relation to what I do with my spare time. I really like to do ""Do it yourself"" projects around the house, but I can never tackle any electrical things in the house because I fear I might overload the circuit or hurt myself. When learning about circuits and how current runs through them, I learned how not to series and parallel circuits work and how they are different  and what a ""short"" actually means. This basic knowledge will allow me to practice safer procedures when dealing with currents.It also relates to my major, because the human body also is like a circuit. Not only does it have current and voltage potentials between the nervous system, you can also relate the cardio vascular system to it as well, as the more you use different parts of your body at the same time, the more ""current""/oxygenated blood will be pumped faster throughout the rest of the body."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,86,"Most of what we've learned doesn't necessarily apply to my specific field of study but I think having basic knowledge of voltage, current, and electrostatics is important. By understanding these concepts, we can safely navigate tasks that may have seemed unfamiliar before. Things such as jumpstarting cars, installing a ceiling fan, and knowing about your home breaker are some examples of this. Everyone can benefit from this background learning. "
