2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,83,"My goals career wise are to work with the National Park Service or some other nature-based government agency doing nature conservation. This class can help me understand some biological concepts that will help me in my career, but mainly it's just interesting to me because I've always wondered how electricity works. Other than that, this class can help my goal of better time management, since it's asynchronous. It also is helping me with time management because I am trying my best to break up the homework and do some after every lecture. In the previous physics class, I tended to save all my homework to do at once and It stressed me out a lot. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,89,"My short term goal is to get through this semester especially with COVID, and my long term goal is to graduate and get into a doctorate of physical therapy program. being in this class helps me meet with the requirements needed to get into a doctorate program. This class also helps me to expand my learning so I can do well in my career in the future and be knowledgable of physics in the world around me. I most likely will not be using these formulas while as a physical therapist but it helps my thinking and understanding of concepts which I can deffinatly use in my career."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,90,"physics 2 is a required class for my major and helps me comprehend the building blocks that form this world. My main focus at this time is to graduate soon and taking this class is the step that I need to complete this goal. Physics is a subject that does not come easy to me but with perseverance, I can pass! this will teach me grit that will help me accomplish anything I put my mind to "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,99,"My goals are to learn more about how the world operates, and to use that knowledge to take care of people. Humans have evolved into beautiful conscious beings, with anxieties, love, anger, and all of the other emotions that come along with existence. There is so much diversity in human life and we all have to be true to ourselves. I am just trying to be true to myself, and do what I know I love, which is learning and helping. If I could be a student all day every day, I absolutely would. I want to know everything there is to know about human beings. How our organs work, how our inflammatory response works, how our brains work, how our emotions work. I want to understand why people make bad decisions, and why people make good decisions. I was a psychology major in undergrad, but realized that there is so much more that I want to learn. I want to learn about how the mind and the body work together. How we can heal ourselves spiritually and physically. I want to listen to what everyone has to say, and understand where people come from. I have a lot of faith in humanity. My boyfriend likes to call it naiveté. But I just have to follow the thing I love, because that is the point of life? Isn’t it? To be your authentic self? I am just glad I know what I want. Sort of."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,82,What my goals are would be finishing my classes with passing grades and making sure that I stay on top of things as well. Not only that I want to be able to tell others of what I learned and how much this professor has helped me as well. How this class can help me achieve my goals is by giving me guidance on what I can do to improve and to reach out and let us know any updates that occur. Also if there any questions that if they can always be answered right away.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,93,"Although I like physics and it's an interesting topic for me, my academic and career interest is biology, specifically completing this class so that I can get my degree and one day go to medical school. This class teaches me the fundamental application of physics and how everything functions, which is important to prospective doctors to understand.But besides that, one of my hobbies and things like to do during my free time is DIY home and car repairs. I like to use my hands and try to tackle new projects, and based on what I have learned in my previous physics classes, and my current physics class, I have been able to reach my goal of learning how currents and circuits work together  and how all the forces are acting on an object and how much I should use, etc..."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,87,"I think right now my goal is to graduate and finish my degree and maybe move out. That is ultimately what I am focused on right now. I think another goal that I have is to find something that I love doing. I really enjoyed hiking before quarantine but once a lot of the parks shut down and fires started happening, hiking was not really an option anymore. This class will help me understand the fundamentals of physics for my major in biology. Other than physics for my degree, I'm not sure how physics will help me ""adult"" in life haha. But I do hope to take away knowledge that I didn't have previously. What I have learned however is some of the basics of a circuit and I feel that could help out in some way later."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,85,"My goal is to graduate by the end of this semester and passing this class will allow me to achieve my goal. I have put off finishing this requirement because I have a tough time with physics. Something in my brain just doesn't click and I often get confused when trying to solve a physics problem. I hope that this class will actually make some sense to me so I can pass and move on. Everything seems to be running smoothly, and I finally actually get some stuff. However, I think the labs only help in a general sense. I have the most trouble applying what I learned to actual word problems. After graduation, I hope to continue growing in the current company I work for, however, I am seeking a well-paying job in the industry I want so I can move into an apartment by myself. I really want a cat but I need to be able to be independent and self-sufficient before I can take on the responsibility of a pet. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,97,"My goals for this class is to understand the physics around me. I still think and openly talk about centripetal force whenever I go through a spiral on the freeway overpass towards the freeway beneath me, and I at first annoying would state to whomever was in the car with me that you feel that pull on us while we spiral down, that its centripetal force and its the force that affects us trying to keep us centered towards the middle of the circle. This class can help me reach my goal because more and more I learn about other ideas that at first you would not think its Physics, ideas like heat and J. At first when I started to study physics I believed that heat and J was only something that portrayed to Chemistry."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,92,"My goals are to understand Physics enough to be able to have conversations with people and keep up with them. Also, to understand it enough that when I'm watching YouTube videos about Astronomy or some type of Physics related subject that I can understand the video completely rather than just the philosophical aspect of the video. This class can help me reach that goal because it's helping me understand Physics in a way that's not too complicated or mathematical. The reason I chose to do the non-calculus based Physics is because I'm really bad at math for one, and I would've 100% failed the calculus based Physics class, but also because I feel like this class helps you understand the concepts so much more. I really enjoy it and it has already helped me understand concepts in YouTube videos and when thinking about physical possibilities in the universe. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,84,"My goals are 1) to graduate with honors and 2) get into a physical therapy program in the future. By taking this class, I am working towards getting an A in which will help me boost my GPA up. Graduating with honors will mean a lot to me and reflective my hard work I've put into receiving my undergraduate degree. With physical therapy, second year of general physics (along with other life and physical sciences), can prove to graduate schools I am capable of handling the workload and can succeed in higher education. Graduating with honors can also help me stand out in the application process. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,94,"My goals in this class are to be able to understand Physics 2 topics more. I had a pretty good understanding of Physics 1 and that is the reason that I took Physics 2 over Calculus 2. The way I can achieve this goal for class is by being able to participate in class as well as working on the assignments that are due in order to give me a better grasp on the topics we learn about in class.  I study the best in a hands on environment but unfortunately due to covid-19, we are all enrolled in Zoom University. Online schooling is not the easiest in the current situation as my schedule is more hectic than normal. I haven't been doing so hot by missing 2 labs but by paying extra attention during the lab lectures and the questions given during the labs, I should be able to keep my goal of learning Physics 2 topics. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,88,"My goals for life are to ultimately be able to get a degree. It honestly does not matter what degree I just want a degree and a good job. Now more specifically my goal for my career is to be able to get into medical school by doing a good job on all three requirements. One my grades in my undergrad, two my score on the mcat exam, and three my participation in something outside of school related to the medical field. Once I get into medical school I then want to be able to get into a good residency and then ultimately I would like to become a general surgeon in the emergency room. This class can help me reach those goals by one helping out my transcript with an A (jk), two by helping me with the knowledge I need for the mcat and medical school and giving me a well rounded knowledge on science as a whole"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,98,My goal for this lab class especially lecture is to pass it with a C or better. I am striving for my grade to be an A in lab and a B in lecture and hopefully I can achieve it. I would be extremely upset with myself if I do not achieve this goal. I do not want to be repeating physics again. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,86,My goals are to earn a degree in my field and completing this physics lab and lecture will help me to do that. This lab will allow me to visualize what I learn in lecture and ultimately succeed in passing the course. Analyzing data is a big deal in my field and this class adds more practice in doing that. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,95,"My goal for right now is getting degree, but my long term goal is to work in a lab or something. To make enough money to be comfortable, I really don't want to make bank I just want to be able to get a house somewhere in the States preferably Montana since I have friends there and there's a ton of opportunities to get a job I want in field work. Basically, I'm a fan of ecology studies and I decided pretty late on my 3rd year that I don't want to be in the medical field because that doesn't make me happy. So, I rather just flow with my own waves and that's been doing wonders. For right now get good grades snag an internship and see where life takes me. I want to live a meaningful life in my point of view-- wow that all sounded super corny. but yeah taking this class will help me  understand physics since it' everywhere and it's good to know how things function on this earth and the whole universe."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,96,"My goals are to be financially stable, meaning I don't ever have to worry about the cost of anything I'd like to purchase. Food, a plane ticket back home, and to help my family out in any way without having to worry about how much. I would also like to help future generations and be able to support them with my resources as well. My goals are to work hard and be content with how I'm helping others and to never stop having goals because I realize that if I don't have any, then my purpose becomes dull and boring. I always have one thing after another. I have a few other goals before becoming financially stable and it's about how I will be in order to get there. It's getting into med school, passing the practical internship, becoming a resident, and being able to become an attending in neurosurgery. It's quite overwhelming and stressful but I know that it's possible and if there's a chance, even if it's a slight one, I'll take it and try. This class can help me achieve these goals as it will be tested on the MCAT and it's helping me prepare for that exam which I will soon take."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,81,"My goal is to graduate and this is my last class required for graduation. I have always enjoyed physics (unlike chemistry) so it's a nice way to end my undergrad. It's a little intense that I am taking this class while deployed for Covid but as the saying goes: ""Success comes from massive determined action."" The hard part is at times I become worried if I am doing something correctly because the pandemic has thrown everything off and everyone is just trying to figure things out as we go along. I think everything is going well and people are trying really hard to maintain some sense of normalcy. I think after the 2020/2021 academic year is over, things will be much better and life will have improved for the better in pretty much all areas of life, especially academics because we are learning how to be more productive and safer while learning.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,101,"My main goal is to either become a physical therapist or a physician, and this class fulfills the prerequisite for general physics. This class should teach me the knowledge I need to help me get ready for graduate school or prep me for the GRE or MCAT exam, depending on which path I take. I really hope I can learn the same amount of things, as if I'm in class in person. I really need to understand the concepts and material because graduate school will go more in depth of these things. It's going to be difficult, but I know I have a lot of resources I can use to my advantage. L hosts office hours to help me study, I can ask someone else in my class for help, or I can go to tutoring. I feel like I haven't used those enough resources because I'm a little anxious, but I should use it in order to be successful and reach my goals. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,91,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?One of my main goals is to not procrastinate. I have done a better job this semester of being proactive than ever before. I think it is because I do not have as many distractions to keep me away from my work here at home. This class will help me achieve my goals because I need to be responsible with all my work to stay prepared and ready for every lab. I will also be less stressed and enjoy learning the material more when I am not rushing to finish it.Another goal I have is to always finish the lab the same day it was assigned because that's what I would be doing if we were in person. This mentality of doing my classes of when I would have had them in person, especially the lecture for this class because it is asynchronous, has kept me in check for the semester so far. I have been able to stay on top of my work and complete everything on time. This class helps me practice this and allows me to work on my proactiveness overall. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,100,"I have a lot of goals but right now my main goal is to graduate next year by the latest summer 2021. Passing this class will help me accomplish my goal because it is a requirement for my degree and a pre-requisite for other classes I will take next semester. Taking this class has helped me understand the science behind the activities we do and how our world and universe functions. One of my other goals is to be able to go to Med-School and for that to happen, I need to take the MCAT which has a portion of physics. I will be tested with physics problems such as the ones we go over in class and the homework we are assigned for the lecture. This class is extremely important to me and important for my current and future education. Ultimately, my goal for this class is to be able to comprehend it to its full extent not just some parts."
