2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,93,"My greatest take away from this class is how much more broad and intricate the field of physics is and how much of it has actually been researched. The ability to create all these simulations (that came in really handy for online instruction) that depict how these things work in a perfect world and the real world and how you can change certain variables and get different results, and these are just things most people don't even get a second thought about. I really enjoyed this class and learned so much, and I would love to take a class on fluid dynamics, but it would be an extra semester on my graduation timeline."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,101,"I think my greatest takeaway from this class is learning how to balance synchronous classes with asynchronous classes. I started going to the zoom sessions in the beginning of the semester, but then I learned I can also learn on my own. I started watching the lectures and reviewing the PowerPoint slides. It was hard at first, but I learned some helpful skills on the way. I always emailed for help, I asked questions even if I felt like they were ""dumb"" ones, and I always practiced until I learned it. Also, I learned that it's very difficult to learn physics online. I know it's hard because of the pandemic, so I had to use the resources I had to my advantage. I watched recordings and videos. I read my notes the slides. I feel like I could have learned physics better if it was in person, but it was fun learning through online. Regardless, this class helped me learn a lot of things and made me a better person at asynchronous classes. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,81,"My greatest take away from this class is that it reflects how physics is all around us. Light, decay, M&M's, Magnetic forces, Optics, our work in this class has shown us that physics is in our 5 senses... Perhaps physics classes centuries from now will study 4th or 5th dimensional physics or anti-matter physics will be significantly more studied. Maybe a 6th Jedi sense will be studied in regards to maximum force that can be applied on certain objects."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,97,"I liked the story that Little shared with us with how she struggled between math, diversity, and growing up. I share a similar experience where I used to live in a very diverse area but when I moved to peninsula I do not see much of any diversity in the city that I am living in now. It was a cultural shock to me seeing that, when I moved here in the summer before my 8th grade. The school said they did not find my test scores or information from my previous school and I was put into intermediate class, basic algebra with the hardest being problems like 3x=1 find x. So I understand the frustration of being put into classes that I have far excelled in. Math and English were two of the class subjects for ""extra learning"" because they lost my information from my previous school. It wasnt until Sophomore year of High school was I even told about taking exams to get into better classes and even then when I got into AP History the professor told me countless times that he thought the class may be too hard for me and eventually I was ""kicked"" out of the class within two weeks and was put into another history class."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,86,"My greatest take away from this class is learning how to navigate simulations. I know that in person it would be a more hands on approach but given that our next semester is fully online as well, it's extremely helpful to know how to work online labs. This is was my first online lab and it won't be my last! I appreciate the DIY components of the lab too because it provides a more real experience while we're all at home. These lab sections also really helped to solidify what we learned in lecture because we get more practical examples that help me to make sense of the topics. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,87,"What I had taken away from this class was learning about aspects of physics that I did not even think was physics. For example, electricity, circuits and how they move. Or even simple things that you do not think about such as a drop which creates waves. I think this class had also taught me that learning is very versatile and is possible to be done from an online perspective especially for a physics class. All the labs were mostly simulations and I think they really connected the lab material and helped me get an understanding and connect it to everyday life. Ex. Mirrors, currents, wave optics, light etc."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,90,"my greatest takeaway from this course was digging in deeper into the scientific explaination of the world around us. this semester we learned about electrostatics, electrical circuits with capacitors, magnetic fields, electromagnetism, physical and geometric optics. It surpised me how many concepts were applied to everyday life. for example during the electrical curcit part of our course, i learned that most houses distribute electricity through a parallel circuit. This was the first time I had ever learned about the way current flow and the first time i had ever really truly thought about it"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,82,"My greatest take away from this class was actually having the ability to learn something. Usually in my other classes we are assigned to so many things, but yet we never get a learning outcome from it. In these labs I always manage to find a way to learn something new and useful. Not only that, but also something interesting that I never got to know about before. I believe that this class has helped me to learn about physics and enjoy it more."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,89,"My greatest take away from this class is that I learned physics! In my previous physics classes I never actually learn about the topics deeply, I would be stressed and memorize what I needed to know for the tests. In this class, I applied physics to my life and I enjoyed learning about it. I was able to learn the concepts and actually understand every aspect of them. This one class I enjoyed going to because you were easy to talk to and the material was easier to understand in the ways that you explained it. I also learned a lot more in this lab than in the lecture part of the class. The lecture to me was hard to understand because the teacher did not explain the topics well, the tests in that class are on a curve and a D is a B because the curve is so large from a lot of students, not understanding.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,91,"My greatest takeaway from this class was that the simulation links are the reason I understood all the material. The simulations had clear directions each week and I was able to comprehend the lesson and concepts due to the visual aspect of the simulation. Due to the clarity of them, I will know now be able to explain the concepts of each week's lab because I saw them in action. I thought that this lab was going to be hard or boring because we were not in person, but it was actually a really fun class because the labs all revolved around the simulations. Each one was interesting and fun. I also will take away a new appreciation for my lab professors. It must be so hard trying to keep classes engaged but you did a great job! I enjoyed coming to each class because I feel like I really learned something new and understood the physics behind it. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,100,"My greatest take away from this class is how flexible the instructors made it. I liked how we were given a week to finish the lab which also counted as a weekly quiz. I learned so much from those because in order to complete it I had to actually review the classwork and slides, sometimes, even the recorded classes. That allowed me to understand the work and be able to complete it on time. Another aspect from this class that was helpful was the ability to have two opportunities to get full points on the lab quiz. This is my first time taking fully online classes so I wasn't sure what to expect especially for my physics, bio, and chem classes since they are harder than other courses. It has its pros and cons such as having control over your classes and time but unfortunately not being able to ask as many questions or stay after class.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,96,"My greatest takeaway from this class was that it was interactive with these prompts as well as sharing them and having the simulation to get a general understanding on the topic of the lecture. It also let us pace ourselves so when the lab was opened until it was closed was enough time. It gave us control of our lesson materials and to go in our own pace. It was really convenient especially with a lot having certain situations and it allowed us to have enough time. As well as the tries we had which were useful and made us learn from our mistake and then we could've gone credit for it. Another takeaway was to connect with others for ideas as well as for help. When going into our breakout rooms or just discussing questions, it was important to have people there to help one another without having to feel embarrassed. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,98,Learning physics has helped me understand the basics of batteries and how electricity can function in a house. Learning about how sound waves function is useful because is always around.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,94,"One take away from this class is that there are some educators who are actually willing to reach out and be helpful to their students, thank you L! My greatest takeaway from the overall curriculum for this class is that Physics is hard, but not impossible. In the past, if someone asked me to do physics, I would've replied with a hard and fast no. But now, I am definitely more confident that I can reach out and help with physics problems. I might not want to, but at least I can do it now. I'm glad that I chose Physics 2 over Calc 2 as my last pre-req. I had a rough time adjusting my sleep schedule when classes were online as well as some other stressful events that caused me to miss some labs, thank you for being understanding L! I hope you have a great holiday season!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,85,"I have always struggled with physics and believed that the concepts were too difficult for me. Even though physics is still a struggle for me, I found the labs very helpful because the simulations made the concepts more clear. I am a visual person so being able to see it happen makes it easier for me to understand. My greatest take away from this class is that I can actually do physics if I apply myself and visualize it. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,84,"My greatest take away from this class is applying new topics of physics to my every day life. Although circuits were a bit challenging for me, I thought it was really cool to learn about as we use different circuits and batteries in our every day life. I was so excited to take part 2 of general physics, but once we went remote it was hard for me to stay motivated and complete my work with curiosity. It became more of just getting the work done before the deadline. I definitely enjoyed the lab portion more compared to the lecture, and grateful we had the lab simulations to help us with understanding the material better. Hopefully in the future I get to take another physics related class in my field of study. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,95,The big takeaway I learned from this class is that I have a better understanding of the world and how it functions though I am at home for most of the time because of a certain historical situation. I liked all the electrical related labs and it helped me understand my daily life better and appreciate the small things literally. There really isn’t much I can type to be honest this semester really brought out the worse student in me but at least I know now all the follies I’ve been going through is not because I have “quirks” but really it was untreated ADHD the entire time. This has been helpful to know actually since I’ve been feeling quite anxious so once I can finally get a hold of doctor I can get properly diagnosed. But beside the point I did learn despite the horrible conditions of what Is happening to the world
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,88,"My greatest takeaway from the class was the fact that I learned you can still learn even though that we are all at home. My biggest takeaway was learning about how to actually be able to take physics and relate it to my life. With this physics class for the first time I was actually able to take what I ,earned in this class and relate it to my life in my everyday outside life from physics. I thought that was very cool and interesting. I was really able to interact and learn the physics lab aspect of the course because of the interactive physics simulations that actually did help a lot with my understanding. I feel that for some reason when comparing my understanding of physics to the outside world I really was able to understand physics in a different way with the online physics lab when compared to the other physics lab that I took in person."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,99,"My greatest take away from this class has been learning how to understand concepts from simulations. Before this class, I only had experience with understanding concepts from in person labs. This semester, with classes being online, we mostly have had to use simulations. I had never used simulations before, and I ended up really liking them! I found them really straight forward and easy to use, and they take up less time than traditional labs. I actually started using simulations that I found online to help me with my organic chemistry homework. A lot of science is manipulating things in space, and it is important to be able to do this even without the materials in front of you physically. Simulations have helped me accomplish this during this school-at-home semester."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,92,"The greatest take away I can think of from this class is that I actually really enjoy the interactive side of physics and it helps me understand the lecture/mathematical side of physics a lot more. This class helped me pass the lecture physics course so much because I could visually think of what was going on with what I was learning. With school being online, it has really come to my attention that I am a visual learner and with the lecture course having no meeting times and being completely up to your own discipline, it has been a struggle! Not having a classroom to see for my own eyes what I am learning would have made me fail if it wasn't for this physics lab. So that has what I've taken from this class is that I need something visual and interactive to understand and learn better."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,83,"I think that my greatest takeaway from this class is how circuits work. I've always though of electricity as some kind of magic and I never though I'd come to understand the basics of it. The same goes for magnatistm. Still, it's a topic that not much is known about, but now I understand how to create it and what it controls. This class also taught me how to look at things critically, and perhaps in a way that's out of the box."
