Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,81,Why Am I Here?I'm here to help. I am here to graduate. The 2 things that are my main motivators. I am deployed in the US to help with Covid-19 and I am taking my final class in order to graduate online now because I want to graduate so badly! After a decade of working and being able to take one class here and one class there I joined the Army as a medic and pushing through the exhaustion of working as a healthcare worker during the pandemic and taking an online class (which is super hard to do because I thrive on in class learning). I am worried things will get worse before they get better... much worse. I believe I will be sent home for a month and then deployed again. I just hope to graduate in December and then it's time to get ready for grad school. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,82,I am here because I want to learn more about science and have it help me throughout the career choice that I have chosen. I want to become a doctor which requires a lot of science classes. I took physics during the summer and I learned a lot in the little bit of time I had. I also want to graduate early and take as many classes as I can to be able to reach my goal. During this class I will learn more about physics than I did previously in high school and I will grow more into the science field. During this class so far I have learned a lot from the labs and last week what we had done had helped me have a better understanding. I am also here because I want to continue learning and gain more knowledge that not many people are able to gain. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,83,"I am here because physics 2 is part of my prerequisite for my major. I'm not too sure how physics effects my major, and sometimes I question why I even have to take it. I wasn't too fond of physics 1; it was hard for me to understand at times and I spend hours trying to grasp the material and still didn't get some of it. But, I actually kind of like physics 2! It's interesting to me and I've always seen electricity as a kind of magic because I really don't know how it gets into my power outlet and then into my toaster. Still, I don't really understand how it fits into my major. The only thing I can think of is maybe it assists in nutrient cycling? Or maybe other ecological processes? That's ok though, I still think it's interesting nonetheless. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,84,"I am here in this class because I plan on pursuing a degree in physical therapy. Since grad schools require the full year of general physics and other science courses I must fulfill the requirements to let alone be viewed as a possible candidate. I'm not too upset I have to take this class because it does seem really interesting! When I first took physics last fall semester I was so nervous because of the negative stigma towards this class and even the doubt many people have about women in STEM. After taking the first part of general physics I was SO excited to keep learning more about physics since it happens every second of our lives. Although I am not a physics major, I do take joy in telling others what I am learning in class. Especially my parents who sacrificed a lot for my siblings and I to live a better life; it makes me want to push more to see them happy and hopefully give back to them for all they have done. I am very grateful for the educational path I am taking as a first generation college student!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,85,"I am here for the simple reason that this is a prerequisite. Like many, I really hate school but I actually have a lot of trouble with physics. I strongly dislike physics and it's one of those classes that I feel like I barely pass. I think this stems from me not really grasping the idea of physics. I understand the concepts and I get why we have to learn physics. But I can't apply it to solve the problems. Maybe I actually don't fully understand the concepts? It's just the most difficult subject for me and I'm not sure how to go about it. I remember in physics part 1, I really thought I understood it but when the problem slightly deviated from the sample problem, I was stuck again. After I pass this class, I hope to never have to do physics again. I get that physics is important because it's everywhere but I can't seem to like physics. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,86,"I'm here to fulfill a requirement and prerequisite for some of my major classes. I don't really enjoy physics because it really confuses me, and it's going to be especially hard with it being online. But either way, I'm here to give my effort and commit to understanding whatever we are learning. In terms of why I'm at college, it's because it's difficult to start a decent career without at least one degree and I want to be able to provide for myself and my future family as adequately as I'm able."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,87,"Why am I here?I am here sitting at home during my first semester at SFSU due the current pandemic happening. Definitely an unexpected turn of events from the beginning of the year to now. But I am also here because I am working towards my biology degree and this class happens to be the one that I didn't take during my freshman and sophomore year. I had only figured out what my major was 2 years into community college and although I'm not sure where I'm headed, I feel like I'm cultivating my path as I go."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,88,"I am here because I am an existing result of my two parents who brought light to my eyes. Their egg and sperm combined together in order to make the zygote that was me. I had to compete in order to make it to the egg and outcompete millions of other sperm cells in order for me to be able to make it to the egg and to be then developed and then born. Now a more general and relatable answer to the question why am I here (lets pretend this isnt a pandemic and this is a normal semester in SF), I am here at SFSU because I fell in love with the amazing crowded clouded city of San Francisco and to me it is amazing and I love it. I also picked SFSU because of the great opportunities that I can have at this school in my Biology major and also in my RRS minor because of the amazing college of ethnic studies that we have here."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,89,Why am I here? I think I am here to help others. I always liked taking care of people and trying to help. I feel like being a physical therapist would be a great job for me because I would be able to care for people and help them improve their gross and fine motor abilities to make their lives easier. After shadowing in a PT clinic and seeing the work they did I was inspired to follow that path. I am here to be a physical therapist.  
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,90,why am I here? I'm here because I am blessed with the opportunity to learn about what I am passionate about. My passion is biology and this class is a prerequisite. I am extremely grateful that I get to learn not only biology but also the basic elements that apply to the natural world. Physics is one of those things that happen all around and impacts the world that we live in every day. I am looking forward to learning more of physics so I can understand the world in a different perspective
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,91,"Why am I here? Well, I have to take this class for my major, that is why I am in this class initially. But, focusing on the bigger picture, I am also at this school because I’m fortunate enough to have higher education and the chance to obtain a bachelor's degree. I have very supportive parents and family that have gotten me to this point. I am also here because I love learning and think that physics is super interesting. It affects everything in the world around us and is important to everyday life and how all objects move! I also am here because I like to work hard and push my mind to its limits. This is a great opportunity for me to do that and prove to myself and others that I am capable of anything I set my mind to! I also really enjoyed physics last semester and knew that I would enjoy this class as well. Physics has always come easier to me, and science in general, so that is why I do not plan on dropping the class."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,92,"Why am I here?I have really vivid dreams at night and every so often they'll relate to each other night after night, and lately I've been trying to focus on my purpose in life because I feel pulled in different directions, and coincidentally my dreams have gotten even more vivid. I'm not sure if it relates, but it feels like even in my dreams I'm trying to discover why I'm here and where do I belong. In this class? I'm an astronomy minor so that's why I'm here. On this planet? I don't really know, I feel like I don't have that many useful skills to bring to the table besides being able to be empathetic and understanding, which is great, but it's not a job. Lately I've been wondering why am I in my major when all it does is stresses me out? I mean, we're quite literally living in the apocalypse, it feels like there are so many important things to be doing 'here' than stressing over an imaginary letter grade. I hate that I want to believe that I'm here for a purpose, yet the most important things in my life right now are a minimum paying job that works me too hard and schoolwork that is, in my opinion, really excessive. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,93,"I am here because I need physics for my degree, but I do also enjoy learning and experimenting with physics. I'm also remotely here in this class due to covid, so even though everyone is technically in class/school, no one is physically at campus, which is kind of weird, but interesting to test everyone's ability to study and stay focused without a library, which is something that I usually take advantage of."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,94,
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,95,"The prompt said ""why am i here"" It's all by chance that I happen to be born on Earth out of all the other earth-like planets in the universe. Also, human instead of a tree or a dolphin. Personally if I had a choice on what I would be I want to be a a jelly fish and just floating around vibing with the other sea creatures maybe sting someone when they're being too rude. The basic stuff. I really have nothing else to type so I hope I am making it to the word limit. I really should work on my handwriting since i am so used to typing that my hand cramps if I write one sentence. I woke up super late and it looks like the Apocalypse outside and all for what? a gender reveal-- I can relate that to physics and say combustion reaction made the forest go wish whoosh all of california is on fire now. Well, that's more chemistry but chemistry and physics pretty much hold hands in a lot of topics. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,96,I am here because it's required for my major and I did not want to take calculus 2 as the first one was horrible enough. I do prefer physics as I find it rather more enjoyable. I am glad I took this class because the students are really nice and the professor is cool and helpful and really understanding. I am also here because I want to be able to graduate in the four year time period as time is really important to me. Another thing that comes to mind on why I am here is because I get to help others which I am always glad to do and reassure them of their insecurities. I sometimes even think maybe I wasn't meant to always be in people's lives all the time forever but it was nice to meet them and there is always that hope that we will meet again.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,97,"I am here to get a passing grade in order to complete my required units for the mathematical field of my degree. Once I complete that I am a step closer into graduating. Once I graduate I can go to grad school and start ""it all over again."" After I finish my grad school I can finally actually start my life. Something ive been wanting to do for a long time and that is go to work and helping animals out as a Veterinarian. If there was a program to only focus on Veterinarian medicine I would do that instead as I believe having a focus on something would greatly increase the improvement of learning and understanding of a subject. Another reason why I am here is that I rather take Physics 2 than Calc 2 because it feels better to take and not only that, but to me it is way more interesting. Physics to me also is fun and not ""hard,"" but its like the concepts are fun, but the work is hard. Unlike Calc 2 to me where everything feels hard and confusing, so I prefer Physics."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,98,"I am in this class because it is part of my required courses. If I had a choice of not needing to take this class I would because I find physics to be a hard subject for me to understand and on top of that math is heavily related to the subject. I just hope I am able to pass the class because I definitely do not want to retake it.  I also find these reflective journaling useless. Even though I hate math because it is difficult for me, I hate having to write in general even more. I honestly see no point in this assignment. Having to do this assignment is a waste of my time and I would much rather be watching a physics related video and write about it than this random unrelated question. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,99,"Why am I here? Because I love to understand how things work. In undergrad I was a psychology major, because I loved understanding how the mind works. I was a neuroscience minor because I loved understanding how the brain works. I am pursuing medicine because I love to understand how the body works. If I could have it my way, I would study physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, and math for the rest of my life, because I love understanding how the world, the universe, and the human body work. I think it is absolutely incredible that all of us are living here on Earth, with developed prefrontal cortices and complex lives, while the rest of the universe is infinite and even more complex than we even know. I have to take physics for medical school prerequisites, but I am so excited by understanding how the world works. My brother and I used to watch “How It’s Made” for hours on Saturdays and Sundays. Now he is getting his PhD in theoretical Chemistry and I am pursuing a future in medicine. I don’t know where my life and passion for learning will take me, but it is exciting."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,100,"I am here because I am a Biology major and this is one of the prerequisites for my major. I previously took a Physics class in high school, but looking back I didn’t really learn much and did not understand the full concept of what Physics actually was and the point of it. I am also here because I want to broaden my understanding of why certain things function the way they do when working out these problems and how they might relate to everyday life. I am also not the best in math, so after taking this class I want to accomplish my goals of doing good and be able to solve the problems without having any trouble and be confident in the work that I am doing. I also hope this class best prepares me for the MCAT. This class will help me understand physics and will help me in my future classes. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,101,"I'm here taking general physics II because it's a prerequisite for one of the graduate schools I want to go to. There are 2 career plans I'm thinking about,: physical therapy or medicine school. I haven't picked which school I want to go yet because I don't really know what I even want to do. I hope I can learn about my passions and what's best for me through these classes I need to take for prerequisites. I'm actually tired since I've been going to school since I was 5, so I hope I can take a break soon. Now that I think about it, learning is pretty fun and I don't want to stop learning forever. I just hope I can take a small break, maybe a year, and just fully rest. But to answer the question in it's entirety, I'm here taking general physics because it's a prerequisite. I don't think I'd take this class if it wasn't. So far, I'm having fun and learning a lot. "
