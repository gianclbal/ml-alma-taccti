2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,99,"My question is: What happens when two crests meet each other in a light wave? In the simulation, we saw that when water waves have interference, the physical result is either a larger wave or a smaller wave. This could affect boats on water, surfers, swimmers, etc. With this in mind, I was thinking about what would happen when two light waves with the same frequency and amplitude had interference. Would the light be a different color when the crests met? Would the light be brighter or darker? Well, when two waves interact, it is their amplitudes that are being added together. For light, amplitude indicates intensity of light, or brightness. So when two light waves interfere with each other, the changes would be seen in intensity of light. Where the crests or troughs add up, the light will be brighter. Where the nodal lines are, the light will be dimmer. This makes sense, just as the areas where the troughs and crests add up will be the most bumpy on a boat in the water, they will be the brightest light. And where they cancel each other out on the water, there will be darker light. It is much harder to see the effects of interference of light than it is to see the effects of interference on water, unless you are in a lab simulation."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,90,"i often wonder how applicable concepts from physics 2 in the everyday world. In class we have been looking into magnetics and the field they create. I was surprised to find that many modern day appliances rely heavily on our ability to understand magnetism. Many computers use magnets to store data on hard drives. Magnets alter the direction of a magnetic material on a hard disk in segments that then represent computer data. Later, computers read the direction of each segment of magnetic material to ""read"" the data. The small speakers found in computers, televisions and radios also use magnets; inside the speaker, a wire coil and magnet converts electronic signals into sound vibrations  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,83,"Something I've been confused about recently is the theory of relativity. I'm not too sure about why it applies. How does the aging of someone in space differ so greatly from someone on earth? I've definitely heard of it before, but I've never been able to grasp it. I know that the formula for time dilation can answer this because if the speed that something is traveling at is at or near the speed of light, time moves slower. What I don't understand is how this is possible outside of an equation."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,86,"I am currently majoring in Geology and in studying topography maps, I've always noticed there is a compass on them that indicates true north and magnetic north (like the north you would see on a regular handheld compass). My question is related to magnetic fields and I guess I wonder how often the Earth's magnetic field shifts and how does it shift? I have touched on this topic briefly in some of my Geo classes but I've never really delved into it. Physics, more specifically geophysics and maybe even geochemistry, would definitely help give me an answer to this question. I'm glad that I had the opportunity to learn more about magnetic fields in this physics class even if I didn't understand all of it. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,81,"A question I have is about reflection vs refraction. I bet there is some key ratio between the two that I am missing. Of course it would depend on the surface that light is being shined on but I believe that light, depending on the surface it's shined on, has some sort of ratio between refraction and reflection, be it a transparent, translucent or semi-opaque/opaque."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,94,"The way I can use what I learn in Physics 2 is how it applies to sharks. I’ve mentioned before how I’ve had a lifelong fascination for sharks and I want to understand them better because they are misunderstood in the eyes of the public. Wavelength, currents, and magnetism are all things that I can use when I study sharks in the future. Sharks are able to detect even the slightest movement in the water thanks to jelly filled pores on the underside of their snout. These pores are called Ampullae of Lorenzini and help detect bioelectricity but they also have a lateral line down the side of their body like many other different kinds of fish. If we can better understand how sharks sense their environment, then we can prevent sharks and humans endangering each other. I know for a fact that being in the water surfing can be very nerve wracking as we have large sharks off our coast. However if we can find a way to nullify their senses with some sort of magnet or something that sends of a wavelength that bounces off of us, then perhaps we can find a way to minimalize shark attacks on people."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,96,Do electrostatics require magnetic fields?No it does not require magnetic fields. Electrostatics in general is applicable to people's lives and just knowing information for it is relevant. Something I recently found out which is why I chose to write about this concept is that an important application of electrostatics is found in air cleaners. The process of this is that electrostatic excess stuff like dusk and smoke in the air which then passes through and attracts opposite charged particles. They are very effective in removing polluting particles and allergens. I know there are like different sizes of air cleaners and their effects on what they do. Such as that the larger ones remove a lot more of the particles from the gas which is connected when they use it to burn the coal and oil. I know another important relevant thing to know about it is through ink jet printer since it employs electrostatics. Electrostatic painting can get to those places that you can't reach or get to and it applies an even coat in a more controlled manner because of the ink nozzle. I know we used electrostatic through the pieces of tape we used in lab and learned that electrostatic charge will gradually disperse turning your charged top and bottom tapes into neutral old tapes as well as which ones repelled and which ones attracted. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,84,"For those who are deaf or hard of hearing, how do they feel the vibrations from music? With moving charges in a magnetic field there is a force that is created. An example of this is a speaker. The moving membrane pushes air that then creates sound waves. As the waves travel throughout the room with the speaker in it, those who are deaf can feel vibration the waves create. This helps to promote inclusiveness at music festivals worldwide. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,87,"One topic that was covered in class was the idea of reflection and my question was how mirrors within cars positioned in order to see objects not directly in front of the mirror? Looking at my notes it looks like it is based off the Law of Reflection. There is the angle of incidence vs angle of reflection which determines what objects can be seen within the mirror. But I believe that it also takes into account the shape that the mirror is in (flat, curved, etc.) which also has an effect on the reflection. This information is applicable to people's lives because we use it everyday when we drive or sometimes within stores to get a wide angle view. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,93,"Question: With all the new technology and sensors in automobiles today with the goal of achieving complete autonomous driving, how do all the waves that are sent out by each sensor not interfere with each other, and the cameras on board scan the road so precisely with the millions of cars on the road.Each car that has some level of autonomous driving (for example, a Tesla Model S) has many sensors and advanced computers that have to continuously monitor the roads and make adjustments every split second. The cars do this by using a combination of cameras to scan the roads, GPS mapping, and distance sensors to approximate the distance between objects on the road. Each sensor sends out a wave (of probably the same amplitude and frequency) and bounces off the object and returns to the sensor, which calculates how long it took for the wave to come back. But if another car is producing the same wave, then the two waves may have constructive interference and the strength of the wave increases, or if a car is coming in the opposite direction, then the two waves may experience destructive interference and the car will go crazy and the driver has to take control."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,85,"I think mirrors, reflections and snell's law was an interesting topic. It furthered my understanding of how mirrors works. I think that mirrors are so common, that we don't think twice about how they work and how they help us perceive things because it is associated more with vanity. It is super interesting how this topic applied to video games and fun things like haunted houses. Flat mirrors are straight forwards because the distance of the image is equal to the distance of the object. This topic is important for us to understand depth perception. Light rays from sun, lamps, etc. bounce off objects and go in all directions. This concept can help us  know object’s location by where rays come from."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,92,"Question: If you wear glasses are you understanding the physics of what is happening with your lenses?This lab was really interesting for me, as well as the reflection lab, because it made me think of my glasses and how they are a form of physics constantly stuck on my face. There is so many people who wear glasses or who eventually will, like I grew up with 20/20 vision and my eyes went bad about 5 years ago, so it's always on my mind when I take my glasses off how I used to be able to see. Learning about lenses really showed me how intricate our glasses are and how without them we (people with glasses) would not be able to operate at the same level really at all as people with good eye sight. So a lot of our every day lives are made possible because of physics, which I think is really cool and gives people a reason as to why they should learn physics."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,101,"I remember learning about concave lens during the lenses lab a few weeks ago. A few examples of convex lens that I use in my everyday life are my eyeglasses. Since I am nearsighted, I can see close things clearly, but I need to wear glasses that can help me see far objects more clearly. I remember learning that concave lenses reduce light and increases focal length, in order to get a clear image. Also, I remember learning that concave lenses are diverging, meaning that the lens are thick at the edge but thin in the middle. This resembles my eyeglasses because it has a similar shape. I have really big glasses, and I especially use them while I drive. Rather than converging lens (for farsighted people), they have convex lens. The lens are thin at the edge but thick in the middle. People with farsightedness use convex and converging lens because it helps them see a close image clearly, so the object is far from the focal point. I feel like this is important to understand about because it is helpful for people to know how their eyesight work. Some people may not know about this, but I feel that it will just make them appreciate physics a lot more."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,100,"Does the number of coils matter? When we did the lab ""Electromagnets"" I learned a few things such as how to build a magnetic field and how easy and fun it is! It was a fun activity that we all did and my first time building one. This helped me understand and visualize how everything works- how the electrons transfer and the cause and effect. When we first started we tried getting paper clips when the magnetic field was unmodified and it didn't work -it didn't attract any paper clips because there was no electric current. After that, we wired around the bolt 20 times and it was able to pick around 4-5 paperclips. We then wired around the bolt 50 times and it was able to pick all the paper clips which were a total of 10. I learned that the more coils it has the more it can pick more paper clips because when there is an increase in the number of loops (on the simulation) the number of electrons increases which means that it makes the electromagnet stronger enabling it to pick up more paper clips. In conclusion, the number of coils does matter and it's important!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,88,"The general question that I have come up with is a light wave. Specifically, I am wondering how do light waves work where they dont interfere with each other. So for example if you are in the movie theater and you are on your phone or something that produces light, how exactly does the light waves at the movie thearter and the light waves that are coming from your secondary device not interfere are cause the movie theaters waves to redirect somewhere else. Also, I am wondering how they can specifically be focused on a specific position. Also on the same subject, I am also wondering about these new cars that we have that are all coming out, such as the self driving cars. I am wondering how all these waves that are bouncing around everywhere are not interfering with the waves that the car is using in order to be able to track where they are. This is relevant because we have spent a lot of time on waves and how they interact with objects but we have not yet talked about lights and waves and how they actually interact with each other. I am wondering if they actually do interfere with each other and how to avoid that if they do."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,91,"The concept I will be choosing to write about is lenses.  The question I will formulate is how can a lens show the whole picture of an object and make it seem bigger to the naked human eye? This deals with the way the lens is shaped. The lens of a microscope, which is what is used by microbiologists to see small organisms, is convex. This means that it takes the light from an object and bends the rays emitted from the object into a smaller viewing point. We know this works because of the three principle rays. Each ray can be shortened or lengthened to create an image on the opposite side of the lens. This is how we can see the image on the opposite side. There are two lenses in a microscope that work together to create this image by bending light so that we can see it with our own eye. This can work with small and larger images because it all depends on how far the focal point is from the lens and how far the object is from the lens. By having three principle rays you can manipulate and change, you can create an image from many different viewpoints. This concept was very interesting to learn about because I used microscopes a lot in my labs this past semester and now I know exactly how they work. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,97,"What I enjoyed of this lab was actually getting out a pot (not a pan) to test out the water droplet simulation and that in the real world you run into the obstacle called interference by the edge of the pot because the ripple has no where to release its energy and instead bounces back ""ruining"" your simulation, unless of course you want to constantly wait until the water ripple settles down to flat again (which would be awhile) which is why the virtual simulation tends to work better."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,98,What happens when two sounds waves meet with each other?When two waves meet a new wave is created from the two. By either adding the two similar waves together to create a bigger wave or by adding the two different waves together to create a small wave. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,4,89,"What are the different types of lenses and how do they relate to everyday life. There are two different lenses convex and concaved. Convex lenses take parallel rays and after passing the lense brings them together into an axis. This is great for people who are farsighted and need glasses because it brings the focal point closer. concaved lenses are converging and great for people who are nearsighted because it helps them see farther away, this is by taking refracted light and spreading it out. Both lenses are very necessary for correcting eyesight because people have different needs and issues when it comes to sight. So having different lenses to fix the different problems in everyone's unique eyes is very necessary. It is also interesting now nearsighted and far-sighted people use a convex lens with contacts because it is the shape of their eye, and I am curious about how a convex looking lense can be concave.        "
