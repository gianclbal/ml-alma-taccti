2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,56,"Aya Alazzeh My greatest takeaway from this class would be mostly based on mindset and the effect of a positive mindset. Physics is nowhere near my favorite subject, but I have learned to put my best food forward and try my best. Having a positive mindset and encouraging myself to focus on physics has helped me achieve my academic goals in terms of Physics. Another takeaway would be how I have been adapting to having school and classes online. I have felt my eyes worsening and so I got a pair of blue light blocking glasses, and they have been a game changer. I recommend them to anyone and everyone taking classes online. I have learned a lot about myself over quarantine, and I have realised that if I have the right environment, as well as mindset then I can sit down and focus and get work done. On the other hand, If i am in bed or in pajamas then I tend to be lazier and procrastinate more often in my schoolwork. It is all about setting the scene and correcting the ambiance for myself when I know I want to come study.   "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,66,The greatest take away from this class was the independent learning I actually got done. I realized that a lot of the problems that I was able to learn I taught myself and it gave a sort of confidence that I did not have before. This whole process has made me more aware of what I am able to do myself but also how much someone needs a friend. I spent double the time on a lab than I would usually have had spent if I had someone there to help me. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,60,"My greatest takeaway from this class is to give equal attention to all classes I’m currently taking even if I don’t particularly enjoy the subject. The reason I say this is because I’m more than likely going to pass this class but I know I could have done so much better in this class and in other ones I’m currently enrolled in as well. I know if I had put as much effort into this class as I did my biology class then I would have metaphorically walked out of this class with an A or at least a B. The reason I think I didn’t give this class the attention it deserved is because I’m not the biggest fan of physics since I’m pretty bad at it and I also really don't enjoy the lab portion of any class so I think as a sort if defense mechanism I just avoided this class and some of my other lab courses. I really regret this because it would have taken just a little bit more effort to try and I just didn’t. Sometimes we have to learn our lessons the hard way, something which I try to avoid, and unfortunately that was what happened in this class and other labs as well but I’m also really appreciative of the experience because I know that for the labs I’m taking next semester I will do better and try a lot harder having learned what I learned this semester."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,80,My greatest takeaway from this class is that physics can explain a lot of what happens in our everyday lives. There is an explanation for everything that happens like how the ball bounces back when you bounce it or something else. Another thing is that physics is connected to other sciences and they are all connected and everyone of them explains how something works. Physics is a really interesting subject and somewhat easy to learn. I took a physics lab last year in person which was fun and sad. We had to go online but the simulations still made it fairly interesting and easy to learn.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,55,"My greatest take away from this class is that any subject can be interesting when you have someone with the right energy teaching that subject. For example, teachers that tend to seem very excited about the topic they're teaching can wake up a classroom or inspire kids to investigate what makes that topic so appealing to their teacher. Meanwhile, a teacher that seems like they hate their job has the potential or transferring that feeling to their students. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,61,"I would say the greatest take away from this class is that physics and science is all around us . We interact with Physics in everyday life . Most of the time we are not aware of it .  There are many examples of this in Physics .  Some of the examples i can think of from this class is light, electric currents , voltages , waves , sound and many other things we can both see and feel around us .  There are also many applications of the formulas and concepts we learned during this semester . Some examples of this are magnetic feilds , Snell's law and calculating voltages and currents . I think the one thing i can take away from this class is to appreciate science and the concepts and ideas we interact with everyday.  We do not have to be scientist to know about these things and we can easily relate to them."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,79,I think that my greatest take away from this class is that physics is basically everywhere in our daily life routines. This physics class talked about circuits sound waves and lightwaves more than the first physics class I took. This physics lab was definitely way easier and more fun compared to the physics 1 lab because we actually learned about things that we can use in life.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,73,"My greatest takeaway from this class was the knowledge of the new things we learned that wasn't taught in the previous Physics class. A lot of the outside world connects to physics which I know, but after learning, sometimes I find myself thinking about things differently. For example, when we learned about lenses I didn't really know too much about it but it was interesting to learn about and connect it outside of physics. It made me think about how cameras work and what happens when rays are parallel or come through the center and if and when an image is real and inverted. Another lesson I learned a lot from was the waves lab where we learned about pulses, amplitude and frequency. If not all the educational, I really want to say that online classes are hard and hard to keep track of sometimes and I was able to make sure that I did all my assignments on time and not miss a class either. Although I had help from my alarm to tell me what time class was going to begin, I was able to make sure that I stayed on top of my assignments."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,65,"My main take away from this class would be my new found knowledge of learning physics through online simulations. I was very curious as to how we were going to be able to affectively do physics labs while online, but I found that the simulations were very helpful. While online learning is definitely more difficult than in person learning, I thought that this lab would be a lot more difficult and that I would come out of the class not really retaining any of the information that I had learned. I now feel that this is quite the opposite of what actually happened."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,53,"This class was a great reinforcement of the things we were learning about in lecture and really allowed me to grasp onto certain topics much better. The greatest takeaway from this class, as with many other lab classes, was seeing how these different topics factor into real-life. After conducting and going through each experiment each week, it was always very effective for me to research how these ideas were being used in real life and how it effects our daily lives. For example, it was very interesting to learn about circuits and how they are used in the infrastructure of our houses. Or even learning about different types of waves, such as sound or light, and how they are emitted and changed under different frequencies or amplitudes. A lab class is meant to show the real time application of the ideas we learned in lecture and this class did a great job in doing so. It was also a great break in between classes to just sit down and do a lab as a much needed different type of learning from out typical day full of lectures. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,78,I did learn a lot  more from this class then I did in my lecture class and I thank you for being a great teacher. The labs were set up nicely with Power Points that were easy to understand and the labs were easy to navigate. The current lab I feel was the lab that gave me real world sense because current is flowing all around us and now I have some what of an understanding of how it works. Hopefully I will be able to apply this knowledge to my other classes and go more into depth in my next physics class.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,59,"My greatest take away from this class was learning about the different circuits and how they look and operate. Having the simulation of this lab and building the two different circuits really helped me to get a clear picture on what the difference was between a parallel circuit and a series circuit. Before this class, I didn't know what the difference was between this two, heck I didn't even know that there were two different types of circuits, I only thought that there was only the parallel circuit cause that is what houses use. I'm sure I talked about the types of circuits in my high school physics class, but since that was a while ago I forgot, so being in class really helped me to learn about the different types. I really appreciate what this class did for me this semester, I had a lot of fun and I learned a lot.   "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,52,"This physic lab course had been a very informative, interesting and stress free at the same time. This semester had been a weird and chaotic since we had to do every class online and virtually. I was not sure of what I can learn from a lab section online but I did learn a lot about different physic concepts and ideas from this class. my greatest took away from this class is the knowledge which help me understand the concepts I learned in the lecture section of the course. Every week, we learned a new concept in lecture through lecture slides and notes from the professor but sometime I need to additional information to really understand and get the concept. This lab is what help me to tie the concepts I learned in lecture with the applications the concepts in real life outside of physic lab. the simulations of the lab or a few actual experiments that we got to do during this semester are very helpful. I got the see the concepts being apply in real situations rather than just seeing them on paper and on theory."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,69,My greatest takeaway from this class was being able to work on assignments although we couldn't use physical objects all the time due to the circumstances we have going on. It was really cool to be able to use objects that we may have in our everyday homes in order to work on the labs for the class. The simulations were also very helpful since it helps to have visuals of the assignments so we can follow along. We also got to work with each other and be on zoom calls when it is necessary. I know that it wasn't the easiest semester but I feel that all of us as a group have learned a lot. I also wanted to say thanks for always trying to keep the class on task and for showing interest in teaching the subject. It helped out a lot to stay focused. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,62,"My main takeaway from this class is that I could do anything if I put my mind to it. Physics has never been my strongest subject, I find myself stronger in chemistry and biology more than physics. Given that, I was a bit weary going into this lab considering the concepts are a bit more challenging than the topics I learned in my last physics lab. I found myself very stuck and completely confused in parts of this class while working on the lab but when that happens, I wouldn't drop everything and give up. What I would do is first reread the slide show that is posted to iLearn and corresponds to the lab. Then, if I am still confused, I will rewatch the lecture recording and see if your explanations and examples helped. If that doesn't help, I go to youtube or google to get an explanation. When that doesn't work, I email you. In the end, I always figure out the concept and my confusions are cleared. My main takeaway is that even though I am not good at physics, my hard work and dedication into understanding the topic has helped me achieve an A in this course! I could apply this mindset and work ethic in any other class and hopefully achieve the same results. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,75,"There are so many greatest things that take away from this class. I learned and did incredible experiments on interesting topics such as the electrostatics, the E Field, the current, the voltage, the electromagnetics, the reflection, the lenses, the pulse, the continuous waves, the interference, the wave, and the radioactive decay. Not only I gained knowledge but also I gained a few skills such as working in teams and working alone. I am glad I took this class for this semester, the classmate were nice and the teacher was very easy to understand and easy to follow along. She made the class as comfortable as possible for everyone. She made sure everyone understands the topics by going beyond her capability. She teaches the topics with a passion which makes the topics or class easy to follow along and understand. I will definitely recommend this class especially the teacher to everyone.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,74,"I must admit that I got really lost in the lab few weeks before thanksgiving break. As you already know about what happened to my dad. I struggle a lot learning concepts and gaining back my focus again. I've been reaching out to my classmates for help since I missed classes and couldn't really keep up with my missed school work. Some lab questions I had to skip because I just really don't know and honestly, I am in the point where I feel like ""just pass the class"". I know its really bad to just give up like that but I just hope that teachers would also consider that just like myself, every students are experiencing mental breakdown, stress, and probably depression. Though I must say that I really did enjoy this class and I learn a lot in Physics II than when I took Physics I. It was very challenging yet fulfilling that finally, I'm done with Physics!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,51,"My biggest take away from this class was a studying method for classes that are more science-y and more math related subjects. Since I am a Kinesiology major, and this is my third semester in the major, I am starting to take more and more upper division science courses (as well as Kinesiology courses that are not science but are still ""hard classes""). Taking this Physics 2 class has allowed me to learn which methods of studying works best for me, and it has also taught me how to still learn even with class being online. I will take my learning and study habits from this class and apply it to my upper division major classes since I have had the time this semester to really make sure that this method works for me. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,57,"The fall semester was quite different as in person class due to ongoing issues in the real world, but the online simulation did deliver the learning experience of teaching the law of physics. For that I am grateful of the knowledge that has been delivered despite online-courses."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,72,"The greatest take away from this class was to know that as the shorter the wavelength of light is used, the smaller the number of nodes will be. I remember using the spectrometer for general chemistry and we learned how difference substance and its concentration are determined by how the light is absorbed in the spectrometer. And especially the color of the substance will determine the wavelength in which the light is absorbed which later gives us a determined concentration ( our goal in the lab). It was super interesting going back to use wavelength and study a bit further other applications in waves and radioactive decay labs. It was interesting to learn how light waves can behave and how we can determine through the use of equations. I must say it is a different application that we use in chemistry but it is something that I will certainly work on more and practice more. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,71,"This class has been great this semester. I learned a lot about physics topics and how to actually apply them to the real world. Its crazy to think how much of our daily lives involve physics. All of the topics we went over this semester were interesting and Leslie did a great job of making the class interesting and easy to understand. I wish we could have had this class in person, but Leslie made it a fun environment anyways. Overall it was a fun semester and I enjoyed this class a lot."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,63,"My greatest take away from this class was applying concepts we learned to everyday life. I realized that with most of the classes I've taken, I don't absorb information well and I keep the information I learn in the class. Labs in this class forced me to come up with my own ideas of how physics concepts can apply to everyday life. It wasn't easy, but seeing the examples in PowerPoints, word problems, and simulations gave me a better idea. Hopefully I can apply this to my future classes without them actually asking me to apply concepts to my life. I'm glad I took this class because it relates to biomechanics which is an important component to what i'm trying to pursue in the future, which is physical therapy. Having online simulations was difficult but it made me learn to stay on top of my work and find time in my schedule to do the actually work. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,76,"My greatest take away from this class is how flexible the instructors made it. I liked how we were given a week to finish the lab which also counted as a weekly quiz. I learned so much from those because in order to complete it I had to actually review the classwork and slides, sometimes, even the recorded classes. That allowed me to understand the work and be able to complete it on time. Another aspect from this class that was helpful was the ability to have two opportunities to get full points on the lab quiz. This is my first time taking fully online classes so I wasn't sure what to expect especially for my physics, bio, and chem classes since they are harder than other courses. It has its pros and cons such as having control over your classes and time but unfortunately not being able to ask as many questions or stay after class. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,77,"My greatest takeaway from this class is that even though we are doing this class virtually, we are still able to learn physics in an interactive way. Personally I really enjoyed this lab class because the class was very interactive and I loved the stimulations because I'm a visual learner so those really helped me learn the concepts. I liked the way the labs were structured, like it was guiding us through the topic. Another takeaway is that maybe I don't dislike physics as much as I used to because this class was actually pretty enjoyable. The concepts could be a bit confusing at times, but working through the labs each week really helped. Overall, I feel like I learned a lot from this class and enjoyed the semester."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,58,The greatest takeaway from this class was to be grateful for what you have. When campus was opened I would complain of waiting up for my 8am now I miss it. To be honest I miss more the parties and stuff. Academically  a great take away I can take is to improve on my time management skills many times I have not been submitting stuff last minute and basically don't put in as mush time as I would have likes to in the last 3 questions of the lab since I'm ruching it in the last 10 minutes. I don't know how to work on that tho I just keep procrastinating. But putting time into an assignment seems to be the takeaway I got special since classes are online and they're is not too mush structure.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,67,"The greatest takeaway I have in this class is how much the lab was able to teach me and help reinforce concepts I normally wouldn’t be able to visualize and conceptualize. Last semesters  physics lab wasn’t as successful as this class in regard to how much I learned about physis concepts from actually doing the labs. Though sometimes the questions asked in the labs may fall short and not help me , most of the times they were made in such a way that I would not only understand what to do, but actually come to understand what I am learning. The simulations were on of those aspects that helped improve my absorption of information significantly. Visual aid for learning on a subject like physics was really essential for helping me understand concepts introduced in the classroom. Some concepts I know pretty well because of lab now include most of the current and voltage concepts as well as the wave optics. Though sadly I am not still too sure how I am going to use most of these concepts outside of the classroom, I am proud to at least know I was able to actually learn and even excel in some of the concepts of physics during some point of my life. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,68,"Taking Physics for the first semester at SFSU made me so scared since I never had a good relationship with physics but Leslie was really helpful and I was able to meet her during office hours before the tests to ask my questions from her and anytime I missed an assignment she was so helpful and allowed me to complete quizzes. The assignments were understandable and regular. If I did study the lecture and listened to the lab's lecture parts I was able to do Pearson's homework. To be honest, I'm not sure if I'm going to use the formulas I learned in this course in real life since it is not related to my major, however, I was able to learn the topic very well and I'm over the fear that I had of physics. "
