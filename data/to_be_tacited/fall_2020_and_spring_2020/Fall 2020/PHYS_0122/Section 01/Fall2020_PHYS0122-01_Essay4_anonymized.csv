2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,74,"As you may already know, I am a transfer student from City College of San Francisco. It took me 5-years to finish all my prerequisites at my community college. I would say that I am strong enough to handle depression or stress. I have been in a position where I felt like I want to stop and drop school because of all the discouragement I hear from everyone. Every day with my experiences in life I keep reminding myself of why I am here and why I am doing this to fuel myself to continue and keep going. After my graduation and got my Associates's degree at my community college, I realized the reason I am working hard to pursue my education. I realized that working at a restaurant and getting paid minimum wage is not the life or a career that I really want for myself--at least I know that I can do better than that. Now that I am 2 steps closer to graduating with my bachelor's degree, I feel more confident that I can survive and achieve in life. The best strategy that I think helped me keep my motivation is constantly reminding myself of my purpose helps me stay on the right path. Make a journal and do free writing. Express yourself and your feelings in your writing and that should help you feel a little better than keep going. Be sad but never stop!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,71,Personally I am not a person who has trouble staying focused so I will continue to stay focused and not procrastinate on any assignments or work I have. I like to get my home work or anything in general done as soon as possible so I think by doing this it helps me not stress about having to do something last minute because I was not focused or I procrastinated. I also like to stay organized and write out what I have to do for each week which I believe helps me stay focused as well.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,65,"There are many strategies that I could put in place to keep me focused. I have personally been having a tough time keeping on track and focused this semester due to classes being online. To help me stay more focused I think I should get back into religiously using my planner. I used to write down every single task that I needed to get done down, no matter how big or small of a task it was. Recently I have not been doing this. I think writing everything down gives me more motivation to get it all done. It is satisfying to look at a long list of things and have them all be checked off, it gives me a since of accomplishment. Along with that, I should portion up my time in a better way. When we still had class in person, I did not really have to think about when to get my work done, since I would do all my class work in class and do my homework/ studying in between classes. Now that I am at home all day it is hard for me to know when to get started on my work and how much time I should set aside to work on things. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,62,"The strategies that I could put in place to keep me focused through the end of the semester is not procrastinating, completing my work ahead of the due date instead of a few hours before it is due. I will accomplish this by writing out a to do list and making sure I complete all of my assignments on that list before I go to bed. I will organize this list by completing the assignments before it is due so I am less stressed and have more time to study for exams instead of rushing to finish my homework. Also, I need to find a way to regain motivation, as I am feeling a bit burnt out. I took a heavy load of classes last semester (spring), 12 units of heavy classes in the summer, and another load of harder classes this semester and I never seem to catch a break. I know that we are almost done with the semester, and I could grind out the next 7 weeks or so. I am looking forward to having a month off in the winter, so that is my biggest motivator! "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,73,I think that to keep myself focused through the end of the semester I need to keep with the current schedule I have and within keeping it I can ensure I don't fall off the wagon and get distracted doing anything else. Also another thing we could do to keep ourselves on task we can take breaks to keep our minds fresh and not wandering. Sometimes I find myself getting caught up on a problem and not knowing what the answer is or how to get it but after taking a break (long or short) I am able to come back to it and look at it from a different perspective.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,79,"It's been hard to focus on school while being at home because there are so many distractions, but there are a couple of things that have helped me concentrate on my courses. One of those being my roommates. We try to do our assignments together in the living room so we can encourage each other to finish our work. Another thing that helps me concentrate and stay motivated is making a todo list. I typically write down all of the assignments I have due and their due dates, then I stick them to my calendar and remove them when I finish an assignment."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,57,"I have a degree to obtain, so it a marathon race and not a sprint. Every week's assignment is helpful for the long run. Also the deadlines really help keep me on track even though i may tease with the deadline time."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,68,"I personally set goals for each week to keep myself on track in different courses. I jot down all of the important dates, so I would know when a specific test or assignment is due. It took me a while to get on track with my physics class to learn the techniques that help me specifically, and that's obvious by the grades from the start of the semester by now. I think another important element to keep students focus on the course is some time off. some weeks I study a lot at the weekends and some during the week since I work, but some weeks the productivity is low, and that where I know I need to rest and take some time off of studying and that really helps too. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,70,"I know for myself that motivation and trying to keep up with school have honestly been a struggle for me. I have been finding myself motivated to work one day and the next day not having the capacity to go to class or turn in assignments. Somethings that I have found that has helped me keep up my motivation to get through this semester is that I watch motivational videos every morning when I wake up, watch TedTalks on various topics, go outside and get fresh air, or even just shower and change into nice clothes to get my head in the right mindset. I have noticed that my work ethic is based on my mindset for the day. If I feel lazy then I wont get anything done. If I stay in pajamas then I feel lazy and just lounge on the couch. But things like listening to motivational speakers really helps reminds me of what I am trying to achieve and to maintain my grades this semester. I have also noticed that being stuck in the house everyday and not being in clothes to get work done also affects my working mentality because I mix up my sleep space with my workspace and trying to see my house as both is challenging."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,67,"I think for a lot of people its the fact we are at home and comfortable that makes the learning experience much harder. Not is are we having to learn through a new medium but as well do it in an environment that is most of us have experience learning through causes the inability to focus. Now that the semester is nearing its end, this can be even more difficult. I believe making my own learning environment better would help me stay focused. This can be removing electronics from my view if they aren't being used for my learning, having my textbook near me so it makes me think about opening them. Also I maybe for early classes, doing zoom lectures outside of my bedroom with remove my habit of lying in bed while learning which makes me too comfy allows my focus to go astray. Furthermore, just having a mentality to push hard and keep up my work should help motivate me and succeed throughout the semester. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,64,"Since the classes are online now, it feels like there is a ton more work to have to do, so surprisingly what is keeping me ""motivated"" to continue with all of this is to put off all of my assignments until the day before or the day they are due. It sounds like it's lazy, but when I would try to finish everything at once in the beginning of the semester, it was absolutely horrible. With assignments due nearly every single day, I'm letting myself just do whatever is due as late as I can, life goes on outside of class and whether that's for better or worse, everything feels like a lot right now, and it is really hard to care about school things. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,53,"Sometimes it is very difficult to focus on classes when they are not on-campus or in person. Being in your own bedroom causes a lot of distractions and let's face it, online lectures are not very easy to keep your 100% attention to. To manage the campus closure in regard to classes, you have to really plan out your assignment and make sure you are absorbing the information being taught. Whether it's going over the lectures again and making study guides or asking the professor for clarification, managing your studies in each class will help you from not getting totally lost and stressed out. Furthermore, I do know about anyone else, but being in my house all day means not seeing my fellow classmates and friends at school. Not being able to meet new people at school at a new campus since I am a transfer has been super hard, so making group-me chats and review groups has helped me a lot since campus has closed. Lastly, the last thing you could be is a responsible citizen so that closures (such as with campuses) can soon end if people are social distancing and wearing proper protection. It is a shame that our government has already done a horrible job in managing the situation, so I guess we have to push for more regulation. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,69,"What I do is that I set reminders for myself to look up all the classes to make sure that I have or don't have any assignments. Another thing I do is that I set specific times for myself to make sure I do the assignments. Since the past few months have been pretty close to the same routine everyday, I always check ilearn or any other website to make sure that I'm not missing anything. Another thing that I do to keep myself focused while doing assignments is that I really like to listen to music because it helps me stay focused and blocks outside noise when there may be things or noises that can distract me. Another thing I do is that I constantly remind myself that I need to continue grinding in order for me to get where I want to be in life since my future is on my mind heavily. What I do in the present will affect my future, so I try to stay as focused as possible. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,63,"Keeping track of all my school work allows me to stay focused through the end of the semester. I'm taking 19 units and it's hard to stay on top of everything, but knowing when all my assignments are due and when my exams are to stay focused. Also having a set time each day to do my school work forces me to consistently stay focused on school."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,56,"Aya Alazzeh	Some strategies I can put into place to manage the campus closure is to create a study inducing environment at home. I prefer studying towards the evening. I also like to have showered before I study so that I feel fresh and I can focus. I enjoy studying in groups of 2-3 people maximum, or sometimes alone. Since professors are less accessible due to the campus closure I have been using lots of online resources and videos to help clear up any confusions I have regarding any subjects I am studying. Some resources I have used are khan academy, the organic chemistry tutor, and of course google and other search webs. I have also been using my email quite frankly to contact my professor, as well as some of my fellow classmates. Some other strategies or things i can do to manage my mental health would be to go on a daily walk, and do some sort of meditation every day. I also enjoy cooking and baking in order to destress, and I have learned that it is incredibly important to take some time to do something I genuinely enjoy. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,61,"The strategies i have in placed to manage the campus closure is , always stay on top of my assigments .  i have a set schedule where i attend classes , watch lectures for classes not meeting lives and completing assigments and homework . I would say it is harder to keep with my deadlines , not so much with doing the work itself . Because there is less structure in place , it is harder to lose track of what i have already done  But i have learned how to navigate virtual learning experiences such as Zoom and i do feel like having less structure helps me be more accountable for my work .  The campus closure is challenging in many ways but it has also brought a sense of piece of mind as well . By not having to go on campus , i am being protecting from contracting COVID , since i am not around as much people . I also do not have to deal with traffic , public transportation , ect . I am fully prepared to be learning vitually for the long term."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,78,I feel for me writing down what I need need to do for the whole week helps me keep track of what I need to do. If I don't write it down I will probably forget to do it because honestly I've been losing track of time because I'm inside all day everyday. I have definitely been struggling with motivation like with one of my elective classes I've forgotten to log into the zoom a couple times because I just am not into it so that makes it easier to forget about it. I had to make my schedule my lock screen to remember when and what time my classes are. I think I'm going to start waking up earlier and get ready so I fully wake up and am able to comprehend my days so I can finish the semester strong 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,60,"I really don’t know how to keep myself focused till the end of the semester so if you have any suggestions so I’m open to them. No, but on a much more serious note I know that in order to remain focused till the end of the semester I need to cut distractions and really just force myself to do my work and remain on schedule. I know that while being at home, it's become so much easier for me to be distracted but to be fair it's really hard to continue doing work when my adorable little nieces come over to visit me. I also know that I often use Starbucks as a distraction like when my mom and I go get Starbucks I know that she’ll have to do a billion other errands but I still decide to go with her even though she gives me the option of not going."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,52,"after 6 months at home from studying online to doing mainly many things virtually and being home with people all the time, it had become a little overwhelm and can be very distracted especially during time of classes or studying time. one thing I do to keep myself from being distract is create my own little study space where I can be away from other people in the house and stay focus. another thing is time management, I learned to manage my time between classes and and other things I need to do and find times later in the day to study and do homework. Also, I try to remember and remind myself about my goals and the reasons why I am in school right now, so I stay motivate and focus."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,51,"This semester I have found it to be especially hard to stay focused during Zoom classes that are held synchronously. I like being to work ahead and rewatch recorded videos as well as the recorded Zoom classes; however, I would like to get better at not getting distracted during Zoom meetings/classes. I have started hiding my phone away from plain view so I don’t feel tempted to get up and grab it. I also want to regularly get up and walk around so I am not sitting for hours on end with no physical activity. Even if I have to take my laptop with me to walk around my house during my lectures, I will do it to ensure that I don’t get bogged down physically and mentally."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,66,I have started to workout everyday as a form of stress relief and as a form of moving around and not just sitting in my desk all day. I feel like it has not only helped me become a better student but it really has a become a part of my daily routine. It has been very stressful though. The whole time that I have been home I have loved it because I did not realize how much I miss it but at the same time I come to realize why I decided to move to in the first place. I want to be my own independent person I here I am listening to my parents again. It is difficult but again a good workout really helps to focus. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,76,"Last semester when the campus closed it was really hard for everyone because the reason why it closed was due to Covid-19. It has been a tough year for the world and millions of people have died due to COVID-19. Everything is still so surreal to me and although it is still scary I feel like I can manage it better than in the beginning. Before campus closed I was scared of life to get COVID-19 since there are so many people on campus and I was glad they closed it. It was hard transitioning to online classes for many reasons such as not having access to a laptop and or wifi, having too many siblings and not having enough room/space, and not having anywhere to live (for the students who live on campus). I personally struggled with having access to wifi and not having space at home to do my work. The strategies I’ve been using are working with what I have and making the best of it and looking at the positive side of it. I live by this phrase “control the controllable”. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,77,"Honestly, it's been really hard to stay focused and motivated while doing online learning. I try to tell myself it's ok to have a hard time since many people are. But, I am trying my best to keep a general schedule of when I should be getting my work done. Showing up to classes is only part of it. The hard part, for me, is getting the work done outside of class. I get really easily distracted so minimizing distractions is extremely important. I don't like working in silence so I usually will look up some chill study mixes on youtube to listen to while I do my work. I have been just taking everything day by day and week by week, trying not to focus on too many things at once, otherwise, things get jumbled in my brain. It's been hard but I will get through it and I hope everyone in my class is doing okay during this time as well! "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,59,"The strategies that I have to keep me motivated till the end of the semester are just the same strategies that I used in the beginning of the semester, which are: going to bed early (since I would have to commute if we were on the campus, so I had to wake up early to catch an early train), writing down all of my assignments in an agenda, work on some of the assignments early in the morning before my classes start and finish the rest of the assignments while I wait for my other classes to start. Another strategy that I have is to do all of my school work on the days that I have class and days that I don't have class to not do any work, that way I don't get burned and I can take that day to reset my mindset. The very last strategy that I have is that while I am class I am in my parents room because it is much quieter in there and there are not a lot of distractions in the room.    "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,55,"One of the things I have recently started trying to do to keep myself focused on studying is not worrying about “how long” I’m studying for. I’ll grab a sheet of paper and completely fill it out, front and back, with the notes from a chapter or lecture I’m watching/reading. Once I’m done with that sheet of paper I’ll take a break. I try to not be hard on myself about how long my breaks are, but I do make sure to go back and do another sheet of notes. I keep doing this until I’m done with readings for the day or until I finish the chapter. I’m not as consistent as I’d like to be but I try. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,75,"The pandemic and staying at home affected me a little to focus on my classes because there are many distractions. I added all due dates and important dates on my calendar with alarms; therefore, I won't miss any assignments or projects. I check my iLearn every day to make sure I did not miss anything. I try to do my homework earlier than their due dates; thus, I won't panic. While doing it, I like to use the ""Flip"" app on my phone; it is a focus timer for study. The application allows me to focus on my studies and limits me to use my phone. I try my best to do all my assignments on time. Because of busy work schedules, I had to stay up all night to finish all of it. I always do all of my homework and projects on Friday, that way I can relax and have fun on weekends."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,72,"First step is not to feel discourage. I was working so hard throughout my community college thinking the day that i will finally transfer to a university to finish what it seems a long journey for me, and the lock down happened. Since it looks like we are going for another semester off campus i will definitely  work on my schedule. Trying not to get overwhelmed by doing a better job at managing my time. ( too many classes this fall).Then i will definitely reach out more to my professor during office hours because i feel specially during exams that if there is a question i don't understand i am on my own ( that prove terrible so far for me this semester). And finally i will have time for me to have breaks. Been coup out in one small area puts more stress and depression when i want to take a break or rest. Unfortunately i cant do nothing about that for the moment but i do can unplug from everything and try to read or do some activity that will put my mid off the stress of school. Perhaps little projects could sound promising. "
