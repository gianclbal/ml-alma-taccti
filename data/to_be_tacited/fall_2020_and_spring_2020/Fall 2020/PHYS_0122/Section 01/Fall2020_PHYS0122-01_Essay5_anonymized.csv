2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,55,"How is physics relevant to music today?Music would be impossible if physics did not exist because the production of sound is through sounds waves with varying amplitudes and frequencies. If a musician were to study physics, they would be able to analyze which soundwaves appeal to certain parts of your brain. They would also be able to realize that there are certain sounds that work together in harmony, like crests that crash together and become larger, and that there are parts of sound waves that do not function together, like a crest and a trough which would go back to equilibrium. Not only could artist use this understanding to produce better music, but they would be able to produce music that is healing. With our understanding of soundwaves, people have also begun to understand music therapy and the benefits it can have of children who need learning adjustments."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,78,A question I could formulate would be from the current portion of our class. How does current flow from one object to another? The direction of an electric current is by convention the direction in which a positive charge would move. The current in the external circuit is directed away from the positive terminal and toward the negative terminal of the battery. Electrons would actually move through the wires in the opposite direction. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,75,"The voltage lab might be used to benefit society. We use electricity for everything such as plugging appliances or charging our computer or phone. I learned many things from the voltage lab. A current is a simple circuit consisting of one loop, and the current flows continuously. A voltage is a measure of how much work it would take to move a unit charge from one place to another. Two or more devices which are in series are connected in the same branch. Therefore they have the same current passing through them. Two or more devices which are in parallel are connected independently between the same two points. No matter how many batteries are wired in parallel, the voltage will be equal through each battery. Resistors are just circuit elements that have resistance. The amount of resistance is equal to the amount of battery and the quantity of battery. Each parallel resistance has the same amount of battery voltage and the quantity of battery. A room heater is an everyday example. The resistance of the heater permits a certain amount of current to flow to provide a certain heat. This lab is very useful to learn and use it in everyday life. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,53,"What is the Doppler Effect and how is it applied in our daily lives? How is the doppler effect different for sound than light?The Doppler Effect is a wave phenomenon that is the change in frequency that results from a change in wavelength caused by the movement of a wave source as seen by the observer. Frequency is related to the velocity of a moving object so as the velocity increases, so does the doppler effect. The faster something is moving, the smaller the wavelength and the bigger the shift. The Doppler effect is used in types of radars today that measure the velocity of a detected objects. For example, law enforcement use a radar to detect speeding drivers as it comes towards or away from them. Another application of the Doppler Effect is that it is used my meteorologists to track weather conditions such as storms. It can also may even be used in medicine to diagnose certain conditions, such as with the heart. The Doppler Effect effects sound differently than light waves since only sound waves require a medium to transmit waves. For sound waves, the doppler effect is dependent on the speed of the thing that is creating the sound waves and the observer who is listening to said sound. But this is not the case for light waves since there is no medium required. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,56,"Aya AlazzehJournal #5One concept that was covered in class thus far has been the magnetic field. In specific, the magnetic field on a moving charge. The equation that describes the relationship between the magnetic field and a moving charge is defined as: Magnitude if the force= F= qvBsintheta. Theta is described as the angle between the B field vector and the velocity vector. “Q” stands for the charge and is measured in Coulombs. “V” stands for the velocity and is measured in meters per second or m/s. “F” stands for the force and is measured in units of Newtons or N. Finally, “B” stands for the magnitude of the magnetic field as if measured in teslas or units of T. We learned that the faster the particle is moving or the greater the velocity of the particle, the greater the calculated force. We also discussed in lecture that if the charge has a velocity of zero and it is not moving, the force will be calculated as zero. Another key concept we learned about was that only the component of motion that is perpendicular to the magnetic field lines produces a force. Finally, we learned and saw in examples that magnetic fields can exert force on both bar magnets and on moving electric charges. We practiced using the equations and concepts we learned by applying them to our homework on Pearson, as well as on our first midterm. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,62,"Question:  Mirrors -- How do they really work? Answer: I wanted to first discuss how this is applicable to my life and others people life. Mirrors are used in everyday lives, whether we like to admit it or not. We use mirrors when get ready in the morning, wash our faces in the bathroom, etc. It is very difficult to avoid mirrors in our everyday lives. It is also very important when driving, knowing how to safely change lanes will be extremely difficult without mirrors. It would be a huge hazard to try to change lanes without mirrors or having rear view mirrors. Mirrors basically work by reflecting light off an object and reflecting that image. The topic of reflection from light goes hand in hand with the main concept of forming images with our eyes from light reflection. What we see is basically light reflection, every image has light reflected off of it and what we see is the light that is reflected back to our eyes. There are also two types of mirrors, spherical mirrors. There are concave and convex, and based on the mirror being used, there could be inverted or real images. Another fun fact about mirrors is that you do not have to be the same size as the mirror, the mirror could be half your size and you could still see your whole body. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,57,"The concepts we have learned in the last few weeks have been very educational in shaping our understanding of why and how mirrors that we look at every day work, the lenses from glasses to telescope function and giving us the ability to see that which lies far beyond our reach.  Why are traffic lights red amber and green? Well from the  Continuous Waves lecture and looking at a chart it can be seen that red amber and green have the longest wavelength, red the most among them. This makes the colors able to be seen in broad daylight and red the most obvious to be seen. Even in a fog a red light will travel farther (less scattered) to be seen signaling ""STOP"" hence red lights in the rear always on to show the presence of a car and when brakes are applied the red light is intensified. This shapes how traffic lights are used in the most efficient manner for safety."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,76,"Does the number of coils matter?When we did the lab ""Electromagnets"" I learned a few things such as how to build a magnetic field and how easy and fun it is! It was a fun activity that we all did and my first time building one. This helped me understand and visualize how everything works- how the electrons transfer and the cause and effect. When we first started we tried getting paper clips when the magnetic field was unmodified and it didn't work -it didn't attract any paper clips because there was no electric current. After that, we wired around the bolt 20 times and it was able to pick around 4-5 paperclips. We then wired around the bolt 50 times and it was able to pick all the paper clips which were a total of 10. I learned that the more coils it has the more it can pick more paper clips because when there is an increase in the number of loops (on the simulation) the number of electrons increases which means that it makes the electromagnet stronger enabling it to pick up more paper clips. In conclusion, the number of coils does matter and it's important!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,60,"After going through and recalling some of the lectures and labs done in physics over the past few weeks I have formulated a question surrounding reflection and snell's law. How can understanding how reflections and snell's law actually translate to everyday life and is there real life examples of this that I haven’t noticed in the past. When looking back and recalling the relationship between the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection I realized that this relationship and the snell's law equation has been used as a common visual effect at Disneyland. I don’t remember the exact name for this effect. I think it is called “Pepper’s ghost” and it is most famously used on the haunted mansion ride at Disneyland. During the ride there is a ballroom scene and there are what appears to be ghost dancing and eating in the ballroom. It really is an amazing practical effect because the figures look very realistic and translucent but have an amazing amount of detail. This practical effect is achieved through a reflective panel of glass, lights, figures that will be seen as ghosts, a completely black room, and the actual room where the figures appear. It is actually a very simple practical effect but only achieved once reflection is better understood especially in terms of light because there are figures that appear to be flying but are actually on the ground in the black room and they are made to look as if they are up in the air through the angle at which the glass panels and light are placed. It is a little more difficult to explain in text but it is so simple and now better understanding how the law of reflection and incidence relate, it is easier to overall understand the practical effect."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,58,Can light get rid of light ? Light is a wave. Water is the wave that we are most familiar with. All wave act the same when it comes to constructive interference where to high points from the wave add up to creat a higher point . But we also have destructive interference where the high and low wave interact so the amplitude cancels to and you get nothing so would this just produce darkness? This is interesting because with this you can produce another synthetic light to produce darkness and thus help people who have night job be able to get their dark day to sleep 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,51,"In the past few weeks, I feel like we have been working more and more with real life examples of physics and not just with topics like current and electricity where you can't physically see the electrons moving. With lenses, the information is important because it can help develop better glasses and contact lenses for people who need it the most. Light waves are everywhere, and being able to learn how to harness the most basic light waves, sunlight, more efficiently, I think we would be able to do a lot of good. There are already more and more houses in my neighborhood and surrounding neighborhoods that have started to install solar panels. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,67,"What is the difference between concave mirrors and lenses.A mirror is a smooth, highly polished glass surfaced which images may be formed by refection. Concave mirrors are converging mirrors. The reflecting surface is towards its center. The image would always be inverted and magnified. The focal length are always positive and the object distance positive. Concave mirrors have negative focal length, producing a virtual image and diminished image. Thus the image formed is smaller than the actual object. Image distances are always negative for virtual images and positive for real imagesObject distances should always be positiveReal images are always inverted and virtual images are upright. f is positive for a converging lens or mirror "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,52,"one concept that was covered in class in the past view week is geometrical optics. we were looking discussing the concept of different types of mirror and lens. we also were studied the concept of refraction. one question I would have is how do we apply these concept in our everyday life? these concepts are very useful and practical in our everyday life. we see mirrors and lens in a lot of places and in many things that we use everyday but I don't think many of us understand how the concept and ideas beside the use of different mirror and lens. Or why do we sometime see images of objects are bigger, smaller, closer, and farther. for examples, the side mirrors and the rear view mirror in our car. these mirrors are there so that we can see what going on around and behind the car while we are driving, they are safety features design to protect us and ensure safety for everyone on the road. We only applied these concepts to help correct our vision in wearing prescription glasses. Others useful application are for design or decoration of objects and photography too. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,79,"I am not so sure what to choose but one of my favorite lessons we had in this course was the circuit lessons. I think it was my favorite because it was one of the simpler lessons in this course and it was also pretty interesting. I found it interesting how circuits work because we've used them for most of our lives, but we were not too sure how they actually worked. Circuits were pretty cool because they use the energy from the batteries to the wires than to the bulbs. I always wondered how that actually worked on a more molecular level."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,61,"One example of a concept i think is relevant to everyday life is the concepts of reflections , such as Snell's law and  sound and continuous waves .  How these things relate to our everyday life is , we see reflections all the time . Looking into a mirror is an example of reflections . Rainbows are examples of reflects .  Taking a picture is an example of reflections . We interact with reflections all the time .  The same can be said for waves . Waves are a form of an energy that is all around us . Whether it is sound waves from a speaker or waves generated in the ocean . We can both see and feel the energy of waves .  another example of Physics in everyday life is electric currents .  Electric current supply us with the power we need and use constantly . Every appilance needs a certain amount of current and voltage to operate .  Electric currents also supply us with light in the form of lamps , lighhtbulbs ect.  Overall there is many different concepts in physics that we interact with , these are just a few examples."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,72,"I would say the past few classes were quite challenging for me but I've learned a lot. One question I have was about the lens lab and refraction. I was sort of confident with the convex and concave results but I would say that the image reflected behind the mirror is the object image that is a real image. I would also like to formulate the question about if the image is real then is it converge or divergent ? i would say that A real image occurs where rays converge, whereas a virtual image occurs where rays only appear to diverge"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,71,"One of the topics that we covered that slightly confuses me still is Snells Law. Another topic I get confused with is mirrors. Its not so much that the concept is hard to understand, but when I have to use the equations, they confuse me a little bit.I think Snells Law and the topic of mirrors can both be applied to real life. For example, Snells Law can be used to measure angles in different mediums like water or glass. Mirrors can be used to determine how far away objects are that appear in them and determine if they are real, fake, upright, or inverted."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,59,"The concept that I am going to be talking about is mirrors and thin lens because I still get confused on how the light reflects off of them and I am still a little confused on what makes a converging and a diverging lens. For a mirror, it changes the direction that the light seems to come from, meaning that an object that is in front of the mirror will appear to be behind the mirror. Also for mirrors, the object that is front of the mirror that is a certain distance away will appear behind the mirror at that same certain distance away. A concave mirror produces real and inverted images. For a convex mirror, the objects appear to be closer than what they actually are. The index of refraction is used to describe the speed of light in a medium and how it compares to the speed of light in the air. A converging lens takes parallel light rays and focuses them to a point, while a diverging lens takes parallel light rays and disperses them. A converging lens has thin edges and it is very thick in the middle, while a diverging lens has thick edges and a thin middle. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,66,Wavelengths: Wavelengths is important subject in my part because I play an instrument. Understanding the physics that play a part on making my instrument make a sound helps me understand my instrument better over all and the sound I am projecting. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,68,CH-23Consider a rectangular loop of wire 7.2 cm by 8.5 cm in a uniform magnetic field of magnitude 2.0 T. The loop is rotated from a position of zero magnetic flux to a position of maximum flux in 19 ms.What is the average induced emf in the loop?ANS: Loop Area (A)=7.2*8.5=61.2e-4 m^2B=2Tmaximum magnetic flux=BA=2*61.2e-4dt=19mse=0.64 V
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,74,"Since we just finished the 2nd-midterm I can't think of any questions or concerns yet. But I must say that the simulations for online lab is still entertaining tho learning and understanding the concept for each topic is important to appreciate the simulation more. There were times that I'm having a hard time using the simulation despite that instructions are already provided. Sometimes it takes a while before I can finally learn how to use the buttons. On the other hand, I am really happy that this class is not giving us students a lot of pressure. Both teachers in lab and lectures are being so understanding and doing their best to accommodate everyone's needs--at least in my case. I do appreciate that teachers did not discourage me to continue this class despite the classes I missed. I am happy that I was given a chance to show that I can learn Physics and that it is possible for me to get an A despite all the struggles. Know that I am grateful for your help and for your support! I can't thank you enough but know that I will never forget that for once I enjoyed learning Physics because of you! --but NO plans in changing my major tho. (Haha!) Thank you, Leslie! You're the best!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,69,"The question that I formulated was based on the Lenses Lab. The question is, how can you differentiate converging and diverging lenses and what are they used for?The answer to this question states that converging lenses are convex while diverging lenses are concave. Convex means that the lens is thin at the edge and thick in the middle, meanwhile concave is the exact opposite where it is thick at the edge and thin in the middle. The other difference is that rays pass through the focal point in converging lenses meanwhile the rays come from the focal point in the diverging lenses. The focal point also means where the rays meet. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,77,"What happens to an image's distance when you increase the object's distance?In the lenses lab, we learned about different types of lenses, such as concave and convex lenses, and how object distance affects image distance. We also learned about focal length and how that plays a role in how we perceive an image through a lens. Through the lab, I found out that if you increase an object's distance, the image distance actually gets smaller, and vice versa. The farther away an object, the smaller the image distance. But changing the object distance doesn't change the focal length of the lens. it's not affected. I think this information is useful because as someone who wears glasses, it's interesting to know how lenses work and how they can help someone see better. Many, many people wear glasses of some sort so it's beneficial to learn about how these lenses can be useful in many ways."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,64,"Are the electrons that run through electrical currents all just lone electrons from no specific molecules or elements? From the various lab phet simulations we have done, we can tell that they are both positive and negatively charged particles, but there is never a mention of what kind of molecules they come from. Would it matter what elements they are from since they are such a small particle and all that matters is the charge on it? In a setting like a chemistry class, the type of molecules we are using would be very important to know, but it seems like in physics class we don't need to know what type of molecules they are and I wonder if that is just because of it being a begining physics class, or if it truly doesn't matter in the context of an electrical system. Are the cations and anions just pulled from the air around the electrical system? "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,73,"Can knowing lens and mirror information help with photography?It seems that to be a good photographer it is necessary to know all the components of a camera but also know a lot of information we learned from the mirror/thin lens chapter would help as well. Maybe more so with a film camera. It helps to know about if real images and how they would appear to be upside down and how virtual lens would appear to be right-side up. It also helps to know that an image on opposite sides would converge and images on the same side the light reflects off inside the surface of the mirror. These are important to get the perfect shot at the right time of day when the sun is in its particular place. For example a camera is like a light proof box that will allow for light to enter in one place. A camera will open its’ shutter, and the split second of light to be transmitted into the camera. The light will have the image you wish to capture. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,80,"A concept that I learned in the past few weeks was about magnetism and how it works and how we use it in physics and all sorts of other things. In physics class, we learn what magnetism was and what we could find with certain formulas, and how to use those formulas to find what we need in terms of information. We learned this through a PowerPoint filled with images and tons of examples of how magnetism works and how it taught us about the magnetic field and how compasses work to find true north and south. This concept is used in everyday life with the use of compasses as the magnetic field in the air tells us where north and south are and can help us navigate to a place where we want to be. We also see magnetism in magnets which many people use as a toy. We learn this through practice problems and lectures which show us how magnetism works and the formulas we use."
