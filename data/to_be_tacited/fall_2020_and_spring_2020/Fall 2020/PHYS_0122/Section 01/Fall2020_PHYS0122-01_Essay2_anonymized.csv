2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,58,What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?My current goal is to survive this pandemic. I don't think we are in a time where we could really have any goals. Our futures are so uncertain to have a goal you need a steady ground to put the ladder down. My goal when this pandemic started was to get in shape but I have lost motivation so my current goal is just to maintain my current weight so i currently have no new goals I just hope  to survive and get out of this pandemic how i stared as long as i keep myself floating I'll be good.This class is helping me achieve my goal by just being online and not making me risk much it a class that'll just keep me floating in college.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,65,"My ultimate goal is to become an orthopedic surgeon. This class is helping me achieve that goal by fulfilling my physics lab requirement to apply to medical school, along with helping me study for the physics portion of my MCAT. I do not think that physics comes into play very often when you are a doctor, but I still recognize that it is an important thing to know and learn about. My goal for his class specifically is to get as much out of it as I can, and to get an A. Like I said, I am using this as an opportunity to prepare myself for my MCAT, so I want to absorb as much information as possible so I have to do as well as possible on my test without having to focus too heavily on studying the physics portion, so I can focus more on the bio/chem portion."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,52,"my goals for the next couple of years would be to complete and finish my degree in biochemistry. also I would like to have the opportunity to meet more people and form connection with people that had more experiences in the field which I want to go to in the future. after we able to get back to school normal, I hope to get a volunteer opportunity, So I can gain more knowledge and experience in the medical field. this class can help me achieve my goal because it is one of the required course for my undergraduate degree. also, this class is a opportunity for me to learn and understand more about physics concepts and ideas. We see and use physics in our everyday life and it is help to understand how things functions. even though, we all studying online right now but this class also give me a opportunity to actually see and talk to people in the class."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,72,My goal is to finish school in the given time and I think physics can help me build the background necessary to have a good understanding of how matter interacts with energy and how machinery works. As time has passed I started to enjoy more about physics. When i was a student in high school we didn't have physics labs. It was all lecture classes and I remember I wish we had one. But nevertheless I enjoyed going to class.  I also think that having a knowledge of different science that helps understand and help contribute when giving an opinion or a thought. I enjoy particular labs and I really have enjoyed this class so far even though it is a remote class because I can still practice fun and interesting experiments. Also it has helped me understand more about how things work in my daily life by providing the science background. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,66,My goals for this class at the beginning of the year was just to pass the class and move on. However now that I am doing the work and actually enjoying the lab I want to learn to more. I actually want to understand these things. I really hope that at the end of this class I will be able to understand the physics around me in an everyday life. I am enjoying this class a lot more that I thought I was going to enjoy it and simply saying that is a shock to me. I really hope this class only get better.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,71,"My goals as of right now are simply to do well in every class this semester. Although I guess my goal is to always do well in anything I do. This class is a part of my goals so by doing well in it, I am achieving part of my goals. Of course I have other future goals as well, but I like to stay present and focus on goals right in front of me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,77,"My goal is to graduate and either go to grad school to become a PA or a nurse practitioner. This class is required for me to graduate and is mostly the reason I am here but I have never really been good at physics so I'm hoping to at least come out of this class understanding what I've learned. So far, the labs and different assignments in class have helped. I feel a lot better about this semester as opposed to my physics class last semester. I think a lot of the simulations in the lab are super helpful because I'm a visual learner so it's helpful to picture what's actually going on. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,75,"My goal is to be happy, do whatever job that I want to do, and be healthy. I want to become a dermatologist; therefore, after SFSU I will go to a medical school. Because I am majoring in Biology, more focused on Physiology, Phys 121/122 is my prerequisite. Even though this class is a prerequisite, I want to learn more physics and use it in my everyday life. This class will improve my knowledge and build up my strength. Not only this class but all of my classes will also teach time management, increase my motivation, gives focus, help to boost my self-confidence, provide challenges, and learn how to resolve it. This class gives very good challenges which push me to think more. With the help of lab experiments, I able to understand the topic more, able to experience myself, resolve difficulties, and the labs provide very good challenges to push myself."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,76,"I have a lot of goals but right now my main goal is to graduate next year by Fall 2021. Passing this class will help me accomplish my goal because it is a requirement for my degree and a prerequisite for other classes I will take next semester. Taking this class has helped me understand the science behind the activities we do and how our world and universe functions. One of my other goals is to be able to go to a 2 year Radiology program at CCSF and for that to happen, I need to take pre reqs for that program as well, so taking this class is useful and one of the required classes in order to get in. This class is extremely important to me and important for my current and future education. Ultimately, my goal for this class is to be able to comprehend it to its full extent, not just some parts."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,63,My goals currently is to prepare myself for DPT school and fulfill all my requirements. This class helps me achieve my goals by being one of the prerequisites for DPT school. I also know that physics is a main component of biomechanics and having a better background in physics will help me succeed in that subject. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,54,"My goal is to graduate with a bachelors in science and attend vet school in order for me to become a veterinarian. I have always had a love for animals, I have volunteered several times with the SPCA and another organization that helps eldery dogs find homes, get treatment and much more. I am very excited that I am almost done accomplishing my goals. This class will help me accomplish my goal and allow me to move one more step forward to being done with school. I will be a first generation graduate in my family which is something I am very proud to say being in the stem field especially being a latina in the stem field has been really hard. I have had multiple people tell me I couldn't do it and just by getting my degree it will show so many people who didn't believe in me wrong."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,79,Some of the set goals I have for this year are to boost my GPA and get closer to graduation. I had a doughy patch the end of my sophomore and the beginning of my junior year. Sadly I ended up getting on academic probation and I got myself together now I have a 2.7 but my goal is to get to a 3.2. One other goal I have is to go to physician assistant school and become a physician assistant. I also want to invest in property to be able to have a stable life.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,55,"One of my career goals is to work in the medical field. I really enjoy helping people and I hope to become someone that people feel welcomed to talk to. I think that this class will help me achieve my career because physics is an important aspect in health care. Physics affects how a person's lungs are able to operate because of the pressure differences between the outside atmosphere and the inside of their body. Physics also affects how a person's blood and heart are able to continue working. I also think that this class can be helpful towards my career because we are encouraged to work in groups. Similarly, hospital staff typically work in teams to be able to give their patients the best care possible. Lastly, this class requires that students be able to follow instructions properly. When you are giving someone a medical procedure, you want to make sure all steps are done well so that the results are favorable."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,78,"my overall goal is to graduate and become a pharmacist. This class is going to help me graduate because it is a requirement for my major. My physics class, chemistry and math classes all go together with similar information that connect each other in a way. This class is overall going to help me in my other classes too but the main reason i am taking this class is so i can graduate with a dress in bio-physiology and go to pharmacology school. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,56,"Aya AlazzehOne of my main goals in life is to just continue to learn and grow as a person. This class will help me achieve that by aiding me in learning and internaiging many concepts in Physics. I take education very seriously and there is a reason why. My parents both immigrated to the United States in order for their children to have access to the best education possible. I was raised with a potent understanding of hard work, respect, patience, humility, and most importantly education. My family has always stressed the importance of education. Also, as a Muslim, eduaction is glorified and we are encourgaed as Muslims to be lifelong learners. Education is the barrier between tolerance, respect, and understanding between all living organisms. My parents both attained degrees and had professional careers. My dad has a degree in engineering and my mom has a teaching degree. I also have a very large family, most of which are older than me. I am super thankful and lucky to have plenty of older siblings to look up to. My eldest sister is in Veterinary school at Cornell University, my eldest brother went to UCLA medical school and is now doing his residency at Stanford University, and I have an elder sister who is in physical therapy school at UCSF. My point is that growing up I always knew that I wanted to take school and my education seriously. I have never once taken my education or school for granted. I am so lucky to be able to go to college and have dreams. I can aspire to become whatever I want to become. Many people around the globe, especially women, are not given that chance. I am always grateful and take advantage of my opportunity.   "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,67,"My goals are to graduate and maybe pursue dentistry. This class is required for me to graduate, so I am mostly taking it for the major requirement. However, I know in dentistry physics is actually quite involved, especially in if one wishes to specialize as in orthodontics. As well, physics is something at times worth learning as it explains a lot of things around us. Its just very daunting to some because of how much math it uses, which many indviduals all ready dislike math, so disliking physics isn't surprising. As for me, this semester physics has been pretty weak. Ive treated it with almost least priority because one I'm pretty much teaching my self and I am also tackling other classes that are demanding. Im still have to follow along and complete assignments.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,68,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?My goal is to learn different formulas and concepts of physics, and by the physics lab I have this opportunity to speak and get help from a instructor sort of like a traditional class, unlike our lecture class and that kind of eases my stress, since when I am in the zoom speaking or typing to my classmates, I know that I'm not all alone by myself and I can get help from my instructor or classmates. I also, can learn better when working in groups and doing internet experiments I can actually see the physical experiment happening, which is great to see that happen during homeschooling. I think if some of our classmates would be down to have our own zoom class time to practice that would have been great too, and I might offer some of classmates about that. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,70,My goals for this class is to be somewhat good at physics and learn skills to transfer to my daily life. I also hope to pass this class and become a pharmacist. I can only get this task done if I finish college! In terms of this class I feel like I am always being challenged. Physics is a hard topic for me to grasp and I constantly find myself rereading or finding other sources to help understand the material better. I feel like this class can help me understand concepts from my own major. A lot of things I learn here I feel like are transferable to my major in one way or another. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,53,"My goal is to get an undergraduate degree in biology in order to apply to medical school and become a physician in the future. This goal may seem redundant for the many pre-medical students, but it's our next step into doing something we actually want to do. This physics lab, which I'm taking concurrently with general physics, is one of the pre-requisites to complete the graduation requirement. It is also needed before taking the famous MCAT, which I should be studying harder for. By gaining physics skills now, I am able to utilize them while taking this very important exam that will get me into my dream school. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,64,"My goals are to pass this class, and get a degree in biochem. This class is required to get my degree, but besides that I do want to know more about physics and science in general. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,69,"I have many goals in my life, but the main ones are to succeed and to keep pushing through in school. I'm almost there but I know that I have to be concentrated and dedicated on achieving these goals of mine. I believe that this class could help me achieve those goals because I have to stay motivated to continue and pass the class. I have to continue being punctual and as long as I am continuing to grind on my goals I know that I will achieve them all. I have other small life goals like, growing my clothing brand business to its highest potential or traveling but I guess those don't really apply to a classroom. Hopefully I get the opportunity in this life to do everything I can while still enjoying my life rather than stressing 24/7. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,60,"My current goals right now vary depending on what timeframe I am being asked about. If asked about my goals for the end of the semester is a good grade in all my classes. This class helps me achieve that by helping me in my learning making it possible for me to succeed in this goal and get a great grade not just in the lab but also the lecture. Looking at my goals in a little bit more of a long term sense, they’d be to get into medical school in order to become the best doctor I could be. This class aids me in this because not only is it a requirement for my B.S. in Biochemistry, it is also a requirement for some of the medical schools I plan on applying to. I also think this class could really help be in understanding how to succeed in classes that I haven’t really liked in the past, which would help me in medical school for when I’m taking a class that I’m not necessarily the most excited to be in."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,57,"For this week, we will be going over voltage and understanding how it is applied in conjunction with last weeks lab of how current functions in parallel circuits and series circuits."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,59,"My goal is to graduate in the spring semester with a good GPA, and this class can help me achieve that goal because this is a class that I needed and if I pass this class with a good grade, I can cross this class off my list. In order for me to reach my goal I am going to be working really hard on every assignment that is given to me in this class and I am going to be putting my best effort into every assignment. With this I can make sure that I pass this class with hopefully a B or A."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,61,"My goals are to earn a degree in Biology and gain hands on experiences at the same time . Even though the structure of labs are different compared to the usual lab experience , i can still learn from labs .  In fact , this experience is helping in become more comfortable working almost exclusively online to compleet work and assignments .  So far i am still on tract on achieving my goals of earning my Biology degree. It might take longer due to course availability and time issues , but this whole situation has thought me to except to unexcepted and to adapt rapidly to the changing world of online and virtual learning.  "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,73,"My goal is to graduate (finally) from SFSU and go to veterinary school or if that does not work out, become a veterinary tech. Its taken awhile for me to reach this point and I am finally so close to graduating. I guess this course could help me in more ways than one to achieve this goal. The first obviously because it is a prereq so I have to take it to graduate but also because it teaches you certain reasoning abilities and teaches you brain to solve complicated problems."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,74,"It's been five weeks! Online classes is slowly getting manageable but due to everything being dependent on the internet, there are still rough days. Just like how my Voltage Feedback was accidentally uploaded on this part of the homework. As what I mentioned before on my previous responses, iLearn is still new to me and being someone who doesn't like being infront of the computer all day (but now I have to, no other option), I experience a lot of technical difficulties. I think one thing I am grateful for this semester is having my sister home. She helps me a lot with fixing problems on the internet or even how to do stuff like uploading documents from my phone or how to fix the printer when its acting up. I noticed that I am getting impatient sometimes because of my anxiety. I get nervous when taking quizzes or tests because it is on the computer and it is timed. Our internet connection sometimes is not reliable so my server would log me off out of nowhere or just like now, as I am typing this one, it keeps logging and putting it on drafts. I am still learning how to use computer but I am getting better everyday--except for my stubborn internet connection. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,62,"My goal is to get an A in this class while also learning physics. Getting an A goes hand in hand with learning physics, so I am hoping that I achieve this goal.This class can help me achieve through giving me a more thorough explanation for different physics topics through labs that only focus on specific topic. I noticed that with these past labs, it helped me learn about electrical currents better and had it ""stick to me brain"" more. I am happy I am taking this class while taking the parent lecture course. Labs have always been useful for me. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,51,"My goals are to sign up and get into the Kinesiology scholars program here at SFSU as well as get into a good DPT program at a good school. If I qualify and get in, I will work towards getting both my Bachelors and Masters in Kinesiology in roughly 5 to 5.5 years. This will make me stand out and able to apply to more competitive schools for physical therapy. This class helps me achieve these goals through allowing me to complete one of the prerequisite courses that many DPT programs look for. I think this class will also teach me many things, like how to work together through Zoom when many of my classmates are people I have never met before in person. "
