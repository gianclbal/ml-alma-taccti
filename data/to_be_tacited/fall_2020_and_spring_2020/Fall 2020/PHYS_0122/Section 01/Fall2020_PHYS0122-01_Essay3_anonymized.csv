2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,71,"One topic that we covered over the last few weeks in lecture and lab was currents and how they work through circuits. We learned how series and parallel circuits differ and how they are used in our everyday lives. For example, you can test what kind of circuit you have in your own home by checking the voltage at the outlets in your house. A parallel circuit has the the same voltage but different currents, while a series circuit has the same current but different voltages. This is how you could determine what kind of circuit is in your house if you wanted to."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,64,"If we can move negative and positive charges of a magnetic field from one object to another (like using a balloon to move charges from a wool sweater), how does this change the magnetic forces of the objects? If you are move electrons from one object to another, the original object that is losing electrons will become more positively charged, and will be more attracted to negatively charged objects. The object that is receiving the extra electrons should have the opposite effect, and become more negatively charged and thus become more attracted to objects with a mostly positive charge. The magnetic forces will either become more positive or more negative. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,67,"If you have a parallel circuit with 2 resistors and you introduce another resistor in series, how will the current be affected? What if you remove one of the resistors and parallel and introduce the other resistor in series, will the current be affectedIn a parallel circuit we know that we can solve for R by the rule Rtotal is equal to (1/r1 + 1/r2)^-1. When introducing another resistor in series, we can just add the resistor value of the new resistor into the old Total. Generally, the total R should increase, and If our battery voltage doesn't change we can assume that the current will have to decrease in our circuit. For the second question, the current would also increase as the circuit will now be in series if the other resistor is removed and thus R1 and the new R would simply just be added which generally would give rise to a larger resistor and a weaker current . I think this is one of the few things I really seem to understand throughout this learning experience currently and actually find some importance and use of application for this knowledge. Circuits have never made more sense to me until now so Im very happy with what I know and how I was able to figure this out. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,78,"My question is in the electromagnets lab why didn't my paper clips stick to the wire?over all in conclusion I think they did not stick because I didn't have the right materials, but what made them wrong? First the paperclips I got has a plastic film over them and plastic itself is extremely poor conductor of electricity but then I tried to take off the film and it still did not work so I do not know if it was because I had a nail and not a bold or if it was the paperclip not being a strong enough metal to conduct the electricity. When i put the battery against the wire through I could feel the heat being created so I know they were conducting electricity. I watched a video on YouTube though and they had a bolt and safety pins so I do feel the paperclips were not conducting electricity to be picked up."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,74,"My question is: Is it possible to use mirrors on the surface of the earth to reduce the amount of solar energy that is being trapped in our atmosphere which results in tthe greenhouse effect?After reviewing our notes for this weeks lab, I think it would in fact be possible to set up a series of mirrors to reflect the suns energy back into space. The problem though is that it would have to be an extremely large array of mirrors to make a difference, seeing as more solar energy hits the earth each day than our human civilization uses in an entire year. There would also be certain angles where the mirrors would be more effective, because the angle at which the light hits the mirror is the same angle that it will be reflected back in a V pattern like we saw in lab. The light would also reflect off of the atmosphere which would further reduce the effectiveness of the mirror array at reducing solar heat.I think that the array of mirrors would actually be more effective at blocking solar energy from reaching the earths surface if it was located in space, because the reflected energy would not have to pass through the atmosphere before being reflected back out into space."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,77,"What kind of circuits is being used in our own homes? I learned from the current lab that in our homes, the circuits are in parallel. This is so that if you were to turn off or on a light somewhere in the house, it only affects that one light and nothing else. This is so if you turn on your kitchen light, your bathroom light doesn't also turn on. When a circuit is in parallel, not everything is totally connected like it is in a series circuit. I think this was cool to learn about and something new I never thought about before. This information would be useful to know about how electricity works in your house."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,68,"since the start of the semester, the subject that I liked the most in physics so far, is the subject of current and voltage. We have two types of circuits: series and parallel and elements such as voltage, current and resistant works sort of different in each of these circuits. In a series circuit, the current that each resistor receives in the same, meaning the current passing resistor number 1 equals resistor number 2 and so on and on. However, the voltage decreases as it passes through different resistors. In a parallel circuit, the voltage each resistor receives is the same, however, the current passing through each resistor is different and can be calculated by V=IR. Learning about this subject of parallel and series circuit, reminded me of its use in Christmas lightning decoration, and by the science we learned from this course, we can predict the brightness of different light bulbs in either parallel and series circuit, or the power they will require to operate by P=V^2/R, P=I^2*RWhen lights are attached in parallel, each light is on its own circuit to the power source. If one filament burns out, it has no effect on the remaining lights, as they each continue to be in a closed circuit with the power source."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,70,"I really enjoyed the currents lab, but the question I keep asking myself is how that will help me with chemistry? I ask this question with all the labs we do because it’s an important question to understand the point of the lab. I feel like there was a strong connection to chemistry there. Especially when dealing with things measured in voltage. Although the concepts are somewhat different, I definitely saw a connection between currents and electrochemistry. The fact that there is a transfer of electrons in electrochemistry, such as things like a salt bath, it was similar to the moving of electrons in a current. The concepts are similar and I definitely learned some things from this lab that could be useful for me in my major. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,52,"one of the concept that was covered in class in the last few weeks was the concept of parallel and series circuit and how current and voltages different in parallel and series circuits and how this concept have been apply to our everyday life. there are so many things that you use in our everyday life that applied the concept of voltage, current both in parallel and series circuit, but many people tend not to understand how exactly are those things work because they had became so common in our life. for example, the electrical system in our house provide the electric to our the appliances and devices in our house. the electrical system either are in parallel or series or a combination of both circuit. in addition, many of the electronic devices we used everyday also apply the concept of circuit. this is a very useful and important concept because it makes our life easier and provide more conveniences. Electric is one of the most essential utility in our society because just imaging one day without electricity, everyone will have a very difficult time. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,79,"One of the labs that made an impact on me was the tape lab. In this lab we had to put a strip of tape on top of another strip of tape, then we had to pull the pieces apart. After we pulled the pieces apart we were able to see which piece of tape got electrically charged buy putting another separate piece of tape next the ones that we pulled apart. If the piece of tape attracted to one of the strips that we pulled apart, it meant that that strip of tape was electrically charged. I am able to use the information that I gained from this lab in my everyday life by experimenting on things that can get electrically charged. Some things that I use on the daily that get electrically charged are clothes such as socks and some times even ourselves. For some reasons I always end up shocking my sisters by accident when they touch me and now I know why that occurs."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,59,"The topic that I am going to be talking about is current. Even though I am a biology major and this topic doesn't really connect with my major or my plans for the future, it does connect with me personally. I help my dad out around the house when it comes to repairs and there is a light in our house that needs to be fixed. Having learned about currents, especially currents in a parallel and series helps me understand what it is I need to do in order to help my dad. In the current lab I learned that in a parallel current you are just adding more paths for more light to be turned and in a series current if you add more paths you are just adding more obstacles which decreases the current. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,57,"I found all of the topics very useful and educational as it relates to my life in many aspects. the topics discussed have allowed me to see how the flow of electricity works in a house among varies electrical items. V=IR has shown how current, voltage, and resistance work in a closed circuit and the virtual labs have shown how they inversely affect one another. As someone who enjoys tinkering with things it really has opened my mind of how energy is provided to the world."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,66,One of the most the interesting concepts I have learned in the lab has been the current (parallel circuit). When objects are connected through a parallel circuit than the current does not lose any current through the receptors. At that time that I was doing that lab I had some string lights that I connecting to one outlet. It was maybe abound 100 ft of string lights. The first time I plugged them in it was fin however the second time I connected them it would no longer turn on. Because I connected the system in a series the last strings light were receiving less power resulting them to be more dull them then the others. It was very helpful for me to understand how current works and what I can do to not lose power.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,53,"Why is the voltage the same throughout a parallel circuit, but changes in a series circuit? How about the opposite for currents?In a parallel circuit, the voltage is equal across all components of that circuit. This is because the voltage at each wire is the same, so all components would have the same voltage. In a parallel circuit, the current splits but the voltage does not. Think of it this way. Current in parallel wires is different because it choose the easier path. The less resistance, the more the current due to less opposition of electron flow. For example, if a river splits in two ways, the flow/speed of the rivers (voltage) would not change, but the amount of water (current) going down each river would. Nonetheless, if these rivers connect later on into one stream, the flow of water would be constant. This relates to how current is like water flowing in a single river as it flows in a specific path. This also explains why the voltage is different across each component, since in a series circuit, the current is constant as there is only one path for the current (or water) to flow. Overall, current remains the same in a series circuit while voltage remains constant in a parallel circuit. This information is useful in knowing how voltage works in our daily lives, an example being in our own houses. The voltages across all the electrical outlets in our home are parallel, which suggests that the voltages of all the outlets are approximately the same. Voltage is all around us as it is the pressure from the power of electrical circuit that pushes electrons, or current, through a loop. This then illuminating things like lights! This information is useful to know when arranging wires, so that all the lights in the house will have the same amount of brightness. Houses use parallel circuits so that current can flow through different paths and allows all lights to work independently from others. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,69,"A concept that I can think of immediately is based on currents. And without looking through the lab yet, I know that an example that we can use which would be relevant would be the current in our homes. Since we know that the circuits in our homes can be parallel if the circuit increases with each light that is turned on, we know that each beaker will be using the circuits from the box on the side of the house. And we know that since there would be more obstacles, then the current would increase as well. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,62,"A concept that was covered in class was  electric potential and a question that I have is how does E potential change as the difference between the voltage of batteries change and how is it relevant in my life? Looking through my notes, we could begin answering this question by stating that the equation for finding E potential is Epotential= delta V/delta S. We could next define these variables and say that delta V is the difference in voltage between two capacitor plates and delta s is the distance along the field line. We could then state that there is no change in the potential if you go across field lines, only if you go along the field lines. So, if the change between two capacitor plates (their voltage) is increased, then we find that the E potential also increases due to the direct relationship between. Also, as the distance between the capacitors increase, the E field deccreases due to the inverse relationship between the two. This is relevant in my life because E field and the intensity is relevant in microwaves, which is something that I use every day. Microwaves convert the electromagnetic field to thermal energy that heats up my food. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,73,"How do you maintain voltage difference between ends of a wire?To maintain voltage difference you must have a complete loop for current to flow. The current must flow through one terminal through a device. In a series two objects are connected if all the current passes through object 1 and object 2. In a parallel series the the right sides of an object are connected to the right and left sides are connected to the left. Generally, if there are more obstacles for the current to pass through then there will be less current through a segment. If there are more paths then there is more current through the segment with the battery but at a junction the current will split."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,80,A concept that was covered in class that is useful in my own life is the concept in which our biology teacher tells us to look at things which is U-ABC-IT which stands for Use evidence ask questions Be skeptical Cultivate wonder Identify confusions Think like a biologist. This helps because taking a bunch of science classes and being a biology major it comes up a lot and I have to think a lot in terms of this perspective. This is the concept in class that my biology teacher always tells us to use when thinking about other biology concepts and this helps for the most part and seeing as I will be taking many more biology courses I will use this more in the future.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,56,"Aya AlazzehOne concept that was gone over in class that intrigues me is pertaining to electric potential and magnetic fields. How can you determine the charge of an object in a magnetic field with only the field lines drawn? To delve deeper into answering this question we can see that magnetic field lines are drawn in the direction charge would go if a positive charge were introduced into the field. That being said you can determine the charge of the objects by observing which way the field lines are drawn. If the field lines are drawn pointing towards or into the object then we can conclude that the charge is negative because if a positive charge were to be placed into the field, the positive charge would be attracted to the negative object and the arrows would be pointing in the direction going towards the attracting forces. The same is true if you were to observe that the field lines were actually inting away from the object. If that is the case, then it is safe to say that the object in the field is a positive charge because like charges repel one another. Some examples of this being applied in real lids is the environment around you. Which objects are charged, and which objects do I have to worry about either strongly repelling or attracting each other. Some examples are really strong magnets, some electronics, and even some appliances perhaps. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,76,"What are Conductors and Insulators? How are they used in Physics?Before learning this topic I honestly did not know what conductors and insulators were! Now I know that they are useful for electric current. A conductor is a material that allows electric current to pass through it. However, an insulator is any material that does not allow an electric current to pass through it. They are opposite to each other but both are useful. Some examples of a conductor include metals, copper, aluminum, and steel.  Some examples of Insulators are plastic, rubber, glass, and cloth. In physics, we study conductors and insulators because we want to know how charges function. In a conductor, electrons flow freely unlike insulators prevent the free flow of electrons. We learn how the charge moves and how it can be by friction or contact and a good example that is a daily life activity for many of us is the example used in the slides. By brushing or combing our hair we are moving the charge by contact. “You can get charges to move within an object because they’re reacting to nearby charges.” that helps me understand how charges work in general but in this case how it works in insulators and conductors."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,51,"Even though I don't really see that many connections between my major and EM physics, and I saw more during mechanical physics, I still see concepts we learn in class that are very relevant to my everyday life. I learned that there are many, many parallel circuits in my house, since I have living room, kitchen, and hallway lights that are able to be controlled by two or more different switches. I have also talked to my dad more and more about circuits since he is a fiber optic engineer and works closely with EM physics on a daily basis. I think what we are going to learn today, about light and its reflection, is pretty cool as it can allow us to think about how mirrors work, as well as how light is able to be used in microscopes. I think microscopes are really cool and I always wanted to look at muscle cells through microscopes but I have no been able to yet (hopefully if I do the KIN Scholars Program which allows me to take Master's classes, I will be able to look at more microscopes). I am excited to learn more about magnetism and how it relates to my everyday life."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,75,"The electrostatic concept that covered in class connects with my major, Biology. It shows how protons and electrons attract each other also to resist each other. One major conclusion that I draw from the laboratory is that a negatively charged or a positively charged object attracts a neutrally charged object by rebelling with the same charge and attaching with the opposite charge. The electric field concept shows how electrons attract all negatively charged electrons to attract any positive charge. When there is a positive charge, the sensor's E field will move away from it. When there is a negative charge, the sensor's E field will move toward it. It means electrons, which have a negatively charged attract neutrons and protons. The length of the E field depends on how close to the charge and how strong the charge. When the sensor closes the to charge, its E field is long; while, when it far from the charge, the length is short. The electromagnetic concept shows magnetic poles always exist as north-south pairs, which means the like poles repel like and the unlike attract each other. This lab proves that the like electric charges repel, and the unlike electric charges attract each other. The force of attraction or repulsion is proportional to the distance between each charge."
