Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,51,"I am here in this class and at San Francisco State because I want to become a physical therapist. In high school, I did not do very well in academics, partly because the environment was so competitive, but also because I struggled a lot with classes and eventually just ""gave up"" on trying to do well since I felt like I could never do well. Towards the end of senior year, I realized that I wanted to help people and that physical therapy was one way that I would be able to do that. This is my third year here at SFSU, and I am starting to take more and more major classes as well as classes (like this one) for prerequisites for Doctorate of Physical Therapy programs. I want to study hard and do well in my classes so that I would be able to go to my dream school Univ. of California, San Francisco, and get a good job upon graduating. I want to be able to support myself financially and also give back to my parents and my friends who have been there for me through all the struggles and the hard times in my life. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,52,"I am here in this Physic class because first of all it is one of my required class for my degree, also I do want to learn more about physic ideas and concepts. we see a lot of things happen around us every single day but I think a lot of people don't know exactly how things work exactly. how is the light bulb work? what make the car run? all these things seem like simple things that we used to everyday but somehow they are a mystery too many people. so, I am here to hope to learn the basic concepts of physic. I am not planning on majoring in physic or go into more details physic ideas."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,53,"As I sit on my desk listening to my zoom lecture, I feel that I am here today to reach my goals in the future. By taking time to finish college and complete all my pre-requisites, I am able to set myself up to one day be able to get to medical school. By getting this biology degree, it only gets me one step closer to actually learning about the things that I want to learn about. Although I feel that there are many things still wrong about our education system and how college works, I feel that this is where I should be. I am here today following the guidelines of society, which is sad that taking risks can be so dangerous now a days if you do not do it the ""right"" way. We were all urged to go to college from the day we set into our kindergarten class and I am now here getting an education to only go to another school and continue my education even more. I am thankful for being here today, despite all the things going on in the world and struggles that others amy be going to. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,54,I am in a physics lab because not only do I need this class for my major requirements but also because I truly enjoy doing labs especially when a lab professor knows how to teach it. I am a hands on learner so I truly feel like these labs are going to be a bit hard for me because there is no actual one on one face to face with the professor. I understand material when it is shown to me not necessarily when it’s written on paper. Even though this class might be hard for me because it is not in person I truly will work my hardest to do all the labs and try to understand each concept as well as work in groups through zoom. So far the first lab we did was something I enjoyed but also was a bit difficult because the way the lab was worded was a bit confusing to me.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,55,Marilin Amaya I am in this class for the fall semester of 2020 because the physics 2 class is a requirement for my Biology major. I tried taking this class last semester but I was under a lot of stress because I was retaking a chemistry class that I had failed. I decided to drop this class last semester so that I could just focus on chemistry and pass the chemistry class. Looking back on my decision I wish I would've stuck with physics and done chemistry a different semester. Physics vocabulary isn't incredibly difficult for me because its like learning a new language for me but there are plenty of equations that I have trouble memorizing. I think that being in this lab class will be helpful because we work in groups for the most part.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,56,"Aya AlazzehI am enrolled in Physics 122 lab to fulfill an undergraduate requirement pertaining to my major. My major is Biology with a concentration in physiology. The question why am I here is so broad. Why am I in college. I am in college for a number of reasons. One of the main reasons being that I want to pursue a higher education, and cultivate my love for Biology. I consider myself a lifelong learner, as I am constantly curious about the world around me and how everything works together. I am in school to continue to learn and grow as a biologist, as a student, and as a person. San Francisco State University has a special place in my heart and in my family. When my dad was only 18 years old he traveled to the United States alone to attend San Francisco State University in order to pursue a degree in engineering. My dad attended this school, all my uncles attended this school, and many of my siblings older than me have attended. I feel like there is a part of my family’s history here at San Francisco State University, and so I feel special that I am able to attend as well. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,57,"I am here for Physics 122 which is the lab portion for Phys 121. The learning curve has been quite impacted with the political Covid-19. Even then I still hope to learn more towards my degree Biochemistry. It isn't exactly brain stimulating, but just not being in a learning environment it takes away at the learning experience and educational dynamics. So far lab 1 in its virtual state was successful and i was able to understand the fundamentals of what it was getting across. If all other virtual labs are able to deliver the same results i would say say it'll be a success because learning is the goal."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,58,Why am I here? I have  no idea to be honest . Like to be honest I didn't even know what to do after highschool. Now i'm just here trying to pass my classes so I can have a degree so I don't feel like i'm wasting my life. I'm here because I needed a new goal and this seemed like a reasonable one.Or it is what society makes me feel like is a good goal. I have no idea what i'm going to be doing after this but for now i'm here feeling like i'm doing something productive. I'm here so people dont look at me as a failure. I'm here to feel better about myself.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,59,"Why am I here? Why am I here in my room doing school work instead of on the campus? The answer is simple, I am here in my room doing school work because of the ongoing pandemic. This pandemic didn't need to happen if our politicians weren't so concerned about themselves and their wealth. They should have listened to the scientist to make sure everyone in the country could be safe, but instead they chose to ignore them and tell us the people to ignore them as well. Now the school season has started back up and some schools want kids to come back to class while others are doing distance learning. While the distance learning is good and it keeps everyone safe, it has it's complications if some students don't have the proper equipment, and opening schools back up for kids is a very bad idea since kids could spread the virus to others.   "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,60,"I’m here because this class is a requirement for my major. I do enjoy this class because of the professor, lab instructor, and the overall setting and vibes of the class but I’m not the biggest fan of Physics. My major, which is Biochemistry, is really why I’m here. I really love Biochemistry but some of the requirements, like Physics and Organic Chemistry, aren’t my favorite requirements. The reason I’m majoring in Biochemistry and seeking a higher education is in hopes of attending medical school. Besides hoping to one day become a doctor I also really enjoy learning. Learning is my favorite thing to do and I really enjoy the opportunity college has given me to explore different subjects, such as Physics, but also subjects not even in the College of Science and Engineering like my minor in Human Sexuality Studies. Going to college, especially one like San Francisco State University, has really allowed me to expand my horizons and become an even more open minded and curious person."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,61,"I am taking this course because it is a requirement for my major . During this course i hope to learn about somethings i find interesting or may have heard of .  I also have to learn skills that might apply to future class i will be taking in the future , particularly in my future science courses . I also hope to continue learning about something i learned in the pass more in depth .   In this course i hope to also refine the skills i already know , like writing good responses for labs online .  Taking online labs will be something that requires extra attention. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,62,"I am here because I am advancing in my academic goal of getting my bachelors in biology with a concentration in physiology. The reason why I came to this major , which lead me to take this class, is because I am fulfilling my goal into getting into medical school. I have always had a passion for medicine and throughout grade school, I’ve always been fascinated  in science. Whenever I had a science exam, I enjoyed studying the material. In college, I find joy in taking new biology courses and learning New things that I didn’t know before. If I were to be any other major, I would not be taking this class. If I didn’t take summer classes to get ahead, again, I would never be in this class. I could always “thank” the pandemic for giving me the chance to take five classes in the summer and getting ahead to the point where I could take this class. Now that I am thinking about it, a lot of factors lead me to be exactly right here in this moment — in lab at 9:30 on a Tuesday. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,63,"""Why am I here?"" I saw this question as why am I in school. I'm here because I want to go to graduate school. In order to become a physical therapist, I need to take specific perquisites before I can apply and this class is one of those prerequisites. I'm passionate about the field and I want to use the opportunity to help those that are less fortunate and at the same time, help support my family."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,64,"Why am I here? That's such a big question and I just woke up. I am in college because I like learning, and want a good job that pays enough where I don't have to work crazy hours at a job I absolutely hate just to stay alive. I am here because I think science is super interesting even though sometimes I don't feel that good at it.  I would want a job that has meaning and would benefit the world. I am here in my bedroom doing physics because of the new corona virus. I miss real life classes I don't feel like I'm learning or retaining anything I'm learning through these online classes. I thought taking a lot of online classes this semester would be a good thing since we would all be in lock-down and I felt motivated, but don't think I will take a lot of online classes next semester, or at least not a bunch of early ones like I did this semester. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,65,"I am here because it is a pre requisite for my major, biology. I am not really a fan of physics to be honest. I have never been great at math and I prefer sciences like bio and chem. This is my last semester of physics so after that I will hopefully never have to do it again. I will have to use my physics knowledge on my MCAT so that is another reason I am in this class, to prep me for my MCAT and because it is a requirement for medical school to take a year of physics. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,66,I am here in Physics 122 because of the course pathway that is required for major. I am not very good at physics it has never been my strong suit and the idea that I have simply made it this far demonstrate to me that I can do this. I hope to understand physics and maybe one day be able to say that I understand at least the basics. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,67,"I am here because I still want to continue my educational path forward even through this difficult time. Like most of my fellow classmate, we are all unfortunately forced to be contained in our homes instead of a normal learning environment. As a result, learning and studying has been much more difficult because of how different it is. Thus, I would confidently say my learning capability and performance has been greatly affected by staying at home. I already dropped a class since I wasn't confident on doing well. But, nonetheless I know its necessary for myself to try and push forward even with the situation as it's better to still learn than do nothing instead. So I can make the claim I have no choice being here, but I am here to fulfill my undergrad requirements, since its required for my major. It all honesty I dont really want to take physics but its an interesting class nonetheless. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,68,"I guess I am here since I have a physics lab with the coolest instructor. Meanwhile, at this class, I'm going to experiments regarding the physics hypothesis and theories alongside my groupmates. My purpose for taking physics is to have it as a prerequisite to fulfill my degree as a cell and molecular biology major. Otherwise, I'm not a physics person at all and I hope this semester goes well since the classes are remote and we students no longer have the traditional classes anymore. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,69,"I am here at SFSU because I am going to school to earn a degree so that I can be successful in my future. I am here because my parents wanted me to stay close since I grew up in SF and so they didn't want me going across the country to go to school. I am also here because my older brother goes here so I felt like my parents wanted me to follow in his footsteps, so I just chose the closest school around me. I am here so that I can help make a difference and help others in any and every way that I can. By being given this opportunity to go to school, my goal is to be the best person I can be. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,70,"This is something that I am always contemplating. In terms of this class I am only really here for my major. The fact that I am trying to become a pharmacist, it is only natural that I have to be a Bio-chemistry major. I am really bad at chemistry and physics though. In terms of physics I never took this kind of class until I was in college. It is pretty confusing and does not come easy to me. The concepts are somewhat easy to understand and I can see how the math works. However, I don’t know it’s weird because I have the formulas and can understand the basis of the problem but can never really answer those hard physics problems I faced in Physics 111. All in all I’m here to pass this class and get on with my dream! "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,71,I am here in this class to get to where I want to be in the future. This class is just part of a long path that I am taking in order to eventually get to the career I want. And I am also here typing this on my computer from home right now because of COVID-19. Hopefully things get back to normal soon because I miss the in-person class environment. I feel like I focus better and learn better in general when classes are in person. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,72,I would say the main reason I'm here in school is to learn. I am the type of person that always seek to understand things or how things works. It is something I've always asked myself why things work the way they do? Since i was little my dad used to say that whatever you learn at school you should always use it to improve your everyday lives. The most recent project I had to use my knowledge about forces was to make a clothesline in my backyard. Since the lock-down began it was really hard to find many places open or functional. One of the problems I had with my local laundry mat was having trouble keeping coin change as well as broken machines. So I decided to make my own clothesline but the design of my backyard didn't allow me for a simple line nail to the wall. I had to come up with a different design that allowed me to remove the clothesline when needed. I use the understanding of forces to create the leveling effect without having to drill walls and be removable. Physics and the knowledge of forces helped me out to design it while  taking in consideration many obstacles. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,73,"My name is Chelsea. I feel like I often ask myself this question but lets see. I guess I'm here today (in this physics course) to fulfill my requirements to graduate and become a vet. I decided I wanted to be a vet or ta least a vet tech almost only a year ago. For so long, being chinese american, I had it in my head that I ""wanted"" to be a doctor/nurse. But then for so long I struggled with school, with wanting to finish school etc. I found it hard to not have encouragement to finish school and becoming something I wasn't sure about and being told TO finish school and that I was SUPPOSE to become those things. I don't really do well with being told to do something. For some reason school has just been really hard for me, but I know, its hard for everyone but after starting at SFSU I felt I knew what I wanted to do and where I wanted to be with my own. I still have about two semesters left, it has been a different experience for me going from community college to sfsu. I was able to finally get good grades, even in the classes that I wasn't good at and just feel comfortable where I am at. Something that motivated me was that in chemistry in community college, I did horribly at, so at sfsu I was frightened that it would be the same but I actually did very well in my chemistry classes, and I was a chemistry learning assistant for a semester and my instructor even said I should minor in chemistry! Words I never thought I'd hear. That kept me going and really motivated me to keep doing well. The next semester my instructor in Pre-Calc told me to minor in math! Also something I didn't ever think Id do."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,74,"I am in Physics II (PHYS 122) because first of all I am a pre-med student. Not only that this class is a requirement for my major but also physics is in fact come to play in our everyday life. Though I must admit that I am really having a hard time understanding physics. At first I thought that physics is more like math. Solving problems and just all about calculating numbers, but after taking my first semester of physics, I realized that physics is a combination of science and math. I hate math which makes it even harder for me to love and learn physics. Whenever I see weird and very complicated numbers that requires long calculations, right then, I give up. Physics thought me how to change my bad habit. I don't quit when there's harder problems. I start thinking of other ways in which it will be easier for me to understand concepts and not just solving or getting the right answer. I try to spend more time studying for physics compared to my other classes. However, because of our current situation right now having to take classes online, and having an asynchronous class, my struggles in physics is back. I don't know how and what strategies I should do to be able to succeed in this class but I am for sure to give my best so I can get an A at the end of the semester.PS: Thank you for this week's lab. I like that you are doing the powerpoint and lecture. Our lecture class doesn't do that or maybe I'm just having trouble understanding the lecture. Anyway, I hope we keep our labs like this. It’s much easier to understand concepts this way."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,75,"The reason why I am here (PHYS 122) is that I want to learn or understand the topics of physics. I am taking physic classes because I am majoring in Biology in Physiology as a focus. After attending the San Francisco State University, I will transfer to Medical School because I want to become a dermatologist. I want to transfer to UCSF or the University of Washington as my graduate school. I want to study hard, get a good grade, and get in the Medical School that I want to get in. However, most importantly, I want to understand the topics and use them in real life. In this class, I want to improve my teamwork skills and communication skill. I want to be a better person than yesterday’s self and improve every day. I want to be a good person, a good student, a good daughter, and a good future doctor."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,76,"I am here because I am a Biology major and this class is one of the prerequisites for my major. I have taken a Physics class previously in high school, but looking back I didn’t really learn much and did not understand the full concept of what Physics actually was and the point of it.  I am here because I want to broaden my understanding of why certain things work the way they do when working out these problems. I am also not the best in math, so after taking this class I want to accomplish my goals of doing good and be able to solve the problems without having any trouble and be confident in the work that I am doing, especially with calculations and working with graphs/charts. After taking some physics classes, I have noticed that we can apply many of it to everyday life and use it on the daily without noticing. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,77,"I am here at SFSU because I want to get a degree so that I can apply to PA school because my career goal is to be a physician assistant. I decided to come to SFSU because it would save me a lot of money since I am an SF native and I already live here. My parents are helping me pay tuition and I don't want them paying too much. SFSU is also a great school so it works out. I'm in this physics class mostly because it's a requirement to graduate. Honestly, if it wasn't required I probably wouldn't be in this class. But I'm hoping that this class will change my mind about how I feel about physics and so far I am enjoying this class. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,1,78,I am here in this physics class because I need it to fill a major requirement but I am also in this class to learn as much as i can. I am already seeing similarities from physics 111 and 112. I am even seeing similarities in my chemistry and math class so by taking this class it is strengthening my overall knowledge and helping me reach my goal of majoring in bio-physiology. Sometime I am frustrated with physics but then I remember I wouldn't be taking this class if I didn't need it to go where I'm going in life so I need to work hard and retain the most information I can.
