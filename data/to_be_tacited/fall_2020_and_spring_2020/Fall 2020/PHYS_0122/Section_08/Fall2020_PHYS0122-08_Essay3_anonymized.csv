2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,111,"One concept that we learned during this past week is electrons. A formulated question on electrons is how can electrons relate to dentistry? I choose this question because I feel like the information will be useful since I’m interested in dentistry in the future. Also, physics is a procurement for dental school. From my research, I learned that electrons can help with laser surgery. Lasers take advantage of electrons' quantum behavior, releasing light energy that can be regulated precisely. In teeth laser surgery we work with wavelength, molecules and etc. It seems like a lot of chemistry but there's also physics in dentistry. Another thing I learned was electrons can help detect roots of tooth decay. One method they used to find it is scanning transmission electron microscopy. TEM is a microscopy technique that has electrons being transmitted to a specimen to make an image. I’m guessing this image shows a dentist whose tooth has a root decay. I feel like electrons and other physics concepts such as thermodynamics, torque, and others fit perfectly with dentistry. Physics has very important information that I can not only use in my everyday life outside of school but in dental school as well."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,102,"A concept that I enjoyed from the past few weeks was the reflection and snell's law portion of the course. I particularly enjoyed the lab section with the online lab simulation. Snell's law describes the way the path of  a ray of light when crossing from one transparent medium to another when the speed of light is different in the two mediums. A question that I came up with is what is the index of refraction? The index of refraction is the ratio fo the speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in the medium. The index of refraction is a property of a medium, it decribes how light propogated in the medium. When light crosses from one medium into another medium with a different index of infraction, the ray bends to minimize time. Snell's law is used to find many different properties such as finding an angle of incidence and refraction. Snell's law says that with light with light going from medium 1 to medium 2 that the incident angle of the light is related to the refracted angle of light by this rule n1sin(θ1) = n2sin(θ2). This portion of the class was the most interesting to me as it was the most enjoyable lab so far."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,103,"Why does the opposite attract?We always hear that opposites attract. Charges that are opposite attract to each other while charges that are the same repel. So a positive charge/proton will attract a negative charge/electron, but not a positive charge, vice-versa. Because in an electric field, the positive charges will arrows are pointed outward while negative charges point inwards cause them to be like magnets. My hair would sometimes stick to the wallnor a balloon for no reason and I was always curious to why it does, but I wasn’t sure why. However, the electrostatics lab made me understand why my hair was sticking up to the wall or balloons. I found out that due to the balloon having negative charge/electron and my hair has  a good amount of positive charge/proton compared to others that is why my hair tends to stick to the balloon without me trying to rub on it. As for the wall, it is neutral so as I lay my head with a bunch of hair on it, my hair makes the wall negative charge/electron which then it attract my hair making my hair goes up and stick to it. I find it very interesting that it happens to sweaters to that are made from animals hair/furs through using the stimulation for the lab."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,121,"Formulate a question would be A capacitor is connected to a battery. If we move its plates further apart, work will be done against the electrostatic attraction between the plates. What will be the effect on the energy of the capacitor.? Since the battery remains connected, the potential difference V between the plate of the capacitor will remain. Since capacitance depends on the distance between the plate, it will decrease with the movement. Q=CV Now C decreases and V remains constant, the charge will decrease on the capacitor will decrease. Some charges from plate passing through the connecting wire will charge the battery. Some energy of the capacitor will be transferred to the battery, so the energy of the capacitor will decrease. The work done in moving apart the plate will be used up in this transference and dissipated in the form of heat in the connecting wire. It can be used in my life because it helps the environment be clean, so we can breathe the air like the air cleaner. The air cleaner process place an excess positive charge on smoke, dust and pollen, and other particles in the air and then passes the air through an oppositely charged grid that attracts and remains the charged particles"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,115,"Even though it was (I believe) the first lab we completed, the applications of electrostatics still blow my mind.  Electrostatics is the study of stationary charges.  Charges may be positive, if more protons are present than electrons, and may be negative, if more electrons are present than protons.  Like charges will repel each other while opposite charges will attract each other.  When objects become charged, charge is conserved as it is not being created nor destroyed but simply passed on from another object.  These charges can be moved through friction/contact, or induction.  Charging by induction is the process of charges realigning themselves so the opposite charges are closest to the object nearby. For example, if holding a metal pole with a negative charge near an evenly charged object, the charges within the evenly charges object will realign so all of the positive charges are on the side closest to the negatively charged pole, and all of the negative charges are away from the negatively charged pole.  Induction can occur in both good and bad conductors.    What is interesting is that electrostatics has been used to help clean pollution from the air.   To do so, positive charges are applied to dirt particles (pollution) in the air, which are then collected by a negatively charged plate in attempt to extract the pollution from the air."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,110,"One concept that we learned in the past few weeks is on the type of circuits and how current and voltage passes through each of them. A question that could be formulated is what is the difference in how current and voltage travels between series circuits and parallel circuits. In a series circuit, the current through each resistor is the same (I). The voltage in this circuit is a fraction of the total voltage. The more resisters in the circuit lead to higher total resistance, leading to slow down the current. In a parallel circuit, the current in each resistor is a fraction of the total current. The voltage is the same in each resistor. The more resistance there is the lower the total resistance in the whole circuit. This information I could use in my day to day life because it helps me understand that most likely our home will have parallel circuits. The voltage around my house is of the same voltage as the battery or energy source. The voltage changes depending on the number of resistors that are in the home, but the overall voltage will be the same as the energy source as well. The current does change depending on how many resistors are in that particular part of the home. I believe that is why some fuses are blown out when the current carried exceeds the rated value over time. If a circuit is overloaded, meaning beyond the preset amount of amps labeled on the fuse, the fuse blows. In order to be the most counterintuitive, each home will need to have parallel circuits."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,105,"How are Energy & Work related? Energy is the ability to do work. Work means pushing or pulling something some distance therefore, energy is the ability to push things around such as exerting a force. Where there is a force, there is energy. F=mg is useful for this. If we move an object up against gravity by a distance, then it gains potential energy. When I was moving out of my house in San Francisco I had to push my bed down the stairs and into the moving van. I had energy to do this which gave me the ability to do work. By doing this, I also exerted a force on my bed by pushing it. If I wanted to know force I exerted, I would multiply the mass of my bed by gravity.We are always doing work even if we don't realize it in everyday tasks that we are used to doing all the time. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,118,"Learning about circuits is great and interesting, but I want to know how a circuit can be used to make a battery or the power source of the circuit infinite. Basically I want know if a battery can keep going on forever. This is interesting for me because some things I have in my house uses a battery and its not often, but when we have to change the batteries of something there seems to be no batteries around the house. It would be interesting to see if its possible to make a circuit last forever. Moreover, the creation of such a thing would make it so that car batteries will last longer or even for electric cars there wont be a need to change the battery unless damage. Although those batteries last long, they degrade overtime. And, making something that does not degrade or at least take longer to degrade will be a great invention."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,104,"A concept that was covered in class the past couple of weeks is, What is power and how is it relevant to the course and to life? Well, power in general is measured in watts or joules per second, one can define power as the amount of energy transferred or converted per unit time. We can calculate this value by taking potential energy and dividing it by the change in time that was measured, from this formula we can actually derive a more recognizable formula using algebra and get the formula, power equals current square times the resistance of the electrical system.  How is this related to real life? Well if someone who likes to save money or be environmentally conservative with your energy use, one can calculate the power usage of their own house. All you have to do is go outside of your house and check the watt-hour meter, from there you can calculate the kWh usage that your house's annual use. If you know the rate at which the electric company bills you then you can multiply that buy your houses power use, from there you can see if you need to cut back on power usage or if you are doing fine."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,108,"The concept that I remember the most from past weeks is the lab where we learned about voltage and current through light bulb. I now know how to calculate the amount of current and or voltage that is going through each of the wire in our home. My question for this reflective essay would be how many current does the power source in my house provide? In order for me to know that I first need to know how many voltage my main power source has (ex: 10V, 50V, 100V etc..). After finding the total voltage, I then need to know my resistors such as light bulb, T.V, air conditioner, etc.. that is connected to my main power source. These resistors sort of act as an opsticles as you keep plugging more things to you power source. From the lab weeks ago, I know that houses usually run on parallel circuit rather than series circuit because its way more efficient. Now that we know the total voltage, total resistor, and total current we can now go through each resistor and see how much resistance it has, and from that we can figure out current or voltage using the formula V=IR. I think that this lab will specifically reside deep in my brain because I really learned the most that I can learn in that lab. Hope there are many more labs as similar style to that lab. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,119,"How does a compass work? My family loves to go camping almost every other week in the summer. When we go hiking, a good majority of our day is spent hiking and exploring our surroundings. Even though we have the compass on our phones and have a map from the closest rest area, my dad always insists on bringing this small handheld compass every time we leave our tents. I've almost always taken how the compass works for granted; it just wasn't something I really ever thought about. However, last week, we learned about electromagnets in lab and it finally explained to me how exactly a compass works.The needle of a compass is itself a permanent magnet and the north indicator of the compass is a magnetic north pole. The north pole of a magnet lines up with the magnetic field, so a suspended compass needle will rotate until it lines up with the magnetic field, pointing north, helping us navigate our way. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,106,"I found solving for circuits to be extremely difficult and situational based. I struggled a lot with the end of that unit, and I expect to struggle a lot with magnetism as well. I suppose one of my questions would be how to solve for these types of problems more efficiently. I read online that Kirchoff's law in addition to Ohm's law can be used, but I'm not entirely sure how to apply the two laws together, or when each law can be applied. I find myself always solving for each piece individually which takes a large amount of time versus solving for I1=I2+I3. In all honesty, this level of physics does not appear to be relevant to my own life in terms of what I am studying. My major and occupation's focus is more towards 3D kinematics, and I feel no need to learn about electric charge, electromagnetism, etc. because they are not present in the human body. I genuinely believe this class is too difficult and contains too much information that most health majors need; it's specifically catered towards electrical engineering majors. I suppose I have a better understanding of how the lights in my house work, but I would never be the one to fix them if they were to break or turn off anyways. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,113,"The topic which I want to talk about is parallel and series connection. We all use electricity in our houses, offices, universities, hospitals, etc. But there are different connections used depending on the appliance and place. There are two types of connection:Series and parallel connection.In a series connection, everything is arranged in series and the current is the same through each component.whereas in parallel connection in a parallel circuit, charge divides up into separate branches such that there can be more current in one branch than there is in another. which means that the current flowing in the parallel circuit is not the same. It varies according to the connection you have. Series connection example: A string of led lights, a switch that controls a single bulb.parallel connection example: A switch that operates multiple bulbs and appliances. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,112,Colton Rees  The concept I have chosen to discuss is Amperes Law when it relates to Electric Magnetism. In Amperes Law a magnetic fields magnitude is directly correlated to the distance from a current. This has to do with metal wires forming a loop around a metal pole of some kind and their distance from the current that is flowing through the pole. In Ampere’s Law you can when you create a current it automatically creates a magnetic field and since the magnetic field is some what attached to the pole it moves through the metal wire creating electricity. My question would be if this method could be used to create enough electricity would it be a viable option for alternative fuel sources for air travel instead of conventional sources.   This kind of electricity creation is already in use in our everyday lives in a multitude of electric motors from power tools to hybrid vehicles. The issue that comes into play when trying to upscale this is the fact that you would need very large currents and magnetic fields to provide enough electricity to power and aircraft and not only could this be hazards for passengers but each individual engines own magnetic field could affect each other in a negative way. Now obviously this concept has a lot of issue but if they could be figured out the environmental good this would accomplish is off the charts. Air travel is one of the biggest pollutants to our environment in the world and a safer cleaner source of fuel is a necessity and would revolution the air industry.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,114,"The question that I thought about was: How did Tesla contribute so much to the magnetic field in order for us to name certain units after him? Although I couldn't really find that in my notes I looked up some information and realized that Nicolas Tesla was an extremely intelligent individual that discovered a lot about magnetic fields and electricity. He was the first one who thought about alternating currents, he contributed to what we know today as a bluetooth device. He pretty much helped lead to the discovery of many electrical devices that we use today because of his observations. This affects my life today because I own a cellphone which was thanks partially to Tesla, I own a bluetooth set of headphones which help my emotional state a lot since music helps me. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,120,"I honestly do not connect physics with personal interest, but I do think about in during everyday life situations. A few days ago I saw a car that was flipped over on the freeway. I saw that the driver got out okay with no visible injuries but the car was ruined. It was completed flipped, and resting on the ground. As I was driving by I was wondering how that could happen. It didn't look like another car has collided with the flipped car, the car was small and it looked like the accident happened in the slow lane. So that made me question how it happened because it looked like speed may not have been a factor. The ground did not look uneven so I don't see how the wheels loss traction. The whole situation looked confusing to understand and made me question the physics behind the situation"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,117,"A relevant concept that was covered in class was circuits and the different types of circuits: series and parallel. Series circuits are arranged so that the current only has one path to take. The total resistance of a series circuit is equal to the sum of the resistors. On the other hand, parallel circuits have multiple branches or paths. The voltage across each of the components is the same and the total resistance is adding 1/R. I learned that our homes have parallel circuits, so if one device or item loses electricity, the rest will still be functional. Circuits are useful in that they make programs run, make things light up, allow us to use certain appliances--all things many of us are used to in this modern society. This applies to me personally because there are many appliances in my house and it would be a shame if all of them burnt out in a series circuit instead. Our homes are wired in a parallel circuit, but individual appliances like fridges, water heaters, freezers use series circuits."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,107,The topic I am choosing to write about is the law of reflection. The law of reflection states that the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence. Hence the reflection angle will be the same but only depending on the angle. I feel like this is something that can be very beneficial in the real world especially when it comes to car mirrors and blind spots. I’m thinking about this because there’s alot of accidents that has been happening lately and it’s all due to the blind spot of the car mirror. With this being the case it’s harder for people to make judgement when it comes to backing out or changing lanes. Overall this topic is something that the majority of people should learn more about in order to really understand blind spots and how important it is to check all angles. This is because you can’t see EVERY angle in your mirror and it will always be better to be safe than sorry. I especially wish i learned about this before since i have a few blind spots when it comes to my car and I got in an accident. I can’t imagine the blind spots when it comes to big trucks as well as the commercial delivery trucks.  
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,109,"In our class we learned a variety of concepts that were the backbone to life in general. One main concept that lays out the foundation of physics and life in general are charges. In the Electrostatics lab we learned about how charges react to one another. This is important because in life charges in our body react to each other causing reactions. Where in chemistry and chemicals, the charges allow one to figure out or predict how such chemicals would react to each other. This is especially important for lab science as charges are an important part of chemical compounds and learning how the chemicals will react through charges. Another important lab we learned is the following lab where we learned about the E field of the charges. The charges have an electromagnetic field that will tell us how powerful a charge is depending how which charges react to each other. This is important in everyday life as we have to deal with electric fields when working with any wires and circuits. This also ties in with the circuit lab where we learn about how the electrons move in a circuit and how they react to different variables being added or removed. We can see these type of circuits in all houses that have electrical wiring."
