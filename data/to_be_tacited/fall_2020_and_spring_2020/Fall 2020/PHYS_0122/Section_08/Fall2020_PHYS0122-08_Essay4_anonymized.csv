2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,114,"Often I find that I procrastinate because I do not think about the reward of finishing my work done early I think more about the struggle I am about to face when I do get that done. In order to stay focused until the end of the semester I need to isolate myself and really focus on me and mt studies. I think that I need to start thinking more about the reward of getting my work done as oppose to the struggle. One thing that really does help is the isolation and silence in order to get my work done. I am also still in SF and wish the library was still open so that I could get some work done. Although there are many ways to focus or to try to, what works best for me is to be in a designated space to do work which I do not have in my room. I think that primarily getting my work done so that I can ask questions would really help me focus for the rest of the semester. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,113,"Because of the pandemic, it has been difficult for all of us to concentrate on studying. I have been struggling a lot because I am India and because of the time difference it is really difficult for me to manage things. I need to stay awake the whole night. But it was my choice to stay in India, so I cannot really complain about it.Well, talking about strategies, I don't really have much to talk about but all I can say is that if you complete your work in the given time, that is the lest you can do. Because that way you can manage things and assignments too. That's what I do. I do not pile up my work for the last moment, instead, I complete it as soon as I can. That way I have time to study other than giving all my time to assignments. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,106,"Staying focused throughout the semester becomes increasingly more difficult as it progresses, especially as a senior. There's an antsy feeling after half the semester when things feel faster and more chaotic. Especially when classes are online, it can be a bit more difficult to keep track of events since we are constantly sitting at our computer in the same environment. Personally, I find the best method to stay focused and keep on track is by setting alarms on my calendar for university events and big assignments, and reminders on my phone that allow me to check off completed assignments for the week. By doing so, I am less likely to forget about assignments that are due. However, in order to stay ""on track"" and give myself a proper break by the end of the week, I must complete work for certain classes by a set day, so I always try to finish my work by Thursday, and leave Friday for any extra quizzes or exams I need to take. I also find it helpful to strategically plan out my breaks so that I am not taking too many or too little breaks when doing my work. The last thing I want is to be burnt out when I still have a ton of work to finish on hand. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,117,"That is a really good question. I am quite the procrastinator and even though I know that I have more time to do things since classes are online, I find that the day passes by too quickly. For this semester, I am trying to cultivate better time management. I sort of keep a planner and write down assignments that are due every day. I check them off when I am done. Motivation can be hard as well. I think that taking a break once in a while is very helpful. Work on an assignment or immerse yourself in studying for 1-2 hours and then taking a break is nice. I've also started working out in the mornings ever since the summer and quarantine. I try to keep a consistent schedule and workout around the same time. Getting good grades is also a motivator for me to keep myself on task and finish my work, although I'm finding that I don't quite pay attention the same amount that I would if I were in a live class. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,102,"Keeping pace with classes has been a difficult task, but I am trying my best to manage it and not fall behind. In order to stay on top of my assignments I try to make a schedule and stick to it. I also use my calender to keep track of due dates and in order to organize when to work on assignments. Finding motivation is probably the most difficult thing for online school. In order to find motivation it takes a lot of focus and try to set a goal for myself and stick to it. It even helps to write it down and try to look at it everyday and read it, also you must truly believe that you can achieve it. When setting the goal it shouldn't be unrealistic and should be attainable. So I set my goal to be to pass all my classes this semester, in order to achieve this goal I wrote down the steps I need to achieve it. I then set a schedule and calender in order to focus my time better and be more efficient. At times it has been hard sticking to the schedule but I have been able to manage my classes as well as I can. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,108,"I know that everyone is going through hard times right now but for me, when I get in such situations, I try to look at the good things such as being closer to my family.  generally hangout with friends during the weekends and go to college during the weekdays so I didn't see them so much back then but now, I get to hangout with them 24/7. I also believe that through bad things, there's always a greater thing waiting to happen so because 2020 has been terrible, I am very much excited and looking forward to the coming new year where hopefully everything starts to progresses back to normal life. I also try to create certain time range in order for me to keep my full attention on my learning. So I'll study for 2 hours straight with out any distractions such as iPhone, or friends. After the 2 hours, I eat snacks and go on my phone for about half an hour. When I'm done with my break, I return back to my learning area and do the same thing for another 2 hours and then take break for half an hour. My day usually end just like that, and of course I hang out with my family through out the week but I try to do all my assignments during the week so that I can hangout with them fully during the weekends. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,115,"I think so far I have been pretty good at staying on top of my school work, but I would also say I have been more unorganized than usual and I feel that is hurting me a bit.  I feel to help myself stay organized, I can schedule out my time better and stop procrastinating when stressful assignments come up (lol).  I have a habit of avoiding/putting off my most anxiety provoking assignments until last minute, causing me immense stress.  Though I always get them done, I know it is unhealthy!! It causes me to have chronic stress, and by confronting this bad habit I can possibly help reduce this.  So scheduling out my time and including breaks within the schedule I feel will help me to stay organized and focused for the rest of this semester.  I am happy we had this mini journal because it has helped me to better evaluate my situation rather than ignore it and allow it to get worse!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,119,"When the pandemic first hit, it was a bit rough for me to keep up with my schoolwork. The thought of this new, sudden change and what it would bring with it was incredibly overwhelming. Now that we’ve been in an online setting for a while and will continue to be, I’ve found some things that help me stay on track. One of these things is creating small goals for myself so I feel more motivated to accomplish more things throughout the day. Another thing I’ve found to help with my procrastination is planning out every minute of my day on google calendar so I feel less inclined to waste my time with things that are unnecessary. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,111,"During the beginning of the fall semester, I had trouble focusing on my studies and assignment. I wasn’t as organized as I am now. A couple of months ago, I started watching youtube study videos. After watching a couple of them, I began to feel motivated on finding a way to keep my focus throughout class and assignments. One of the strategies I use is keeping my phone away from me. Being at home and having easy access to my phone can be distracting to me. Another strategy I use is keeping a weekly planner and organizing my day and the assignments I plan to do on a specific day. The next strategy I use is hearing ambiance music on youtube or my study playlist on Spotify when I study or do homework. The ambiance music and my study playlist help me keep calm and focus on my assignments. My last strategy is my timer. I have a timer that I set for an hour to keep my focus on my homework. After that hour I take a 10-minute break and repeat."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,118,"Some strategies I have been trying is to use candy or chocolate as incentives for any amount of work I set myself to do. Sometimes it helps but other times I just end up eating it all before I get any work done. Also, I have been trying to exercise more instead of being cooped up in the house staring at a computer screen. Out of any I tried this one has been helpful as its giving me  a beneficial break and allows me to be healthier and refresh my mind. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,121,"Some strategies that will help me focus through the semester would be listening to music, it helps me relax and focus through the day. Another thing would be a planner, the planner helps me be organized for all the classes I have for this semester. So I won't miss anything that is due or have exams. I would also go outside to get some fresh air, to help me focus and refresh my mind, or sometimes I would walk with my dog for a couple of minutes. Sometimes I would watch a movie or one episode of a show, so I can refresh my mind and think about something rather than schoolwork. The last thing I do to help me focus would be to take a 30-minute nap or more and be in a quiet room where there is no distraction from anything because I'm a person that gets distracted easily."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,107,"""What strategies can I put in place to keep me focused through the end of the semester?"" Some strategies that i know I can put in place to keep me focused through the end of the semester is to set reminders and keep organized when it comes to due dates for assignments and projects. I’d also start studying earlier in order to avoid cramming when it comes to tests. I’d also take some breaks cause i’ve found that if i sit on a computer for long periods of times, the work i do and studying i do isn’t as effective. Also it’d make me dread doing homeworks and such so i feel small 10 minute breaks would help me push through as well. I’d also keep reminding myself that I’m graduating this academic year and there shouldn’t be an excuse to slack off especially since i want to finish strong."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,103,"To keep myself on track I like to make a schedule. I write out all the assignments and their due dates so I won’t forget. Then I just check them off as I go through the list and finish my work.  Also I like to do some assignments when I have time even way before the due dates so I can get it off the list on my schedule. I feel like making a schedule keeps me from forgetting assignments and turning them in on time. I also feel like it lessens my stress, because I don’t have to think about all of my assignments 24/7 and keep track in my mind. Also I can make time to exercise, eat, sleep and spend time with my family when I have a schedule. The schedule keeps me organized and on track so I can make time. That is why every week I make a new schedule so I can know how to start off my day."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,104,"After being such in the house for a little over a month I can say without a doubt that I wake up every morning feeling less and less motivated. The days seem to go on as just identical repeats of each other, and my hope for life to go back to normal seems to slowly fade day by day. Dispute this I still have the motivation to push on and keep my life on track, and some ways that I am doing this is by first, I continue to work out every morning after I wake up, which I had already done before the pandemic. When it comes to online work, sitting in front of a computer can easily cause burnout in anyone, when it comes to this what helps me stay motivated is taking regular brakes which consist of watching a little tv, going on social media, or making some food. Motivation is low but after we make it through this you will appreciate the character development afterward, which is something that I tell myself every day. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,110,"Some strategies that could help me stay focused until the end of the semester would be waking up prior to classes and start my day as if I was going to attend classes on campus. The motivation for classes or staying on top of assignments has been quite difficult. I have attempted to set reminders and create a check list of assignments. To stay motivated I try to pace myself as well as making time aside to go out of the house and into nature. I find myself procrastinating a lot more this semester because being stuck at home for so long, has made me too comfortable learning from home. After three months of consistently staying in the house, my sister and I tent camped in our backyard so that we could break away from how comfortable things got. But ever since the wildfires in CA, we had to pack things up and come back to the house to attend classes. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,112,"Colton Rees  During this semester I try to employ two methods to keep myself motivated. Of course, with the unusual circumstances surrounding this semester it has been more difficult then others but the same methods to keep up my motivation still apply. The first thing I do is to try and not overwhelm myself with assignments or projects. This means if I have homework or projects do for multiple classes I will space out the workload as to not get discouraged. The second thing I will do is keep reminding myself of my personal and educational goals and that my had work will lead to future success. These two methods are what keep me motivated and focused especially in the idle of a trying semester. I believe without some form of motivation that a person will certainly become discouraged and question why they are continuing with such difficult work. Everyday when I go over my to do lists for my classes I use these methods to keep me on track, now they don’t also work and I do stumble sometimes however if I stay focused I always keep myself motivated."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,109,"After a long time staying at home I found it difficult to stay focused and motivated to do any studying properly. I still finished my work when I had to but I had a hard time finishing it as it took me long hours to finish an assignment. I also don’t study for exams as often as I used to because I’m at home where I’m used to relaxing instead of working. To keep me focused and motivated in classes, I tend to check my grades every day to remind myself of the end goal. I also reward myself at home. For example, if I have an upcoming exam I reward myself with food or buying something after I finish my exam so I have something to look forward to after the exam instead of feeling anxious about my grade. I don’t really do much studying but when I have assignments that need to get done, I finish the first thing in the morning so I have the rest of the day off."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,120,"This semester to help keep me focused a downloaded and app called notion. Notion is an app that I've been using to help keep track of assignments. Even though lately it's been hard to keep consistent with it, it has helped me keep up with a lot of assignments I would have otherwise forgotten about. That's the only real change I've made to help me stay focused throughout the semester. I guess I should add that I threw out my physical planner because i would never use it so it did not serve a purpose for me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,105,"It truly has been difficult being at home for 6 months. I often have found myself being too lazy to go to class while sitting in the comfort of my bed. I seem to have no motivations sometimes because learning remotely is simply not the same as being in a physical classroom with a professor and classmates. These are some strategies that I can put into place to keep me focused through the end of the semester. I can attend class or do homework in places that I normally wouldn't to keep me motivated such as a park, somewhere with a great view or simply just outside enjoying nature and getting some sun. I could also do homework with friends that way we keep each other motivated and it could be somewhat fun. Hopefully this will help me stay motivated. "
