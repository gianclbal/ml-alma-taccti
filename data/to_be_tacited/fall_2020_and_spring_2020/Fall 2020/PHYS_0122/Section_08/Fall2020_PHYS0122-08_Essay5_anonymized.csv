2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,113,"The topic I want to discuss is refraction. Refraction is the change in direction of a wave passing from one medium to another or from a gradual change in the medium. Refraction of light is the most commonly observed phenomenon, but other waves such as sound waves and water waves also experience refraction.n1/n2 = sin α2/sin α1. This is the mathematical way to show snells law.  Snell's Law is important for optical devices, such as fiber optics which creates observes electromagnetic radiations. For instance, Telecommunication Fibre Optics."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,114,In lecture I remember there were several topics that were covered that were kind of abstract. The idea that light travels in waves has always been like a common sense thing to me and I’m not sure of it’s because that’s what was taught my whole life. But the idea that the separation causes different lines with different lengths and fringes that are made to be dark and light is quite amazing. The relationship with all of these lines and distances can be solved using the trigonometric functions. When light shines through two holes the path difference can be described as constructive or destructive light which our eyes interpret as dark and light. Dsintheta is the equation that can be used to describe the relationship between the two shining lights and the distance of their exact interaction since their waves travel after they pass the hole in a circular motion across the plane. If the distance between the light an dark fringes are whole numbers then the light will be destructive and if the distance between the fringes is fractional then the light will be constructive. This is used to describe the difference between the path length. This can be used in spectroscopy by putting light through narrow openings which measures the separation between the different wavelengths with different colors which allows someone to measure the respective angle of the color. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,104,"One concept that I would like to focus on from previous labs/lectures would be destructive and constructive interference. The question I am going to specifically tackle and analyze is, “ when you do the double-slit experiment, why are there multiple fringes that display from the two slits?”. I would answer that question by stating that just like the sound or using water as a medium wave can be induced within them. As we learned when waves are offset by a half of a wavelength then destructive interference will be an effect observed, such that the two waves will cancel each other out. Basically, the opposite of constructive interference, which would be if the waves were moving simultaneously rate. So, I would then use the concept of noise-canceling headphones to support my answer, because that is how noise-canceling headphones work is that they play a noise that offsets with the surrounding white noise, thus creating a destructive interference effect and silencing surrounding noise. So the reason there are multiple fringes that are produced by those two slits is that in those dark fringes are areas where destructive interference occurs. This is because the light that is coming from the source is late when entering the edge of the slit, and the areas that are bright are the areas where constructive interference. In conclusion, the reason this is possible is due to the fact that just like sound light travels as a light wave and those waves have the ability to cancel each other out."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,115,"How do light rays operate and how can they be used as an energy source?Light rays can travel in three different ways from the source of the light to the decided location: 1. Directly, through empty space2. Through a medium3. Reflected off of a mirrorWhile keeping in mind how we can manipulate light rays through the understanding of how they travel, we can transform the light energy into useable energy for human technological ""consumption.""  The light rays we perceive are simply photons moving in a wave like fashion, moving at the speed of light.  Most light comes from a heat source.  This light energy can be harnessed for other uses, like how solar panels transform light energy into electrical energy.  When photons from light rays hit solar panels, they cause electrons to flow within the panels.  The electron flow creates direct current electricity which flows into an inverter.  The inverter converts the direct current into alternating current electricity.  This is the electricity used to power electrical devices attached to the solar panel system.Solar power is considered to be the ""cleanest: type of energy around; Solar panels provide a renewable energy source, which reduces the need for oil, coal and natural gas production which all add greatly to the pollution of our environment through addition of harmful fossil fuels which are responsible for greenhouse gases.  If we want to help nurture a clean environment for the planet and those inhabiting it, it is important we make the transition to renewable energy such as solar power."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,106,"Understanding the way a lens or mirror works is extremely important for understanding the way we perceive the world around us, and also adds to our safety. In real life, lenses and mirrors appear in everyday objects in a variety of mediums. Recently, there have been discoverings of suspicious activity in hotels and other housing services in which human trafficing is secretly hidden. A lot of times, victims become trapped when they are the most unaware because they do not hold information to check their surroundings. One test that should be done at any new public housing location is to check mirrors if they are one-sided or two-sided. To do so, one must place their fingertip to a mirror and if there is a gap between the finger the image is real and inverted. However, if the finger in the reflection touches the one's finger, meaning the image is virtual and upright, it is a two way mirror. This indicates that there is an image on the opposite side of the object. Understanding fundamental concepts of physics can help us to understand our environment, and help us get out of terrible situations such as these. Other tests regarding frequency and magnetism can also be used to check objects around our environment as safety precautions. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,111,"How can lenses affect our everyday life? There are two types of lenses concave and convex. These two lenses are completely different from each other. A concave lens diverges light rays while a convex lens converges rays of light that are parallel. So how can these lenses affect our everyday life? To start off, magnifying glass and microscope have a convex lens. Flashlight and cameras have a concave lens. These lenses benefit society by helping one see a blurry image better, focusing on light, and etc. Without these lenses, people will not have a tool to help their eyesight, can't take photographs and so much more. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,108,"Through out the last few weeks, we covered a lots of topics such as snell's law, lenses lab, pulses wave, continuous waves, but what I remember the most was how when there is 2 waves colliding into each other, the waves connect and conjoint but when one of the wave is coming from above and the other if going opposite different below, the two waves sort of cancel each other out depending on the size of the 2 waves. When we learn about waves pulses, we are not only learning about things we can't see such as waves coming from a blasting speakers but it also goes us an idea of when ocean waves collide, they also cancel each other out. So in a way, we are learning about how ocean works. Also I am thinking that you can put this idea into many different situations that has some type of waves in it but I don't think you can apply this to every waves though. but overall, my learning process from the beginning of this lab has been very good so I have been learning a lot in the past few weeks and can't wait for more to come. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,120,"My question is: How does light reflect off a mirror?In my notes, it says an incident ray hits a surface then creates a reflection ray. This information can be useful when driving because if light (incident ray) hits your side mirror, it will create a reflection ray. It can be helpful to know about this reflection ray so that maybe you can angle your mirror so that the ray does not blind you while driving. That's the only solid example I have for that. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,109,"I found the circuit lab one of the most important concepts we covered in class because circuits are what runs the world. The world uses electricity every day and that electricity is carried through circuits. The circuit lab explains how the movement of electrons can result in power. This can be high in power or low in power depending on the source of energy. The circuit can also differ depending on how the circuit is set up as we made a circuit with multiple pathways and a one-way circuit. The power of each circuit was different because of the power source and how the circuit was set up. In this lab, we used batteries as our power source and we used voltmeters to measure out how many volts we were creating in a circuit. The benefits of circuits are power and electricity. As I stated, the world runs on circuits, even the homes we live in are running due to circuits in the walls which gives us the necessary power we need to cook food, have light, and etc. In society, we use circuits to light up the city, keep buildings running, circuits are everywhere to function socially, and keep production of basic necessities such as farming, factories, offices, and transportation."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,112,"For this reflection I will be discussing the Physics concept of a lens. A lens is used in various settings to normally provide a reverse image of something be looked at. Lens can be converging, which means the concentrate parallels lines, meaning they make the light rays come closer together usually at a certain point on the lens allowing more clear picture to be seen or photographed. Another type of lens is called diverging, where they spread the lines out away from each other. These two distinctions are vital in understanding the type of lens your dealing with and the capabilities that each posses for whatever they are being used for. These two types of lens are fundamental in peoples everyday lives from bathroom mirrors and glasses to microscopes and magnifying glasses. People use these lens everyday without really thinking of their importance or how their daily routines would be drastically altered if they were not around. Without these types of lens major scientific discoveries from microscopic bacteria to the outer reaches of space would not of been possible. However these major discoveries using lens probably do not rank as the greatest impact lens have had on our society. Lens used for eyesight would arguably hold a strong grip on that title for all the benefit they have caused to millions of people around the world."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,110,"In the past weeks prior to the break, There have been so many great things I learned that was really cool. From the last lab, we learned about continuous waves. When the wavelength is increased, the pitch is decreased below the value when the source is at rest. When the wavelength is shortened and the frequency is higher, this results in us hearing it higher-pitched. In the lab last week I mention how in everyday life a sire of a firetruck changes due to the length of the wavelength and frequency change resulted in a different sense of the pitch we perceive. Last week, I had a midterm and I remember how using the simulation of the angles of refractions and incidence were measured. It was interesting! Growing up, my mom would tell me to put on sunscreen even if it is a cold day whenever we went to a park near the shore. I never knew that even if it was a cold day, the sun's rays were beaming on us through the reflection off of the water. For instance, I knew to get directly out of the sun rays is wearing a hat, but I didn't think of how the rays beam off of the water.  Now I know that the reflection of the sun on the water is nearly as strong, so I make sure to put on sunscreen whenever I go near water. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,105,"A concept that was covered in class over the past few weeks that I want to formulate a question on would be the idea of refraction and how it is correlated with Snell's Law. Every medium has an index of refraction (n): n= c/v. This measures the speed of light in that medium, (v) compared to c. When light enters a new medium, its speed changes. This causes it to bend (refract). The angle of incidence does not equal the angle of refraction, instead they are related by Snell's Law which is n1sinθ1 = n2sinθ2. Some properties of refraction are that light entering a more dense medium bends toward the normal and light entering a less dense medium bends away from the normal. This information is generally applicable to peoples everyday lives they may experience refraction everyday, they just do not realize what is going on. For example, it makes objects in the water appear way closer than they actually are. If you drop something in your pool, it appears to be way closer than it actually is because light bends across mediums. Snell's law is also used in optical lenses such as cameras or glasses that people have to wear everyday inorder to have better vision. It is all around us even if we don't know it. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,102,"An interesting topic to we discussed in lab and lecture was lenses, I found this section of the course very engaging because it is a very relatable topic as there are many uses for lenses. Lenses come in two shapes concave and convex lenses, concave lenses have a diverging shape while a convex lense has a converging shape. A question I have is what happens when parallel waves of light pass through a concave or a convex lense? When parallel rays of light pass through a concave lense the refracted rays diverge so that they appear to come from one point called the principal focus. Concave lenses form a virtual image that is diminished. When parallel rays pass through a convex lense the refracted rays converge at one point called the principal focus. Convex lenses converge the rays because they are thicker in the middle so the light rays are brought closer together. An example of a convex lense is a magnifying glass as it produces a magnified image. An example of a concave lense is a telescope it produces a smaller image when looking through the glass. When an object is placed infront of a convex lense the closer the object is the more focused the lense appears. When an object is placed infront of a concave lense the further the object is from the lense the more focused the object appears."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,121,"One concept that we covered in class that applies to people's life and benefit society is the wave lab. In the lab wave, I learn transverse wave is perpendicular and longitudinal waves are parallel. I learn how two waves interfere, are constructive and destructive interference. That constructive interference when two interfering waves have a displacement in the same direction. The destructive interference when two interfering waves have a displacement in the opposite direction. That speed depends on the medium, tension force, and mass per unit length. I also learn that the amplitude of the wave makes the volume of the sound and the frequency of the wave is the pitch of the sound that we hear. The waves benefit society because we have speakers to hear music and people talking. Without a sound, we would not have music and people would not listen to any danger to warn them. The sound wave causes our ears to send signals to our brain to create a sound and that important in people's life because it allows us to hear messages and emergency signals to protect ourselves and entertain us. Sound benefits our life because it part of communication between each other and culture in form of speech, music, and creative sounds. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,117,"A concept recently covered in lecture and lab was waves. A question I often have about physics concepts is how did people come up with ideas and test them. Waves are dependent on distance and time. There can be constructive interference, which is when the amplitude adds up, or constructive interference, which is when the net displacement is reduced. Superposition is an aspect of waves that says that the net displacement caused by a combination of waves is the algebraic sum of displacements caused by each wave individually. There are several equations for different types of waves like for waves on a string, finding wavelengths, fringes in the two-slit experiment, etc. Phase changes can also happen to waves. Waves are present in many aspects of our lives, ocean waves, light waves, electromagnetic waves, sound waves, etc. and these concepts can be applied to them.  I recently learned that two antennas doesn't guarantee a better signal than one antenna because it depends on the distance of the waves, which can either result in constructive or destructive interference. Learning about waves can benefit society because they are a huge part of our daily lives and learning how they work can be beneficial to manipulate them for our own uses. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,103,"Why are lenses important?Lenses are important, because we get to use it for different things. Things that have lenses are mirrors, glasses, windows and much more. But the most important one is the lenses in glasses, because it is use to help fix people that have trouble with their eyesight condition. Lenses have been used for centuries, but I’ve never really seen the important use of it until now. For example people with farsighted would use a converging (convex) lens to be able to see what is close to them while people with nearsighted would use a diverging (concave) lens to be able to see far away like a whiteboard in class. Before doing the Lenses Lab, I didn’t know what was so important about lenses even though I see it all around me. After doing this lab, I was able to know about two types of lens: converging (convex) and diverging (concave). Converging lenses are thicker in the middle and thinner at the edges while diverging lenses are thinner in the middle and thicker at the edges. Converging len makes light convex light into the eye and diverging len makes light concave into the eye. It made me realise and care more about how lenses are used in the real world, because I have friends and family that depend on it to see. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,119,"Question: How do we calculate the speed of a period wave and why are they important? In order to understand this question, I think it is important to know the difference between amplitude and frequency and how they both pertain to the wavelength of pulse waves. The amplitude of soundwaves corresponds to the loudness or volume whereas the frequency of soundwaves corresponds to the pitch of its sound.That being said, the formula for finding wave speed is frequency multiplied by wavelength. This can be applied to the Doppler Effect where a source of waves in motion change depending on where the observer is. For example, two people seven miles apart hearing an ambulance drive by would hear different things. Whoever is closer to the ambulance would hear the ambulance more meaning there is a higher frequency of soundwaves whereas someone further away from the ambulance would not hear it as much, meaning the frequency of the sound waves are low. The sound of the ambulance never changed but how it was hears was relative to the listener. "
