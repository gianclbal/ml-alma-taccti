Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,102,I am enrolled for physics 122 mainly to fulfill my graduation requirements for my biology degree. I am also taking this course because it is a requirement for dental school. I plan on continuing by going to dental school and becoming a dentist. I am also taking physics because it will help me prepare for the DAT exam that I plan on taking later this year. Aside from taking this class for gradutation requirements I also hope to learn some concepts that are discussed in this course. I am interested in this course because it will help me to progress further in my academic journey and to hopefully help me do well so I can get into a good dental school. I look forward to completing this course with an overall positive experience and I also hope to do well in the course. Physics is an interesting subject that has plenty of real world applications that are interesting and will help to learn general knowledge that will help later on in my academic journey.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,103,"Why am I here? I am here to learn more about science,because I have enjoyed science since elementary school, but I can only continue to learn more of it if I go to college. When I first got started in science I was in elementary, my dad and I entered in the school science contest for fun and we ended up winning.  After I kept taking science classes and it never stressed me out. I found it interesting and fun even when it's challenging so science has always been my favorite subject. So I am in your course to learn more about physics and I need this course for my major biochemistry. I am majoring in biochemistry, because I feel like it will be helpful for me before I get into medical school. I want to get into medical school not to make anyone proud even though it is a plus, but I want to do it for myself, because I have seen many MD in different positions in the medical field doing their job and they even show me things that sparks my curiosity and interest even more in science so it just make sense for me to go to medical school, because that is where there are hands on learning of different positions of the medical field."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,104,"“Why am I here?” I am where I am at currently, being orange county, rather than being in San Francisco due to the fact that I am in the middle of a world pandemic and I simply cannot return back to school and continue in-person classes. That is where I am geographically, however, why am in this class? Well, that’s because I am a science major, specifically a bio physiology major and I must complete the introduction to physics course series in order to complete my major requirements in order to receive my degree. Where I am in my current knowledge of understanding physics, is that after completing physics 111 I really don’t feel that I have learned a lot from the course, and now that I am in PHYS 121, I am keeping a good pace and staying caught up with the class and I am hoping that I can learn just as much as I can online when compared to in-person classes. This global pandemic has been a huge influence in to where I am right now and I really wish that I was back in San Francisco learning back on campus even with all the major wildfires happening in California right now."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,105,"Why am I here?This is a very broad question, with many possible answers. Why am I currently in this physics course? This is because it is a pre-requisite for my major which is Biology with a concentration in cellular and molecular. Although I am forced to take the physics series, I have actually come to really enjoy learning about physics and realized that physics is all around us in everything that we do day to day. Why am I at San Francisco State University? I am currently here because I wanted to further my education and study something I actually enjoy which is what I am currently doing. I want to be successful when I am older and have always been told that you first need an education in order to secure a good job in the future. San Francisco just happened to be one of the cheapest options for me at the time because going to college can be very expensive, but I would not have changed my whole experience for the world. I am glad I chose to attend school here. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,106,"When being asked why am I here, a lot runs through my mind. And partially, I'm not sure why I'm here. However, I do know that I am here because my parents expected me to succeed and thrive in the environment that America has to offer. When they were young, they escaped the genocide known as the Khmer Rouge in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. They were forced to learn a new language and adapt to the new environment around them. Their struggles meant that as the first born of a second generation immigrant family, I was expected to succeed in academics in order to help my parents and brother survive. I'm expected to help them with all of their paperwork, and my brother's homework. I am expected to carry on both cultures to the next generation. There's more of a force rather than a will to continue living this way, mostly it is out of guilt. To be quite honest, this is not the way I want to live. It's a selfish wish, which is why I continue to live for others, to nurture them and attend to their needs. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,107,"""Why am I here?"" This question is super general but I'm here for a lot of reasons. Firstly, I'm in this class because its a part of my prerequisite for my major which is biology - physiology and also for dental school. I'm also here in college because I want to pursue a higher education and be able to get a job that I am passionate about. Lately I've been feeling very discouraged, especially since the whole covid - 19 and everything going on. Especially switching all of the classes to online classes has been very hard to adjust. I've taken online classes before but having all of my major courses online is difficult. It requires a lot of self discipline and organization. So far I'm definitely trying my best and I'm doing okay in school/work life, home life not so much but things happen, I'll get through it. I want this work ethic to continue this way until the end of the semester. It's my last year here at SF state and I want to work super hard since I'm so close to the finish line. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,108,"I feel like I genuinely belong in this physics class or any physics class because I've always been intrigued on how and why things happen the way it does (i.e why an apple falls from a tree? how to calculate the physics under shooting a basketball so that you can make it every time?) Having these types of wondrous inquiries had led me to take physic the year before and ever since, I'm more willing to learn about how everything works the way it does and so that's why I am still continuing to take physic classes. I have never been more interested in physics before then now because I had the best physics professor my previous year, professor dr. Xu. He was an awesome teacher who genuinely had love for physics and wanted to teach other of it and the things he was seeing in physicist point of view. His style of teaching was calm, collected, and easy to understand (because his explanation of things was way different than any other teacher that I have ever had before, a teacher that I can relate to)."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,109,"I am here in physics because it is a requirement for my major. Although it is a requirement physics is an interesting subject to learn. I find physics very difficult to learn and study but it also brings curiosity to my mind. I want to be in physics to understand the concept further where it will help me understand my concentration in molecular and cell biology. I don’t have much of a want to be here but a need to be here as physics is a concrete foundation in learning other topics. Physics is also all around us, how things work, gravity, and etc. If it is all around us we should understand its existence and the purpose that it brings us. I thought I wouldn’t be capable of learning this subject but I passed physics 1 and I believe if I study hard enough I can pass physics 2. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,110,"I am currently attending San Fransico State University because it was the closest school that was near my family. Although I could have attended other schools, this school was more convenient. Particularly, I am in its class because it is a prerequisite for medical school. I feel that I am taking this class because of that but also because it is very valuable to learn to be prepared for the MCAT. I hope that through this lab class, I will be able to learn more in-depth and truly understand the fundamental concepts in the course. I found that with labs, the material or concepts are more fully ingrained in my understanding overall. Having labs with the lecture courses generally help me apply some concepts in the real world and lets me get to know some of my classmates even more. With labs, I can 'make more friends' because most of the time when I do not understand a step then its easier for me to ask a colleague rather than the instructor. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,111,"Why am I here? I am here in this physics class to finish my undergrad major requirements. I am majoring in Biochemistry, so I have a couple of lower-division science classes that I need to take. This will be my last physics class for my requirement. I took general physics 1 last summer semester as a head start, so now I’m taking general physics two now. Why am I here in this school? I choose San Francisco State University because of the biochemistry department. I was told that San Francisco State has an amazing biochemistry program. Another reason, I choose to be here in this school because luckily my financial aid (FAFSA) package was able to fully pay my tuition. The last reason I chose to go to San Francisco State University is that it was close to home. I wanted to choose a school that was close to home."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,112,"To be completely honest I am taking this course to further my progression in my major. Simply this course is a major requirement. However I do enjoy taking physics labs, they are probably my second favorite lab class to take next to biology. I thoroughly enjoy the experiments and applying what I learn in lecture into a real world scenario. Through physics labs I can see and understand concepts from lecture more clearly and get a better understanding of the material. This lab class for me is another way of extending my scientific knowledge and helps me experience new scientific theories. Even though this class is a requirement and I must complete it for my major I do not look at it that way. I look at this class as a new scientific experience in my educational career."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,113,"Why am I here?I was in high school when I decided to pursue my studies in the United States. I always wanted to study abroad. I wanted to experience a new environment and a new schooling system. To be precise I am taking this class because it's a prerequisite for my course. I am a biochem major and I am looking forward to becoming a pharmaceutical scientist. And I think that physics is really important when it comes to research. I always hated physics back in high school. But after coming to the United States, I have kind of started taking interest in Physics. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,114,"I think I am here because I enjoy learning. I am a sucker for information and I thoroughly enjoy learning about the world around us. Even though there are classes that don't really follow my career path they are still interesting to learn about. Physics is not my major but it is very interesting to learn about because there can be several physical studies to look into cellular forces. There are some studies to show how cells have been affected since the beginning of life because of charges that are based on the chemistry of the cell. This is why I am here. I am here because I am curious about how the world around us works in a chemical, biological, and physical way as they all connect into the perfectly placed world that we have around us. I am also here because I have realized that there are not enough people convincing others that science is real. There are not enough people that understand the basic biology of life which is one of the most fundamental aspects to understand how we work. If we all had a more general understanding of how we work and how we interact with the world around us, then we would I think we would have a little more respect for out mother earth and each other. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,115,"In one sense, I am here because I completed physic 1 and now I would like to complete physics 2.  In  another sense, I am here because I want to go to medical school, and this class a prerequisite for many of the schools I am looking to apply to.  Previously, I was planning on going to a Ph.D program for Psychology after undergraduate school, but at the end of my Junior year in undergrad I decided I actually wanted to go to medical school.  I had been considering it throughout that whole year, but I didn't think I was ""smart enough.""  Luckily I gained the courage by the end of the year to follow my dreams!  I was cared to ""start over"" in a sense, but I know I would regret it for the rest of my life if I didn't take the chance and try. I am glad to say, after taking the majority of prerequisites, I feel confident in my self and my ability to get in to medical school and succeed in medical school!"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,121,"I'm here in this class because I need to take this class for my major. But this class will help me learn about the introduction of electricity and magnetism. It would be nice to learn something different, so later it can be helpful in life. This class will help me have an understanding of the topic. Some topics of physics will help me through life because in life there is physics. Also, I'm a visual learner, so the lab will help me learn more about the topic I learn from the lecture. Also, because I like learning topics with activity, so it can help me more. Being in this class I will maybe meet new people that have different kinds of majors. I guess I'm here in this class, so I can learn from different people learning skills and opinions of physics. Also, because a different person might describe it differently than the professor."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,116,"I am here to further my learning. I don't have any particular passion for physics but it is useful for my every day life and I need it for my degree. Ultimately I am hoping to go to medical school and study to be a surgeon because I'd like to make a positive impact on the world. In the case that I cannot, for whatever reason, finish my intended career path and go through with medical school, I would hope that I'm still doing something meaningful, like working for the Center for Disease control or in a lab doing important research. Regardless of what I officially end up doing I'd like to be able to help others and create a meaningful connection to people with what I am doing. Being able to help people gives me purpose in life and makes me feel needed."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,117,"I am in this class because it is a major requirement for graduation. Even though I am still uncertain about my career path, I have to keep moving on and through each semester, although this semester is unlike anything I've ever had before. I am here at college because, in this day and age, it is expected of us to go but I can't really imagine doing anything else anyways. Because of COVID-19, I will be here at my house for the remainder of this semester and maybe the next one. Online learning is a sad new reality for students, at least in the United States. However, at least there are some advantages to online learning. Zoom and other similar platforms are able to bring people together from all over the world. Having guest speakers has been easier. There is no need to commute, which saves time and money. I am here but at the same time, I am not really here. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,118,"I am here to study physics and have a basic understanding on why things work or why they react with each other in a way that can’t be explained by a different study. This suits well from what I want to do in the future because I want to be a doctor and learning how physics has impacted medicine in a great way is a good thing. From x-ray, CT scans, and MRI, all came from an understanding of physics and how electromagnetic fields work and such. Information such as gravity, pressure, and volume from learning physics and their laws help with understanding the body. With modern science and modern machines, we take physics to learn the basic science of these new technological developments and how they work. Many things we have today would have been invented without the knowledge that comes from learning physics and how it affects us."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,119,"Well, to start off, I found this question pretty vague, which I'm assuming is the point of this question. I’m not sure what “here” really is. Why am I here on this Earth? Why am I here at San Fransisco State? Why am I here taking a physics class? Honestly, I’m not really sure what a definitive answer would be to most of those questions. I’m still iffy on what I want to be when I “grow up.” I’ve always been interested in helping people- but just not sure how to do it. When I was first deciding on which university to transfer to, I chose SF State because they gave me the option to graduate early as a Sociology major. But what was I really going to do with all that saved time? Honestly, the only question I do know the answer to is why I’m taking a physics class-- it's a prerequisite for medical school, PA school, dental school, you name it. I know I want to do something in healthcare, I'm just unsure which path I want to go down but it's always safe to cover all my bases. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,120,"I am in this class because I need physics for my major which is Cell and Molecular Biology. It is a little hard to see how physics is related to cell biology, but when trying to relate it to molecular biology the connection becomes a little clearer. A lot of chemistry is involved in how molecules move around and operate. When chemistry is involved, physics is almost always involved.I guess another reason why I'm here (pertaining to sfsu) is because it's near my house. Although i do not qualify for FAFSA, my family and I still can not afford for me to live on campus or in san Francisco. This limited my university options a lot. Out of the bay area universities I could have chosen, they had to be close enough to my house which is in Oakland and they had to be universities that I actually wanted to go to. So I ended up choosing sfsu. "
