2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,104,"I would say that my biggest take away from this class would obviously be a better and more concise understanding of physics, however a subject that I would say was very important to me personally learning about was the lesion about waves. The reason that I thought of this section of class specifically is because first, I thought the ideas of destructive and constructive interference was very interesting and explains a lot of phenomenon of the world outside of the physics lab such as how noise-canceling headphones function. And secondly and more importantly, is because this section looked at the light fringe experiment which showed me that light travels in waves due to the destructive and constructive interference properties of the experiment. However, building more on this subject, in the lecture, I learned that light was also a particle at the same time, which then transitioned my learning from traditional physics into relative and quantum physics. This is a subject that really interested me because since high school I have always learned about traditional physics rather than these more modern and unorthodox ideas of relativity. Definitely overall the greatest take away from this class was expanding my ideas and understanding of physics, but specifically, I would say the section that intrigued me the most and I feel I learned the most from were the wave interference labs and relative physics portion of the lecture. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,120,"The main take away from this class is that physics can be seen in everyday life. Last semester in physics it was a lot harder to connect physics to real life. Most examples were just about cars. But this semester we were able to connect physics with more real life topics, like lenses, light, and waves."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,106,"My greatest takeaway from the class is how various subjects in physics can be used to relate or solve problems in everyday life. Through my experiences from taking this course, I learned the reasonings of why and how things work such as vision, sound vibrations, waves of water, gravity, etc. Rather than exploring the topics individually, they all seemed to piece together like a giant web. I think that after learning various subjects in this class I am able to see the world for what it is in a larger picture because I now have a better understanding of the various attributes that explain the environment. Previously, I thought that the subjects had little to do with everyday life because I didn't find them to be useful or efficient ways of thinking. After realizing that these subjects aim to explain the deeper meaning of things, I found it to be almost intriguing. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,102,My gratest takeaway from this class was that physics is a very interesting subject and it actually applies alot to our daily lives. Physics helps us alot with everyday life and used in manufacturing many devices we use everyday. Such as building electric circuits for a house or building a tv. Physics is used in circuits to figure our which patterns to build the circuit in order for it to supply power to the whole house evenly without blowing a phuse. Physics is also used to make television sets when they place a lense in the tv physics is used in order to determine the shape of the lense in order to provide a wider view for the individuals that are watching it. So those are some takeaways I got from the class that relates to our everyday life and helps to make our lives more convenient and to provide us with essential information for our lives.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,108,"Whats greatest take away from this lab course? Where should I start. I think that the most useful thing that I learned from this course was how positive and enthusiastic you were in every lab which was very beneficial to me because it encouraged me to learn more efficiently. I believe that how professors approach a lecture is way more important than what you are taught that day because if a professor is not in a right mood to teach, then his or hers lecture might not be as efficient as it could be. My other greatest takeaway from this class was how fast we got through things as a whole class because every one understood what they are suppose to do and that all comes from the teaching from the professor. The professor has to make every single lecture amusing because there are many students that are hands-on learner/ visual learners, and especially through online classes, it is very easy to lose concentration. Overall, I learned so much interns of knowledge but I learned most on how to teach a class, and how to keep every one excited for the next lab."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,114,"My greatest takeaway from this class has been general concepts about the physics 2 ideas that were described in lecture. I think it is really waves that define movement and are considered to affect us in almost every way possible because of our sight, smell, and hearing. All of these release vibrations that are considered in physics to describe our surroundings. I really think that these factors that we have studies so much have an affect specifically on cancer causing agents. This is something that I was to study and look into for my research later on. Physics 2 has taught me more about concepts than math like physics 1. I really enjoyed it because it was another side of physics that was in a way similar but towards the end it became very different than physics 1. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,109,"My greatest takeaway in this class is all the logic we learned behind how these simulations work. Although we can’t experience lab hands on this semester which is disappointing, I feel we still got a sense of how these labs work and understand why such reactions occur. I believe the most important lab were the first couple of labs when we worked with positive and negative charges. As I am a biology major and going to minor in chemistry, we talk a lot and use charges on an everyday basis to understand why such chemicals react with each other. The most interesting lab were the ones we got to do hands on at home because it kept me focused and I got to interact with the lab material making it easier to have a grasp at the concept. One of these for example was the charge lab with thale tape. It was easy to understand this lab because unlike the simulation, I can actually work with the material than just watch."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,107,"What my greatest take away from this class is the ability to discuss with others is very important. I know especially now since we are doing school online and not actually physically interacting with people, it's good to still discuss with others. I understand how sometimes we can forget how there are so many other possibilities and it's great to talk to others and see what they think. Overall I enjoyed this class and how the professor made us think outside of the box. I also really appreciate how professor patel gave us the opportunity to make up work, it really helped make me feel less pressure since physics itself is already hard to understand. Another takeaway from this class is I can do things I didn’t think I was capable of, I just have to be persistent and not give up. I really realized that I do just need the extra time and that’s okay, I just have to start earlier and not wait last minute for the lessons I’ve learned to stick to my head. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,121,My greatest take away from this lab was that all concept topics that we learn in lab is related to our daily life and that phyiscs is important in our life. I learn how to read a dialgram of waves and calcuate the distance between each object and wave. Another thing that I took away from this lab would be going in detail about the different topic that we learn in this semister. I learn how we see each object on the mirror and what position the objoct or us have to see it in the mirror. I also took out of this lab is to understanding how phyiscs works and how to think like a scientist. I learn how each wave interact with another wave and how the pressure of the wave making the sound loud and low. The las thing that I took awasy from this lab was having skills on solving a problem in a different way. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,111,"What was my greatest take away from this class? My greatest take away from this class was expanding my critical thinking skills. Physics is a pretty hard subject for me to understand. During this lab, I have noticed there are many questions in the lab that have me using critical thinking skills. During the first couple of labs, I had trouble coming up with ways to solve my answer. I study a bit more on the subject and use my critical thinking skills to solve and answer the problems. Another great takeaway from this class was learning how each topic to learn works and can relate to our everyday life outside of the physics lab. I enjoy learning how physics is used in our world/everyday life. These lab courses didn’t just only teach me what the subjects are about and how they work. They also taught me how to use my critical thinking skills whenever I got stuck on a problem."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,105,"""What was my greatest take away from this class?""When I think about this question there is two things that instantly pop into my head. The first being that if you really want to learn no matter what obstacles come in your way, you will find a way to learn. I noticed this especially with everything going on such as the pandemic. In person school was canceled for everybody and everyone had to now learn remotely over zoom. This was especially hard for a lab class because it is honestly not the same learning hands on versus a simulation that is done on a computer. Even though we had obstacles we still tried our hardest to learn and we succeeded. We did not let the pandemic stop us from being able to go to school and learn. The second would be that physics is around us everywhere in our everyday life and we just don't notice it. The simplest tasks that you do everyday involve physics such as a driving a car or going on a walk. That is what I enjoy about physics, I am able to relate it to my everyday life and things that are routine to me."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,113,"My greatest takeaway is this new learning experience. All the things we studied in the lab, are also taught in the class. But experience is far better than knowledge isn't it? Knowledge is important of course but the experience is more important. This is the reason why we have labs for biology chemistry and physics classes. It is because things done practically are more useful and stays in our mind throughout life. It was difficult for all of us to cooperate during this pandemic. But because of the stimulations and your helpful recordings, made things very easier for students. I wasn't able to attend the live classes because of the time difference. But still, the recording made me feel as if I am in the class. I really enjoyed this class. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,112,"My greatest take away from this class was expanding my knowledge physics and how we can found out certain aspects of physics by performing experiments with every day items. These labs have really opened my understanding from some physics concept and made me question and learn different things. Even though this is my last physics lab I will take in my current college career I will take what I learned in this lab and attempt to apply them to my other classes. I will always take what I learned in this class to my everyday life and have a better understanding of the world around me. This class has shown me the many way that physics plays a part in our everyday lives. Even though some of the concepts can be hard to grasp and understand, the labs we conducted this semester were very helpful in my understanding of many physics ideas and theories."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,119,"I'll be honest, I never wanted to take a physics class. Before I decided to go into medicine, my plan was to make it through high school and college without having taken a physics class. I found just the idea itself extremely daunting. However, now that I'm done with both physics one and two, I'm not too sure what I was so worried about. In my opinion, I found the lab sessions to be incredibly more helpful in comparison to the lectures. I think my biggest takeaway from the lab sessions was learning how to work with people in an online setting. Online lectures are not very interactive. Being in the breakout rooms, I got a chance to work on my communication skills and learn from my peers. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,117,"My greatest takeaway from this course wasn't necessarily a specific concept although I have learned a lot. Having a physics lab fully online made me more appreciative of the hands-on experience that I've previously had in 121/122. The simulations were a good substitute and I concede that there are some pros of the online format, but there are cons as well. It's also kind of hard to get motivated so I learned that I have to be proactive and it's ultimately up to me to choose to learn. I have to seek out knowledge from the textbook or online or ask the instructor to get a better understanding of the concepts that may be more challenging. This course also cemented the idea that physics isn't something totally abstract and only full of equations, but there are a lot of intersections between our daily life and it does relate a lot to biology and chemistry concepts. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,115,"This class has helped me see that I am capable! I find physics very interesting but also very intimidating.  Math has never been my strong suit, but I have always been very intrigued by the concepts within Physics.  Though I was “scared” of the math, I was able to successfully learn the material.  I feel that the supportive environment provided by Yatrik helped me feel more comfortable with being wrong and asking for help.  Also, one thing I love about physics is that it causes you to view the world from a different perspective.  We take advantage of the complexities within every day events; Having some knowledge of physics you begin to recognize the complex processes present within these every day events and appreciate them.  It is exciting to be able to view the world in this way! It makes me appreciate life even more than I had previously."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,103,"The greatest takeaway from this class is that even if I get it wrong on problems in labs, I was able to understand the concept after with the little hints or as I continue to do other problems which made me catch on to what I did wrong. My favorite labs are the Lenses, Voltage, and Current labs because I did those labs in high school, but there was no in-depth connection or understanding of those concepts it was more of doing this and that, but in your class, I like how you make us think more about its connection to the real world and its importance. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,110,"The greatest takeaway from the class was definitely how waves regardless of the material are in will be consistent. I enjoyed learning about waves and especially after today's lab I learned about half-lives. In this when it comes down to different materials with isotopes that are potentially radio active, the result after 6-7 half-lives become non-existent. The atoms will still be there but only in that itself. We know that atoms cannot be created or destroyed according to the Law of Conservation of Mass. Other than that, it was nice to see waves through guitar strings and waves on these strings as well as seeing interference (constructive and destructive interference) when there are two sources. I didn't know that water particles move up and down rather than moving in a direction. This is why when we are in a swimming pool we have to go to the ball and no matter the efforts to create waves to displace the ball towards a certain direction will be ineffective unless there is a force in the direction of movement desired. "
