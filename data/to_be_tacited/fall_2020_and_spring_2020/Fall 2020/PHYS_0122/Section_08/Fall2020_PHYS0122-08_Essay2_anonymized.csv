2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,112,My educational goals are to obtain my B.S. in General Biology then apply to medical school and obtain my M.D. in Orthopedic Surgery with a specialty in Sports Medicine. To obtain these goals I must continue to perform well in my classes and advance my scientific knowledge. This class can help me to obtain these goals by just providing me with the opportunity to gain this knowledge and move forward in my educational career.
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,107,"My goals in this class is to do the best I can to achieve the grade I deserve. Not only in this class but in all of my classes. This semester i’m taking 17 units and it is a lot. This year is going to be my last year at San Francisco State and I'm doing everything in my power to do well. I’ve been trying my best to manage my time, prioritize, and put my 100% effort into all of my classes. It's been really hard because my family members are sick and I'm the only one who is able to take care of them since I'm the only one not working. I've dealt with loss recently as well and it's just been a whole roller coaster. I've been trying my best to prioritize and manage my time but of course nothing is perfect and doesn't have to go my way all the time. But at the end of the day, I know im trying my hardest and no one can say anything about that to me. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,111,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals? My goals are to graduate on time. What I mean by that is that I want to graduate in four years. I have heard by many people that people who major in any STEM often graduate in five to six years because of all the units and pre-requirements. Luckily, I’m on track to graduate on time. This class is helping me achieve these goals because physics is a required class for my major. This is currently my last physics class since I did general physics 1 last semester (summer). Another goal is to be accepted to dental school. This help is helping me because eventually, I have to take the DAT which is the Dental Admission Test. I'm pretty sure physics is on the exam and plus both general physics 1 and 2 are required courses most dental schools want their applicants to take for undergrad. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,109,"At first I wasn’t sure of why I had to take physics when I’m a biology major but then I understood that physics is actually very important in science overall. My goal in this class is to further understand physics and how the material will further help me understand how physics works in everyday life. My main goal is to understand physics to further understand biology as biology needs the knowledge of how charges work in chemistry and cells. A main part of biology is chemistry due to the elements and chemicals in our body and environment. To understand chemistry, I have to understand how charges work, as chemistry deals with electrical charges. Physics helps me understand how these charges will react to other elements as physics is somewhat a basic knowledge needed to understand how everything else works in life. My goal overall in doing this is to become a scientist who studies the human body which therefore I need basic knowledge of physics to understand chemistry and biology."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,120,"Well because physics is not my major, I only have a few reasons why I'm taking this class. I am a biology major and it is required for me to take the Physics II lab. So my goals for this class are to complete the requirement with the physics knowledge I need to know for my major. This class can help me achieve these goals by completing the requirement and giving me simulations of the labs so I can learn from them as if it were the regular physics lab."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,102,"My overall goal of completing this course is so I can complete my prerequisites for dental school, so I can become a dentist. This class is also improtant for me so I can have a background in physics so I can do well on the DAT. This class is also helpful in order for me to earn my bachelor's degree in biology. This class teaches many different skills such as electricity which is very important for building circuits and fuse boxes. It also provides a good base for branching into other fields such as any STEM major. Although my goal is to be a dentist this class also provides many other opportunities incase I decide not to pursue dentistry but this class is still very instrumental for my success in my career choice, so I have to do my best in order to pass this class so I can continue my academic journey and hopefully graduate and go to dental school."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,119,"My goal in life is to become a psychiatrist. I love to help people and am a huge advocate of mental health. The biggest way this class is helping me achieve my goals is by being a pre-requestive for medical school. Although physics is not too correlated with the human body, it does have some use to understand physiology. This lab class in particular is very helpful in helping me understand concepts from my physics lecture. I am a visual learner and the simulations we do in lab help me grasp the concepts better. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,104,"My goal in life is to complete my bachelor's dree in biology at San Francisco State. Not only that but I wish to also attend medicinal school and hope to receive my doctorate degree and become a general physician or any doctor that specializes in any field, more specifically possibly radiology. How this class can help me is by giving me a better understanding of physics which I need in order to do well on the MCAT testing which I need to complete in order to apply to medical school. Other than that all I really need from this class is that I need to complete it as a prerequisite for my degree in bio physiology. Other than that, the only thing that this course could really help me with is doing well on the MCAT and possibly do better in future physics class that I possibly might have to take in the future."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,113,"My goal is to become a pharmaceutical scientist. And when you talk about the research field you must have good analytical skills, planning and performing experiments also logical reasoning. And I guess Physics is important as it helps in analyzing things. It helps us do good reasoning. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,105,"What are my goals and how can this class help me achieve these goals?I have several current goals at the moment. My current goals academically are to receive good grades and to graduate with a degree in Biology w a concentration in cellular & molecular. I then wanna go into medicine and work as a forensic scientist. This class will help me achieve this goal because this class is a pre-requisite for the degree that I am going for. I have some personal goals as well, I am trying to start thinking critically and to be more mindful about situations that are going on. This class will help me achieve my goals because this class material teaches you how to think critically in order to understand the material. I hope that I will soon be able to achieve my goals, with the help of this class. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,115,"My goal is to go to medical school and become a surgeon one day! This class will help me achieve that by not only fulfilling a prerequisite, but also teaching me needed background information to succeed in medical school and a medical career.  Though the focus of medical school is not necessairly on physics, this class is helping me to build a critical mind and gain information to build important inferences and connections upon when learning new information in other classes or even in the future; it is helping me to gain a good and steady base of knowledge and explanations as to how the world around us works which in turn will help me to understand the workings of the human body.  I also feel this class is broadening my mind which can only help in the long run when facing difficult situations or when pondering over phenomena in life. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,121,"My goal in this class is to pass the class and that I know a little bit about physics. This class can help me achieve these goals by I go to class and learning about physics. By doing the activities we do in class, to have a bettering understanding of each topic. By looking at the power points to also have a bettering understanding of the topic. It can also help me see the connection between the objects. Also, it will help me have a better understanding of the world and how each thing is connected to physics. It will help me to express my creativity, building things, solving problems skills, critical knowledge, and that there are other ways to solve the problem and not just one way. This class will also help me see the world in new ways and then change it because we need physics in our life"
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,106,"Ultimately, my goal is to pursue a career in physical therapy. In order to do so, I need a strong foundation in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics in order to have a better understanding of subjects such as Biomechanics, Exercise Physiology, and Motor Development/Learning. Physics as a whole is important for understanding the human body, and how it is able to move mechanically. The human body is full of lever systems, typically third class levers, and can be explained through a variety of kinematic theories and equations. For example, a biceps curl, featuring a third class lever at the radioulnar joint; the resistance would be located on the opposite end of the lever, where the hand would be holding an object, and the effort would be produced by the biceps brachii. Although many people who study Kinesiology might not understand why they must first study Physics, it should be noted that physics lays the groundwork to better understand the forces produced by muscles. I personally do not see the correlation between electric fields and Kinesiology, however I do see a strong correlation between kinematics and Kinesiology. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,108,"I have always had a thing in me that screams out physics is your subject and you should understand it and and enjoy the process of learning it but I have always had trouble with it. My issue with physics is that although I can do a physics problem right then, I can't really put it into a daily life scenario. I think my main problem is that are lots of formulas in physics and it's had to keep tract of which one to use in which scenario. So the goal that I'm settling out to myself is to really understand the situation and be able to put it into real life situation. What do I hope to learn in this class that I haven't learned in other physic classes? I hope that this class will be the one that connects me and the world of physics together and helps me reach the goal that I set upon myself to be able to relate my learning into everyday life situations. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,103,"My goal is to finish my bachelor degree in biochemistry in 4 to 5 years. Your class can help my goal, because I need this course due to it being a prerequisite requirement which I need to graduate. Also I want to take this class to improve my critical thinking, learn how to solve unfamiliar problems, utilizing scientific methods, stabilize my basic knowledge of physics  and work in diverse groups to explore different thinking and ideas when dealing with hard problems, because I feel like this will help me get a better understanding of physics. Physics is a challenging subject, but I feel that as I practice I can get better at solving and figuring out the problems; therefore, I do believe physics is a necessary subject and I developed a liking for it. In addition, I believe that my understanding of physics will be helpful in the real world and future careers, because as I learn more about physics I can apply it to situations when needed."
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,114,I am interested in learning about cellular forces and I really feel like there are a lot if subjects in this class that connect to that. I feel like I want to study and make connections between physics and biology more so than there already is. Maybe bring something to light that no one has seen before. I feel like in this class I need to study more of the concepts behind these ideas so that I can really allow myself to see the physics aspects in cells. There are so many components to these cells that interact and my question is always: what are the forces that drive these cells to create these kinds of interactions. There are so many concepts of physics that may explain these cellular ideas that I have I just feel like I don't have all the information yet. I feel like I need to study the connections that people have already made? There is so much information and not enough time to study everything. 
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,117,"My goals are to graduate and then be successful. Get a good job that pays fairly well. I don't really have a concrete idea of what I want to do after. Maybe CLS, a Master's, a Ph.D.? That's something I've been mulling over recently and I really should come up with a long-term goal. Although this class may not play a huge role in this, it is a major requirement class that I have to pass. While achieving good grades isn't everything, it is still important. My goal is also to pass this lab course as well as the lecture course. To me, physics has never been a class I enjoyed (no offense).  It can be confusing and hard to understand. But it really does make me think. With it being online, I think it's even more difficult now to grasp, although the labs are somewhat easier. Doing labs in person is crucial, not only for this class but for my other lab course in chemistry. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,110,"One goal of mine is to become a pediatrician. From a young age, I knew I wanted to be a doctor but not until a couple of years ago, I realized I wanted to specialize in pediatrics. This class is one of the prerequisites to get into medical school. I hope that through this class as well as the lecture, I will be able to understand the fundamentals needed to take the MCAT.Another goal of mine is to graduate undergrad with both a Bachelor of Science in Physiology and a Bachelor of Arts in Child Development in School-Aged Children. This class will help me because it is one of the many steps to graduating with this degree. This class is needed not only to complete these steps but it is also really helpful in understanding concepts that I can apply to my knowledge in the real world. Like why certain objects work the way they do and the types of factors that can contribute to an object to have a certain reaction or outcome. "
2020,Fall,PHYS 0122,--,8,118,"My goals are to pass all my classes with a grade higher than a B. I also want to find a better job that will give me the hours I need to save some money to pay for my mcat test and the following applications. Also, I just want to learn as much as I can on how things works. This class fit with that because physics will give me a basic understanding of how everything works. In the future I would like to become the best neurosurgeon and become known for my research and work in the field. I would also want to have a breakthrough in any field of the science that will help us move forward in research in what subject field I will be researching on. This class will help by allowing me to be more openminded with concepts and  be able to understand hard topics.                "
