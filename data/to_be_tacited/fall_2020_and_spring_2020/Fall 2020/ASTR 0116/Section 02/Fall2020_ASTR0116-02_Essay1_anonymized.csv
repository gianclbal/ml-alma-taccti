Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1231,"To be quite honest, I do not know what my purpose in life is. As a matter of fact, I believe we have multiple purposes in life since we go through many different kinds of transitions. What those transitions are, is up to the universe to decide. For example, I knew the roles I would have to take on when my little sister came into the world; I needed and wanted to be a good role model for her so she can come to me with whatever problems she is going through. But that’s just one example out of an infinite amount out there. All I know, at this point in my life, are my likes and dislikes, the person I would like to become in the future, and even the person I’d like to be with for the rest of my life. But my main purpose at the moment is to work hard and finish these next 2 years of school to get my Bachelor’s degree in Anthropology and Minor in Recreation, Parks, and Tourism."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1232,"I'm here because I need to be honestly, this class is a requirement for me, but I honestly enjoy Astronomy, I like learning about our universe, it's really trippy to me and just like wows me every time I learn something new because it's like why? I always have a why question after I learn something about our universe, like even if I learn the fact and the why it is the way it is, I'm still like OK BUT WHY, I don't know if that makes sense but it's just how trippy it gets me. I'm so into these kinda things. But anyways thats about it for my way, writing from my stream of consciousness is a bit hard cause I'm like what do I even write about? But I'm looking forward to this class and hopefully learn more trippy universe things."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1233,"Natalie Aguirre   ASTRO 116-02     “Why Am I Here”   Why am I here? It’s actually a question I ask myself more often than I realized. I asked myself   that for the first time in seventh grade. A question I still ask myself today. My junior year of high   school I realized I am here to help others as I joined peer counseling and applied for a   counseling internship through my school for the following school semester. Senior year my   purpose was to help others solve their own problems and find ways to promote mental health.   The question came up again in my head entering college. Why am I here? What can I do to   change the world? Why should I care about changing the world? I then realized that I care a lot,   that’s just who I am. With that being said I care for the plant and the beings on them, both   animals and humans. I made my purpose to help not only others but nature as well. I decided to   combat climate change by lowering my carbon footprint and finding alternative solutions that   won’t harm the plant like switching out single use plastics for lifelong alternatives that are   recyclable or biodegradable. While I am helping the plant with my small contributions I am also   studying to become a therapist with my psychology major. I wish to help those with disabilities   feel that they too have a purpose and their disability is nothing to be ashamed of. I am here to   help others because of the big heart that I carry."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1234,"Why are we here? I am here taking this class because one of my friends mentioned it was interesting. I am here and one of the few punctually at 9 a.m. because I want to finish my assignment during class during group work and use my resources efficiently. I am here after class finishing my assignments and tying loose ends to ensure I am doing everything possible to have a good grade. My purpose is to succeed and learn along the way and that is why I am present and “here” today. We can't always dictate our life and find the answers but it helps me to find purpose by doing mindful actions such as being present today. If I asked myself why I'm here and had no answer, that would make me feel useless and unsure. Instead I chose to focus on the positives and credit myself for the work I have accomplished today. I am here because I woke up today and I am ready to serve my purpose, whatever it may be."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,226,"Roxana Garcia Rojas   Ricardo Flores   ASTR 116   24 August 2020   “Why am I Here?”   I am here to be a role model and give inspiration to those who come from low-income   communities. As I go through college, and think about what I’m passionate about or what I want   to do later in life, my answer always leads me to being an educator. Life is hard, and the   institutional oppressions that have held and still hold my family captive, as well as my   community and others like mine, is something that I want to bring light to and tear down. But   that takes the work of many, and to begin, you must first be educated. Which sucks because to be   educated you have to go to an institution, take tests that cost money, pay for college applications,   and all that hard work needs to be done because to be successful in America you must have a   degree. However, working always seems so much easier, you earn money, and set your hours,   and there’s no stress on homework or reading. I want to show that working towards your   education is purposeful work. To break down and fight against everything that oppresses you   shows your strength. I wish more people could see that."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1235,"Why Am I Here              I remembered when I was a kid I was interested in business management, During high school, I had to do a lot of research about different colleges. I originally have chosen another college in a different city. But everything has changed when my grandpa passed away in my senior year. My grandpa and grandma live together for a long time, and my mom was the one who is taking care of them. During my high school senior year, my grandpa has passed away suddenly. My grandma had Alzheimer’s disease and has gotten worse after grandpa passed away. I was afraid that she will forget me one day and I told my mom about San Francisco State University is also a college for business. Then I had a conversation with my mom about this college and, is closer to grandma’s house which I can help take care of my grandma after school. That is how I have entered San Francisco State University, Overall, I am not regretting any choices I have made so far."

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1239,"I'm here to learn new things and find my passion. I really want to go into business and create an idea that can benefit society. I hope to learn a lot about marketing, and have my own business one day. I think it interests me because I don't want to be stuck in a job that I hate, I'd rather find my passion and do something that I love; so starting my own business would be something really challenging yet inspiring. I’m excited for what the future holds, but also nervous because things don’t always go as planned. I’m not sure what to expect for the next couple of years but I really hope that I can work my hardest to achieve the goals I have in mind.    "
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1240,I am here because my mom took Astronomy when she was in college and she loved it. She told me all about it and how it was so interesting to her. She said that after class she would go up to the professor and ask him a bunch of questions about space that she was wondering about. Every time she would walk up to him at the end of class he would roll his eyes (to be funny) because she always had so many questions. Im also taking this class because space and astronomy have interested me ever since I was little and I want to be able to answer my questions I had when I was younger. I really started being interested in astronomy in 6th grade when I was at science camp. The instructors took us out at night took look at all the constilations and I loved it. Im excited to learn all the interesting facts of Astrology. 
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1241,"Reflective Journal 1:                 						         Renick Slazinski  	Honestly I used to wonder “Why I am here” I truly think it is one of life’s great mysteries. I think it is a question that changes with time, like how we change and mature and our tastes begin to evolve and change. Also since it’s vague it could also just mean like “hey why are you in this lab class?”. I think to answer the latter, I am here because I am a senior at SFSU, I am on the cusp of graduating and the school has consistently refused to accept my community college astronomy lab/class. I had to fight tooth and nail but finally they accepted me taking just the lab to let me graduate.  	Now on why I am here in the universe. I know I will be going a little over, my apologies. I truly do not even know any more. COVID has kinda destroyed my social life, I lost out on a relationship, I lost my job, and I lost family. I kinda think my whole purpose on why I am still going on is just to keep their memories and experiences with me. I sent someone I care about deeply a letter where I bore my heart out to them and I somewhat realized that no matter how awful my life gets or how distant we become I will always keep them with me. It’s funny because doing my observations my legs somewhat turn to jelly realizing how small I am in this vast world. It makes me  feel comforted to have so much in my mind and in my heart regardless of how small I am in the scheme of things."

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1243,"Hello, my name is Samuel King and I am here because I want to do something good with my life and also I want to prove the people who think I am not gonna do anything with my life wrong, that's what drives me most . I also want my life to have meaning, I want to give back to my community and to help with some of the problems like helping the homeless, and just trying to help out in any way possible. I know I got to work hard because if you put your heart into and work hard you can do anything. I am here because I have a purpose, everybody has a purpose you just have to be willing to put in that hard work because anything can happen so I want to make sure I live life to the fullest and make sure my life is meaningful"
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1244,"I am not exactly sure why I am here. I choose to believe that we all have a purpose, but I have no clue as to what mine would be? I find it more pleasing to believe that I have a purpose rather than believing that I am just on this earth for no particular reason. Although I don’t know why I am here or what my purpose is at the moment, I believe that one day it will become clear to me. Right now, I just try my best to live happily until my purpose is fulfilled. I also believe that everyone is connected and that each person’s purpose affects one another’s. Like each of our lives our chapters to one big story. That little thought of all life being connected brings me this sort of comfort. I just think the universe is a pretty interesting thing to learn about."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1245,"I like to think I’m here because I’m meant to live a life that I, myself, find meaningful, and also because my parents wanted me to (haha). At the moment, I want to be a therapist, although I’m not sure if I want to specialize with families or individuals, I do know I want to be there for people and be able to bring some relief to their lives. And while that may be what I want at the moment, it might change and I hope to find satisfaction with that path. I also want to find happiness, which I know is never a constant but that will only make me appreciate it more when I am happy with myself and my life. But I think my “purpose” in life is just to exist and live the best life that I possibly can without the burden of needing to do something great."

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1247,"Michael UrestiAstro 116“Why am I Here”                         Honestly i'm not too sure why i'm here but there's only one thing i know and that is to make it worth it all the way through till the end, I personally don’t think anyone knows why were all here but I know that everyone has a purpose, goal, desire or a dream they want to achieve in life. For me i'm not fully sure what i want to do with my life, i always say to myself that i just want to live life and have fun with it , enjoy it, it is true that i want to have fun and live it, but i think i can do more than what i'm doing right now. Everyone have beliefs of their own of what they believe in like opinions, theories or yourself and if you believe in yourself that means you are trying to achieve more in life and have a purpose for yourself, i mean everyone believes in that we were born or put on earth for a reason like a purpose, I personally agree but were all not to sure why were here, but there's one thing i can say and that is to find your own purpose or dream that you want to do and achieve."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1248,why am I here  I can write a lot about this topic but what I want to write about is why am I here in the United States. I came from China I moved to the US when I was 12. I have friends and family in China but why am I here. I can think of many reasons my parent want me to be here and my mom’s family wants me to be here. But on my own reason is that I cant survive in China society. There 1.4 billion people there in China. I have to compare with 1.4 billion people and to survive I have to put two hundred percent of hard work.  So come to the united state to compete with few people.
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1249,"Why am I here?I am here because my mom did not know how to use birth control and my dad did not know how to use a condom. However, if this an existential question, I guess I am here like everyone else to serve a purpose. Whether that is to help in humanitarian ways, help save lives, clean the environment. We all have some purpose. Personally, I want to be here to see my loved ones succeed in life and make something of themselves. I would want to grow in my own career and never get lost in it and forget my roots nor family. I want to have children relatively young not older than 25 because my mom was a young mom. I know she'll get to meet my children and maybe even her great grandchildren. I would want that for myself as well. I just want to be here for my loved ones and be able to do what I love and to not have any stress or worry in the world. But the reality hits and I am living in a pandemic, racial inequality is dividing my country and there are so many basic human rights being  violated and is it really worth being here. I hope the parallel universe me is doing well."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1250,"I have joined this class not only because it seemed interesting, but also because I have been fascinated by astronomy since I was a child. I want to learn more about astronomy because there is so much out there, further than we could ever see. I would like to learn about the calculations and how it applies to  the class, and understand  to do it on my own and use the material I learn and apply it to my life outside of school. I want to learn more about constellations, nebulas, and our galaxy. I like to go on NASAs page every now and then to see if they have discovered anything new. I also like to see new pictures that the rovers or satellites have taken. Ever since I was a child I loved going on top of the roof of the house and look up at the night sky and try to find constellations, or watch the solar/lunar eclipse, and watching the meteor showers as well, and ever since then I have always wanted to learn more about what is out there and that is why I have joined this class, that is why I am here. "
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1251,"Josceline Perez  8/24/20 ASTR 116-02  Reflective Journaling Essay #1: Why am I here? I enrolled in Astronomy Lab this fall semester because I'm interested in this topic of learning about space like our solar system, moon, stars and more and have a better understanding of the discoveries found in outer space since I don't know so much about it but I'm really excited about learning more about our universe. I also enrolled in the lecture of astronomy this semester and I hope I am able to learn more about this topic and expand my interest and knowledge in astronomy. I also took this class because it was a GE requirement but mostly because I find this topic really interesting to me that gives me an interest to go more in depth. I want to learn about different galaxies if there are and go in depth about our different planets there are in space. I also want to know what are the different objects we are able to see only through telescopes and not with our own eyes."
