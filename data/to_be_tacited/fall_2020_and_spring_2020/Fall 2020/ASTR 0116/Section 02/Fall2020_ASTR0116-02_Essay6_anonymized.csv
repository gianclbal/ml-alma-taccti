2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1245,"Online classes have made it easier for me to slack off during class, because there is nothing and no one keeping me accountable for my actions. I prefer having in person classes, which I know are not available, but I am still doing well academically with online classes. I just hope by the time we get back to school, people won’t be too dependent on the easy accessibility we get online. I do not feel like I have been more or less productive, but I am finding it easier to know what I need to do for my classes (although I would say that is due to the website given by San Francisco State and not just because classes are online). For self-care, I am giving myself the space and time to do things at my own pace and to allow myself to not feel guilty about putting myself first. I enjoy being able to feel at peace even when I know I have an assignment due, because I am confident in my abilities. One thing I do need to focus more on is my sleeping schedule, which is terrible, because I always sleep between 2 and 4 AM and either get five hours of sleep or ten hours. And that can deeply impact my mental and physical health, so the best way to better my sleeping schedule would be to procrastinate less so I don’t stay up late and to get rid of technology in the hours before I go to bed. But overall, I would say I am doing alright and will continue working to do better."

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1232,"I have honestly hated online learning. I am a hands on person and ever since we went virtual it just did no good for me. In a time like this I would actually love going into class physically so I could get my mind off of these crazy things going on at least for a bit. Online learning simply makes me feel super unmotivated and makes me lazy. I messed up really bad this semester, and my family was going through a lot so it was super easy for me to loose track of my classes. It has made me even feel kind of dumb, butttt I know i'm not. Lately i've taken the initiative to start self meditating even if it's for 2 minutes. Clearing my mind is hard, but staying in one place taking deep breathes with my eyes closed helps me remember that I need to pace myself with the things going on in my life. I also love doing masks and making hot chocolate, its like a get away for me. I really hope that I can go into next semester on a positive note because I actually like school, but this situation is just what makes things hard. I know I can get through this, I just want this pandemic to be over"
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1249,"I actually prefer online learning than being in person. Ever since I started college, I always had an online class. I always did better in those. I would also never go to class because I did not enjoy commuting to work and then having to commute to school and then back home. In a hectic city such as San Francisco, the commute would take a toll on me and it would be very time consuming. I lost my job too working at Boba Guys so now I work at Amazon with a very flexible schedule of only having to work 3 shifts a month to stay employed , which has given me flexibility to focus on my last school year. I feel as if this school year has been my most productive because I do not have the commute nor work the 40 hour work week. I have been taking care of myself by working out or getting a morning walk. I definitely have gained a lot of weight. I have been the heaviest I have been in my life. It makes me feel bad about myself and it adds on to the quarantine blues. In the city, I was always walking and now I'm back home in a small boring town with nothing to do, I don’t get much exercise in. However, I just bought a Peloton so i'm excited to get back in the grind since gyms are closed. I have more concerns for my well being and personal health than my education since I am doing better in school."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1235,"Since the last semester, we started the online section for all classes. Even though some of my classes were online classes, it was still hard for me the adopt that all my classes had become online classes. Due to the COVID-19, this semester we have to continue on having classes remotely again. Based on the last semester I have gained some experiences on how to handle my classes. Luckily this year, all my classes professors have provided the slides or the video of classes on ilearn for us the view in advance or to review if we cannot make it to classes and the attendance is not a requirement. There are pros and cons to having remote classes. Because I am a full-time student and working as a part-time insurance agent office team member, I need to have good time management. By having classes remotely, I saved a lot of time commute from work to school or home to school. I can save more time from commuting, I can go to work and return home early to study or do homework, and I can get more time to do my personal things. The cons are I actually need to spend more time studying. I am not a reading person, by having remote classes, I actually have to spend more time studying and reading.  When I have a question about homework, I can only send emails or wait for office hours to contact the professor. Also, I am more likely to be a listener and a note-taker during face to face classes. I actually think I can learn better in the face to face classes."

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1240,When we first found out that we were going to be doing online school I was sad because I thought I wasn’t going to like it and it was going to be really hard to learn because we aren’t in a classroom with the teachers. I felt like I wasn’t going to be able to learn anything really because I’m so used to being with the teacher. Now that we have been doing it for a while I realize that I was wrong. It seems like I’m learning the same amount as a I would be if I was at school in a classroom. It is also really easy to  ask my professors questions when I don’t understand something because I just have to either go off of mute and ask or type it in the chat. Even if I don’t have a zoom class for one of my classes I can email them and they will respond pretty fast. I also feel like I have more freetime now so that helps with my self care.
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1250,"Online classes have impacted me dramatically because i'm more of a student that likes to learn in person, i can't really do online or stare at a screen all day or else i get bored or go insane, not really my eyes just end up getting tired and i get headaches. I was hoping to move on to campus like many others because i can't do work at home because of family issues or situations, so online has been pretty hard but i've been doing my best to manage it.. For self care, to be completely honest i didn't really care about my self care the first weeks of school as long as i got my work done and in on time, i didn't care if i didn't sleep, i didn't care if i was stressed till it got really bad to the point i had a breakdown because i felt so overwhelmed. I now handle it better by going to a walk or a hike, or even a late night drive. Sometimes I meditate, write things down or even hang out with my friends for a bit. Sometimes it's good to take a break from school and a break from life and focus on yourself. "

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1239,"online classes have been a huge challenge for me due to the workload. It has been stressful so for self care i really try to take time to myself and work at my own pace. this has been helpful, however I have fallen behind in s couple classes due to the large workload and going at my own pace. I am thankful that the professors are being understanding about students' challenges but I feel that online classes are much more challenging and time consuming than in person learning. I hope to keep staying on track by motivating myself to do each assignment at my own pace, so that i can be successful."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1234,Online classes have had a serious impact on my learning and overall college experience. I feel like at times it is harder to concentrate and feel accountable for the work when we are adapting to confusing ilearn pages and strange schedules and webcam feature. When we attended college in person it felt more rewarding and interacting with the class and professors face to face was more effective than talking to names on a screen or simply sitting through a class in a distracting environment. Overall I have learned to adapt and set boundaries for myself to still feel like I am in a professional environment. I will usually grab a snack and fill my water before class lock my door and maybe light a candle or turn on my diffuser to feel relaxed and prepared to pay attention in class. I also started going out for runs in between classes and focusing on my mental and physical health. These basic rituals really help keep me centered and disciplined to continue doing good in my classes.

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1231,"I definitely believe that adapting to the online classes was fairly easy  for me and I know that I am very fortunate for that. Especially when I know many other students are struggling with their grades at the  moment. But the thing that has impacted my learning the most is my lack of motivation. It sucks to just wake up and still be in the same room for hours, whether it is for zoom or doing actual homework. Typically what helps is that I spend a little time on everything. Like I would plan out a few hours for homework then reward myself with watching an episode or two of a show. Essentially just trying to get my mind off school and give my back a rest from sitting down for so long. Another thing that helps is that I currently work 2 jobs so I appreciate the fact that I can go out and do other things even with everything that is going on in the world. One of my biggest concerns about my learning experience is that I’ve been so used to open book tests since the start of online learning that I’m afraid it’ll be hard to memorize everything like before. I’m sure professors will have their own struggles as well with going back to normal, whenever that will be, but I believe both students and professors can work through it."

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1247,"Michael Uresti  ASTRO 116 Reflective Journaling Essay #6   For this semester, online classes are alright if you think about it because in my opinion i prefer in person classes since you have a better opportunity to ask and show what you mean in your questions that you ask for. But as of this year it’s a little challenging for me since I can get easily distracted at home than if I was in person in class. But whenever I have free time I just use it by playing video games or go workout and run while I'm done with school work but so far throughout the semester I’ve been busy with midterms and exams. I think online classes are ok and not ok for some people since they are not too used to it but for me im kinda getting used to it in a way of working through a schedule of it. I still feel in some way my skills of learning through online classes are still improving despite going through a pandemic and staying in doors and doing school work. Even though it is near the end of this semester, it has been a real challenging one for me since I have been busy doing school and working out things in reality as well as finishing my work."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1241,"To be completely honest my online learning this semester has been pretty taxing. I am taking 7 classes, and honestly it has been pretty tough to really absorb relevant information. The other issue is workload, I have found personally professors have been either understanding and taking this semester easier or over compensating and upping the workload. Neither of these are a problem but it makes scheduling out weekly assignments hard due to the unorthodox year we are having. The problem I currently have is the intense workload from both school and real life. I have had firsthand experience with employers and professors who are understanding and others who are not. One professor has not responded to a single email when I ask for help, and I genuinely am teetering on writing the school, but I fear if I do he might fail me. The way I focus on self care is through ASMR. It is kind of embarrassing, but I listen to it when I work or when I have breaks. It is basically calming sounds and it just kinda helps me shutout the outside chaos and focus on the main thing I am working on. This is a marathon not a sprint and it helps to focus on one thing at a time."

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1244,"Online classes have made learning very difficult. Being on a computer is no where near the same as being in a classroom. During these times of online classes, I’ve noticed that students do not seem to be as engaged with their learning as much as they were when they were being taught physically. Most of the time that I’m in class, I find myself dozing off as my professors ramble on and on which leads to me getting lost and falling behind. This gives me the concern that I might not be able to stay on track with my learning which may result in me giving up on online classes all together. I’m thankful for the classes that I do have online that keep the communication and learning going like this astronomy lab and my Asian American studies class. To make sure that I don’t fall too behind, I usually end up having to teach myself whatever my teachers assign me to do. This usually gets pretty stressful so I try to make time in my day to do something relaxing. I do this so that I won’t just feel like I’m spending everyday trying to keep my head above the water. I also like to make sure that I always have someone there to talk to for comfort when I’m not feeling well."
