2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1245,"Astronomy Lab 116              Charlotte Zhou   10/14/20     Reflective Journaling Essay #5     I want to major in Psychology, because I want to be able to help people the same way   that other psychologists have helped me. And I want to minor in Counseling because that will   actually allow me to become a therapist. During my senior year, I was given signs that what I   wanted to do with my life was become a therapist, and one example is a friend told me that I was   a great person to talk to about anything going on and that I should be a therapist, and I have been   given further reinforcement by other friends. I see how much the world needs there to be a focus   on mental health since it is such a prevalent issue, and to not put a stigma on people needing to   go to someone to talk about how they’re feeling. Also I just like the thought of being able to talk   to someone, and make a difference in how they feel about their life at the moment and in general."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1244,"When I picked my major, I had no idea what I wanted to be. I chose the major, international business, so that I’d be taking the generic business classes and have a lot of career options. Although I’ve still not been able to figure out what I want to do career wise, I’ve found interest in many of the business classes. They seem to be very useful in everyday life. It gives me hope that I’ll eventually find a job where I can practice these skills and earn a good amount of money. At the end of the day, my goal is to get a career where I am able to live a healthy lifestyle. I do not want to have to spend my life stressing about money. At the same time, I do not want to be stuck at a job that I do not enjoy doing. I want to be able to take pride in my work and come home without any work related stress."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1240,"I actually don’t know what I want to major in. And when people say that they don’t know, they   usually have some sort of an idea but I really have no idea. For a while, I wanted to be a labor   and delivery nurse but I don’t anymore. I wanted to do this because I wanted to help people and   I wanted to experience childbirth because it was beautiful but not myself. I just wanted to help   and watch it. But about a year ago I volunteered at a hospital near me in the labor and delivery   floor for a whole year. In the beginning it was ok but as the year went on I started to not like it. I   just didn’t like the vibe in there and it seemed really stressful sometimes. So towards the end of   the year of volunteering I decided that I didn’t really want to do that anymore. Now I'm just trying   to figure out what I want to do and asking people what they are majoring in to get ideas."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1251,"Reflective Journaling Essay #5  ""Why do I want to go into the field I am majoring in?	 	 The field I am currently majoring in right now is pre-bio, working my way to get into biology even though I'm not really sure which department of biology I want to study and major in. I'm getting interested in marine biology so far this semester. I am taking a marine biology course and I feel like I love it so far exploring and discovering our oceans and animals/organisms. Back in highschool i also took a course in marine biology and I liked it. Even though I don't like science that much, I'm trying my best to major in biology. My goal is to get a degree in biology to go to med-school. One of the reasons why I want to go to med-school is because one of my goals is to become a pediatrician and in order to do that i need a major in science. I always wanted to become a pediatrician because I have an interest in the growth of youth and I like being around kids."

For as long as I could remember I’ve always had a love for art. Being creative, both   through my thoughts and actions was constantly present in my life. To me, art is more than a   hobby, destresser, but it’s a large factor in my identity. I’m immensely happy in pursuing my   passion. I get a lot of people (older individuals) addressing how my future career can be seen as   “non-realistic” and I can honestly even feel that with/around my peers, who are going into   computer science or medicine. In recent years, I feel them looking down on me and see me as   extremely naive. It’s not like I’m going off to Paris to become a freelance artist, staying up all   night painting and feeding off of 0.50 euros (about $0.60) baguettes. I was selective in choosing   my major, which is visual communications. I like to describe it as the “umbrella” major of   design. It covers typography, graphics, illustration, photography, and much more. It’s about   using images to convey emotions. Whether that be through the nostalgic Coca-Cola logo or the   importance in the cancer ribbons, these symbols were created with time and care, and it impacts   our lives. Some say it’s just “silly art”, but I want to be able to make     As someone who’s still relatively young (I’m a second-year - 19) I feel like this major fits   me perfectly. I may change my mind about what I want to specialize in as I get older, but this"
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1231,"""Why do I want to go into the field I am majoring in?""   The field I am majoring is in Anthropology and I have also decided to minor in Recreation,   Parks, and Tourism. With an emphasis on Cultural Anthropology, I really want to be   involved with my community and ensure the workforce I eventually go into promotes   diversity and access to every individual. The reason I want to do this is because I have seen   one too many instances at places where minorities are treated unequally; even in the   classroom it can be seen. Especially with the uproar of the Black Lives Matter movement, it   has inspired me to want to do more for my own community and within my own culture. I   started having open ended discussions with my family members about it and seeing their   perspectives allowed me to give more thought into my own stance. With Recreation, Parks,   and Tourism I hope to use the knowledge I gain to promote a safe and fun environment   when I decide to coach little kids in soccer."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1237,"""Why do I want to go into the field I am majoring in?""     I want to go into the field I am majoring in because there are many different job fields I can   qualify for. Another reason why I chose to major in Psychology is because I feel like in the latino   community mental health is overlooked. I think mental health is really important and my people   should know that when going through rough times they are not alone. I would want to change   the stigma that mental health is not an issue. I feel like it is something very important and if   everyone focused on having a healthy mind people in this world would be better. I am also   doing a business minor which will allow me to open up my clothing business. I want to have a lot   of options and be able to do more than just one thing. I hope I am able to accomplish the things   I have in mind."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1239,"I’m a business marketing major because having my own business is a big goal of mine, and learning how to market products to consumers is essential for owning a business. I’ve wanted my own company since I was young because my dad showed me how hard work now can pay off later. Gaining business skills before going into the business field is very beneficial because it can give you a more grounded understanding of marketing and make you more successful in the long run. I’m excited to be taking business classes because I find them genuinely interesting and engaging. By the end of my 4 years at SFSU I plan on having a deep understanding of marketing and having the skill set to start a business of my own."

I am currently majoring in Asian American Studies. Ethnic Studies, from the moment I stepped   foot into San Francisco State, had interested me. I truly think it’s a blessing to have taken an   Ethnic Studies class during my first semester of college, like I’m smart for signing up that class   before college started. As soon as I am done with my BA, I will go on to get my Masters, and   then my Ph.D. I want to go on and teach higher education, that might be high school students or   maybe college students. I’m still figuring out that part. I want to inspire students that with being   educated, you get get farther in life. Which is why these days I am considering teaching high   school students, since that is the first level of higher education. I truly believe Ethnic Studies is   important, that’s what I want to teach. Throughout my life, I learned the history that America   wanted me to learn, a white history. But what about the struggle and resistance of the   “minority”? I want to agitate to revolutionize, the youth are our future."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1248,"""Why do I want to go into the field I am majoring in?"" First I majored in computer science, but after that I went to Chinese lit major because I think I should learn more Chinese history Chinese word anything related to Chinese. But why  because Chinese lit is a fun major to learn. For me Chinese is always a fun thing to Play while watching Chinese movies and using Chinese slang can be very cool. You will learn a lot by just saying one easy sentence that can have thousands and thousands of  meanings behind it.Chinese It contains a long history of the Chinese nation, a broad and profound culture, and an immortal soul for thousands of years. Chinese is not only a communication tool, but also a manifestation of its own and even the national soft power. The breadth and depth of this language, we will never understand it for a long time。"
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1241,"Reflective Journal Why Do I want To go into the Field I am Majoring In?  	I AM SO SORRY THIS IS LATE, ALONG WITH THE SOLISTICE LAB, I THOUGHT I SUBMITTED BOTH AND THERE WAS AN ERROR, MY APOLOGIES.  Honestly the reason is pretty simple. It is just passion. Ever since I was a kid I never really had a passion for most subjects besides stuff related to the performing arts. It changed who I was, those early classes were the ones I felt engaged and what made me want to pursue it further. I was always told to do a job I was happy in, and truthfully I never would have felt that way unless it was in the cinematic arts. It hurts because due to the pandemic, I lost all the needed practice college would have allowed me to have, and to also help grant me connections and internships that are basically a requirement to get a job in Hollywood. I am working to go above and beyond to try to claw those opportunities back, but I know cinema is what I love. It frankly is all I know and can talk about. It is sad and drove away relationships, but I know it is what I have to do if I want to be happy."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1235,"I am currently majoring in Business management. When I was a kid, I wanted to be either a lawyer or a dancer. I have attended multiple law workshop and have gotten the certificate. Also, I have been in a dance class since middle school. I was interested in these two careers. However, my family disagree with my opinion. They think that to become wealth as a lawyer, you will be asked to represent someone who feel guilty, which my family hates. They disagree with me to be a dancer, because beside being a professional dancer, then the only option I have left is to become a dance teacher. At the end, my grandpa told me to learn about what does business management do, he said I might be interested. It turned out that, I started to major in Business management, and I am current working and managing an insurance agent office. I actually really like to be a manager. I really enjoy in this filed."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1250,"Why do i want to go into the field i am majoring in       I am majoring in criminal justice and hope to minor in crime scenes or forensics. I chose this   because I like to solve problems and solve crimes. I like puzzles and try to figure out what   happened, ever since my sophomore year of highschool i loved to watch forensic files and   conspiracy theories. I also watched documentaries of serial killers to see why they did what they   did and tried to connect the dots to other murder files, i like who done it for the mystery and i   used to always want to become a homicide detective ever since i watched the show ‘Monk’   when i was younger but realized that i have to become a cop before i could become that and i   really dont want to become a cop. There are different things you can do with a criminal justice   degree but personally I just really love forensics and crime scenes. One of the main reasons is   because no one should lose a loved one in a horrible accident or in a muder etc, but I would like   to help solve the problem and figure out what went wrong or what happened to bring closure to   the victims' families."

I plan to become a therapist or counselor for adolescents and adults. I want to get into this field because I love helping people, and want to do it professionally. Human psychology is also very interesting to me and understanding why people do what they do and what nurturing and childhood can affect someones overall well being as well as the nature part of it. In addition, how neurology and the brain play a role in someones overall life such as chemicals or lack there of.  Ultimately, I just want to help people who cannot help themselves and help them create the life that they want for themselves, showing them that it is possible and achievable."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1247,"Michael Uresti ASTR 116  ""Why do I want to go into the field I am majoring in?""                 For me i'm majoring in Criminology but at the moment i'm still not sure if i want to continue pursuing it, not because of the situations that have occurred but i'm still thinking about what I actually want to do in life. I know it’s really late of me saying this but there's a lot of things and careers that sound fun to do like being a stuntman, that's the only thing i know of as of right now but yeah. When I chose Criminology I thought about being a detective, because it’s a lot of mystery solving with it and whenever I play video games that have mystery puzzle solving problems, I tend to enjoy solving it and it’s very enjoyable whenever you solve something. But when I looked up the detective department, from the looks of it, it looks tough to get in but I'm that type of person willing to take on a challenge when I see it as something interesting to do. But if I do end up pursuing this major, I’ll want to continue doing what I do best, working hard towards the goal I've set for myself in the future."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1233,"Reflective journal #5     I am currently a pre psychology major but I have since changed my mind, I guess you could say   I’m a pre liberal studies major now. I wanted to be a therapist for the longest time but during the   pandemic and taking two SPED courses this semester, my mind has shifted. I now want to help   children in school, I want to major in Liberal Studies to become an elementary teacher. Not only   do I want to educate the youth but I also want to decorate a classroom and make the   atmosphere inviting for every type of child, whether they are neurotypicals or special needs. I   also learned that it was my mom’s dream career to be a school teacher growing up, but   changed majors because a teacher’s pay wouldn’t support her other dream of having a big   family and instead switched to human resources. By going for the liberal studies major and   becoming a teacher I also feel like I am living out my mom’s dream career."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1234,"""Why do I want to go into the field I am majoring in?""     I am a second year student majoring in Interior Design. I decided on a major within the   creative arts field because I am an extremely visual and hands on learner so it’s really the   only thing that made sense for me. The way I see it, if I'm going to study something and find   a job that I don't wake up everyday hating then I must choose a field that I am naturally   good at and enjoy. My main objective in life would be to intern at a film studio throughout my   final years of school and land a job as a productions/set designer. I am an extreme film   fanatic and the idea of being able to build/design a set for a film and create a new world   very much excites me and motivates me to learn as much as I can. I considered other   majors that would also be relatively creative such as studying CGI or computer animation   but so far I am intrigued and still determined to be a set designer."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1236,"I want to go into the field of psychology because I want to help people. Growing up, I went to   therapy for most of my childhood for different reasons such as my parents’ divorce, losing   family members, and dealing with anxiety and depression. To be completely honest, none of my   therapists helped me at all, and it wasn’t that they didn’t do their job, but they didn’t provide   what I needed at the time. As a result of that, and because I have dealt with multiple different   issues in my life, I want to be the person I needed growing up and I specifically want to work   with kids and teens for that very reason. Ultimately, I just want to be there for and help other   people with the issues in their lives and provide an outlet for people where they can feel   comfortable and heard."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1249,"The reason I majored in Business Administration with a concentration in marketing is because I read a   book my freshman year at sfsu called “The Power of Habit”. There was a specific chapter in the book   describing how companies target people and advertise based on their shopping habits. The psychology   behind the marketing is what fascinated me and chose to pursue this degree. Business was never   emphasized in my high school. They pushed science and engineering, and I never knew what business   was back then until I came to SFSU. I am happy coming here opened my eyes to other degrees there are. I   am still not sure what or where I want to work. A few companies I have thought about working at are   skincare, makeup, and fashion companies to promote a cleaner and more plant based route than the   traditional chemicals and artificial fillers. I just want to help spread awareness for a more sustainable future   through my marketing degree."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1232,"I want to go into Interior Design because I have a huge passion for Architecture. I originally   wanted to major in just Architecture but SF State didn’t provide it as a major so I decided to   pursue interior design and I LOVE IT. Ever since I was little I loved art and had such great   appreciation for art around the world, whether it was paitings, music, buildings anything   honestly. I grew up knowing I wanted to be involved in the world in an artistic way. In high   school I gained a huge fascination of Architecture, I loved seeing how innovative people could   be and how they could translate art work onto buildings and landscape, thats when I knew this   was from me. I love exterior Architecture but I also am in love with interior design, from every   little detail in interior design its just amazing. I really hope one day I can show the world my   innovative ideas I have, I know this major is for me."
