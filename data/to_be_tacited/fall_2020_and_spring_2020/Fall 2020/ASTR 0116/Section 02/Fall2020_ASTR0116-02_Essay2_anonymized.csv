2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1250,"What do I do when life gets challenging? I do many things, one thing I mainly do is stress. I always try to find an alternative to stress, like sometimes you just need a break from the world for instance, I love to go for walks or even late night drives to clear my mind and relax. If not then I meditate and try to get all my thoughts together and write them down later and reflect on them to see how I can solve the problem. I also go to one of my closest friends and rant to them and explain what is going on in my life to let it out and not keep it in , usually they give me their opinion on what i should go or give me advice on the situation. If the problem is related to school, I usually try to go over the assignment again to see if I understand it. If I don't, that is when I go to a professor or even a friend for help. "

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1249,"What do I do when life gets challenging?     When life gets hard, I always write down my feelings. I make sure to write down what I control and what I cannot control. I do this to stop myself from worrying about all the hypotheticals in life and wondering about the what ifs. Recently with Covid-19 happened, everything seems to be the opposite of what it was in March. I lived with my boyfriend, had a puppy, had a new job in which I hoped to grow with them as a company, and when Covid-19 happened, I lost everything. I ended up failing one of my classes because happened so quickly, and now I am living home with my parents and everything I had before is gone. I wrote down what I control which was my education and I am thankful to have my family as my support system. I definitely had a couple good cries, but it’s better to feel every emotion and grieve than to bottle everything up. I just make sure to write everything down every once in a while, to check in with myself."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1232,"When life gets challenging I usually have the urgency to quit and feel like I need to get out of the situation as soon as possible. As of lately, with everything that has been going on around the world, I've learned that challenges are sometimes there to test us to let us know that we can overcome it if we work hard enough no matter what it is. Usually a life challenge comes with a lesson and that lesson is whats going to set us up for success. Whether we fail or succeed, we passed the challenge and we tried, and thats what I've learned from it. When life gets challenging, I like to remind myself of what I'm appreciative of, and all the things that I have, whether it's my family or friends, my puppy, or even my hobbies. I like to try to remember that life has been hard before but I've overcome it and that what's different this time? I try my best to stay positive and always look on the bright side of things, after all life isn't perfect and we're here to live in the present."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1235,"When life gets challenging, I usually will be scare. I am not sure where the fear comes from, but I will still try to tell myself that I will need to face the challenge. I remembered that as a kid my mom told me that the only thing you can do when you face challenges is to cross it. It is hard to cross it without support. So, support is very important when challenges arrive. These challenges can be hard and easy to cross it, but they just simply mean that something we have never seen, touch, smell before in our lives. Sometimes when people faces challenges in their lives, they will move backward or just stay at the same time, you just need someone to push you hard to face it and cross it. So the support is needed and a hand to push you is also important when face those challenges."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1234,"When life gets challenging I always take time to find my personal wisdom before acting out of anger or frustration. I think its always better to self reflect and be strategic when confronting your problems. Recently with the global pandemic, it has been hard to tackle a challenge that impacts every aspect of society when not everyone complies. What I do is simply focus on myself and try to educate others along the way, knowing that at least I am doing my part in bettering the situation. It is easy to get depressed about the challenging aspects of our life but something that shows true strength and resilience is choosing to find a solution and not giving up even when the circumstances are not favorable. Continue to reflect and see personal growth as you tackle unfortunate situation. In the end they can be reasoned with some logical thinking and mindful acting on your part or you can even ask for help from a friend. As long as you are motivated to not let a challenge stop you then you are doing your best. "
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1248,"When life gets challenging, I will try to find a solution to go through the challenge, or I will ask for help. I understand that sometimes no one can help me with the challenge I am facing because everyone is different and special, so of course our challenges will also be different. I think that is always good to ask if anyone can help. Even if they cannot help at least they can give support or hold your hand to go through the challenge. Since sometimes a lot of the people will decide to not go through them and let it be. So asking for help is not only just to ask others to help you go through the challenge. It is also asking someone to hold your hand or to push you harder to face the challenge. Once you have gone through the challenge, you will be successful in some way. Just like if you don’t face the challenge to climb up to the mountain, then you will never know what is on the other side of the mountain."

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1236,"Reflective Journaling Essay #2     When life gets challenging, my first reaction is to stress out and panic. I tend to overthink   situations and if I get frustrated I immediately want to give up. Throughout my education, I   realized that just because something is difficult, your first instinct shouldn’t be to give up. I’ve   gotten better at having patience with myself and taking extra time on certain things when needed.   I’ve learned that for situations that involve school, it helps me when I have a big calendar for the   month and I write each assignment on the day that it is due so I can physically see which   assignments I need to do on which day. The same thing goes for when I have appointments or   plans, physically seeing something rather than seeing it on a screen makes it easier for me do you   remember the date. In unexpected scenarios, I always remind myself that everything happens for   a reason and that I have no control over certain situations. That tends to always comfort me and   helps me not to worry."

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1239,"When life gets challenging I try to focus on the things I'm most grateful for because it's easy to take those things for granted when life gets tough. Sometimes we forget that we have so much to be appreciative for and we forget that we could have it a lot worse. In challenging times it's so important to ground yourself and remember you have power over your life and you don't have to settle for less because you have control over your actions. I try to remember that discomfort is only temporary and life circumstances are ever changing, so there's always a way to do something, even if it seems impossible. "
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1231,"When life gets challenging, one of the first things I tend to do is reflect back on why I am doing the things I’m currently at work with. Challenges tend to make you lose focus on why you are in that situation in the first place. Which is why there is always the tendency to give up when times are tough. But once I get a clear picture of what and why I’m doing all this work for I try to get myself into a relaxing place, even if it’s just for a couple of moments. I listen to my favorite songs or sometimes I’ll go on my bed, grab my laptop, and open youtube. Ever since I entered college, one of the best pieces of advice that I was given was to be sure of making time for myself. Even if it’s staying in for the night and postponing that hang out with a friend, sometimes you genuinely want to be alone and relax when things are piling up. "

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,226,"Roxana Garcia Rojas   Ricardo Flores   ASTR 116   10 Sep 2020   Reflective Journaling #2   When life gets challenging, I usually block it out first. It’s my defense mechanism, which I know   is really bad. Once I’ve had a little pep talk with myself, I cry. After that I try to pick myself   together again. I know that everytime something challenging hits me, it’s supposed to be a   lesson, something in which will help me grow. At least that is how I think of it as, and it helps   soothe my mind knowing that it will get better. But things don’t automatically fix themselves, I   must work toward it. I do some reflective journaling, jot down important reminder or events on   my bullet journal, and just try to keep a positive mindset. I can’t fix anything from the past, and I   can’t keep making my mind run through it as it will never help me move on. I come to terms and   acknowledge the struggle, and work towards reaching a “better place.”"

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1244,"When life gets challenging, I tend to get a bit stressed. Sometimes everything could just feel so overwhelming and I feel like I could use a break from it all. When that happens, I try to use whatever free time I have doing something other than my normal, everyday routine of work and school. I’d do things like go for a drive or skate at my local skate park. After being with myself for a while and feeling calm, I always feel that it is good to speak to a friend. So, I’d talk to my friends about things going on in my life and find some comfort in them. After having a little time to myself and conversations with close friends, I usually feel a little less worried about life’s challenges. The last thing I need to do for myself is to prepare for having to deal with these challenges again. Doing so isn’t so hard with a recent reminder that you’re not alone. "
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1243,"When life gets challenging I like isolate myself from the world. and what I mean by that is I like to be alone listen to music or even just sit in my car and just listen to my thoughts. Life has been rather challenging for me this past year and a half I have been dealing with a lot lately and just recently have had some issues with my family and at the moment I have no home, so right now my life is quite frustrating however I don't let that get to me. when life gets challenging it's always good to just focus on the things you got going for you, so for me that would be school and work. I work full time so it's hard to balance that with school especially when I don't have a place to stay, but I try to make time for it and I just makes sure to communicate with my professors. I know school is what's going to get me somewhere in life. I said I like to be alone when my life can get challenging however it's also nice to talk to my friends and my girlfriend they have been helping me with so much if it weren't for them I probably wouldn't have graduated from Community College. So when Life gets tough make sure you focus on what you got going on for you and find a support system it always helps knowing you have people who want to help.   "

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1247,"Michael Uresti Astronomy 116  ""What do I do when life gets challenging?""                   Whenever I get in a tough spot like for college this semester, not really fond of the online school situation but I have no choice to do it due to the whole Covid-19 situation. Even though it doesn’t feel the same at all when attending the zoom class sessions when you're at home instead of in person class, it doesn’t exactly feel the same but you gotta do what you gotta do. When I'm having trouble in certain class assignments, I start to overthink a lot about this or that question, whenever I do that I just like to calm myself and just take a break from it by either playing my video games or just go out and do my daily running exercise everyday. I basically just relax myself when i'm in a challenging situation because it’s really not a good thing to overthink or stress yourself out on anything, it’ll just make it even more problematic in the future. Finally, by the time i return back to my work, I just motivate myself to continue working and also listen to music and get my groove on while working for class assignments."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1240,"When my life gets challenging, I do a few things. One of the things I like to do is paint. Painting usually distracts me from everything else that is going on in my life and makes me happy. Recently I went to this place called Color Me Mine and you get to pick out whatever poetry you want and you paint it. Then they bake it for you and you can even eat off of them. When I went there it made me really happy and distracted me from what I was frustrated about earlier that day. I also like to hang out with my friends when life gets challenging. They always make me have a good time and it puts the rest of my life on pause. So basically when life gets challenging I try to distract myself from the negative things in my mind. "
