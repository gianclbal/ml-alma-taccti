2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1241,"Reflective Journal  On this topic it hurts because doing classes remote during covid I really felt all the resources I lost in the switch. So much of my early semester TA’s hammered into my head all the resources and benefits students at SFSU had and what they could do with it. While losing all of those I feel like this biggest resource that everyone has in this situation is the internet. Obviously students had this back when classes were not remote, but the internet is a great resource we all have. When things fall apart or I hit a brick wall I take solace in the fact that I can check last minute internet for help on a topic. Especially since I have a diverse course load with politics, astronomy, and cinema classes it helps me focus on what I have a more rudimentary knowledge of compared to what I know far more on."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1231,"Resources can come from many different places and for different  reasons too. Resources can range from homework help, advisors  help you  work on upcoming class schedules, and even counselors (or places) to help  relieve you of frustrations. Some resources that I have used since beginning  my college career, even during this pandemic,  are the academic advising centers. They have helped me understand the  classes I will be needing  to take in the spring semester and even encouraged me to seek the other advisors for my  major  and minor to get a sense of what career I would want to get into after college. Another resource I’ve used is the front  of my yard. The houses  on my  street are not very close together  and there is  so much  open space from the beginning of  the  street and back. So lately  I have been using it to my advantage by  riding  my bike or scooter to  get some fresh air as it’s not fun being stuck in my room doing all  these assignments and joining zoom calls."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1244,"Making sure that I have resources to go to when I am in need is very important to me. When I am stressed and need someone to talk to, I usually go to a friend for comfort. Having a friend listen to what is going on with you can be very therapeutic. Another thing that I also see as a resource is my skateboard. Sometimes when I am feeling low, I grab my skateboard and head outside to get some air. Doing so makes me feel calmer and less worried about whatever is going on in my head. I think it is really important to have a hobby that you enjoy doing. That way when I plan on doing my hobby, I know I’ll have a good time for that part of the day. I’d say my most reliable resource is my family. When It comes down to it, I know that they’ll always be there to push me. They’d never let me fail in life."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1248,"""What resources do I have?"" Google must be the most popular way to find all I need, after that my phone is the best way to find an answer. Not only going to the Internet but all apps on my phone can be a good way to help. like social media it gives a lot of good answers that I don’t have to find out by myself. I can watch a lot of news on the phone which can help get a lot of ideas that I care about. Finally talking to people is a good way to learn, to learn how other people have seen through things, everyone got their points of view so that's a good resource that I have. I like to talk to people. Even those people I don’t know are still worth talking to them. I  wish I could learn more by using these methods."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1233,"Natalie Aguirre   ASTR 116-02     ""What resources do I have?""     The resources I have are my parents, my boyfriend, my laptop, and phone. Whenever I am   challenged on financial aid, paying other bills, or what’s the best decision to make for a class I   consult my parents for guidance. This is actually going to be my last semester at SFSU before   transferring to a different college. Unfortunately I’m 8 units short, so I plan to get those units   through community college. My boyfriend is finishing up community college to also transfer   colleges, so I turn to him to find out what classes are offered and how to navigate community   college, as each college has its own style of adding classes and where classes will be online.   My laptop and phone are probably my most important resources. Through both these resources   I can email professors with questions, access my ebooks for the classes the require it, watch   youtube videos for my asl class, and ask the internet questions and follow up with my professor   if the answers I find are accurate."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1234,"What resources do I have?Now that we have moved to an online environment and remote instruction I am lacking many of the resources I had last year on campus. I used to live in the dorms meaning I was constantly in an environment where I could thrive for school. Some of the resources I had was the library, computer and printing stations, tutoring, amongst other programs catering to students on campus. and many great friendships. Now that I am home I have My laptop, my phone, online textbooks, and the support of my family. I am grateful for these resources and continue to use them in achieving success both academically and in my personal goals. the resources i had in college may have been beneficial and necessary for face to face instruction but now with this pandemic my resources are mainly digital and I don't have the need to print or write on paper. We can see that technology is slowly deeming traditional learning as obsolete. "
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1238,"Shoshana Schneider Astronomy 116 November 22, 2020    What Resources do I Have?  What resources do I have when I need them? In school my resources are the professors if I have questions, not understanding the material or are not doing well in a class. I also have the tutoring center to help with any subjects that I am not understanding or doing well in. Some resources I have for my mental health and well being are the counseling/psychological center at the university. I also use my friends and family as a resource to talk to in times of crisis or personal problems to help me gain perspective and vent. Some other resources I have are the outdoors such as the beach and many parks in San Francisco such as Golden Gate Park, Lake Merced, and Ocean beach as a resource for exercising with their many paths to walk and run on."

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1235,"I do not think that I have many resources. I only have the internet and maybe the San Francisco State University Library resources. Before I possibly have the San Francisco Public Library as one of my resources. However, due to the current pandemic, the library is not open to the public. But searching the answer on the internet/ google will be one of my option. If I am using resources that are reliable and useful. Sometimes I can use google to search on what are some reliable website that I can use to help me solve problems. The worst case is if I am really confused on the items then I can email classmates or friends and even the professor to clarify some of the questions I have for the work. Sometimes friends or classmates will give you the wrong answer. We must discuss more and finding out what is the answer."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1239,"When I think of what resources I have, I remember that I can use the internet, as well as ask people for their input, as a resource. We can even be resources to ourselves, because we know what to look for when something is missing from our work. This is when we research, ask people with previous experience, or gain our own experience as a resource to help us. It's important to remember we have access to resources at all times and you can utilize yourself as a resource when necessary. Learning how to conduct successful and helpful research can be really useful when you are trying to find resources on different topics. Knowing how to ask questions that are clear and straightforward will also help other people better explain things to you if you asked them for help. These can all be resources to draw from."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1240,"When I think about it, I have a lot more resources than I though and especially for this class. First, I have the internet. This is what I usually use when I need help because it is the easiest and you mostly always get the correct answer. Another resource I have is my text book that I bought. I haven't used it so far but I'm sure I will use it at least once. A text book is a good resource because it is mostly the specific answers your teacher wants. sometimes the internet gives you an answer your teacher wasn't looking for. I also have my mom as a reassure. My mom took Astronomy when she was in college and she loved it so I have been asking her questions here and there. Lastly, I have my teacher as a resource. I can email my teachers any time. "
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1232,"I have a ton of resources, I don't know necessarily what resources you're asking for, but I know that I have my family as a support resource.. they are there to navigate me through any obstacles I am facing. I also have college resources. I am actually in a program called College Connect, and without them I probably wouldn't be at the college I am today, they help from providing me school resources, to job resources, to even food resources and health resources if I ever need it. I know Sf State also provides a lot, like gator groceries for example, tutoring, and other amazing things. I know I can always find resources as long as i'm not afraid to ask"
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1245,"Resources that I have at San Francisco State are tutoring, workshops, and counselors from the programs that I am a part of, such as EOP and Metro. If I ever have a question about what I need to do for upcoming semesters or need help with classes, I know where I can go and get help. I have also made friends in some of my classes or have group chats where I can ask for help specific to my courses and from people who know what is going on in the class. And when having friends in a class, I feel more comfortable asking for help and participating in class because I know they’re there supporting me. Other resources I have are Mental Health Counseling, or just talking to someone, which is especially helpful when I am stressed about my classes. And I know that I have a great support system from my family, which can be a great reminder at the end of the day, because I know they will always be there for me."

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1250,"Depending on what kind of resources you are talking about? If it's for school, well i have my laptop that helps me getting my work done and communicating with my professors or my phone helps me as well if i didn't have a laptop. I also use the internet as a resource if I need to look up something or have to research something now that libraries are closed. There are online books as well that some professors have provided for us when school began that we would need for our class. I also have my friends that help me out when I need something or am struggling with school or a class. If not well then i still have a professor to go to during their office hours to help me if i need help or even if i have a question. I don't know if that is considered a resource but I'm going to count it because it's something or someone I can go to for help like having a tutor as well."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1249,"The resources I have are my parents and people nearby. I know it is bad to call them or refer to them as resources, but they are the closest people I have whenever things go bad. Whenever I need a break from life or I need a shoulder to cry on go to them immediately or I wish i could be with them in that moment. I take their opinion seriously compared to others, so if I need career choices or important advice I go to them. In addition, if I need to move back home I know I always have a place to come back. Luckily my parents own their house, so I always have a place to fall back to such as right now in the pandemic. Outside of them, I do not have many resources. I do not have any professor recommendations or job resources since I barely have a part job. I definitely have to work in those areas in order to find a good career."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1236,"I am very grateful to have multiple different resources if I need help. My mom has a degree in computer science but gave birth to me soon after she graduated. So, she stopped utilizing her degree, but now she’s going back to school to get her degree in nursing and because of that, it’s very beneficial to me if I need help with any of my classes. She helps me with things like formatting my essay or uploading any assignments. Besides my mom, SFSU has multiple different tutoring options that I can take for different classes ranging from math to English to history. One major source that I have is also the Internet. If there is a simple question or concept that is hard for me to grasp, I can look up the definition or function of what I need an explanation about and it will give me exactly what I need. "
