2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1245,"My family has always seen education as a vital part of succeeding, especially since they never completed a higher degree of education beyond high school. Both of my parents have gone to college but dropped out after a year or two there, and though they never got a college education they are both doing well. Their encouragement for my sister and I is that despite how well they do, what they have are just jobs, not careers. They want us to have careers so that everyday we go to work, we’re not bored or hating where we are but instead love it and wish to be there. Although my parents are focused on my grades, the most important thing for them is that I try my best because they believe I will do well in college and in life. So I am trying my best to live up to their expectations and to help myself, I have found support groups among friends and peers and that has made my first year at college easier; knowing I am experiencing the same thing as other students and that I am not alone. I know I will succeed."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1244,"Growing up, my parents were always very strict on my siblings and me. One of the things that they were the most strict on was grades. My parents made it seem that getting a bad grade was one of the worst things you could possibly do. It also meant big trouble for when they found out one of us had one. This made my siblings and me grow up to fear bad grades and to try our best never to have them by the time we had to show our parents our progress reports or report cards. This has helped me navigate through college since it helped me realize that as long as I apply myself to my work, then I’ll be fine. I still maintain good grades by the time each semester ends just as I did before. I believe that my family has raised me not to be lazy and to always work hard."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1249,"I am a first generation college student. My parents are immigrants from Mexico and luckily they have motivated us to go to school. My dad went to school and got his license to be an electrician and overall know how to work around home construction. My mom was not able to go to school or continue with her dreams of studying because she got pregnant and had to raise us. She eventually went back to work once my youngest brother was in first grade. She had to work in the fields because the goal was to make money and she is not very good at English. She works at Foster Farms now and even got Covid because of how badly they handled it. She reminds me  if she had a better education she would not have to go into work during these times. It’s the reality of life, people who are better educated now do not have to go to work and expose themselves while people such as my mom who are not educated and do not have the best healthcare have to go out and work regardless of this pandemic because they get threatened with losing their jobs."

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1234,"My family and values greatly impact my success and my choices throughout college. I'm a first generation college student and it was very important to me to make my family proud and have the experience of college. Moving away is part of this and although my family would've rather me stay locally in SD, I decided to follow my intuition and head to SF.  No one in my immediate family has ever left home and this honored my family as well as frightened them. I got many requests to stay and consider other options but in the end my family valued my opinion and I started on my college experience. Being a first gen student I had no prior experience about college and it was hard understanding the requirements and deadlines for registration. Once the stress and anxieties of registration were done, I had the absolute best time and encourage everyone to attend if it's possible. Continuing my education was a choice I made but i couldn't have done it without my friends and family. "
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1251,"Reflective Journaling Essay #3 ""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""  	The values of my family has helped me throughout college so far by the support they have provided for me since my first semester at Sf State. Being the first one in my family to attend college it's taking a big responsibility for myself and being able to be successful working hard towards getting my career, to make my parents proud for all their time,support and things that they have done for me getting where I am as of today, as well as my my own, knowing that i can become someone i want to in the future thanks to my parents/friends and all of their support. My first year of college I was nervous and scared about going to state because it was a big change for me, not knowing a lot of people going there and starting over and getting used to it was a bit challenging. But now that it's my second year I am getting used to how things work, what I need to achieve in order to go into med school/graduate and I'm looking forward to meeting new people and people who can guide me throughout college."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1231,"Even in high school, my parents have always implemented that when I commit to something, I go through with it no matter how hard it gets. Of course there’s some limitations to that lesson (i.e. if mental health or health  in general gets worse). However, it helped me understand that if I’m going to put all my effort and time into, for this instance, college, I expect to get the degree no matter how long it takes me. On the other hand, I have  received great advice from my aunt as she just finished her master’s program. She always emphasized that  it’s okay to ask for help when needed and to always try to go to office hours when you can. This advice has helped me build relationships with my academic advisors and so far, they have all been a great deal of help since the start of this new semester. "
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1250,"My parents don't really care if I'm in school or not, they just want me to get things done around the house but my older brother has been very supportive and making sure I get my work done and making sure I don't procrastinate or stress out too much either. My school community has been really helpful as well, when I need help with something for school I always have a place to go even if it's to my metro advisor for even office hours for my professor. I know I can always go to them for help if I need it or even to talk to them. They have helped me the most when it comes to figuring out what to do, to get through college especially now that it's weird and different that it is online. Having it online has been sort of complicated and difficult at times but so far pretty good. "
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1241,"Reflective Journal 3:  	I rely heavily on my family and my local community more than anything else in my life. The ideals that were introduced to me since I was a kid have always been engrained and somewhat a guiding force on the rights and wrongs of what to do. I live and grew up on the East coast, and spent a majority of my life in Florida. While I personally can attest that Florida is not the “south” when it comes to ideals, I have interacted with a community that has southern ideals and family members who are very much what a typical southerner would be described as. This clashed instantly with San Francisco when I moved for SFSU classes a bit ago. I think what I knew and learned in my time was that my family’s influence on me was a huge factor, but not one that I needed to follow. I learned from there faults and used them to be better in my life on the west coast, and used their benefits as well. Life is a balance and I am extremely fortunate for the childhood I had, everyone has bad upbringings or areas in some form and I am fortunate for the experiences I had. The most important thing I learned at college is that family is not forever and death can happen, and keeping their influence alive as memories is incredibly important."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1239,"My values of my community and family helped navigate me through college by the way I think, act and perform in class. To name some of these values are to do your best, respect everyone, and don't judge others on physical appearance. These helped me become the person i am today because I care deeply about human interaction and relationships because they shape so many aspects of life and make life full of joy and excitement.I love the friends I've made and I hope to make positive impacts on people. This has made me more sociable and when I got my job in SF i was able to interact with ease and do my best while not being shy or anxious which is usually how I feel in my past jobs. "
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1235,"I am the first child in my family to study in college. I think it is hard for me because my family does not know a lot about college. In my generation. my community start to provides all kinds of help for people to enter into college. My community has provided me all types of resources, such as financial help like grants, financial aids, and scholarship. Also, my community has helped me with applying for college and all the help for submitting the application to apply. College seems to be a new environment for my family. My family did not know anything about college and college life. But my mom still tried to give me all kinds of suggestions and any helps that she can give. She read books and have multiple conversations with me regarding what major I am interested in and gave me suggestions with which school best fits me."
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1236,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college because something my family has always said is knowledge is power. My mom and grandparents have always stressed to me, my siblings, and my cousins that your knowledge is something nobody could ever take away from you. My mom graduated from college with a computer science degree but had me after she got married, so she decided not to work. After me, she had my younger brother and sister and by the time we were old enough, computers had evolved in such drastic ways and she was out of the loop on how to use them. Her degree didn’t really mean anything to her anymore. As a result of that, my mom has always stressed to me and my sisters that it is important to graduate from college, find a steady job and get yourself settled before getting married or having kids. "
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1240,"My family has helped me out a lot with starting college. But before this, my parents and other people in my family have really motivated me to even go to college. My dad only did two years of community college so he really wanted to see me do a full 4 years in college. Also, my older cousin went to San Francisco State and made it seem so amazing. Starting college and applying for colleges, my mom helped me so much. I definitely would not be able to do this on my own. She honestly did most of the work for me when it comes to applying to colleges and getting ready for online classes for SF. I am so grateful for my mom and my parents in general and I hope they know that. "
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1233,"Natalie Aguirre   ASTR 116-02     ""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate   through college?""     I have been very grateful to have the family that I have. In the start of my school journey my   parents have always been encouraging and telling me to try my best. I never had the weight on   my shoulders of needing to always have As, or be shunned for not getting 90% or better on an   exam. Even in high school, where I was surrounded by stressed students trying to make their   parents proud with a letter on their report card, my parents were still supportive and didn’t really   worry about my chances for college. Without that stress I still got A’s and B’s. Through college   my parents still are my cheerleaders, they are proud that I want to major in Psychology to be a   therapist that wants to work with children with disabilities. They don’t worry when I drop a class   or say a class becomes too stressful because they know I’m making the best decision so I can   continue to excel in school. I thank my parents for being so supportive and allowing me to pave   my own path for my future, with of course some words of wisdom on their end when I’m stuck on   what to do."

2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1232,"I would like to speak on my families background. My family came from poverty and thankfully worked hard to get to where they are today. My parents always raised me to understand that in life you have to work for things you want and that no matter what they'd support me. My parents didn't go to college and came to the United States pretty young, and being a first gen, I just want to make them so proud. I know that if money wasn't a barrier, or even if language wasn't a barrier (my parents are Salvadorian), they would have had less struggles and possibly gone through college. My mom was a nurse in El Salvador and when she came to the United States, her nursing certificate didn't even count. My parents have been a great inspiration to me and although they didn't get to experience college, they worked hard to make sure me and my siblings were always okay. They have been my entire support throughout college and thankfully now a days there are a ton of resources for first gen students, especially latino students like myself. Although I am Latino American, I love my families background and I want to represent them as a whole. Thanks to my family i'm able to make my dreams come true, thanks to my parents I am where I am today and although college has been a kick in my a$$, they're always there to help me overcome any obstacle. "
2020,Fall,ASTR 0116,--,2,1248,"I am the second college student in my family. My family did not provide much help to me because English is their second language. Different from other students, I am the second child to enter college. But my sister has a different experience in college. She studied in one of the university in China that have different teaching materials and technics. I am glad that my community was able to provide financial help and other help. Even I came here when I was in middle school, I did not learn much because I did not understand English well. I was lucky to have good teachers and counselors to help me apply for school and write different essays. I was afraid that I cannot finish my classes in high school and will not be able to enter a college. Luckily with all the help and efforts, I was able to become a student at San Francisco State University."
