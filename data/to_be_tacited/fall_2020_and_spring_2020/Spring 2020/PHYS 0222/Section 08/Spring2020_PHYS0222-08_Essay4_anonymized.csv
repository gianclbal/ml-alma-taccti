2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,437,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college because there are two main rules my family follow which are to always try to spend this least amount of money possible and to always be polite to every person I meet. I've actually been able to save more money because of how I've treated my classmates from the first semester. I've been able to avoid spending about $600 my first semester by avoiding the bookstore and buying everything for the cheapest price or finding the materials for free. Thanks to my classmates from last semester, I've been able to get free materials and help from them this semester. The people I've met have given me good advice out of nowhere because that's how I've been mostly keeping up with other classmates by exchanging advice to each other, so I could say that my freshman year so far has been fairly easy and fun."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,433,Thanks to my community back home I was able to decide on attending college and what was the best way to approach college. One thing my community has done for me was offering a scholarship. The Santa Barbara scholarship which guarantees that all students who apply from the community has a chance to obtain a scholarship for college. This is very helpful for me being in a low income family. My parents and I can stress less about the burden of affording college when our community has our back. Beside scholarships you are also able to create strong connections with teachers and other educators. Each gladly to give a letter of recommendation that can help by applying to even more scholarships or gain advice on how to succeed in college. I am very thankful to my community to giving me the right path as well as a great start into college. In order for me to succeed and to continue on succeeding. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,441,"This question has mainly caused me to wonder what values from my family and community are ingrained in me or are ones that I follow. It's not something that I've really thought about as I tend to live my life day by day and handling things as they arise without a thought as to why I do certain things. I've always been the type of person to do tasks on my own and not expect or want help from anyone else. The problem with this is that I think it does the opposite of helping in college. It's hard to ask for help or ask questions so there is a barrier between my lack of knowledge and the wealth that other people possess. On the other hand, I've been brought up with the idea that no matter what, I'll do whatever I need to do. Even though I may procrastinate and sometimes not do too well, I'll complete what I need to."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,444,"The values of my community or my family helped me navigate through college by giving me confidence. My family has taught me to always be confident when I speak up and try new things in life. Becoming the only child that is currently is in college has helped me gain patience because I'm in the need to graduate and become successful. As well I am practicing my patience more because of what is going on in my community. With the whole disease and quarantine I feel that I have gotten more time to work on my school work and I feel that its a really good thing for my education and my friends education as well. Navigating through college was a struggle at the beginning but with the help of my peers and family it has become very steady and at ease. To be able to navigate through college in this situation all I need is to stay patient, hopeful and support my peers."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,434,"This question is very tricky for me because I have not really thought of it too much. My parents helped guide me to be successful in elementary and middle school. Even my first two year of high school. But by my junior year, they started leaving me alone to see how well I can do. Throughout my first semester of college I was not really in contact with my family too much. My mom would call me a few times just to ask how I am doing. But everything they taught me while I was with them I feel really helped me be able to correctly do my work. They were the ones guiding me and helping me to make sure I did all my work correctly. And I am also glad that they ended up leaving me to do it on my own because if they did not, then I would be very lost in doing my work because I would be so accustomed to my parents helping me do my work that I would have no idea how to do my own work."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,431,"Codie Mitchell  PhysicsLab 222.08  3/18/20  Journal #4     The values I hold, that were given to me from my community are kind of hard to pin down. I moved from Panama to Florida, Alaska, Alabama, and now California. Every place I lived rubbed off on me in some way or another. This gives me a less common outlook on people, life, and places. I like the ways my community influences me. Except now I live in the Tenderloin and do not enjoy it much at all. This has helped me navigate through college by helping me navigate and see through people so I don’t wake up 35 and realize I have been living my life wrong or for other people. My family raised me in finding your own beliefs and all of that. I am VERY thankful for this because it let me form my self while finding my self. This gave me the confidence to be myself and not second guess my self. I feel to some extent the harder you are on yourself the better person you beomce."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,438,"I am not really sure, I just kind of go through college at my own pace. i tend to make use of the whole assignment due date, for example if an assignment is due in a week I might do a seventh of the homework one day and then the next seventh the next day, etc. I guess my parents not pressing me to get a particular job also helps but for the most part they have a hands off sort of policy. Well as long as I am on track with graduating, in other words I am not taking classes unrelated to my requirements. I guess my adviser has also helped a lot with showing me what classes I need to take in order to graduate. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,435,"From the very beginning of college I wasn't very motivated. I was with friends who didn't necessarily care about it at the time. This would cause me to be out really late into the night at 4am without the care of finishing my English paper or physics homework that was assigned. It wasn't until I met my ex girlfriend at the time, she had convinced my to try harder in school and pursue things that I actually wanted to do. Fast forward to how things are now, she's no longer with me but i took that same mentality and it helped me so much as an individual. One main obvious support group I have is my family, they've always been there for me always telling me to finish school providing all my necessities. Another is my current girlfriend who pushes also cheers me on whenever things get rough with life and school in general."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,440,My family values have helped with college in many ways. One of the main ways is to keep pushing even when time gets hard. This is very important especially because many of these classes are very difficult. I remind myself everyday to not stop because I have made it so far and the outcome will be very beneficial. The outcome is worth it no matter what anyone says. As time get hard as an individual I have remind myself that tomorrow will be better. Having a positive mindset is very important just because that will help a person out more than anything. A person can have the worst day in their life but with a positive mindset that individual will avoid doing something they might regret later. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,445,For myself I just want to be able to graduate from college and get a good paying job at the end. This is my main motivation for doing good in all my classes and then once I graduate I'll be able to take care of my family and get them anything they would want and to pay my parents back for everything they have done for me. In my family my mom and aunts went to college but didn't graduate and now my brother and I are in college. He's at UC Merced and he is gonna graduate at the end of the semester and I'm at SF State about to finish my second year. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,442,"I would credit the values of my community and family  for helping me navigate through college. I am apart of many communities but the largest are, the city that I am from, and my ethnicity. I am from East Palo Alto, a small city once known as the murder capital. Once filled with crime, it has begun to turn into a tech mecca. This city has been ill-spoken of because of its past but that has only fueled the people in it to strive for success. I am trying to be the rose that grew from the concrete. Being Latino also brings me motivation. My people are generally hard workers and fight until the end. Thats how I want to approach college. Lastly I appreciate my parents for instilling this ""dog"" mentality in me. I am a grinder and find anyway possible to succeed. I have learned that sometimes you fail, but it is how you react that defines you. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,446,"As long as I can remember, my parents have always placed education as a high priority for me. ""In life, people can take away your money, your job, your material successes; however, no one can take away your knowledge, and that, Milita, can set you free."" My mom's words have always echoed in my head and remained etched into my brain. Ever since I was a child they instilled the values of education, service, and compassion in me. I always knew that I wanted to pursue my higher education in a field that would enable me to help my community as well as contribute to the new age of discovery in the scientific realm. I figured that working in the medical field would be the most appropriate job for me. However, after working as a Certified Nurse Assistant for a year in a Nursing Facility and Acute Care Center, I realized that it was not what I wanted to do for a living. My mother encouraged me to be curious for a variety of topics in hopes that I would figure out what my passion truly was. In that junction of my life, I discovered the beauty of physics. My infatuation for this subject only escalated with time, up until my college application period. Currently, I am enrolled at San Francisco State in hopes of one day earning my Bachelors of Science in Physics with a minor in mathematics. :)"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,443,"Growing up in a community where many get comfortable and stuck in, it actually pushed me even more to get out and go to college. waking up to the same people, same settings, and witnessing the same mistakes every day was draining, but the love I had for. all the individuals in my community cause they were my own made me still support those who lived within it. I wanted to uplift and inspire my community so much that I have came to San Francisco with a goal to be a Civil Engineer. Taking on this challenge shows how much I value my community because I want to give back to them. I want to give them hope that they too can still one day attend a college and obtain a degree, they too can become a leading example in not how to be "" the rest "" they too can make it out the "" hood "" and prosper in life. My strengths and ability to take on challenges faced in my day to day life came from living in my community where being a hard body wasn't a choice unless you would be downplayed. My family had some examples already set out for me in how to prosper a successful life which I looked up to and followed in some ways. Being pushed by those around me definitely contributed to my commitment to staying grounded to school until I obtain my degree. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,439,"My family has always wanted me to go to college, and so they have encouraged me to do so which helped me go to school. I learned that I have to try to do my best, even if it’s hard or even if I make a mistake or fail, I should keep going and keep trying in school - which has really helped me, because before I would always be self critical but I realized that that just discourages me from trying harder in school. In these troubling times, my parents encourage me to keep going with school and trying my hardest in my classes, and this helps me navigate through college. My family has always encouraged me to be curious and try to find what’s interesting to me, and that helped me choose my major of computer science. I’ve also always admired my hard working classmates and strived to do better in school because of them. All in all, all of these people helped me navigate through college."
