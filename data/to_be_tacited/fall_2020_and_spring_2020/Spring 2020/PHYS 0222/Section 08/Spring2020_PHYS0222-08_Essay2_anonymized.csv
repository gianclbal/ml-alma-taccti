2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,429,"In these past few weeks, we learn about the deviation and how to calculate the density of a object. In the first week we measured the width of the table. Then we calculated the average width, and we use excell to sort the width. Next, we calculated the middle number and find the deviation of the table. In the second week, we learn how to find the density of an object and how to to find out what the object is."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,443,"Learning the concepts of acceleration, velocity, and time I can now apply that to the real world when dealing with cars and determining what is causing the car to either speed up or slow down. Imagine a car sitting at a stoplight is not moving. When the light turns green, the driver presses the gas pedal and the car starts moving. The car moves faster and faster. Speed is the rate of change of position. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. When the velocity of an object changes, the object is accelerating. Remembering that velocity is a measure that includes both speed and direction. Because of this, a change in velocity can be either a change in how fast something is moving or a change in the direction it is moving. Acceleration means that an object changes it speed, its direction, or both. When I think of something accelerating, I think of it as speeding up. But an object that is slowing down is also accelerating. Remember that acceleration is a change in speed. A car that is slowing down is decreasing its speed. It is also accelerating, because its speed is changing.Imagine a car being driven down a road. If the speed is increasing, the car has positive acceleration. When the car slows down, the speed decreases. The decreasing speed is called negative acceleration. In both cases, the car is accelerating, but one acceleration is positive and one is negative. When a car changes direction, it is also accelerating. In the figure to the right, compare the direction of the acceleration to the direction of the velocity. Acceleration has direction, just like velocity. When a car’s acceleration and velocity are in the same direction, the speed increases and the acceleration is positive. When a car is slowing down, the acceleration and velocity are in opposite directions. The acceleration is negative."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,446,"How can integrals help one understand physical concepts, and furthermore, help a person in their everyday life? In Physics 220-01 students learned very basic physical applications of calculus. In one particular lesson, students covered how to calculate for work using a value of force and a distance ( sometimes even the angle of inclination can be used.) This can be useful to calculate how much work must be done for an object of a certain mass to move over a period. This can help people in the real world especially scientists and engineers who need to build big structures and need to calculate the amount of work needed to be done. This can help them choose appropriate equipment to move certain heavy objects. In addition, using this integral will help someone understand why it takes the same amount of work to do two trips to pick up groceries from the car as if it would take to carry all the groceries in one trip. This is impressive because on would think it takes more work carry everything in one go, but since it is only one trip the work is the same as a lighter load in two trips. Constantly, I find myself amazed at how calculus and physics are woven into the intricacies of our real life. I would love to continue exploring how the concepts I am learning in Physics 220-01 are applied to me as well as society in general."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,433,"One thing I learned in physics that I see daily is applying force. For example when I push a door open. I am applying a force from my arm to the door. With the force I apply the door opens. Another example would be in the gym. When you squat you apply force on the weight going upwards, against gravity. The force you apply must be greater  than the force of the weight and gravity that is pushing down. A force is when you push or pull on something. The equation is f=ma, ofrece equal mass times acceleration. Without being able to produce a strong enough force  I wouldn’t be able to open a door or do anything else that contradicts another force. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,440,I thought that displacement and distance was very interesting due to distance being the total of what was traveled and displacement being the time difference and different of when the object moved.  This lab that we just did which was lab 6 was very interesting because we found the acceleration. When throwing something I would like to know the acceleration of that object too. When doing this lab I was not sure of the purpose but after time and doing my lab report I was able to find the purpose. The purpose was very clear to me at the end. But was confusing was doing the tan inverse in the homework but I was able to figure out that we do this because we want to find the degree of something I am sure this is theta in the equations that were given. Doing the basketball experience today I was heists on the calculation because It was so much but with time and patience I was able to get through it. With time and patience my numbers were similar to my team and I was able find the discrepancy and the uncertainty of this lab. This lab was very helpful. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,437,"Why do we need the Polar Coordinate System?In a commoner's everyday life the Polar system will never be used, but the lives of people like us who are trying to become engineers, architects, scientist, etc the Polar system becomes very useful. The Polar Coordinate System is a lot like saying that there is a ball 30 feet NorthWest of the benches. The location of the ball was a distance and direction (r, theta) instead of actual longitude and latitude coordinates (x, y)."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,436,"Being a new student to physics and this being the first course I'm taking for it, it really is eye opening to see how basically almost anything that we take for granted in our day to day lives such as transportation is dictated by physics. But there's one particular thing I've never really given much thought to my whole life, how is it that air resistance affects my life? Conceptually i've known about it for a long time, that a wad of paper is easier to toss than a flat sheet of paper, but I never knew of the reasoning behind it. While I myself personally am not engineering up anything or doing experiments of any sort that uses air resistance, it definitely has a large impact on one aspect of my day to day life, namely different forms of transportation. From taking the bus or Bart here in San Francisco and especially taking an airplane out of town, someone out there who designed these things with the concept of air resistance in mind, and it definitely partakes in the influence of the designs of these technologies. Even outside of moving real fast through different forms of transportation, even when getting around by walking we're all affected by the wind and air resistance to an extent. San Francisco isn't a stranger to some windy days, and surely if you were to get caught out in it, you would feel it as you walk or bike around to where you're going. While biking specially, it sure doesn't feel great to wear a big, bulky outfit since the air resistance would definitely hold you back, only forcing you to exert more energy just to move forward."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,441,"One of the current topics being covered in PHYS220 at the moment has to deal with acceleration, initial and final velocities, and anything else movement and speed related. I don't know about you but aside from the obvious, driving a car, I am throwing things ALL the time. It's interesting to think of what the associated values might be for my current actions. I never really considered it before but any time I move or toss something it has set values associated with each precise action or movement. Literally anything I do can be calculated using functions we've covered, and what is even better is that it can all be improved! My weak and imprecise human mind can at least stop to take a closer look at whatever I'm doing to see if there is a better or more efficient way to complete a task. Aside from throwing or moving things, I also mentioned driving which is realistically the best examples which physics could be applied to in terms of everyday usefulness. Everyone always hears about keeping a safe following distance and having an understanding of how long it actually takes to come to a full stop in a car when going at a high speed, but it doesn't fully sink in. If people observed and understood initial velocity, deceleration, and calculating the time and delta X, I bet they would be much more hesitant to drive as recklessly as they do. Oh man I can't wait until self driving cars are more prevalent and can do all these precise calculations for us that we couldn't do on the fly."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,439,"How can the use of antiderivatives help us better understand Physics?For my question, I decided to use: “How can the use of antiderivatives help us better understand physics?” In this past semester, I felt everything come together with physics and calculus and I finally understood the direct applications of mathematics and that made me feel very excited. Since I have been taking physics in parallel with calculus 2, that also really helped me see the connection between calculus and physics, since we would use calculus to solve physics problems! To answer my question, the first and most interesting thing I learned was that the antiderivative of the acceleration equation as a function of time is the velocity, and the antiderivative of the velocity equation as a function of time is the position! This helped me solve many physics problems over the course of my classes. This information is applicable to physicist’s lives, and helps physicist’s solve problems, which can be used in many ways to benefit society. For example, physics furthers new technology development, and allows us to discover new scientific discoveries. Physics extends our knowledge about the way things work and the universe, and this is done with the help of calculus and antiderivatives. An example problem for physics with calculus could be: given an acceleration equation as a function of time: a(t) = 30t, find the acceleration, velocity, and position, at the time t = 5 seconds. So in order to do this problem, I would first take the antiderivative of the acceleration, giving me: 15t^2, which is the velocity equation with respect to time. Next, I would take the antiderivative of the velocity, in order to get the position equation with respect to time: 5t^3. Plugging in the time of 5 seconds into each equation would get me: p(5) = 625, v(5) = 375, and a(5) = 150."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,442,"A concept we have been learning about in my physics lecture class is free falling objects. What is the rate at which an object falls? We can call this gravity. The acceleration of a falling object on Earth is 9.8 m/s^2. This information is useful to calculate the amount of time it takes an object to hit a surface. This information is relevant to myself because I may need to use this in the field I am pursuing( engineering). I also used to play aot of sports so it would be interesting to calculate things such as how gravity affects the distance or speed of a football being thrown, or how long it takes for a basketball to go inside the hoop. These are just a couple of examples I would be curious to find out, if I had the time. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,432,"Why does everything have to be measured with the metric system? If we were to end up using imperial, we’d still be asked to switch and convert the units into metric. In the past few labs we’ve done, all our units have been converted into metric. For example, cm/m instead of inches, and grams/kilograms instead of pounds. This is also seen in the main physics class — everything is metric. It does make sense why we have to do this, even though more people are used to imperial. Weirdly enough, the US is one of the only countries to still use the imperial system. Many others have switched over to the metric system in favor of being the majority. But many Americans aren’t used to the metric system compared to the imperial, which has been taught to them in their childhood. The same goes for me, as I am not all that used to the metric system compared to the imperial. I’m sure it’ll take a while, but I’m confident I’ll get the hang of it sooner or later — especially if I want to succeed. This is also especially important in classes, so it’s definitely something to keep in mind."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,434,"In one of the labs we did in this class we used scales and learned how to find the density of an object. This lesson that we learned can be used at home if you ever want to find the density of an object. Even if we don't have the fancy scales available at home that we used in class we can still find a way to weigh the object. We also used surface area to find density using calculations. Afrerwards, we did more claculations to find if our answers were in agreement with the calculations we did based on the scale. Now if anybody ever wants to find the surface area or density of an object I can show them what to do based on what I learned in our lab last week. For example, my sister read that a paper clip was able to float on water but was not sure why because she thought the paper clip had a higher density than the water. She asked me to help her find the density of the paper clip to find out if it was true. I showed her what I did in class minus a few calculations because she would not understand them. We found out that the paper clip does have a higher density than water but can float due to the surface tension of the water holding up the paper clip."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,435,"Knowing how to take measurements is important in any lab. In order to make sense of the results properly one must know how to also do unit conversions and make sure to use the appropriate numbers to understand the results. Without knowing how to do this one can really mess up a project. One story is when a mathematician was handling calculations for a space launch for NASA. According to a previous professor who had told me this story; the guy doing the calculations had messed up one of the units causing the space launch he was working on to crash back to earth right after launching. That was millions of dollars, time and effort wasted because the units were wrong. One can say that was a pricey mistake to pay for such a minor mistake. Another important reason why it's vital to know how to take measurements and provide the right units is to gather correct data so one can start improving their product after the first few initial tests. Like for example, Track times with a specific tire. We won't know how vastly we're improving the tire grip if our lap times aren't being shown the way the should. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,447,"Over the past week or two, in both lab and lecture we have been discussing how velocity changes over time in regards to different examples such as if its in free fall, if in motion. The graphs of these examples and of those from lab can be put into physical form such as Dr. Tennant throwing pens, paper balls, and any other objects in the room. But horizontally we physically see its path and as it accelerates and decelerates to the floor. we cannot physically see the path always however, sometimes its true path is hidden. If I drop my phone in a car going 30 MPH and my phone falls straight down, the graph of the phone is actually a horizonatal descending line over time for its velocity because its truly moving forward."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,445,"There are a lot of forces that I experience in my everyday life including the velocity and acceleration of the bus moving that I take to and from school everyday. There is also the force of gravity whenever something drops on the floor like a piece of paper, my pencil, or eraser. Sometimes I go to the gym and play basketball where I shoot the ball upwards toward the hoop and it goes back down as it reaches its maximum height. Whenever you shoot the ball there is an initial velocity and there is also projectile motion. I can also use physics in my life because this is useful for me for when I graduate and become a mechanical engineer, I can use these equations and concepts when building or designing new cars."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,444,"Physics is involved in my everyday life whenever I am at home and school. I use force to push the doors open to go out and back in, whenever I wake up the sound of my alarm clock uses physics because it a property of sound. As well it helps me in detecting problems and build solutions for it. What I learned in my first lab was figuring out the amount of space and object could fit in a certain area. Whenever I walk there is physics because of the resistance between my soles and the road creating grip so I wouldn’t slip. Connecting each part of our lab to everyday life interests me in learning how physics is involved in my everyday life, knowing that my major is physics it will as well support and grow my knowledge. I found it very interesting to know the different kind of properties that there is and how it can be expanded or even researched upon when doing a lab. As well the many functions that can be used to find an error analysis, discrepancy, areas, and uncertainties. I believe that being able to connect physics in our everyday life is very importation because it is used everyday."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,431,"Codie Mitchell  Phy 222  2/20/20     I am going to be talking about the third week of lab. This is the week we did our first real lab experiment. This entire lab’s purpose was to get more familiar with how the future labs will go and how to use and record data with certain tools. We measured things such as length, width, height, mass, density, and volume. I am curious about why these introduction labs are necessary to the student body. This is best answered by looking at what we learned from this introductory lab. The answer to this lies in how we calculated or recorded our data. We first used meter sticks to measure the dimensions of the table. We needed to gather this information and find out what we were given and what we needed to find. This took us converting units and using formulas to achieve an answer.  What we are being taught here is to learn how to visualize a problem and be able to figure out the steps in any situation to figuring out a solution for the problem we are given. This is a very valuable skill to learn and is given to me personally because problem solving is a massive part of the Computer Science major."
