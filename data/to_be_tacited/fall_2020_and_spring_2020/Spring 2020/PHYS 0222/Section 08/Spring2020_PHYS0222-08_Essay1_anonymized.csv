Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,429,"Why I am in this class is because I am major in computer engineering major. Also not only because of the major requirements, I am also interested in physics a lot. You may not know that I am a person who partial on science, my liberal arts is not that good. I’m here because I want to learn more about the science. Although I like science, but I’m not interested in biology. I’m interested in chemistry and physics a lot. Before I came to the US, my liberal arts scores was alway floating on the pass line, but my science scores like chemistry and physics scores are always over 140 out of 150. I also like to think about the working principle of the mechanics. Finally, I hope I can do well in this class."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,430,The reason I'm in college is because I want to get a degree and find a decent or good paying job once I'm done with my degree. Then after that I think I'll just participate in the rat races for the next couple of decades and hopefully I'll make the best out of it.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,431,"Today, I am here in San Francisco, California. The reason behind me being here is my father went to Panama and met my mother. They got married and eventually moved back to the United States. They had my older brother, and went back to Panama and had me. My dad was in the military so, we moved around a little bit. I went from Panama to Miami, Florida then to Delta Junction, Alaska then Athens, Alabama and finally I moved out to San Francisco, California to attend college. I am awake now at 9:30am because I picked classes I require for my degree. I picked this degree to use the knowledge gained to create, build, and develop business in the future. The reason for me being in this class room today is to complete the first assignments on iLearn and to do the first Lab assignment. I am doing this course to be able to have the prerequisite for the next course in line in my degree."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,432,"The main reason why I am here is because it is required for me to take this class for my major, which is Computer Science. Initially, I thought of just taking this class at a later date, but then thought to myself, “Might as well get it over with earlier than later”. I don’t regret making the choice, though having so many classes is kind of hard to juggle, it means I have to step up my game and focus on school more. After attending both of the Physics classes, I started to think it might not be as boring as I thought it’d be. Sure, it’ll be challenging, but with a but of help, I think I’ll be ok. Now I’m thinking that I am here because I just want to learn more about the subject and how I can apply this to real life, as well as my major."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,433,"The reason I am here is because of my major. I am required to take this class and many more other classes that also require labs. I am excited for this physics class and thats because in high school I took a physics class. What I liked about it was that we were able to work on projects that reflected what we were learning in class. I hope the same thing happens here in this lab where we are able to work on projects that reflect what we learn. Other then that I am also here because I wanna graduate. My goal is to graduate in four years and in order to do that I have to sacrifice my mornings, so that I could take my classes early and have more time in the afternoon to either work or get more classes to take. The reason Im here at this university is that I don't want to live in a boring minimum wage job for the rest of my life. I wanna find a place were I am able to gain a good amount of pay and also enjoy what I do."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,434,"I am here because I needed to take a lab in order to fulfill my requirements for my major. I chose this specific time because I just wanted to get this class done as early as possible so I can have the rest of the day to do whatever I want to do. I don't like waking up early, but that is a sacrifice I am willing to make in order to have the rest of my day to myself. I normally don't do anything anyway, but I have the possibility of making plans if I wanted to. As for the philosophical side of this question, I wonder that all the time. It feels like we don't know our purpose or why we are here until our final moments when we reflect on our past."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,435,"Why I'm here is a good question but a very vague one. To start off I'm here in a lab at 9:30am because I want to get this class out of the way along with my Physics 220 class because it's a requirement for my CS degree.... Now I've been in school for about 5 years now... 2 years of that was me being lost, another year was me searching for who I am and what I want to do, another year was spent pursuing it and the last year this year is the continuation of that... I just wanna graduate man and get to work lol... I could be at bed right now or taking a hike or going to the gym or even better walking my dog at Fort Funston. But I wanna get this degree, so I can get a stable, nice paying job so I can fund a cool hobby... like racing... street racing, or circuit racing..... yah I think Ima do that... well thats why Im here "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,436,"I am here today in lab because many years ago life sprouted up here on a rock floating around a star. After billions of years of things evolving and struggling through life, I managed to be born right here, right now where life is convenient enough that I get to get an education comfortably at an age where my ancestors would be toiling away just to survive a few hundred years ago. A cumulation of human knowledge and learning is what allows us to live in the type of world we do today, and while not nearly anyone would be someone who makes groundbreaking technologies, or advancements in our society, all our lives are improved and benefit from it.  Basically, for me personally I'm just here living a life trying to do what I can, and fortunately it really is a case of existing in the right place at the right time. As goofy as the state of world politics or the environment and whatever any other impending disaster is going on, right here right now is arguably the best time in history to be living, and that's why I'm here attending lab writing this."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,437,"The main reason that I enrolled into the Physics lab was because my major required me to pass the course. Although joining the class wasn't something I chose for myself, at least for the rest of the semester I'm choosing for myself that I will A's the course. In terms of concepts and theories from Physics, I don't know much about Physics. I've only taken one class that was related to Physics which was in my Junior year of high school. I'm hoping that in this course we'll conduct some experiments that'll at least about something I've never seen before. For example, I've always wanted to do an experiment testing out how different objects have more or less friction. Most of the experiments we conducted in high school were conducted as if they were hazardous, but we experimented with nothing hazardous. Hopefully, I can finish the course excited for the next Physics course that is required for my major."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,438,I am taking this class mainly because it fits with my schedule and I need it for my requirements. The particular reason why I specifically chose a physics course rather than other science courses is because I wanted to kind of witness the application of calculus in the real world at a much higher level than how the applications were taught in calculus. In mathematics we are just basically given the equation already and just plug in numbers. For example the equation for an object throw (the parabola) is just given such as something like -16t^2 - 8t + 32. Which just gives us the ability to calculate the velocity or acceleration of the thrown object at a given time but I do not necessarily know how to arrive at the equation if we were to actually perform the experiment in real life. So I hope to be able to learn how to create the equations from real world experiences from this class.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,439,"Why am I here?I am here because I want to do a good job in school in order to get a job. My major is computer science and part of my major requirements is to take physics and this physics lab. I find computer science interesting and cool, and I also find physics really interesting which is something I hadn’t discovered until I started to take physics class. It’s hard to do excellent in school for me, but I keep trying no matter how hard it gets because I want to get a job in the field of computer science, and who knows what else - I find many things interesting. Basically, I am very interested in finishing my major in order to get a job in computer science, and I am interested in physics. I am also interested in learning and developing myself, and this is why I am here. Thank you for the opportunity to learn about physics and how experiments are done in a laboratory."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,440,Cristian Garcia 02/06/2020Lab 1Why am I Here?The reason I am taking physics 220 and physics 222 is because I want to advance in my education. I want to receive my bachelor degree in Civil Engineering but in order to do that I have to pass my classes. I also need physics 222 because it is the lab class for physics 220. If I did not take the lab class I would have been dropped. I don’t necessarily see this class as mandatory because at the end of the day I am here to get my education. This lab can help me in my physics 220 class because I can ask questions and I would get those questions answered. I want to learn in this class rather than to play around because I need to take another physics class after this and I do not want to struggle. I rather have an idea on how to do something than not knowing what I am doing. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,441,"A convoluted question. I am here to live, to die, and to make the best of the bits in between. That brings me to college, where I will educate myself enough to find a good job and hopefully a meaningful one that satisfies me and gives me a sense of fulfillment. Part of doing that is taking this physics course and accompanying physics lab. For some people it is just a requirement that they have to knock out in order to complete their major but I actually have a lot of fun with these interactive type of tests. I can do physics questions all day in class but it's not nearly as satisfying as doing all the calculations myself and coming up with data to accompany my questions or thoughts.So why am I here? I'm here because technically I have to but also because I want to enjoy myself and make the best of my schooling."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,442,"Manuel SotoVernon Wetzell Phys 222.08 6 February 2020For 5 minutes, journal reflectively on:""Why am I here?""This essay is meant to connect you to your purpose. This is not meant to be a formal essay. It should be stream-of-consciousness writing from the heart. You will be graded on participation only, not on the specifics of what you say. 5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150-200 words.	First off, I am here because this course is required for my major. I am in this specific class because it fits best with my current academic schedule. On a larger scale, I am here because I graduated highschool, and am the first in my immediate  family to go to college and further my education. I am here because I understand that I have the opportunity to exceed the limits that have been placed on me because of my ethnicity. I am here to prove everyone who doubted me wrong and display what I am capable of. I am here to earn the best possible grade, and to learn."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,443,"When the question ""why am I here?"" gets asked, I instantly think they are referring to where I currently am at that exact time and place of being asked. Although that is my outlook on it, this question can become more in debt by adding on to the question continuously for example; Why am I here in college? Why am I here in San Francisco? Why am I currently here sitting in this lab class typing this response? And so forth. These questions typically can all be answered through one reasoning since they all tend to tie in together in the end. To begin with a little insight on why I am in San Francisco is due to me wanting to be in a city environment when working towards my bachelors degree due to me originally coming from a similar environment, making it a bit easier to adjust. Being comfortable is very important, especially when moving alone, because of the high chance of home sickness that can arise when making major changes. Leaving home and venturing out to attend college at San Francisco State became something I wanted do once I was presented with how this route can lead me to success. This lab class is one of the few courses/steps needed to complete all requirements made for my degree which is why I am currently completing this response. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,444,I am here in my 9 am lab because I would like to expand my knowledge and hands on lab skills but also because it’s a class that I need to take. My major is physics and I’ve heard it’s hard but I like to challenge myself. I’m in the lab mostly because I’ve always enjoyed hands on labs. During high school I took chemistry and physics and when ever we did some of our labs  I found it interesting. I know that when working on these labs I will be able to get out of my comfort zone and ask for help whenever I’m confused or in need of assistance during the process. I intend to put my part in the lab and it’s reports. As well I hope with this lab class I figure out what I would like to do in the future. I’ve always had an idea to work in medicine as a lab technician. I hope that the reason I am here helps me out for my future and growth of my knowledge. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,445,"I am here in this physics lab at SF State right now because it is a class I have to take for my major, Mechanical Engineering. I am willing to do whatever it takes to get to where I want to be and I know there will be difficulties I will have to overcome while doing this. My end goal is to be able to have a good paying job that lets me live a happy life with a nice house and car and also be able to take care of my family and pay my parents back for everything they have done for me. I chose Mechanical Engineering because I wanted to do something with cars when I'm older whether it's working at a car company like Tesla or being able to modify and drift cars. I also decided to attend classes at SF State because I was born and raised here and I went to high school right next to State at Lowell High School and wanted to stay somewhere in the city or near the city to save money and also stay close to my family. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,446,"I am here because I want to learn how to apply physics concepts to the real world. As a physics major, I would like to experience what it is like to be in a lab because my goal in the future is to work doing research. In high school the physics labs were very superficial and I hope that this lab covers the concepts in more depth and has more labs that can thoroughly describe concepts. My favorite topic to study in physics was forces (especially gravity) because I loved calculating for forces in the egg drop lab. I hope I am able to repeat the lab or a lab similar because it was the one I enjoyed the most."
