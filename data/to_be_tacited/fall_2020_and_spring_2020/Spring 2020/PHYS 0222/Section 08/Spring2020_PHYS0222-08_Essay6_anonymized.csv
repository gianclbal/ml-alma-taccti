2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,439,"I want to go into the STEM field because I am very interested in science, especially computer science, which is my major. During high school, I didn't find a lot of classes interesting, except for maybe math and biology, so at first I thought I was going to do biology, but then I took a year off after high school in order to find out what I would be interested in studying, and I came upon computer science. I did an online course, and that really opened my eyes to computer science, and it was very frustrating to learn at first, but once I understood something, it became more enjoyable to do and I realized that I wanted to pursue a degree in computer science in university. When I was little, I was also quite interested in science like physics and chemistry and biology, so perhaps that also led me to go into the STEM field. But overall, I am in this field in order to get a job with computer science because that's what I'm interested in and gives me inspiration to keep going."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,444,I think I want to go into the STEM field because I want to challenge myself and beat the stereotypes and system. Ive heard that being a women of color its tougher for us and usually the drop out rates are high but I want to go against that I joined a stem major because I like it and I want to finish it because I like it. Even though I have doubts on my major I'm sticking through it at the end. I believe that if I'll eve finish my stem major it will be a huge accomplish. As well I want to go into a stem major because I feel that I can learn so much about life and the mechanics of the outside world and it will be a good way to shape me up for the future. For now being in my stem major is very good and feel prepare for the tough parts of my path.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,441,"I had no idea what I wanted to do for my time in college, although I've always been drawn towards and had a much easier understanding of stem subjects. For a long time, that not knowing persisted and eventually I stopped for a while because I lacked any sort of interest or motivation.Years later I met someone while traveling who was making money by doing some sort of web design. I'd never done anything like that but the idea that I could visit any place I wanted and not come out broke at the end fascinated me. Once I got back, I enrolled in community college in a software development program. It turned out that I was pretty good at it, and just like other stem subjects, it came naturally. What got me started was the idea of traveling, but what has grown into a larger passion has been working with my friend on a game of his. It's been enlightening to see what can be done and how to do it. I'm not sure what i'll do with this profession, but I think I'll enjoy it one way or another."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,430,"The reason why I wanted to go into the STEM field is because, well to be frank, working the STEM field makes a lot of money and money is what my family and I need. Money makes the world go round, as they say. Even if that was not the case, I'm not too sure what else I would want to do. I'm not creative so anything related to art is out of the picture. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,440,The reason I want to into the STEM field is because is something I've always being exposed to. I have always loved math but there has been time where certain teacher make me not want to continue. But that soon changes when I start to remind myself that this is something that is very beneficial. I want to be able say that  I graduated in the STEM field just because many people have told me that is very difficult and say good luck. I don't like when people say good luck to me because is saying like I am going to graduate by luck. I want to prove those people wrong and show them that I put a lot of time and effort. That time and effort will pay off and I know that for a fact.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,429,"The reason why I chose to join the STEM field is that I am interested in the machinery, also I was interested in the computer hardware. Also, when I was young I always think about how to create some things interesting and useful to help me do somethings. I was very interested in how to be innovative and creative. I think the value of our engineers, is to turn all the paper talk into reality, making the world a better place. That why I chose to go into STEM field."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,431,"I wanted to go into the STEM field because to be honest it just seems inevitable. It seems the entire generation before mine has basically come to the conclusion that every child should go into STEM fields no matter what they want to do. This is because ever since there was science fiction, science is right there behind it find the bits of truth and pulling them out. The saying Art imitates life tells me that as a species we come up with things from our imagination, then look to make them as true as we can. This being our focus, as a species, tells me that it would benefit anyone to go into STEM fields. If the tech industry will be the one industry that every industry must merge with, it does not make sense to not start there. This field has a door way to every other field, and with it comes a certain level of power. For example, if Apple succeeds in moving all medical records online, then the STEM people have control over medical records. This makes the STEM people more powerful than the doctors in some way. Automation and various other methods the STEM community uses are key to our progress as a species. It makes less sense to me to not be in a STEM field."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,445,I wanted to go into the STEM field because I wanted to be an engineer since middle school. I didn’t know what kind of engineer I wanted to be at the time but when I got to college I decided I wanted to be a Mechanical Engineer. I want to become a Mechanical Engineer because in high school a few of my friends had some nice sports cars including a BMW and Mercedes and I rode in it quite a lot and it was fun. I wanted to do something with cars when I grew up and I figured that a Mechanical Engineer is what I wanted to be. I also found out that they make a good amount of money so I’ll be able to give back to my family and parents for everything they’ve done for me.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,442,"I want to go into the stem field because i am aware that they make a significant amount of money. I am pursuing a degree in civil engineering and one thing they are in charge of is roadwork. My city is relatively poor and roads are not up to standard. I notice that all the roads leading to richer areas are new or maintained, however, those that lead into poorer neighborhoods, contain lots of potholes and are falling apart. That is one motive I have; bettering my neighborhood. Another reason I was interested in this field is because I have an aunt who graduated from San Jose State University with a degree in civil engineering and she has raised a family and has had a stable job. I would like that for myself and with her knowledge, i can relay any questions I have and she know she can answer because of her experience. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,449,"I always wanted to become a computer engineering major because I've always liked electronics and science as a young kid I would always read books from the library and anything related to science and it really made me interested for more than any other topic I read books on anything that related to science or how things worked and it really would always make me happy and I was able to understand the sectional way more than other topics such as math or English or hard just because this is where my attention was and then I started tinkering with electronics at a younger age and it really helped me set a route for myself which is why I am a computer engineering major now and the reason why I've always been fascinated with anything STEM related, it just connects with my brain in a way that nothing else really does. Even in this class physics it blows my mind to be able to understand and calculate certain things in real life that you usually overlook."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,435,"Why did I choose a stem major? To be honest I have no idea why I did, I mean I never really was into anything else really. I didnt really have a talent in any form of art, I really am not into business and I find it really boring, I could've gone into humanities as a public speaker or something. I was initially going to just be an english major and call it a day but I found that I was just doing that on a whim. It kinda just started with a few math classes here and there and eventually I found out I had a knack for it. I didn't really enjoy it at the time but eventually once I started going into calculus I fell in love with it, and then computer science kinda came in also after math and it made understanding the courses easier. I found the structure in Math and Computer science to not only be comforting but it makes the most sense to me so far as the topic goes. I like finding things that translate over and work every single time and that occurs with mathematics a lot and with computer science you pretty much find better ways to do things in general not just in programming but maybe in a sequences of steps on how you approach a problem. It's all very nice in general and I figured if I enjoy it this much why not pursue a career in it."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,446,I want to go into the STEM field because it has always been my passion since i was a little girl. I have always loved science and math (even though I was never really good at mathematics.) I vividly recall as a child looking out the window as the rain droplets pitter pattered and wondering why the world worked the way it did. I wondered why humans and life existed. I wondered why the universe existed and where did it come from. My parents were always super supportive from the start and encouraged me to pursue what I loved. In high school is when I first started to feel out exactly what major I wanted to obtain in college. I tested the waters with biology but i realized that the science only superficially answered the questions that my curious mind spawned. Then chemistry felt closer to what I wanted but not exactly it. Then I discovered the beauty of physics. Intricately written formulas to describe why objects fall. Concepts to explain why the world spins. This was it. I knew then that physics was my reason to live. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,437,"I want to go into the STEM field because it contains all my interests like math, building, and crafting. I was first interested in game development and the idea of programming when I was in middle school because I used to play a lot of video games. Until my Junior year of High school where I built my first gaming computer which is where I learned that I love building electronics. From there I started to repair phones, controllers, and signed up for a computer hardware class my Senior year. Computer Engineering became an obvious choice for me because the hardware class taught me that I wasn't as interested in programming as I thought. Once I learned that Computer Engineering required a lot of math skills it became an obvious and favorable choice for me. Based off my first year experience, I'm going to love becoming a Computer Engineer, but it's not going to be as easy as I thought it would be."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,443,"STEM education helps to bridge the ethnic and gender gaps sometimes found in math and science fields. Initiatives have been established to increase the roles of women and minorities in STEM-related fields. STEM education breaks the traditional gender roles. In order to compete in a global economy, STEM education and careers must be a national priority. Each and every decision made uses an aspect of STEM to understand the implications. In conclusion, STEM education is critical to help the United States remain a world leader. If STEM education is not improved, the United States will continue to fall in world ranking with math and science scores and will not be able to maintain its global position. STEM education in school is important to spark an interest in pursuing a STEM career in students. However, teachers do not carry the whole burden of STEM education. Parents also must encourage their children to pursue STEM activities and increase awareness and interest at home and in extracurricular activities of the merits of STEM education.Programs outside of school can help children to see that STEM is more than a class to finish. Having activities that show real-life implication of STEM can pull together the ideas presented in school and help to show how they benefit our society and even our world as a whole. Children can see that what they are learning now is pertinent to their future and the future of the whole world, creating an interest often lacking when learning new concepts that do not seem to carry real-world application. Engineering For Kids, for example, offers a suite of STEM enrichment programs for children ages 4 to 14."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,433,The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is because I enjoy the math and physics that goes in to it. There is so much to learn about everyday things and how they work. Its very interesting for me and I hope to learn as much as possible. My interest in STEM first came from Math. In school math would be my favorite subject because I would always do so well in the subject and the idea of working hard to find a solution is great. When it comes to math there is usually only one answer and once you get the answer you realize why it is so. Mt interest in STEM grew even more once I took my first physics class in high school. The class was so interesting learning new things and applying math to solve the issues made it easier and more intriguing for me.
