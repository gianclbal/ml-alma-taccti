2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,449,"This online swap has been recently very difficult for myself as unfortunately right before this lockdown happened comcast was supposed to come out to my house and fix my internet issues, they had diagnosed the issue to be the underground line that connects from the main box to my house, they got to it and started to work on it but then had to leave it as comcast removed all at home operations and now I have been stuck with spotty internet for the past two months, I’ve called so many times but they said they simply don’t have a crew available to run out and fix it so I have resorted to using the hotspots on my phone as well as Xfinity hotspots but they both as super slow and the amount of devices I have at home simply can’t handle it. It has made me completely miss deadlines as I have no clue when my internet will be ok and when it will just drop off like I had my service cancelled."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,431,"The transition from face to face classes to the distance learning format was rough on me personally. During this worldwide shift I had to stretch my money out while not having some of the basic necessities for distance learning like printer ink, loose leaf paper, and other school supplies. This all while I am made to wait even longer for more money to come in. Id say it cut my retention of class material down almost in half. This concerns me as it will affect my learning and consecutive class knowledge. As far as self care I have been cleaning alot and playing alot of music. I take occasional sanity walks just to get some air and try and sleep early and eat well. This has been going moderately. It is harder to sleep when your home all day I think, and just is such a different atmosphere now, then before this whole lock down.  I am really concerned that there will be little to no support or understanding for this whole period when we go back, and currently while this doesn’t effect some, those same people need to understand that it does affect others. I wish there were more places and ways for students to just chat recreationally."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,445,"Since online classes have started, I haven’t really been able to understand some of the stuff taught in physics and calculus. It’s also harder for me to learn through online lectures because I can’t really focus and I end up just doing other things. I’ve been staying at home almost everyday for self care and only leaving the house to go grocery shopping with my mom and I walk out to my backyard to get some fresh air from time to time. The only concerns is that I hope I can pass all my classes this semester and hope that this coronavirus lockdown can go away as soon as possible so I can be back outside going to the gym and hanging out with friends."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,442,"Online classes have definitely impacted my learning. I feel like I haven't learned much and work gets repetitive. A concern I have is that I wont be able to complete all my assignments on time. Professors feel like since we have more time, they can assign more homework, when in reality, we have other issues to worry about in regards to the coronavirus. There was a time when I was not motivated which resulted in me slacking. Now that I have to complete all these assignments, I am overwhelmed and wont receive the grade I would like. Transitioning to online classes was difficult for me. I don't really do homework at home, rather in the library. Since campus closed, it has been hard not getting distracted at home. I have been attempting to do as much work as I can but since we have reached the end of the semester, I have to prioritize certain assignments."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,429,"Online classes improve learning efficiency and save a lot of trivial time due to school and eating. However, there are also many bad of online classes. For example, people who do not work hard and have poor self-discipline may play mobile phones in the class, listen to the online class casually, and do not practice after listening. Also, students and teachers cannot communicate as well because of typing speed is slow, information processing and reception efficiency are low, and teachers cannot make teaching arrangements according to students. Sometimes it is hard to figure out how to do the work."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,439,"Online classes have made me feel like I'm cooped up and I've become a bit lazy since I'm at home and I don't need to go anywhere. Some of my concerns are that I am not getting enough fresh air, and not getting enough exposure to interesting things like school, and parks and restaurants that I liked going to. I am also trying my best to not get lazy since I am at home. I am also pretty scared of the virus and I am scared to go outside because I don't want to get sick. However, I try to remind myself to have hope in these times. First of all, I may be cooped up but I can still go on walks in my neighborhood. Also, I try my best to clean and do homework and find time for hobbies and not let myself get too lazy. In addition, I try to indulge in my hobbies in order to learn more interesting new things, or doing a course online. Also I try to remind myself that just because I go outside doesn't mean that I will get sick because I have a mask. I also remind myself that this will pass, and everything is going to be alright, because I like having a positive outlook on life."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,441,"Truth be told, I don't think online classes have impacted my learning all too much. For the most part, everything seems to be roughly the same. I would say that in certain scenarios, I have the ability to pay less attention while doing online classes but I still procrastinate as much as I usually do. This isn't my first time taking some classes online so I suppose I already knew what it was going to be like.As far as concerns for my learning, I don't have a lot that are impacted by classes being online. The last ""Marble In A Bowl"" lab provided a fun and interesting way to use mundane household objects and figure something out even though we didn't have any fancy tools at our disposal.Lastly we have self care. I think the largest aspect of this comes from less time going to the gym (as in zero), but trying to replace it with running. Since I can't eat out as much and don't do delivery, I've also had to get more food to make myself and I think I've done a pretty good job at getting mostly healthy options."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,446,"This last month and a half inside have been the most stressful time of my life. From the fear of going outside to buy groceries to staying inside and being trapped with my own sanity have been torturous. School is harder because teachers just love assigning a whole bunch of assignments and essays and all them make everything due Friday so I am big stressing. Honestly, I just want this quarantine to end because I miss seeing real people and I feel like I can't breath anymore in this house. In contrast, I have had more time to do my hobbies like painting, making music, and writing poetry. These activities kind of distract me from the fact that we might have to spend a whole year inside. It's all good though I'll be fine. I just hope teachers are compassionate with my slow pace. I have been taking more time to submit my assignments and get everything done because I am also taking more time to cook and clean around the house. Keeping busy has helped me take my mind off of the quarantine depression. I am also glad that I have my dog with me. Thank you for reading!"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,444,"Online classes have impacted my learning in a positive way, I feel that taking online classes has given me more free time when finished with school work, as well not staying up late doing homework but has helped me plan out my time schedule. At first it was difficult for me to switch from face to face to online because I was used to just having to wake up at a certain time and head to school, and the scenario of school physically being in class, with classmates and my teacher but now I'm used to the online classes. For my well being I'm staying focus and positive. I have understand that having a good mindset well help me stay focus on classes and homework, as well influence my family around me. As always I've taken my classes seriously because I know that it will take a huge toll on my path to graduating. Myself and my family are a huge reason for my comfortable switch from face to face to online classes. Its benefiting for most including myself  because its a good way to relax and to be able to destress. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,443,"As lie comes with nothing but unexpected turns all the time, all you can do is adjust. I definitely enjoy face-to-face classes due to being able to be more interactive with peers as well as be able to get help on the spot! This transition have now made life more congested, in my opinion, by now having to complete all assignments online. There is little to no hands-on with any of this learning. We are having to miss the true assistance needed in labs and finish them ourselves. Although this is a tragedy, is a precaution put in place that is suppose  to help stop the spread of COVID-19. To keep myself healthy I have continued to stay indoors and keep socializing distancing my number one priority.  I now have more time to cook and eat home cooked meals more regularly, I have days to myself where I can give myself a "" break "" from reality at some points of overwhelmingness. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,435,"Honestly its a mix of both good and bad. Like it's great in a sense I don't have to be stressed about thinking on how I'm going to look and get to school and I can just attend classes from my house so it takes out a lot of expenses. I'm also able to keep up more with my studies due to other responsibilities being put aside. However,I kind of depended on being outside as a way to set the tone on what and how I am going to go about my day. I can hardly focus at home sometimes and the workspace I have is small compared to library tables I usually work at. I find myself falling into bad habits also wanting to play more video games, eat, sleep and watch things more often compared to how it was back then simply because I had no time for such things. Im glad I'm still able to go outside though and work on other things such as my own cooking skills, I even picked up cool hobbies; lock picking (I bought a lock pick set), fixing and opening up new and old tech I have lying around the house(From the IfixIt toolkit I also bought), etc..... Aside from school work.. physics is fine I feel like the pace of work was decent but earlier think pair shares were being replaced by quizzes and honestly those problems were alot harder than the old quizzes but things reverted back. Overall though some of my classes haven't really paused to take a break even when the incident started and at this point I'm exhausted and ready to go into summer. Being taught from school gives me no escape from the work.. that maybe my only complaint so far.."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,433,Online classes have negatively impacted my learning. I feel that by taking these online classes and being at home I am less motivated to learn and be engaged in my classes. When i'm in school I am far more motivates to succeed and get my work done. The reason for that is back in college there are far less distraction and a lot more areas to study. While back home there are less areas to study and easier to distract ourselves. I constantly find myself losing focus during online classes. I feel more comfortable skipping a class online then going to an actual classroom. On the other hand I have been safe and healthier since coming back home. Being back home I am physically able to distance myself from other people. I am far healthier as well. I go on runs to get in my daily exercise. So far my self care has seen a positive change since being home. This pandemic has changed so much so quick that me as a student is stressed on how class are still on and how grading scales have changed. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,437,"Online classes have impacted my learning because I'm unable to attend my Labs and receive hands on experience on concepts I'm learning in my lectures. I feel like everything that I have learned since the online classes have begun, won't stick to me because of my lack of interest. My lack of interest comes from the fact it feels like I'm just watching a youtube video instead of being in class and that I've enclosed in my home for 1 month already. I don't have any concerns about my well being because my family has been following all of the quarantine regulations and have only gone out for grocery runs and other necessities. There is a low number of individuals who have corona virus in the Bay Area and the diagnosed people are mostly quarantine themselves, so there is a low chance we'll run into individuals who are infected. I'm hoping that when the quarantine is over, I will at least regain interest in my classes as I won't feel like I'm trapped at home anymore.These online classes are helping prepare on how I will my manage my time for the college classes that I'll be taking over the summer."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,440,Online classes have impacted my learning a lot i feel like i am not learning the same way i use to. As for self care it has not change as for getting 6-8 hours of sleep and going out for walks.
