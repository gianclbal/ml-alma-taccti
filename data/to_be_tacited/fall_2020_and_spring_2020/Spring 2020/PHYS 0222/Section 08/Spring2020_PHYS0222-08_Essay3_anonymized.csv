2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,432,"When life gets challenging, I don’t have to keep all my pent up stress to myself. There are friends, family, and even teachers who are willing to losten to what you have to say. Don’t let it drsg you down so easily that you don’t know what to do. To start doing something, you have to come to terms with it, and talking to someone really helps with that. Even if it bothers you to take that step, you never know when it will escalate into something much worse. Keep your chin up and think about it for a bit; there must be something you can do, right? Of course there is, but effort has to be put into achieving it first and foremost. Once that happens, something is sure to happen and who knows, you might just overcome that challenge. The hardest part is taking the steps to overcome it."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,439,"When life gets challenging, I like to take a step back and address my thoughts. Often for me it’s easy to get overwhelmed with life, and it’s easy to ignore all of the issues that are bothering me, but when it gets too challenging, I like to just take a moment alone and just let my thoughts come to me and try to reason through my issues. Talking to a loved one helps me get my feet back on the ground if I am overwhelmed as well. Sometimes the right words from someone can help me realize something that I had not taken into account. Sometimes some self care is nice too, like some meditation or just some quiet time with a book or a movie, helps me remember who I am and that everything is okay. Reminding myself that I need to be patient and that everything will be alright also soothes all of the thoughts that circle around my head whenever life gets challenging. All in all, taking a step back and addressing my thoughts and doing some self care helps me when life gets challenging."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,438,When life gets challenging I guess I just ignore what I have to do for a but. I sometimes just go out for a walk if it isn't hot outside. I tyoically only walk outside for this reason if its cold out. The cold seems to helo me relax. If it is hot outside I just tend to either watch a movie or play games. If I can spare like a day or so I tend to hang out with friends to get my mind in a more relaxed state.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,437,"It's kind of difficult to say what I do because I've never had an experience that I could say that I was having major trouble. At most I've had experiences where I've struggled a bit, but only for a short period of time. In the instances that I've struggled a bit, I've always tried to solve the issue by myself for as long as possible. When I saw that I couldn't solve the issue on my own anymore, I seek help from a person that I feel like they can help me the best. Usually the people I ask for help, for personal problems, are my parents, brother, or uncle. Like I said before most of my experiences have been short struggles, so after getting help from 1 or 2 people my problems have usually been solved. Whether I've had really tough or easy experiences either way seeking help will always be the best thing to do."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,430,"I'd try to get sense on what is it that I'm trying to do. If I can't figure it out at the moment, I'd take a break and come back to it later. In the ideal scenario, I would try to break it into smaller tasks and work on it one by one. Realistically I'd probably procrastinate a bit before getting started on the work."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,440,What I do when life gets challenging is the question. It depends on the situation. Once common situation will be getting caught up in homework. What I do I tackle one homework at the time and then continue on the other homework’s. Another challenging thing will time management. This goes day by day just because everyday is a different day and different obstacles. I challenge everyday by doing all my task and once all my task are done I chill. Another way I challenge myself to do better is not to stress about the situation this is very important just because stress lead to more things. Stressing takes an effect on the way you live day by that day. I try not to stress in the long run. I rather take it slow because if I rush things this will lead to more problems. An example of a problem will be getting things wrong. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,446,"I am going to be honest, when life gets challenging, I am not very good at composing myself and facing the situation head on. Initially, depending on the situation that I am confronted with, I cry or get upset. I usually beat myself up or let myself drown in emotions that are probably useless in the long run. Then, I try testing the waters with different solutions that could possibly help me overcome the problem, some aren't well planned out and frankly quite dumb. When a solution does not work, I resort to looking for help from other people that are probably better left out of my problems. By the time that I have digested the hardship in my life at the moment and come up with a fool proof solution, the obstacle has already dissolved itself with time or the situation/problem has become irrelevant. Oops. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,441,"This has always been a struggle of mine. I'm naturally good at most things that I attempt but it caps out at that unless I put in a lot of effort and that's where I start to fall apart a bit. It's not that I mind putting in effort, but depending on many factors such as the subject, whether or not I enjoy it, how capable I feel with it, and others, affect what I do when facing a challenge. Typically I will procrastinate and put something off. If it feels especially daunting, that procrastination will last until the last possible moment or lose all interest in the topic. If I am uninterested and don't care about the challenge, I might just give up entirely. When It comes to something I care about or that interests me, I will often seek help when I know I don't have the knowledge base or skill level to complete whatever task it is.I know that procrastinating, losing interest, and giving up are some of the worst ways to handle a challenge but for some reason that's just how things worked out for me. Probably an improper upbringing but what do I know. I do what I have to do to complete what I absolutely need to."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,443,"One of the most important things I do when life gets challenging is isolate myself from my loved ones. Not because I want to, but because I like to avoid throwing my problems and stress onto others. I enjoy spare time to sit and analyze my problems closely enough until I have solutions. Organization is my beginning step because I believe making plans and goals is a way to assist problems that exists. By organization I mean, prioritizing what needs to be worked on first that would also help benefit the next problem in line. Often times we know why life is becoming challenging and it is often due to lack of motivation. Lack of motivation sometimes causes me to give up in certain situations, prolonging them which only makes them worse so I now limit the amount of prolonging I allow to happen with certain situations. As far as self care goes, which helps bring me to a relaxing mode, would be me treating myself to lunch and or dinner and also spa dates. Music also helps me cope well when I am feeling overwhelmed with life. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,434,"When life gets challenging, I usually like to step back and just rethink everything. Depending on the situation I'll maybe rethink what I'm doing or rethink my approach. Maybe I just step back and try to see a big picture. That will usually help me calm down and open my mind to new possible solutions to get out of these challenging situations. When life gets challenging it's easier to just give up and ignore the problems, but working through them will feel so much rewarding in the end because you will be earning whatever you worked for. It will feel so much better getting what you worked for when you worked hard for it than if it is just simply handed to you with no effort being put in. So yeah it sucks when life is challenging, but the reward is worth it in the end. That is why I try to look at the bigger picture when life gets challenging."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,433,"When life gets challenging I like to take time off. I like to clear my thoughts and take a mental break. This break usually consist of a food break, excursive, or just time to sit back and relax. I feel that by distracting myself from a challenging task then getting back into it helps me resolve my issue and overcome the challenge. With the mental break that I take I am able to decrease the stress the task has given me. With less stress I am better able to focus on the task ahead and find different ways to approach the challenging in order to overcome it. I have used this idea of a mental break during midterm week and finals week. I find it super helpful in my case. Besides the mental break, I also like to ask for other people help. I feel that by having someone else approach the task with you it become less challenging. You are able to work as partners sharing the work load or passing around ideas that can help each other. Doing so can make the task less challenging and less of a stressful situation. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,442,"When life gets challenging, i usually pray and tell myself that it wont be like this forever, or seek friends for help. I find that when you place your faith into something bigger than yourself, such as God, you feel like there is someone there watching out for you. Friends are a good outlet for support. They remind you that whatever you are going through, they are there regardless of the circumstances, and can help you with what you are struggling. When life gets challenging, i know that I can get through it because I have in the past. When life gets challenging, I usually try not to stress about it because, whats the point? I am just putting myself through it twice, which is more than I need to. Although i try to maintain a positive character whenever I am struggling, it does not mean it isn't difficult."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,429,"When I facing the challenge, I will try hard to overcome the challenge. Challenge is weak when you are strong. When you encounter the challenge, you should tell yourself that this is an opportunity to exercise and shape yourself. When you overcome the challenge more often, then you will become stronger and succeed. Therefore, to face up to the challenges, face up bravely and be unyielding, there is nothing to fear. We are born to solve problems if we do not face the challenge we will not progress. Just like our real life, if we don't face the challenge and problem, our technology will not progress, we won't have the life like now."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,445,"For me when things in my life get challenging, I would go and work out at the gym. I work out almost every day when I come to school which is Monday through Friday and working out usually clears out any thoughts in my head and relieves stress. I also try to talk to people about things if it does get pretty bad. I like to think of all of the possibilities that would result if I do a certain thing or if I don't do something, what would happen later on. I like to rethink a lot of things and remind myself that it's not going to be like this forever and that better days will eventually come. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,431,"Codie Mitchell  222.08  03/05/2020     When life gets challenging, I try and stay in the library as much as possible. I do this to fuel me to continue doing homework or studying. Just me being around other people who are also being studious makes me become more like that. I also try to keep my time management on point with a timer app on my phone to break down the day into smaller bite sized time increments. I usually take occasional breaks to walk around or sometimes play LOFI music on Youtube. This all accompanied by a light work-out or perhaps just a trip to the sauna in the morning and evening to bring it all together. Since it is very easy to become disorganized, I usually set aside some time to re organize everything, or perhaps rewrite/consolidate notes. Besides things I actively do, I try and bring things with me from home that will keep me from procrastinating my day away"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,436,"What do I do when life gets challenging? Well, the only thing to do is to challenge it back I feel. But of course, being the Challenger is now the hard part of the equation, it won't come around to you, you've gotta do something about it. And when that comes about, it sure is easy to try to shirk that responsibility. But the hardest part of anything is starting out, so just that. I try to identify the problem in my methodology up to that point to see if there's anything I did that caused this new challenge, or maybe in the end it was just inevitable. After that, I take steps towards the problem and determine what is quickly available and/or viable as a solution. Is it something I must prioritize, or is it something that can move to the back of the queue, it's all deterministic. So in all hopefulness, when it ends up not being the most dire of issues, I attempt to solve my problems while they are still mild, but honestly it's easy to forget and put it aside until it does become a slightly or even bigger problem than necessary. So though life definitely throws some unavoidable curve balls, there's always something you can do day to day to at least put myself in a better position so when the challenge comes to me, I can look it in the eye on level ground."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,448,"When life gets challenging, I try to figure out what to do on my own and then check with other resources to make sure I’m making the right decision or make sure I’m on the right track. I don’t like being given an answer straight out. I believe it’s better to be told how to solve an issue so the next time that issue comes up, I’m better equipped to resolving that issue because help won’t always be available. Also, i like to break down the problem into parts that I know I can do on my own and parts with which I know I’ll need help. First do what you can do and worry about what you can’t later on. This covers ground in solving a problem but takes away from the stress induced by said problem because I stop worrying about things I don’t know. I’m lucky enough to have a mother who supports me in my endeavors unrelated to school issues, which allows me to feel confident in my studies. School-related issues don’t seem as challenging now because i have resources that help me understand topics that may not be clear. When life gets challenging, there’s always that initial stress. However I know there are ways i can resolve my problems, making challenges seem less daunting."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,444,"What I do when life gets challenging I stop and reflect why I am doing what I’m doing. I usually stress the most when I am doing school work. I get angry and feel like giving up, and perhaps cry a bit but I eventually step back and take a breather and reflect that I am doing this because of my future, myself and most importantly for my family. I realize that my family is my motivation to keep going and never give up. When it’s personal problems I tend to talk with my sisters, my sisters are a huge support on my success and are great to look up too because they are older and have more experience in life so I consider their advice to be very helpful. But then at points I keep to myself because I sometimes believe that my challenges in life is my only way to learn in life and I should figure it out on my own because that’s going to happen when I’m older. Also, i have the support of my friends because if we go through the same thing eventually we will have to ask for help. But overall I do rely on my own self when life gets challenging because I know myself more than anyone else and just having a moment to reflect and talk out loud helps."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,8,435,"It honestly depends on the situation. If it's an all out losing situation for me and it's something I particularly don't enjoy in the first place I just drop whatever it is that makes life so challenging. However, if getting over that obstacle leads to a better and a happier life I strive for it. If it's something I really am interested in and passionate about I don't just give up on it. I find out other ways I can achieve the goal or attain success. I begin to experiment different methods and if for whatever reason I get stuck I'll definitely ask for help. I'm more confrontational as well depending on what situation I am dealing with also and I try to keep an open mind. I feel like keeping an open mind when things get hard is probably one of the best things you can do when one is put under tremendous pressure. It allows a person to think outside the box per-say."
