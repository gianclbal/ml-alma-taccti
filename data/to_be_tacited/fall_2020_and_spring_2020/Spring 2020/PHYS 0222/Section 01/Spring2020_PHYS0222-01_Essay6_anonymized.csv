2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,424,"I love code. like i know some programmers have those moments when they struggle to find a bug and curse out their screen and what not, but its all still just a thrill, a rush. lines of code can turn into software that can change the world....for good or bad...depends on which team you're on. i was always fascinated by technology, hardware and how code and hardware cooperate with each other. i have created some projects and they were fun but more so were made in honor of helping a friends problem. like a friend needed a url link assigned to her from her job to reach a certain number of clicks, so I made a bot that takes proxies and clicks that link from each proxy so it can register as a click from her job. point is, coding allows to fix simple problems and just be fun. i don't know, I just enjoy it lol. isn't that why anyone majors in what they are majoring in? out of passion? but yeah, hopefully i get to work for a good company as a software engineer one day. for now, i'll continue my side projects and building my resume. (and networking ofc)"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,428,"Alexander Chen5/5/2020PHYS 222I want to go to the STEM field because I am terrible with social studies and communication and the STEM field just appeal to more. Most of my classes are math and science based while having only one class of oral communication. In my oral communication class, it is relevant to my life because communication is used constantly and of course used to communicate with other people. In the class I learn some fundamental points on how to properly construct a speech and to properly execute the speech. For my math and science classes, I am taking chemistry, physics, calculus, and beginner classes for engineering. Most of my classes are STEM classes. These classes is not that relevant to society, my community, and everyday life. But later on, if I continue to pursue mechanical engineering, I can give back to society and my community. All these classes are part of the road map for the mechanical engineering major. The things I learn in chemistry is used to learn to basic principle of chemical safety and this relates to my major because I will need understand how batteries function when working with electricity.  The things that I learned in calculus can be used for applications like mortgages and interest. For my engineering classes, they would not be that useful as I am only learning the basics and introduction of engineering and learning how to use AutoCAD."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,417,"I wanted to go into the STEM field because of the choice of my career path. I’m a computer science major and ultimately I want to become a software developer for Amazon and make skills for Alexa. About 2 years ago, I used to work at the Amazon Pop-Up in Westfield and all I did was sell Amazon products and smart home accessories. I got familiar with the whole Amazon ecosystem and would inform customers how awesome smart home automation can be. I played a lot with Alexa at work and especially the echo dot since it had an open API. I made a few skills of my own such as making an insult generator where Alexa would roast you. At that point, I knew coding and developing skills for Alexa was my passion. To conclude, I knew I wanted to be a software developer for Alexa because it’ll actually be a profession where I won’t end up hating my job."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,419,"Siqi Guo   5/8/2020                      Why I want to go into the STEM field? Before I answer this question, I did not think this question answer. First, I will think because I am student, I need study. This is a big point. Then, I study computer science in the university, I really enjoy I type the code and think where I type wrong when I do the assignment on my computer. Another way, I think when I study like science, engineering, math, that hard major class, can improve my brain speed and strengthen my major knowledge. I know that these subjects are difficult and challenging. However, I think that can challenge and will help me in my future work and life. Of course, the most important point, is can improve our ability. After all, these are rational subjects, but often the most testing subjects. So that is why so many people like it, including me."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,412,I want to go into the stem field mostly because of the stable jobs. I can make good money to provide for a family and for me to enjoy my life. I chose to study computer science because it is actually fun for me to code. I don't necessarily like learning about computer science but I do like doing it. While I'm doing It feels like i am solving a puzzle. I have a goal in mind and I have to figure out a way to achieve that goal. I also really like it because you can create thing when there is nothing there. You can have just a blank screen and with some code it can turn into a complete program. I also feel like the future will be all technology and with a degree in computer science I will be well equipped to do something with in the future. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,415,"The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is that I've always taken an interest in science including technology, engineering, and mathematics. I've never really had the interest to pursue other topics other than those throughout my life. Science was very fascinating to me and explained to me how things worked and why. It fed my curiosity as I grew up questioning many things. I really got involved in learning about the solar system and planets in 6th grade. I wanted to be some sort of an astronomer because of the vastness of space and how mysterious it was made me want to learn more about it. With getting into science heavily, it led me to pursue other topics like the environment, physics, and biology. It helped that my mom was a nurse growing up so that also steered me into the direction of the STEM field. The older I got the more I realized that STEM jobs were very significant for job security and the progression of society. STEM was heavily emphasized in my last years of middle school and throughout high school. The importance of STEM being showed to me throughout school led me to take a career path involving a job apart of STEM. I enjoyed technology and computers and ran servers for several games which involved very very little coding which made me want to be a computer science major and explore more into the coding and software aspect of computer programs. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,423,"At first I really wanted to be an astronomer, I thought the idea of looking at stars, exploring new planets, and seeing a star blow up was really cool to me. I've always been interested in science and I knew I always wanted to adventure into that. That was very short lived, I found my love for gaming and got extremely passionate, one day I said ""hey I would love to make my own game"". Now I'm a computer science major and the only thing I regret is the amount of math I have to do. I want to be able to make my own game and publish it, to experience how it feels, even though I know its insanely stressful. Overall, I wouldn't want my  major to be anything else, and I've thoroughly enjoyed it, also the pay is extremely nice. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,411,"I want to go into the STEM field in order to get a better understanding of the world around me. Ever since I was a kid, i wanted to know how things work, specifically things related to astronomy. Also, I want to be able to use knowledge for different aspects of science while focusing on my major, Computer Science. I believe that a strong foundation in math and science can be applied in any occupation and one can highly benefit from it. Even in business, law, and other non-STEM fields, a foundation in math and science can be useful. As for my major, I went into coding because it explains the programs behind the tools and apps we use everyday. Also, no matter what occupation I were to go into, knowledge of coding can put me in an advantage compared to my colleagues. Knowing how to code, in my opinion, unlocks limitless possibilities with what you can create."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,420,"There are multiple reasons for a person to go into a STEM field; possibly it could be chasing one's dreams or pursuing a job just to meet one's daily spending. Myself personally was culmination of an interest of science at a young age combined with hard work from the different grades level to today. I would personally go towards a STEM field for the purpose of grabbing a degree under my name and finding a job that suits me more towards my interests. In its entirety, I have always pondered the new discoveries that could be out there in the world in the deep regresses in my mind while showing a somewhat optimistic outlook on the world, perhaps going into a STEM field will help my own goals of obtaining something new and possibly beneficial to everyone."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,413,"When I got out of high school I thought that I wanted to work with my hands and I was in a position that make the military really beneficial to me. I joined and ended up with a job as a generator mechanic. I went to a unit that was very high work load and I realized that I didnt want to be a mechanic for the rest of my life. After I got out I knew I wanted to be in a stem field. Going to college for anything something arts related wasn't really on my radar because it reminded my too much of grade school which I was very bad at. I started as a mechanical engineer because I knew that fixing things could be be very rewarding and I was looking for that same type of satisfaction there. I didn't take any  classes that related to mechanical engineering that really got me interested but I taught myself how to program a little and became extremely interested. Now I keep going this direction with my life because I can get much of the same stress-work-resolution type satisfaction from programming without being outside, in bad weather, covered in grease and oil. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,421,"I want to go into the STEM field because, above all, knowing the mechanics behind the way the world works is something that I really aspire to. Calculus is a massive roadblock in the path of this, as I still don't really understand and the transition to online classes has made things even worse in this respect, but I am working through it. In fact, during this quarantine, I've thought a lot about switching majors to something less heavily intertwined with calculus. I gained interest in physics because I had a really good physics teacher in high school, but not as much of it is clicking as engagingly anymore, although having hands-on labs is a much better way of learning, for me. Maybe this is why I liked my high school physics classes so much, as over half of it was labs, rather than lectures. Anyway, I still have to do a lot more thinking about what I will pursue for my degree, but I will still hold onto my appreciation for physics no matter what."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,418,"Going back to when I first started college, I only wanted to do engineering because there was always going to be a job for construction work, or building or rebuilding buildings.  But now, I see the engineering field as not only a job, but a way to be a part of the future, and what new prospects the future would have.  And in the beginning I love the idea of building and making dream buildings a reality.  Buildings in general, how to build them, what they are made up of, and how long they would last, are all the questions an engineer could answer and prove.  And being an engineer means you are smart too, but that will have to come with time."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,410,"I wanted to go into STEM field because I wanted to do computer science. I enjoyed coding and the great feeling of solving the code after struggling to figure it out feels great. I also want to be part of a big project or a game project and feel proud to know that I was a part of that success. I know it isn't like anyone is going to really know, but at least I will know I assisted in it."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,427,"I would really enjoy being in the stem field, but more in depth I would enjoy being able to work as a Civil engineer because I really enjoy being able to build things. Ever since I could remember I've been a very hands on person and I know I'm going to have the opportunity to do a lot of internships that would allow me to learn this way and I would actually love that. Although I know I might go into a certain position where I'm inside working on calculations for jobs or something, I still would love to be able to pass by a house or building and tell people I was a part of the team that built it. Which is another reason because I really like meeting new people and being able to work alongside others for a outcome. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,409,"I went into the STEM field because if I can understand what it's about and it's a good career to get into, I might as well do it. I want to keep my loved ones and myself financially secure. I'm also not really passionate about anything enough to turn it into a career, so I figured I'd turn to something I have some skill at that can make a good career.      Even then, I have little hope that I'll make it out alive with how competitive my field is, but it's all I've got going for me financial-wise, so I'm going to give it my all. I'm hoping that the growing demand for programmers grants me some help on my end. And now that everything's practically going through a corkscrew loop at 100 miles-per-hour, I just clinging to the STEM field because that's the only direction towards purpose and occupation I've got, right now."
