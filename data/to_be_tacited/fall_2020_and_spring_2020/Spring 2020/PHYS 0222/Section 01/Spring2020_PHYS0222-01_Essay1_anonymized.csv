2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,409,"I'm here because this is a class that I need for my major. Yeah... it's rough out here, buddy.I want to get an A in this class so I have a foundation while job searching, so that I hopefully can beat the crippling dread that job searching, and thinking of the future in general, can be (for me, at least). I know I'll need side projects as a Computer Science major, but I feel like acing this class would just... help, somehow. Who knows.I have no idea what else to write, but I'm hoping CS-related jobs outside of major cities are abundant, because I'm trying to head OUT of Cali. This is asking for a 150-ish world limit and I'm trying to oblige. I hope the research goes well and that everything works out.And if you know the movie Promare...... what's good. I see you're a person of culture, as well."

2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,410,"Well, I always have been afraid of heights, but I also want to try skydiving. If I were to apply the lab today to skydiving, it would be very different, yet the same concept. We are mapping an object's position and figuring that objects velocity and acceleration. Get a big motion sensor and have me jump hundreds of feet in the air off of an airplane, we could track the same thing about me. How high I am from the floor, how fast I am going, and how soon I will panic because that ground is getting closer and closer to me."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,411,"Following the concept of acceleration and velocity, I propose this question. Do objects of different masses fall with the same rate of acceleration, and if so why? The formula for a falling object in free-fall is v=gt. There is no variable in the formula in which we can insert the mass of any given object, so we must conclude that mass has no affect on the velocity of a falling object. From this we can conclude that the mass of an object does not have an effect on its acceleration either. An object falling is hindered on its way to the ground by air resistance, not by its own mass. Two objects falling without air resistance will fall at the same time regardless of their masses.This information can be useful to me in my own life, as there are many sports and activities that utilize falling objects such as football, basketball, and baseball. While these objects encounter air resistance, which changes the distance, their acceleration remains the same. With this information it is now easier to deduce where a ball (or any other object) might go while midair, which is crucial for activities that utilize falling objects, like sports."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,412,"Online learning has impacted my learning so much. It is so hard to learn at home, there are so many distractions and I cannot stay focused on my classes enough to clearly understand each topic. I am staying up until 4-5 am every day trying to get my work done because I am procrastinating and I have no reason to get up early anymore. I feel that the in person class setting is infinitely better, I feel that there are way less distractions. I was very lost in my physics classes so I would go to my professor's office hours every week, but now that we've moved to online learning we would have to do them via a zoom meeting and I do not feel comfortable with that. Especially  since I can't show her my work and she doesn't understand the errors I have made in my work. Learning has never been more difficult than right now. I thought that we would be going back to the university for the Fall 2020 semester but now I'm hearing that we are probably not going to and Im very worried because I will be taking an even more difficult physics class and two computer science classes. These are classes I feel are very important for me to clearly understand and I feel that I won't."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,413,since we have switched to online classes my time management and work ethic have suffered. I am still motivated enough to do my work but I have turned to a purely mechanical view of it. Before the quarantine I would take the time in most of my classes to try and make connections from the material to other parts of life and attempt get a solid conceptual understanding. Now I have tasks that need completed and I complete them so that I do not fail.From what I have seen of my friends during this I seem to be at least average on the quarantine motivation scale.   
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,414,"In this lab physics class, the teacher was asked us to do the lab work that about measuring something. We did the measurement that measure and weigh a metal cylinder and a paper, and also to count the are of a piece of paper. During the time for measuring the metal cylinder, we have measured the diameter and height, after that, we recorded those measurements and calculate the volume, area, and density, also we need to record and calculate the percentage of the error uncertainty. After that, we use those data to figure out the material of the metal cylinder which we were comparing other material's density. It required us to weigh and measure more accurately that could help us for doing the data calculation. After we have discussed the calculation and finished the measurement. We started to write the lab report. It is important to have a little discussion because we want everyone in our group to agree our calculation and the result. Even though we were working separately, but we would discuss that at the end. That's why we should have a group work in this lab class because each one is important. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,415,"So far in the past classes we have measured volume, density, area, and learned how to use standard deviation uncertainty, and discrepancy. All of these are useful in their own individual ways that can be applied to the real world. Last lab we used the density formula to figure out the composition of a specific metal of a cylinder. This could be useful and applied to the real world if encountering something and want to know it's density to compare it with other things you know to see what it is. It can also be used in my life by trying to see if a specific chain or jewelry is real. If testing to see if it as made out of real gold the lab we did with density would definitely help. Using the uncertainty formula, it can help with describing how accurate the method that was used which can show how far off the calculations were. Today we will be going over the the effect of gravity and acceleration on an object which can be applied to almost everything. When it comes to sports it can most definitely be applied to basketball, football, soccer, track/field , and so on."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,416,"I am taking this physics lab technically to meet the requirements for my major. I believe that physics is a requirement partially due to the nature of this major. Computer Science is related to Computer Engineering. Computer Engineering involves physics. Perhaps another reason is, it's important to know physics, so that we'd understand how things theoretically work. Perhaps it's included to require students to round off their major with other subjects--so that students learn about subjects outside of their field. If I were to ask myself, ""why am I taking physics?,"" then perhaps I would be asking myself why I'd want to pursue a degree in Computer Science. Computer Science is about logic and how things work. It's within my understanding that this is similar to physics. I enjoy learning about how things work underneath the hood. I explore different ways of deriving a solution that gives the same output, and relish in methodically documenting my work and improving my code. So in a sense I enjoy learning about physics because the underlying thought process shares common ground with programming. In addition, I also want to learn cool things about machinery."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,417,"I’m here at SF State because I wanted to go to a 4 year university and it was the most affordable compared to the other universities I was accepted to. I pay my own tuition and it’s way cheaper compared to private colleges or out of state colleges too. So far, I like everything about it and I don’t regret my decision. The teachers are great and it’s not a huge party school which I like. It’s pretty mellow here and there’s a bunch of educated hipsters who attend this university. I also wanted to note that I’m glad to even get this class. It’s a requirement for my major and I’m not trying to fall behind. If I had not been enrolled in this class, I would’ve also been dropped by my PHYS 220 class. I’m very grateful for this opportunity."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,418,"Describing how my first and hopefully last, worldwide outbreak is so far would of course, be a negative attitude towards it.  And I would assume that most people would view the same, but to be specific i dislike how trapped I feel in my own home.  How I long to go out and hang with friends, or travel just to go out on an adventure, or even the daily routine of exercise to and from school.  How I am doing in school so far, I would say not the best because I feel more lazy and lax compared to actually being in a lecture or lab.  I feel that working over a computer screen, is just asking for laziness in our studies.  I am trying my best to focus on school work, but only grades will tell, and the only few things I would change for online work, is for there to be more HW that is on Ilearn.  Instead of jumping back and forth between 3 different HW sites.  Using just one for all of school would be easiest."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,419,"Name: Siqi Guo Date: 2020.2.18           My major is computer science in university SFSU. The question that I come up with in terms of the concepts from our lab in the previous couple weeks is what could you possibly get from the standard deviation using on one of the database I created last semester. The regarding project, called “The Grade Book of Programming Class” is implemented by using an SQL database, with having all the midterms’ and finals’ score from 100 students in this session recorded in, respectively. All the scores are sorted in alphabetical orders using the sort function.          Our instructor from the PHYS 222 class introduced the physics problem and how to calculate and finally to get the answer, which I assume it is quite useful for assisting both my major’s assignments and solving daily issues.              Using the methodology provided from our instructor, I use in my major class. In my major class, I figured out the median score from the grade book is 80, meaning that half of the students in that class scored less than 80, and half scored more. After taking the previous couple sessions of the PHYS 222 lab, I realized how to use the standard deviation more effectively, supposing I want to find out the percent of the overall numbers of students that score less than 85. For the scores of the grade book, the standard deviation is 15, explaining approximately 68% (2/3) of the scores within 1 standard deviation (65 - 95) of the median. Approximately 96% (50-110) of the scores are within the 2-standard deviation (30) of the median. Therefore, the concept of standard deviation is truly useful in our life."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,128,"Douglas Paredes2-18-2020Physics LabWhat we learn last week can connect to my personal life because it shows how we can determine what type of metal something is. I am a big fan of gold and the way it is manufactured, unfortunately, nowadays there is a lot of ways that one can fake that metal. However with that test that we performed, I can at least be more certain that it might be gold. I can also relate to experiment that we did the first week. I learned to how to measure things and how to account for uncertainty. That is very useful to know as not  everything is completely accurate. With that, I can determine how close we are to the actual answer. I think that this is very useful,  because in sports, measurements are everything. Especially in football a game that inches count. That is why I am grateful tp have a better understanding of measurements and margin of uncertainty. I can also connect to the way that we handle the lab report. I am an engineer major and I need to have a good understanding of how to write a good lab report. I also am able to get information like what hertz are. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,420,"The online classes have impacted my learning on the multitude of my class subjects greatly considering how the remote classes are not the best solution but an easily available one between the students and the professors. Some prefer a face to face confrontation while others prefer the general remote learning that is happening now. For my own self care at the moment, its moderate at least comparing to my past shenanigans,I do have concerns about how long this type of learning will go on for considering how I general view online learning as not as good or worse to a the physical lecture in terms of memory retention and the better experience it has between the college students and the professors / doctors. As for the worries of my general well being, there are none considering but I do worry for the other who don't have the supplies to help themselves during this pandemic."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,421,"When I think of the question ""Why am I here?"", multiple interpretations pop up in my head. However, one rings out louder than the rest without getting too existential, that one relating to why I am at SFSU, studying physics in a temporary building right now. I chose physics as my major for two main reasons. For one, physics was the only subject in high school that I actually enjoyed studying, mostly thanks to having an excellent teacher (shout out to Chris Balmy.) Secondly, thinking about the mechanics of our day-to-day lives has fascinated me for a while, since it ensures that physics will always be relevant, no matter the circumstances. As for why I'm here studying physics in this very moment, this lab is a required addition to the lecture component of the course, and while I would have liked to avoid coming in on Tuesday at 9:30 AM, sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do. It could be worse though, at least I don't have any 8 AMs. This is my first lab course that feels like a real lab course, so I am very excited to see where this goes!"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,422,"Online classes have impacted my learning quite a lot. Although I like the idea of learning online, I find it very helpful to learn at my own pace whether slower or faster at times. However the hardest thing has been physically being away from campus.  I no longer have an apartment or a schedule really and it has been difficult. I have also been fasting for the month of Ramadan the last month so that has been keeping me occupied. I am worried about getting bored. There aren't very many competitive things for me to do except video games which I am bored of now. I like doing physically  competitive stuff with friends and people. I will have to find a way to challenge myself."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,423,"Online classes have impacted my learning by making me procrastinate a ton. I'm not great with online classes because I do not trust myself with doing the work. I'm usually a very big visual learner and I feel like I'm missing that key thing. I also feel like being able to go to classes helps me do my work because I feel more entitled to work on things. Right now the things that I am working on for self-care is not going outside because my dad gets easily sick, and before this whole pandemic started he was already sick, but now he is fine. Overall, the only issue I'm having is dealing with my time. I do not think I have any current concerns with learning, if I put more effort into getting things done I would be able to maintain my grades."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,424,"we learned about acceleration of moving objects. somewhat like measuring what path an item or object is going if that makes sense. how I know some situations that like that topic can be related to. like things such as drifting? because we dealt with like radiuses and stuff. and that can be relevant because like in reality, what if you're racing? you need to know calculations in order to insure that your turns and speed changes all work in your favor or else things can end badly. other topics discussed in class that can be related to every day world could be the topic of how things can be measured when thrown or falling. somewhat helps you know how to predict an objects path to better how you'll figure out much power and which way to throw and item. in addition to factors like wind resistance, etc. that can be used for physicists but even people like sports players. physics relates to anything if you think about it.  all these topics learned and discussed can be used to to better any task at hand. but mainly basic topics within everyday things. its just how accurate do you want to know things or have them done correctly."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,425,"I am here to study computer science. I enjoy everything about computers from building them to programming them. My goal is to eventually start and run a related business in the technology sector. I am mostly interested in artificial intelligence and robotics. I also think the mobile field is important because it is a part of most everyone's daily lives. But most importantly I think computers are essential in pushing humans to new limits. The ingenuity of humans and the learning ability and speed of computers will change the world as we know it, and I want to be at the forefront. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,426,"I had taken the PHYS 222 last semester but didn't pass, because of absent. the reason I didn't go to class is that I thought I don't need PHYS 222 to graduate, the only class required is PHYS 220. I don't like doing the easy project, it is the main reason I didn't go to class last semester because I can know the result without doing a test in most of the projects. This semester, as I already know that I must have a PHYS 222 Lab class to graduate, I decided to retake it. I am sorry for my unrespect in my last semester PHYS 222 Lab, but because of the thought that no need, I didn't want to spend time on something I already know. This semester, I will come to each class and have A at the end of the semester, I need the class to graduate and it is the reason why I am here."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,427,"So far the couple of labs we've done have tied into the 'real world'. The last one we did was about finding different calculations such as volume and density. Calculating different things and checking with  others to compare answers is a part of a lot of STEM fields. For example when it comes to big projects, civil engineers almost always collaborate with other civil engineers on their calculations to make sure they're as right as possible. In addition to this, people in many STEM fields also use formulas that can be derived from other formulas on a daily basis. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,428,"Alexander Chen4/21/20SCI 0227Reflective Journaling Essay #5                Online classes have severely impacted to the college life that I have gotten used to. Some concerns that I have about my learning is how my professors are communicating with us and what assignments are going to change. Also, I have concerns about how we are going to do testing with classes being online. Once we started online classes, I feel like I started to struggle on staying on task with my classes. I have more time to myself without having to walk around campus, I can just turn on the computer and I am in class. I need to get of the habitat doing things last minute. I feel online classes made me less intensive with my classes and homework with the temptation of my computer in front of me. I am doing self-care by exercising and playing on my Nintendo switch."
