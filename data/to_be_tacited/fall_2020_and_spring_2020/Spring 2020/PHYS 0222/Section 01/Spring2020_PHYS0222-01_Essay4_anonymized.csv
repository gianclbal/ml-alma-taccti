2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,415,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college greatly. My family has very strong values when it comes to college. My mother didn't go to college straight after high school as well as my dad. They both pursued alternative pathways such as finding jobs, as my father chose to go to the military and my mother, was a stay at home mom. Both knew how important college was and later regretted their choices to not go to college. While raising me and my other siblings they made it a core value for us to pursue college shortly after high school. They made it a priority for us and gave us all the tools we needed to make it. All my older siblings besides one have gone to college and have gotten a degree. I am the last to get my degree and make something out of it. With this being so, I have more help than I can ask for when navigating through college and getting the proper help I need. The help that ranges from having proper time management, adjusting to the college life, and making big financial decisions regarding loans and financial disbursements. I couldn't have gotten this help navigating through college if it wasn't the strong core values that my parents laid out for the rest of us to follow."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,409,"In my family, education is a high priority so we can make a ""better life for ourselves"". I'm here at SF State to get my degree, and I just get the bonus of seeing San Francisco and getting to explore it (which brings crippling irony with the current news this year). My housing situation with four roommates hasn't been the best, so being taught since I was a kid to focus on my education is probably what got me through last semester despite being in the middle of a bunch of squabbles I had no part in.     I thankfully know and remember my loved ones care about me. So even when I feel like giving up and becoming a sack of bricks in the sea somewhere, I get back up again just so that they're still happy. I find that doing anything I can to make them happy is what keeps me going. Life's weird, even more so now with this balderdash micro-apocalypse going on. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,428,"Alexander Chen  3/17/20  PHYS 222  Reflective Essay #4                  My parents were never really pushed their ideal major or job for me, and they are supportive to me. The mindset that I had in my first semester of college was to do as well as I can. I would always stress myself that the classes I took were going to be terribly hard and I wasn’t enjoying myself. Once I got to see how the classes were like, I started calming down and started enjoying the college experience. I guess I was overreacting a bit. The high school I came from, stress was a pretty big problem at the school. I must have carried that mindset over to college. Connecting with my friends in high school really reassuring to me. I miss my friends in high school, but I really enjoyed sharing and hearing our first year of college experience. I need to continue to be organized and to clearly communicate with my peers."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,418,"How my values of my community or my family helped me with my choice of college, was mainly what I liked to do, and what is close by.  I generally didn't want to go out of state, and didn't want to dorm anywhere to save money.  Because I knew college would be expensive investment, but thankfully because I like to build, and or anything related to structures.  Civil engineering is still my choice of major and what college close by in the bay has a good program, SFSU does.  So good thing I live in the bay and I like my studies of civil engineering at SFSU so far.  My family says to put my education first, but of course I put my family first, because no one will ever replace my family.  Education can take its time, and I will get through it and get my degree in civil engineering in due time.  There is no rush, unlike what high school was teaching me, to go to a 4-year and graduate, then get a job and start your ""life"".  I am living through my life as it is right now, and I am taking my time for college, and I will get to become my dream of a civil engineer, because I was brought up that way by my community and family.  I have a great family that cares and supports my choices and in time I will be a civil engineer they will be proud of."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,413,"As an older student of 26 I am very much on my own through college, but I know that without my military experience I would not be able to succeed in college. Part of this is the general ""growing up"" I did and the self discipline that grew out of the experience and part of it is the education benefit that takes care of all financial troubles while I study. Another part is getting experience navigating a large bureaucracy which helped me figure out a lot of administrative problems that I have stumbled into. In terms of motivation I am very close to my brother who lives in LA and we talk often about life, struggles, and successes and that helps keep me motivated. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,128,"Douglas Paredes3-17-2020Week 8The values of my community have really helped me get through college. From an early age I was indoctrinated to not give up easily, as a result of that, I have been able to power through a lot of things. My family also taught me how to do everything to live by myself.  I have been taught to fix many basic issues on a car and in the house. I was also taught how to cook many things. The issue that I have seen many college students have is the lack of knowledge of what and how to cook things. Due to my upbringing I luckily do not have that issue. I am able to cook many things. I have also learned from an early age to not shy away from work or a challenge. This is very crucial especially in college. Living in San Francisco and going to college by yourself is definitely a challenge. As a result of this, I have to work to not only be able to pay for school but also be able to pay for my basic necessities."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,414,"In my memory, my parents taught me that I need to go to college in order to have a good job. At that time, I didn't know why do I need a good job and why do I go to college. When I grew older, I realized that a good job means a better life. Since I went to high school, teachers and classmates are all have good behavior that helps me to build up my values that also behave well. Those people are very important to me because they led me to improve my life and helped me to go to college. When I have gotten to college, my parents usually encourage me that make me have more power to study, and my friends in college also trying hard to work with me to try to get an A in class. It's college life and I should try hard to get a good grade in order to a good job that helps my family."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,427,"Since I am a first generation college student I feel like my family values college in its entirety a lot. We all believe it’s important to have as much education as you can in order to be able to help each other out whether that financially or just with things many people that don’t have migrant parents think of such as being able to translate certain documents or conversations. In addition to this, my family values completing things to the best of your abilities. My family always says “Si vas a hacer algo hazlo bien” meaning if you're going to do something, do it right which I think a lot of hispanics also say. If I apply somewhere for an internship, scholarship, or even turn in an assignment I tend to try my best and if I know it’s not my best I’ll keep working on it until I know it’s at its highest potential."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,410,"My community has helped me navigate through college quite nicely. I have made a few friends at SF and they've been very helpful throughout my school year. Whether it is winding down to have fun, need a partner at the gym, or need help with homework. I have been able to assist them as they also have been able to assist me."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,417,"My family has a bunch of female role models that were from the working class and migrated from the Philippines. They’ve all became nurses, doctors, or dentists so their profession is involved in the STEM. However, I didn’t pick SFSU because I wanted to be any of those three even though I know SFSU is notorious for nursing. My female relatives always preached on being independent and never relying on anyone. The popular saying was to ,” figure it out”. So, my original plan was to go out of state or a top school for computer science. I got accepted to UC Santa Cruz, Arizona University, Arizona State, Saint Mary’s, and others but those were my main 4 I was interested in. I worked my tail off for the SAT’s (1240/1600) to get an adequate score to compensate my low 3.4 GPA. I thought I was set; however, my parents asked me how I was going to pay for everything. I looked at them confused and didn’t know what they meant by that because I knew all of my peer’s parents were helping pay for their tuition, dorm, and books. My heart sank and I went straight to applying for financial aid. I couldn’t get a federal loan because my parents made too much and I had a breakdown. My parents made a good point that I applied to all these big name school but I didn’t look into any local state schools which are much cheaper. So, here I am at SFSU. It was the cheapest tuition without financial aid and I didn’t have to find a new job since I work in downtown. Everything became convenient since my grandparents lived 10 mins away from campus (when I lived with them at the time) and my job wasn’t to far as well. I’m happy with my  decision and I don’t regret it at all."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,412,Me and my sister are first generation college students. My mom and dad and all of my aunts and uncles never went to college. My mom and dad both work labor jobs. My dad builds and paints different types of furniture and my mom cleans houses. They both work very hard and they are always very tired from their jobs. They told us that they do this to provide for us and for both of us to get a college education and have a better life than them. Because of this me and my sister have always tried to get the best grades we can. In high school I my performance did dip down a little but now that I'm in college I have picked it up tremendously. I am getting some of the best grades I ever have and am being a lot more responsible with my work. Online classes have made it a lot harder to be responsible but I am still trying.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,419,"siqi Guo 3/18/2020    This is an interesting topic. I think the most is the community. Because first, in the city, we can see many different people and every day we will have new things. We can study from them. Second, in the community, the city let us know a new idea is why we need to do new things, do the favorite job, no matter what we are doing, do what we like to do before we succeed. This point is whatever in the community or university, that is talking many times. The third is study hard, this point is important, study carefully at work, study hard in school. At any time, hard work leads to achievement. That is community gives the value to help me keep going in the college. Lastly, is family, families can establish a successful outlook on life and values. For example, family education teaches how to save money, how to handle daily affairs when one is away, and how to take care of himself. So, I think my family and society values are very well to help me finish college."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,423,"At first, I wasn't into going to college right out of high school, honestly I was kind of forced into going to a college. I started by taking courses at a local community college, and my first semester was horrible, actually so bad that I was put on academic Prohibition . I then realized how important my education is and started to focus more time into trying to get my degree. I also realized that I would be one of the first people in my family to attend college so I took this opportunity to try to be as successful as possible. Overall, my family has been very supportive of me and my actions, and I am glad they pushed me into furthering my education. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,422,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" Your values are really tested when you come to college. You find out if you really believe what you thought you believed.  I found that the values I was taught applied to life in college as well. In fact they applied more than ever. My values have helped me better, more educated choices. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,420,"The values of the community or my family has at least somewhat helped me navigate the intrinsically complex system of college by guiding me through the correct to earn my chemist degree. I've gained some important information from my classmates by informing on tasks and extra ways to do certain problems and labs, the teachers and professors which gives insight on how to do each chapter or section of the subject text of either problem solving or summary of the entire text, and finally my family who gives me an actual idea on how to do certain things. With that being said, there are multiple people on campus who provide mediatory and catering services to other students which provide some kind of benefits towards the students of the college. All in all, without the community at large and the family and friends I have made along the way in college, I would have a much tougher time figuring out everything and how it works in its entirety."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,424,"sorry, I thought I did this. but okay, how do I value my family/community. well thankfully both go hand and hand to be honest. I help my family alot, in regards to anything that needs to be done. but mostly, with work. we own a small convenient store and thats where the community parts sets in. I help my family by working many hours weekly in order for my dad to not have to do so since he has me. it takes a toll on me yes, but Its for family. so I am always willing to go above and beyond. now in regards to community well, a lot of people go there to help support the small business but also sometimes its more convenient for them. get a closure connection and really interact with each other compared to the bigger cooperations. but aside from that community, i do hope to one day make a successful app or just get an amazing software engineering job and give back to my muslim community. and set a good image for those younger than me. some of the kids at our mosque try to be something they aren't and rather not go to college. I hope I can show them a better way for a better future. only time will tell i guess...well, also my dedication ha ha. "
