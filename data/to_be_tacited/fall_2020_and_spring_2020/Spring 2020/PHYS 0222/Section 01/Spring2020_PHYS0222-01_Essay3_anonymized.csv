2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,410,"When life gets challenging, I try to fae it. Normally I am always trying to push through some sort of goal when I was in high school for athletics, right now I am just trying to go with the flow. Sometimes when life gets in the way too much, I like to hit the pool and swim. Swimming helps me clear my mind and tackle the problem another time with a clearer head. It is kind of hard to really know when life gets challenging until you've really hit a brick wall or something bad really happens. I just hope I never had to face this wall too soon."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,423,"Actually, I'm currently at a part in the semester where I am having difficulties in a subject. This semester I am enrolled in calculus 227 and it is extremely difficult for me to understand. When I get in a tough spot in my life, I tend to just take everything step by step. Each night before I sleep I'll plan everything I need to do the next day and make sure I get it done. Most of the times I'll stay in the library for hours on end, bashing my head till I understand. I've been recently looking into tutoring to help my current situation in math. Overall, when life gets challenging I try to take it day by day so I don't get extremely stressed out. I usually don't plan anything so it helps out a lot when I go through everything I need to for the day to come."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,428,"﻿Alexander Chen  3/3/20  PHYS 222     Journal Entry #3     When life gets challenging for me, I like to destress myself before I get back to my struggles. Sometimes, I like to clean my room and get everything organized and tidy. This helps get the feeling that I am not messy, and I am organized. Even though I am not directly facing anything that is giving me trouble, I feel accomplished that I finished a task for the day. Another way I destress myself is by playing video games. I know this method is counterproductive, but it helps relieves me by having some fun instead of doing work. After I had my break, I come back to task that I was struggling with refreshed. When I know a big task is coming up, I try do things bit by bit, so I do not end up stressing over a big pile of work in a short period of time.   "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,418,"The things I do when life gets challenging, are mostly things that relax me and change my mood.  To not see my current situation in a negative light and to make myself feel better in the current mood and in the near future.  I tend to do outdoor activity, from archery and airsofting, to more techie things like computer games, or messing with my car.  I like to repair or tinker with the things I own, so from taking apart my longboard, to adding things to my car, I tend to mess with something electrical.  I am not sure why, but tinkering with objects relaxes my stressed mood, I guess it would be similar to how someone would destroy something out of anger, but I would end up taking apart something and rebuilding it later on.  Games on the other hand just pass the time after some stressful events, and I end up forgetting about the whole situation later on.  I guess I would just end up distracting myself from feeling bad."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,412,"When life gets challenging I usually just try relax and distract myself. For me, the best way to do that is to grab my guitar and try to learn a new song. Learning a new song hells me a lot because it is something that requires a lot of attention and time. I've been playing guitar for a year now and I find it enjoyable every time I do it. I go through a lot of phases of interests in things. For example, some of the things I can remember are getting into magic tricks, solving rubik's cubes, juggling, but none of them really stick. I think the reason that I really stuck with guitar is because I picked up at a point when I was feeling really stressed out. I was in the middle of my college applications and I had a lot of personal problems at the time too, so playing guitar really helped me in that time."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,128,"Douglas ParedesPhysicsJournal #3There are several steps that I take when I began to become overwhelmed with life. It's actually a three step process. First, I put in context how bad the situation is. For example, I had a math midterm last week. I asked myself what's the worst that can happen if I happen to fail that midterm. Then once i found out the answer to that question, I would either take necessary measures to either ensure that I wouldn't fail or let it be. If that still doesn't help, I just take a nap and take the L and bounce back the next time. Because sometimes in life, L aren't losses but learning opportunities. If all of that fails, then I resort to the last measure which is panicking for a little bit then starting the process again so that I can realize that whatever I'm concerned about is not that serious. I have never really gotten to that step but its always in my mind as a contingency plan in case things get really bad, but regardless everything has a solution and if it doesn't then why even bother. Like if you can fix it, cool, I you can't fix it, cool, like if you can't do anything about it then why even be concerned. Its a difference however if you can do something about but you don't. At that point just take the L and live to fight another day cause clearly you just ain't feeling it."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,426,"Every day, people experience different challenges, whether in which steps of life are we. However, if I just sit back to avoid stress out, I could not finish my studies and my life will not be better. As more and more midterms approach, I have to spend more time studying, and it’s important to know what can I do. When life gets challenging, I realize that I can get help. I can ask my teachers and classmates in class or after class. It’s pretty helpful if I understand what we learned. I will become more efficient when dealing with homework and tests.The relaxation is also important for everybody. I also feel like grab some food can be a good way for me to get out of stress. Doing exercises at the gym is also a solution of getting out from worried. When my body becomes tired after exercise, my mind is cleared in contrast. And it’s interesting that I learned meditation from critical thinking class. I found it can help me be more focused on tasks. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,414,"To me when life gets challenging, I will just stop doing anything that I have and go to relax like play games, listen to the music or go to sleep, after that, I will go ask online or friends if they know and I will figure out a way to overcome it. Since we have the Coronavirus around in our community, all the restaurants are closing, and the goods were sold out very quickly. The most challenging thing in this time is to protect myself, and having online classes that might harder than face to face classes. When I am staying home the whole time, I would like to learn something new that improves myself, also I can do the facetime with my friends or play games with them. I believe we can overcome this challenge while we doing our life as normal at home and not going to worry about it."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,413,"When I things get challenging in the course of a day I will just make myself something big to eat. sometimes its just microwave garbage that I cover in hot sauce and other times its a cheese board paired with meats,fruits, and peppers and I drink a little bit of wine with it and that it usually pretty great. If I feel stressed over the course of a week or a few weeks I like to go on a hike or a really long walk maybe listen to a podcast or whatever book i'm reading.  Usually during a regular week I make sure to workout 2-3 times a week in the mornings and pretty much every weeknight I have a stretching routing that I do while listening to an audio book and this amount of routine helps me a lot. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,427,"When life gets challenging or I feel a little too overwhelmed with school or even personal things, I tend to try and hang out with my friends. I think it's really important to give yourself a little bit of time to relax and socialize with people you care about. I also think it's really beneficial to have someone you can confide in whether it be a close friend or a family member because a lot of the times being able to talk to someone about something that's happening in your life or something that's overwhelming you could help you process what's happening better. For these reasons I let myself relax and hangout with either friends or family at least one day out of the week. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,411,"When life gets challenging, I like to get into a certain headspace where I embrace all of the work I have to do. If I am going through a challenging week of school, I just keep going and stay focused on what needs to be done. I feel as though constantly staying on track builds up momentum that I need to focus on my work. However, after a lot of work and studying I need something to help e relax and reduce stress. I do this by running and playing musical instruments. I like to run with music because I only need to focus on two things. This helps me take my mind off all of the work or exams I have coming up. I also play musical instruments when I am worked up to have a little fun during my studying. This greatly reduces the stress of working and studying."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,419,"Siqi Guo 3/9/2020 Apparently, there is no doubts that we are all likely to face all sorts of challenges throughout the semester in University. And it could happen in our daily life as well. From my opinions, I have 3 methods dealing with my pressures when facing challenges. Calming down my emotional mood by listening all kinds of music, especially Karry Wang is my first method. He’s a Chinese singer. This is really helpful on me, because listening to music could always help me to make the right moves. Making step-by-step notes on a note card is what I usually do as well. This is because I could track my improvements step-by-step, which would help me building my confidence. The last one is to talk to my friends, since they are always supportive and could provide some useful advices on my challenges. Therefore, I think even if there might be some challenges placing in front of my life, I could always try to find methods to solve it, if I treat it positively."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,425,"When life gets challenging, I just keep going. Whether it's good or bad, who knows. I tend to deal with things as they come and just accept them for what they are. I forget that I need time to process what's going on around me. Coping properly with challenging things is not a skill I've worked on throughout my life but now as I mature and become more independent I realize that's an area of myself that I need to work on. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,420,"Typically when life does get challenging, there are several options and routes one can take to either pass through it or get around the challenging obstacle in from of you. When its either stressful or intensive, its best to relax and take breaks in between either the workload or intensifying studying for a test or an exam. In others ways of something happening to you when it challenging, it can be especially helpful when you have your friends or Acquaintances to help you out during those tough times in life. There is no definite solution for those challenging points, its best to either have help from others and the willpower to move forward as it can help elevate the more troublesome areas in which coincide with the college semester for this year as week long homework and quizzes can seriously drain a person's mental fortitude."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,424,"What do I do when life gets challenging. well, that all depends on the topic thats challenging. Is it school? is it work? is it life? different things need different solutions. with that being said, I guess that a general answer that can apply to all these is id find the most obvious solution that I feel i can stick through in order to get past the obstacle. but then again, im just saying this, cause some ppl they just give up. some people take drastic measures and even feel they can't handle such things and drop out or worse for example. so yes there are solutions. but what about if the solution isnt even reasonable? maybe its not impossible but what if the issue makes it so hard. like me in school. for example, i struggle being a full time student while working full time everyday. its hard to try and constantly keep my head above water. whats the obvious solution? take less classes and take longer to graduate when im already behind? or get days off. those seem like solutions but they arent options sadly. *sigh* things are always easier said than done. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,409,"When life gets challenging, I do things that will prevent my mental state from tanking. Whether it's running from social media, withdrawing from social circles, or doing something that makes me happy when I should be doing something that stresses me out.     Lately, due to the current circumstances and getting tired when people say, ""the world is really crazy/bad/whatever adjective right now"", I've been having to withdraw from doing work for certain classes for a period of time. Of course, there are other factors-- along with getting absolutely steamrolled with a gigantic workload, I've been having to whatever I can on that day.      Sometimes it's ignoring other assignments to stay afloat in another class day-to-day. Other times, it's calmly admitting defeat and knowing I'll have to re-take a class or two despite some time-sensitive graduation plans. Other times, it's doing your best even when you don't know what will happen and if your efforts are going to be in vain.     Other times, it's trying your best to go against the odds of a messed up brain, a confusing curriculum, stressful school year, debilitating anxiety, and getting sniped by nihilism (and worse) to try and do what you can.      It doesn't matter if it doesn't live up to that straight-A, internship-earning, ""best-of-the-best"" mentality. It's something unobtainable except by the 2% that have the resources or the right state of mind to be able to push themselves or comprehend material like how the system wants everyone to.      All I've got when life gets challenging is my best, and I'm struggling, and that's more than good enough. I feel that if I don't acknowledge that fully, I'm never going to survive or make it another few years when life gets challenging over and over again, no matter how much support or resources I could get."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,415,"I've came across many times where life became challenging and I always resorted to what I knew and did best. What I did was run. When my academic life became challenging with all the IB classes I was taking, extracurriculars, and sports I would resort to running as something that was very therapeutic. Running has become a big part of my like and something that I have been doing since I was a little kid. It was a way to escape from everything for a brief moment and take my mind off of things. When I run I focus on my surroundings , breathing, and the pace I am going atm I'm hardly thinking about any of the troubles I may have that is going on in my social or academic life. Running has been a way to blow off some steam as well. When I get angry, irritated, or sad with anger I go running to let it all out by running at a very fast pace. Doing so has made me feel better afterwards and has let me approach my feelings and situation in a new perspective. Especially when I'm very stressed with the workload I receive from school it's good for me to take a break and do a physical activity such as running to relax and hope for it enlighten me with something I didn't see before. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0222,--,1,422,"What do i Do when life gets tough? Usually I don't even notice. I try to go with the flow and just take it day by day not overthinking about something I cannot control.I try not to focus on things i cannot control however it has been tough with these huge changes. I had finally got an apartment in the city, after spending years at a community college to get here. I got to spend 3 weeks in my apartment before I had to go back home for coronavirus. While this has been a huge change mentally, knowing that i will graduate at home and be in my room for the next year studying. I am finding ways to challenge myself and maybe pick up a couple of new hobbies and skills."
