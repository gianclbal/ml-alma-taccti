2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,587,"I think that the subject or concept, electric field, is interesting and applies to everyday life. An electric field is the force a charge would feel at a certain location. The electric field is created by the charges themselves! For example, a positive charge creates a field pointing away from the charge, while a negative charge will create a field going away from the charge. An example of electric field and charges attracting or being repelled is lighting. Lighting is what we see during storms and although I have never been affected by lightning or had any close encounters with being struck, I have heard stories from other people. Lightning is the result of fast moving air sweeping negative charges up from the ground into a cloud. The ground then becomes positive and opposites attract. The air acts as an insulator (doesnt conduct heat well) and begins to ionize oxygen. A channel is created in the air and objects can become better conductors, so lightning chooses to go through objects that have positive charge in order to get to the positively charged ground. Question: How do you think you can trigger lightning in order to study it?Answer: Send something metal up into the sky (a rocket with wire attached to it), because metals are great conductors and lightning will choose to go through the easier path than the insulator (air) path. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,581,"Recently, we have been covering transverse waves and superposition. According to Google, superposition is “the action of placing one thing on or above another, especially so that they coincide”. Transverse waves are defined as “a wave vibrating at right angles to the direction of its propagation”. My question is “how does superposition relate to transverse waves?”  Ultimately, the bigger idea in response to this question is that superposition relates to transverse waves because, no matter what the size of the wave is, waves will interact with each other. The waves end up passing through each other and coming out without being disturbed. To find the displacement of these waves, we just add the total sum of the waves. Basically, waves add cumulatively to create a resultant wave. With the term superposition, the important part is that it is the action of placing one thing on or above another. Transverse waves mention a pulse that creates a wave by vibration into the direction of its propagation. These two relate because when more than one wave is created and they interact with each other, the transverse waves will interact, such as placing one thing on or above another, creating its overall displacement."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,584,"The question I have is is where do different colors come from.The different colors come from the different spectrums of light. Light can hit a surface and refract different colors that operate at different frequencies. The different frequencies and wavelengths correspond to a specific color in the visible light spectrum. The light that goes into a prism can be refracts outward as a different color. The light that hits a prism or lens is the light of or ray of incidence. The light that comes out the other end of a lens or prism is called the refracted light. And the center between the angel of incidence and angle of refraction is called the normal. As previously stated it is the line that divides the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction. The type of light that is spit out at the end of the lens or prism operates at a specific frequency and wavelength. This can determine whether or not it is relatively high or low in energy. Frequency is the number of times a wave closes the axis, the wavelength is the distance between two crestS. which are the curves above the axis and should to be confused with the troughs which are below the axis. If there is high frequency that means there is low wavelength and low energy. It is high energy is there is high wavelength and low frequency. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,583,"In Physics (both in Lecture and Lab), I learned a lot of things like magnetism, circuits, voltage, electric charge, electric fields, light, sound, interference, diffraction and even quantum physics. A good question for this journal could be ""how do sound waves work?"" Soundwaves work by vibrating air molecules in an undulating motion, and the equation for sound is lamda=v/f, lamda for wavelength, v for speed, and f for frequency. Obviously wavelength has an inverse relationship with frequency: as frequency increases, the wavelengths shortens, and when frequency decreases, the wavelengths stretch wider. That's how sound gets its pitch and even light gets its color. A third variable, amplitude, simply give the waves more pressure but never affects the wavelength or frequency. The sun's rays, UV light, stands for ultraviolet light. UV rays are infamous for being at the end of the color spectrum due to having the highest frequencies, and they can cause skin cancer. The color red, which has the lowest frequency and shortest wavelength, doesn't affect the human body that much and can be used in infrared sensors for TV remotes, radar, CDs and even Tamagotchis. For sound waves I've heard that very high frequencies can shatter glass."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,586,"One of my favourite topics that we talked about in lecture and it really correlates to reality is chapter 29 about relativity. In this chapter we talked about what is relativity, is it the same for everyone or it's different? And we talked about timeIs time the same to everyone? well, when time is stationary, time goes at the same pace as everyone, but if time undergoes through movement, this will cause time dilation where moving clocks run slower in time than stationary clocks. For instance, time is different when it's on Earth and in space. When an astronaut is travelling from Earth to a planet, Uranus, for instance, to their perspective, they will take only 4 years to reach. However, for the observer or NASA on Earth, it will take almost 20 years to see him reach Uranus. This shows that time runs slower in space than in Earth, and this can be known as time dilation. Another example can be length of a moving object. Motions are relative, it's based on who is the observer. If a stationary car is measured to be 5meters, when the car is moving, the car can be observed to be 2.5meters based on the movement of the car. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,582,"My family has really helped me navigate through a lot of my college experiences. They by far are my biggest motivation and support of college. Not only college, I work towards a successful future for family. My parents have done so much to get me where I am today and I wouldn’t want to make all their hard work for nothing. I am also their oldest child of three and for that reason I feel that I should set an example for my brothers. I feel like the biggest way I can return the favor to them is to do well and make them proud. Eventually, i’ll have a stable job in which I can save to provide for them when they get older. Not just for my brothers and parents but also my future partner and children. This is another big motivation for working towards a successful future because i’d want to provide a stable home and care for my children. Also I don’t want family to be an unstable environment in the future. Because school gets really stressful my family is always supporting me and understand that even when I don’t get the greatest grade, that I tried my best."
