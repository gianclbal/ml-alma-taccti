2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,586,"My family is my motivation to push myself into university and life honestly. When my father was young, he sacrificed everything he had in Malaysia and migrated to the United States to get a better education and a better future for his family, which lead me to here too. He put so much effort to build a family to where I am right now and that is my motivation. To also push me in a way that can give my parents back everything and spoil them. Their values are important to me and they always support in everything that I want to do. Without them, I wouldn't be where I am as I was raised in Malaysia for 19years of my life and my parents planned and organised everything to bring me to the US. I want to make sure I can provide the best life to my family in the future."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,583,"During the past four years of my college life my family handled my tuitions and prepared meals for me. And just before this semester started they helped me realize that it's impossible for me to get a degree in Biochemistry, but instead possible for me to switch to and graduate in Bio-Physiology (Biology with an interest in Physiology) given that I've already taken and passed many of the shared prerequisites. They cheered me up when I would lose confidence like after failing tests, missing due dates or simply feeling depressed, gave me advice and ideas on writing answers, and suggested that I take some extra tutoring and avoid doing distracting habits like procrastinating. My family has a very hardworking background: my dad's a CPA with his own office in Noriega; I'm not sure what Mom's job is, but she's sometimes a realtor and an interpreter; my sister attends UC Berkeley but I'm not sure what her major is."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,584,"The values of my community/family have helped navigate college by instilling within me the desire to first want a degree. They helped me realize the importance of hard work and utilizing the resources and opportunities that are available. It isn't enough to work hard, a person must be able to work smart by maintain good time management skills. Of which, I am not exactly the greatest. I still struggle with time management. But it is something that I am working on, and will continue to work on. Physics, Science, and Chemistry, I find these subjects to be a very labor intensive process. In order to do well, I have to put in the time to carefully understand the material. Currently I am working on doing just that. Other than teaching me the value of hard work, I fin that my family hasn’t helped me in navigating through college, because at the end of the day, college is both a social and solitary experience. Social in the sense we are communicating with professors and fellow peers to a certain extent, however it is very solitary in the sense that I’ve found necessary information isn’t really presented to students in the right way. Just last semester learned that we have certain services available to us students. This includes but is not limited to, the students association, carp/lac tutoring, a school provided therapist. All these resources are not widely shared, and I feel like college is more of getting to know your institution first and how everything works before any real academics can start. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,581,"My family values have helped guide me through college by teaching me to be strong and push through each and every challenge that crosses my path. A lot of my family went to college but majored in things other than what I am studying. My family looks at the topics I cover in class and gets too overwhelmed. She tells me to keep pushing, but “she could never do” what I am doing. My family supports me, but they support from a distance. They just tell me to do my best. Because my family either did not go to college or studied something unrelated to what I am learning in college, they do not really understand it and kind of avoid talking about it. It is always “just do your best”, but I guess that’s some pretty solid support. My grandma always wanted me to go to college and I feel like I am doing this for her and I. She and my great grandpa always had a goal for me to become a doctor and like a rebellious kid, I said I never wanted to be one. After going to college for a few years, I realized how interested I was in the human body and its functions. They were the beginning point of my values and taught me to push myself as a child which carries me through life."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,580,"Well my family has helped me a lot through college, to try to keep my mental health on check, i dont want do this "
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,587,"I have navigated through college all on my own. I would say my own values and ambition have brought me here. I am the first in my family to attend college and no one told me too, so it has been my own personal journey. Being my own personal journey, I have been able to take my time, choose my pace, and choose my entire life. This is a freedom that I am grateful for, but it being completely on my own has its challenges. These challenges include not having a mentor or personal guidance, but these challenges made me stronger and more wise. It makes me hope that one day i can be a mentor or be someone that I wish I had to someone else. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,582,"My family has really helped me navigate through a lot of my college experiences. They by far are my biggest motivation and support of college. Not only college, I work towards a successful future for family. My parents have done so much to get me where I am today and I wouldn’t want to make all their hard work for nothing. I am also their oldest child of three and for that reason I feel that I should set an example for my brothers. I feel like the biggest way I can return the favor to them is to do well and make them proud. Eventually, i’ll have a stable job in which I can save to provide for them when they get older. Not just for my brothers and parents but also my future partner and children. This is another big motivation for working towards a successful future because i’d want to provide a stable home and care for my children. Also I don’t want family to be an unstable environment in the future. Because school gets really stressful my family is always supporting me and understand that even when I don’t get the greatest grade, that I tried my best."
