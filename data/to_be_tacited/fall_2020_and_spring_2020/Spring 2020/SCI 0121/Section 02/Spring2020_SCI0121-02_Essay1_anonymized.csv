Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,580,"Why am I here in general? Or why am I in this class?  I am in this lab class to finish my lower division courses for my cell biology major. I do not like physics that much but I’m do enjoy doing experiments. I’m also in this college so i can hopefully graduate with a degree and go to medical school to become a dermatologist, like Dr, Pimple Popper. I want to open my own practice in San Francisco and to make people feel good about themselves."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,581,"Frankly, I am here because I need help in this class and I want to be successful in my classes. This semester is much more stressful than last semester, so I need these SCI classes in order to help me understand the material and be able to utilize what I learn. Because these are all lower division classes, I am holding myself to a higher standard and I want to increase my knowledge. SCI usually gives me tips, tricks, and a lot of practice for what I need to know to succeed. I’m in SCI because I need the tools to help me graduate and do my very best. School is hard enough as it is, but having SCI is something that we cannot take for granted as we only have so many classes they are available for. I am here because I want to do well and move on into my career path with confidence."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,582,"The reason I am here today is to strengthen my education as a biology major. Originally I didnot think that I would survive physics and I didn’t for lecture but now here I am in Physics 2. Inall honesty if I had the choice to be taking physics 2 I really wouldn’t. Physics doesn’t click to methe way it does to others. I also heard that physics 2 is a lot more conceptual so I’m a bit moreat ease. I’m taking this class currently to fulfill my prerequisites and my major requirements. Allin all I don’t think the class should be too bad. At the end of the day, I still hope to leave thisclass with some helpful information. Whether it&#39;s for my future biology classes or just in life. Ialso hope to pass the. Class with a b or higher but we will see about that. I’m taking a sci classso I hope that class will give me a better foundation."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,583,"Why am I here (Sci 121 and San Francisco State University)? I'm here in Sci 121 because I need help with Physics 121 and its lab class Phys 122, which focus on electricity like electric fields, electric potential, voltage, current, batteries and magnetism. Sci 121 is also a good class for me because it fits my schedule and I can get free help like packets, tutoring and exam previews for one extra credit. Meanwhile, I'm here in SFSU because I want to graduate with a Biology degree with an interest in Physiology (I'm a senior but I may need one extra year), and Phys 121 and 121 are my last lower-division prerequisites I need to fulfill so I can unlock more higher-division classes. The campus is also very close to my house so I can live off-campus and stay closer to my family, especially now that my grandfather requires in-home support."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,584,"Why Am I HereI am here to gain the skills I need to pass the Physics portion of the MCAT and enter Medical School. My goal is to become a surgeon, either Cardio or General Surgery. The reason I desire to go to Medical School is because I feel that it is what I meant to do. It is apart of my identity, and it allows me to connect with a piece the piece of humanity I thought I had once lost. In a lot of ways, I guess, my intentions for wanting to become a surgeon are a little selfish. I desire to help others, because in a way it helps me become a better person. To grow, to feel, to care, be apart of something that is far bigger than myself. Taking this course is a first step to understanding the intricacies of the world we live in, which will help me grow as an individual. I just hope I can pull it off. I also want to get a better educations, get a better job, preferably one with advancement opportunities. I also want a job that I love, and this is a first step in that particular direction. When I do apply for medical school, I also plan to earn an associate’s degree in surgical technology, so that even if I don’t get in, I’ll have something to fall back on, and add to my application for when I reapply."
