2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,581,"I want to go into my major because I have always had a passion for science, especially involved in human anatomy. Originally, I wanted to go into the emergency medical technician field, but that was not a reasonable choice for my future. I chose biology with a concentration in physiology because I am interested in the build up of the body and how each part of the body works. The human body is so complex and understanding it takes a lot of practice and desire to learn. I plan on using my major to become a physicians assistant and hopefully work in a small office along side a general physician. My grandpa was a physician and I have always had a great admiration for him and his work. He was very much respected in our family and ultimately, I would like to make him and the rest of my family proud of my work. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,586,"I want to go into my major is because I'm so invested in class when we learn about the movements of substances or hormones or even how the chemical reactions work in our body. It's so interesting and my plan with this major is to get into medical school. In the beginning, I wasn't a 100% sure as it's a lot of time needed to be sacrificed, and it's going to be really stressful as there's going to be a lot of processes. However, I realised it's something I want to do is because every time someone asks me what I'm going to do, the first image that always pops into my head is to be a doctor or a consultant in medicine. That's when I realise that this is the only thing I want to do. I love biochemistry as my major but I can never really see myself in doing research and being the labs constantly, therefore, I feel like the medical field, or even consultation is what I really want, and that's why I'm pursuing this major to see if I'm prepared for medical school."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,582,"I want to go into the STEM field because I have always been interested in science. For the longest time i’ve always loved science. In elementary school science was my favorite subject and I was always eager to go to school just for science class. Till this day my science classes are my favorite to attend. Although they are the toughest classes, I still enjoy learning new information and gaining new concepts. I also chose the STEM field to get me prepared for my future career. I eventually want to become a Physician's Assistant or anything in the medical field that allows me to work with patients. I’ve always knew I wanted to work with people as I grew older. Originally I wanted to become general practitioner however that requires medical school and a lot of money. Physicians assistants do about the same and still get paid pretty well. I like that physicians assistants get to work with different specialities also. I feel that the STEM field prepares me and allows me to gain the knowledge that I would need to get to where I want to be. It will provide me with all the necessary information to become a physician's assistant."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,584,"The reason I wanted to go into my major was to gain a better understanding of what it is I was missing. I originally entered SFSU and finished my political science major and realized why not try a different major. In high school, I found myself to be traumatized by the field of science, and thought that anyone who did well was just naturally gifted, and that any amount of work I put in wasn't going to be enough. I remember my Junior Year of high school I was in AP Biology and I was studying harder than I've ever studied. Writing lab reports that I would give to my brother to check to see if it was done correct;y. because he was in college doing the same thing basically. He thought it was perfect, and every time I went to turn something in, I would never score higher than either a C or a D. And I was like, what is this. It basically killed my nascent love for the science very early. After that, I took an aptitude test and found a new love for dissecting mystery novels. It is then I was drawn towards the field of law. It was interesting,because a lot of what made up law was learning how to think, and how to dissect information which I genuinely loved. And to this day I still love that aspect of the field. Once I finished, I thought I would feel something, like a sense of accomplishment. And to some extent I did, but I also felt like my work was not done. That I was only halfway there. So I decided to take a step back to try and figure out what was going on. It is then I realized, yes I am an individual with an array of talents, and interests. But getting involved in political science didn't really give me what I wanted. In all honesty it felt like a glorified history major. A major hindsight, I really didn't care for. It was okay, but not what I was meant to do. The field of law still interests me, but my real love is people, and the desire to help through surgery. Because that was my original love when I was in high school. The reason I didn't major in a science class was because my first experience was traumatic, my brother and friends were always telling me horror stories about their experiences. In a lot of ways I felt like I was running away because I didn't want to fail.After taking a semester and this being my second semester, I understand the fear, but I don't let it get to me that much. Belief in self is one of the things I had to learn, because most of my life has been filled with anxiety and questioning myself to a very destructive degree. This major is a gateway to my overall goal. Medical School. And I just hope to god I can get there. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,587,"i am a physiology major and i want to go into medicine and maybe public health. I want to go to medical school and eventually become a doctor. Health and healing is such a big part of my life and i really bothers me that not everyone has access to such a vital part of our well being. I do believe our healthcare system can be changed, it just takes the right leaders and I hope to be able to help and reach a multitude of people. I believe that more people from my background need to be represented in medicine, so this is also a big reason I am headed in this direction. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,583,"My major used to be Biochemistry, but just at the start of this semester I swapped it for Bio-Physiology (Biology with an interest in Physiology). I want to take Bio-Physiology because while I'm very good in Biology, Chemistry was just too damn hard for me (I already had to redo some classes and I still failed to reach the prerequisites), and ultimately I'm very interested in Physiology, which is about the human body like DNA (I still need to utilize Chemistry like bonds for that), the digestive system, the immune system, cardiology, the brain, how the cell works, cancer, genetics, etc. I managed to get into Bio-Physio because many of its prerequisites (which I got at least a C- on) were the same as Biochemistry, so I was quickly able to attend some of the higher tiers. I want to get a degree in Bio-Physiology and become a doctor and discover how to fight cancer and genetic disorders."
