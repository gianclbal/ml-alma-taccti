2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,582,"When life gets challenging I tend to let it get to me at times. I’ve been told that I stress myself more than anything else. It’s really difficult at these moments because I begin to get really anxious and it’s hard to carry on with my life/ responsibilities. Many times when I do manage to deal with my challenges, I get myself to the gym where I can release my stress. Once I get my workout in, I go home to make a meal for brain food, and then i’d put together a list of things I need to get done by importance. Usually my workout makes me feel better about myself and I feel more on top of my work with these steps. Most of the time through my challenges, I feel like the world is closing in on my but I motivate myself to get things done. I like to look back and think of all the other challenges that I have already overcome. Once I manage to get past my new challenges I feel even better and as if a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. This is my motivation to get things done and persevere past my hardships."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,583,"The challenges that typically happen in my life can be when I can't solve my homework, gotta study for my exams, fix mistakes, etc. When life gets challenging I would usually hesitate because I think it's a waste of my time or assume it would make things worse, but my experience in life clearly proved I shouldn't do that anymore, and instead tackle and solve them."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,585,"What I Do When Life Gets Challenging:I do several things when life gets challenging. Usually the first thing I do is take deep breaths. In the past, I have suffered from anxiety and as overly simplistic and dumb as it sounds, taking several deep breaths really helps to ground me. Taking deep breaths forces me to focus on a single simple task which not only forces my heart rate to slow but also distracts me for a few seconds from whatever is causing the stress. While these few seconds don’t remove the problem or the anxiety surrounding the problem, it does demonstrate to my body and mind that whatever the issue, it can not be so terrible because I am still breathing in and out. The next thing I do after breathing is call my mom. My mother and I are extremely close and I relie on her pretty heavily. Whenever there is something that is challenging, she is always the first to hear of it. SPeaking with her not only calms me down but allows me a finite space and time to process and freak out. It is also a good space to work through and discuss the issue. My mother is the ultimate “doer” and is always ready to breakdown a situation in order to find solutions. She is always the person I turn to, rain or shine, when I have even the smallest of problems. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,581,"When life gets challenging, I tend to sit back and force myself to take a look at the bigger picture. I need to pause and reflect on what is going on. It is important to look at each thing that is happening, then one by one, conquer each of them, if possible. It helps to make a to-do list, even if it is just for small things like rearranging a binder. Other than that, it is important to take time for yourself. We need to take a break and evaluate how we feel before it gets to be too intense. With that, we need some selfcare to make sure we can perform to the best of our ability. Taking a minute out of every day to focus on your breathing can help. When life gets challenging, it is important to pause, reflect, and react in a proper manner that benefits you."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,2,584,"When life gets challenging I begin to have a million thoughts running through my head. I then begin to freak out, and panic. However, over the years I've learned to deal with such afflictions. I first get something to eat and relax for about thirty minutes. Then, I start to make a list of what needs to be done, what I need to learn/overcome and then make a plan to accomplish the task. To accomplish the task I either communicate with my professor for clarification, use tutoring services, or contact a peer. Then when I have all the materials I need at my disposal I begin to work undisturbed until the task is complete. Should challenges still persist, then I go for a one on one session with a tutor or professor. Or I contact a SCI 121 professor for advice. Every semester I always try to have as many resources available, so that challenges become minor obstacles instead of problems. Thus reducing my level of stress/anxiety. I also talk with several other resources like my professor for physics to work out a plan if my original study plan is not working. For example, I was faced with the challenge of having my SCI 121 course not correlated with my instructors lesson plan. It was difficult, and currently I am working on a study plan with my SCI 121 facilitators to remedy any inconsistencies in my understanding of the material. "
