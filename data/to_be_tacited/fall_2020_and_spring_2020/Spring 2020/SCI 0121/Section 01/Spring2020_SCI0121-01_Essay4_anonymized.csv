2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,572,"I learned that when two electron are faced together they will repel each other, and the same thing for protons. Only a proton and an electron will attract each other, opposite attract. This has helped society in many ways because it is the basis for electricity. In class we went over a circuit and how electron travel through to generate the power we need from turning on a light bulb to lighting up our christmas decorations."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,578,"One thing I found interesting was concave lenses and convex lenses. Mirrors and lenses were actually very interesting to learn about because you look at a mirror every day and do not even think about how it was created or about its refraction or reflection. Even with glasses, my mother wears glasses for everything, she has really bad eyesight. what she does not know is that those glasses have lenses created to see in whatever she needs to see. Concave lenses are for faraway objects that are blurry or nearsighted based in myopia where the light can not focus on the retina. Concave lenses help reduce refraction and lengthens the focal point. while convex lens helps with farsight, with a converging lens which will refract light before it enters the eye. This can also be called hyperopia, where people need to squint to see nearby objects. convex is a round outward while concave is round inward. These both can be used for many different things other than glasses. They can be used for things like cameras or microscopes. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,576,"Class wise I am completely lost moving to online lecture for science classes can be very challenging. Lost might be the wrong word here its more of an overwhelming feeling I do enjoy our mirror and reflection labs we have been currently doing.  These labs would be a great to do in real life/ in person. I do not really have any questions, any questions I do have I always ask my teacher and he is able to break down and explain what is going on. The feeling lost feeling come from social isolation and an extra obstacle  in the ability to communicate and have face to face contact/ connection. Mirrors , lenses and reflection are used in our daily lives all the time from waking up in the morning and getting ready for our day . We use them in our cars to get to work and much much more. We use lenses almost everywhere as well. My favorite use for a lens would have to be the telescope we can see crazy far distances into space just by bending a lens to a certain degree and amount like that concept is amazing. We can also bend lasers and refract an refrain them anyway we want."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,579,"One topic that I really enjoyed this semester was learning about circuits. One key piece of information that was important to comprehend is that circuits can both be used in series or in parallel. One way to calculate values for circuits is by using Ohm's Law; which indicates that current is proportional to voltage. Formula includes; V=IR, where V is voltage calculated in volts, I is current calculated in amps, and R is resistance calculated in ohms. Additionally, we can use P=IV, where power is calculated in watts. Rules when working in circuits include, the more obstacles in the circuit, the less current there is and vice versa, the more paths there are in a circuit, the more current there is.Concept for real life applications includes household circuits and household appliances, where appliances are wired in parallel.Application: We can observe that wiring, as well as what is connected to a circuit is very important.For example, if we have a circuit breaker rated 20A, and if we connect many appliances to our circuit and our current total exceeds the 20A value, then that means a circuit can trip. When wiring is done correctly and a circuit breaker can withhold amps used by household items, our appliances can run smoothly, If not, the breaker can trip and our appliances wouldn't work properly."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,577,"There are many types of lenses, but two main ones are converging lenses and diverging lenses. Converging lenses have rays that pass through a focal point and are convex. On the other hand, diverging lenses tend to be concave and its rays ""seem"" to come form a focal point. Lenses consist of magnification, distances and focal lengths. In real life, people uses lenses for many different reasons. The most known reason are for glasses and contacts. Some people cannot see from far away or can't focus their eyes to read up close. That's when you need lenses to see things with more clarity. The images seem to appear closer or farther away depending of the type of lenses you are using. "
