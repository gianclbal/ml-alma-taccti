2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,577,"I tend to give up easily when situations don’t favor me, and I leave it all to the side. But I’ve learned that’s not right. I have to keep trying till the end. I consider myself as a strong person, but I will not speak up when I need to. I listen to all the bad things that are happening, but don’t do anything about it. I do try to have a positive mindset that things will get better, yet I don’t do anything to reach that goal of things getting better. I do not know if it makes sense. I’m just trying to be a better persona and I hope with challenging situations I will learn my way. For now, I’m not giving up academically, even though I hate online classes. I will keep moving on."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,576,"When life gets challenging, there are several things I do. My favorite thing to do is remember how far I have come in life and the adversity I have already faced. Most of the time I have endured worse in one way or another. I enjoy meditation and smoking marijuana when I am feeling overwhelmed with life. Persistence and positivity are my driving forces to reach my goals.  I remember one of my teachers saying “keep on trying even if it gets hard and you need to go at a slower pace. I'd rather be forty five and a doctor rather than forty five and not a  doctor”. Her telling me this made me not fear failure, and it really stuck with me. Anything can be accomplished with the right amount of time. One of my all time favorite quotes is “Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass. It’s about learning how to dance in the rain”. I feel as if this quote directly correlates to our prompt (what do I do when life gets challenging) and the quote to me means, you don’t allow anything to deter you from reaching your full potential. You don't just wait for bad things in your life to go away, instead, you have a positive attitude and take challenges head on and enjoy the journey. At the end of the day when all is said and done just try your best, and remember the journey is usually the best part !"
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,574,"Angela Orellana - SanchezApril 9,2020When life gets challenging, I start to read to try to get my mind distracted. As of right now I have been reading the bible and a book named creative transformation by John David Garcia. That has been my life saver but I will have to say it, when all of the nonsense gets to me and I can't seem to go anywhere to hide from it but to cope with it. I go for a run and not just for a regular run, I go run the hills and I start air punching the floor or the sky to let out all my frustrations out. It is frustrating and upsetting when you can't do anything in this world for your family and friends. When you know you are only 22 years old and your level of intellectual knowledge is not at it's peek and you know for a fact that no one will take you seriously because you aren't in this ""mature level"" where they can take you seriously. Its frustrating but in the mean time I will work hard on myself where I know one day I will get to that point where people will start to take me seriously. In any case when life does get challenging, I start to focus on how to better myself so that I can overcome such challenges like this because this isn't knew to me at all. this is only another obstacle in life that we all must overcome and how we get overcome it is up to us.  "
