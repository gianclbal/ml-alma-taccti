2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,576,"My family values that I have grown up with are to work hard, dream big, never stop learning, always give back and never give up.The way I was raised is also a very big part of my values, I was told you can truly achieve anything if you put everything you got into it nothing is unachievable. These are values instilled in me since birth that have helped me prepare for college. I have such a supportive, loving and committed family. We love each other unconditionally, we are always there for one another. We have traveled the world together and have been through every up and down in life together. I know they will always be there for me to encourage  and support me. As far as my community, I grew up in San Diego where I went to the same elementary, middle and high school with all of my friends. My Clairemont roots in San Diego gives me a sense of obligation to lead and be a positive role model and to help build and guide my city into the future ahead. I value and treasure my relationships with my family, friends and community. They are my building blocks of love, growth and blessed to call my heart and home."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,578,"the values of my family have helped through college because they all support me to do the right thing and succeed in whatever I decide to do. Few people in my family have been to college but none of graduated, so the pressure is on me to succeed and actually get my degree.  my family is not a bit complicated but the people who support me actually support. these are the people that would go to my games and graduations. They know I can succeed because they have seen what I am capable of. Without my family, I do not know where I would be today, probably not here writing this. I am grateful to them because I have seen what not getting a degree looks like I don't want to have a job that I don't like I want to have a career. I want to wake up every day thinking I can't wait to go to work. Also to come home talking about what amazing things I did at work. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,572,"My values have taught me to never give up, because giving up will always leaving you wondering ""what if"" and that's a horrible feeling to have. Although growing up my family did not really give value to a girl being educated, I knew for myself that I did not just want to be another housewife who sat at home all day cooking and cleaning. I think what influenced me most was watching TV, especially shows like ER and Grey's Anatomy that had strong female doctors. That really motivated me to pursue my dream of becoming a doctor even if all the odds were stacked against me. I literally did not even have a high school diploma, but through hard work I made it to SFSU."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,574,"Angela Orellana-SanchezSci- physics In my family college is extremely important. School comes first and given that all of my uncles and aunties graduated from college, they were considered first generation, you can imagine how competitive my cousins are. My mom comes from 8 siblings and they all went to UCLA and had children ( cousins). Most of my cousins went to IVY leagues. However, in my immediate family, my father (UC San Diego) engineering assistant, brother ( UC Davis ) biomedical engineer, big sister (Johns Hopkins) physician, since we are involved in the sciences.. I always had a hard time catching up. There is  a lot of pressure to be the best in our family and at times it has taken a toll but none of the less, having a loving family is important and I believe because of my parents philosophy of how to bring up children comes from a much more loving alternative and not so controlling. I have managed to feel comfortable enough to be proud of how I have managed myself through college.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,579,"Many of the values I hold close to me and practice on a daily basis derive from both my family and my community.When I speak about community, I see many people I've known throughout the years: neighbors, childhood friends, regulars around the neighborhood. We all may come from our own home towns, but our community is tight-knit and we see each other as family.The values our family and community have can be traced to a Mayan phrase ""In Lak'ech"", which translates to ""I am you and You are me"". This phrase holds much value, as it depicts how we should not only treat ourselves, but how we should treat one another. If I hurt you, I hurt myself. If I treat you with love and respect, I treat myself with love and respect. If you're hurting, I'm hurting. And if you're celebrating and rejoicing, I too am celebrating and rejoicing. It is like holding up a mirror and seeing yourself in others, and understanding one another on a deeper level.This value is important to me as I've always had a difficult time finding partners to study with, or friends I can confide with on an intellectual level regarding school and coursework. Studying by oneself is often difficult, and especially in STEM field, one can find themselves lost and inundated with difficult material to cover. But once one finds their study group and friends, the material and subject matter seem more manageable. If I understand a concept, I can help you understand that concept. If you understand a concept, help me understand that concept as well. Often times school is seen as a competition, when in actuality, school should be seen as a place for growth and learning where we could all help one another out to be successful academics."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,577,"My family has always been there for me and want the best from me. They have worked hard to get me an education and didn't expect to worry about much except to have good grades in school. They have motivated me to keep educating myself and I want to pay them back with having a degree and getting a stable life for them. My mom is my greatest example of not giving up because she was a mother and father figure to me and we lived through tough financial situations, yet that didn't stop her to getting me where I am today and having the basics like food, house, and health. I live in a Latino community where there is so much resources that will help you reach whatever goal that you have. I am grateful for the programs that dedicate their lives to help underrepresented students to apply to college and plan their future. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,573,"The values I have from my community and family have not only helped me navigate through college but also everyday life. When you begin college you are entering a whole different world in comparison to how it was in high school and junior high. You have to now learn to navigate through the campus and the city especially if you move far away from home. When I first started college as a freshman, I was both excited and scared because you begin to make decisions on your own where your parents can’t always help you make them but only guide you through it with support. The values I have gotten from my family have been to never give up on myself especially when times get tough and to always remember where I came from and what is my goal in life. Since I decided to go to a college that is hours away from my home, it has been a bit of a challenge trying to navigate all the responsibilities that come from living on my own. I also haven’t been able to go visit my family back home, but they every so often call to ask me how I’m doing and tell me that they are proud me. The people in my community that I have built around me at SFSU have been very supportive in helping me get through my years in college a bit easier. They have been great in helping me organize my classes around my schedule to help me better finish school in time and with less stress."
