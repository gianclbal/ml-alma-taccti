2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,578,"I wanted to go into my major because science to me was always fun I was the top of it every semester since I was a kid. I have always thought that science was the most fascinating subject, I didn't like math that much, I hated history. With science, you can see so many different possibilities and discover endless amounts of wonders. I knew I wanted to something like this since high school and biology was the way to go. One because once I graduate with this degree I can pursue anything I wanted to. I can go to medical school and be a doctor to help save people in ways maybe other people can not do. My major makes me happy and it brings me peace, there is no other major I would want to do. I may not be knowing what I am doing half of the time but I know if I keep pushing I will make it. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,572,"I want to go into my major because I find it fascinating and interesting to learn about the makeup of the cell and all their little parts. I also want to use my major to be able to apply to medical school, in order to hopefully one day become a doctor."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,576,"I want to go into the STEM field because I am currently a nurse and would like to broaden my knowledge.  I enrolled here at San Francisco State University to achieve a degree in MicroBiology, so that I can apply to Medical School. My long term goal is to volunteer for Doctors Without Borders, helping the underprivileged would be a great blessing in my life. I hope to inspire others to take action as well . I want to travel the globe with them and help save as many lives as possible. I find science and medicine extremely interesting. I come from a family of nurses and doctors and have always appreciated what they do. Volunteering for Doctors Without Borders will allow me to fulfill my love for travel, science and service. I would like to focus my studies in the field of neuroscience, I find the brain to be extremely fascinating. It's still the most unknown topic of the human body!!! Maybe I can help with the creation of an effective Alzheimer's medication or deterint. My studies at SFSU have driven my passion for knowledge even more. The more I learn the more I wish to achieve higher education. I got the drive to apply for medical school from working."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,579,"My initial reason for going into my major, (Cellular and Molecular Biology), was to understand underlying metabolic conditions within communities where health disparities and comorbitities are more prevalent, and study them in a manner in which I can understand them on the cellular and molecular scale so I can understand what is going inside the body, and how it interacts with internal/external influences/stimulus/ingestion/digestion. With my major, I want to become a Family Medicine MD, but I'm also leaning towards a route in Public Health studies, and seeing how I can use my major to solve of the complex health disparities our communities face. Overall, with my major, I'd like to help the greater community become empowered with knowledge, and be able to have choices/options when it comes to their health. Often in underserved communities, there isn't much help in preventative medicine, and there isn't knowledge shared in a way different communities can understand. With my major, I hope to effectively communicate underlying health complications, so community members can make plans pre/current/post any sort of medical procedure/treatment."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,574,"Angela Orellana-SanchezSci- PhysicsMy goal from college is to major in biochemistry and minoring in computer science possibly double major in sexual studies. I love chemistry and I am hoping to getting into medical school. I am majoring in biochemistry because it's fun to do calculations and it keeps me up on my toes. I love the challenge and how it makes me better myself as a student and as an individual in general. It is exciting to know that I am always going to be doing calculations. Also in a way it makes you live in the moment, in the now. I always wondered why biology is so much memorization and why it's always repetitive if science is constantly evolving and transforming, it is boring where as biochemistry you learn about your body but through calculations. that is exciting.  You get to know more of both worlds but combined. I have a headache. In any case that is why I want to study chemistry."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,577,"I actually do not know why out of all the choices in science I picked biochemistry, but I know I want to go to medicine school. Two of the subjects I prefer are math and science and they have been my stronger subjects so I guess that's why I took a path in science. In reality though, I do not want to work in a laboratory nor research. I want to become an O.B.G.Y.N. and I know for a fact I need to take some sort of science as an undergrad. I would like to work with infants and mothers and make their live path a little easier by assisting them in their needs. My major consists in putting in a lot of work and I would like to demonstrate to myself that I am capable of finishing a challenging career path to create a mentality that all things are possible. Biochemistry is teaching me the basics of life science and by understanding where we come from biologically and experimenting with organic components, I can transmit a better response to the people I will be working with in the future. "
