Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,572,I am here because I want to get the best possible grade for physics that I can. I feel like this will force me to review physics concepts in a timely manner instead of cramming everything taught night before. Also this helps relieve the stress of physic.
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,573,"I am taking this Sci 215 class because I feel that it would be great to receive more assistance in understanding the concepts taught in the lectures. I think because the facilitators are students who took the class prior really helps because they can help us in improving our study skills. I have taken other Sci classes and I have noticed that I do better when I have more than one person helping me break down the concept to really learn how to do the problems on my own. In taking a physics class which has never been my best subject, but I always want to try my best in understanding the concept so I can do good my test and exams. The worksheets we are given are like a sample test where it tests on what we know or need help on. I like working in group best I like to compare my answers to others, but also help other understand the concepts as well. I feel that working in groups help you find what mistakes you are doing when studying for a test or solving a specific Physics problem. We are all here to help each other pass the lecture class of physics 121."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,574,"Angela Orellana -SanchezI am here because I want to get better at my chemistry, I want to start understanding it more verses just knowing how to make it and just getting the grade. After all my major is Biochemistry and if I can not understand the simple foundations of it then I how can I overcome the most difficult parts of chemistry. I want to understand the equilibrium , reactions, and products... when it shifts to the right, when it shifts to the left.  Also after my quiz on chemistry 216, I realized that I have to practice more and more and I am lacking in the stichometry when I shouldn't have been lacking at all. This weekend I plan to start reading the book and taking down notes . I also would like to be more Aleks if it will help me and that way I can stay knowing the foundation. Honestly the Kahoot really put me in bad spirits but also put me in hopes because now I know what I need to learn. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,575,"I am here in PHYS 121 and PHYS 122 Lab to finish my requirement classes for my Astronomy Minor at San Francisco State University. I am here because I wanted to take on an astronomy minor since I love learning about the planets and stars of our universe. Taking Physics 121 and 122 is the second level of my physics requirement to complete my minor. I would say I am not the fondest in the field of Physics, but some topics really do interest me and it does help me learn how the universe and planets work while studying my astronomy minor. I never was the most science-knowledged person in my classes, nor do I see myself getting a physics career, however Astronomy always makes me feel like there is hope, happiness and interest in my life. Astronomy shares the unknown with me, and the beauty as well as the danger it holds beyond our Earth. Having a Graphic Designer major, the two would think not to go well together, but I believe that they do go hand in hand with each other. I believe that I can make something out of an artistic field and a scientific field, bringing something new to the table, I just do not know what that would be yet. I am here because I want to show the world after college that Astronomy is an amazing and fascinating thing to learn about, showing people through my artwork and graphic design skills why Astronomy is important to me and why it should be important to others"
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,576,"I am taking a SCI helper class to better understand what I am learning in class. I am taking both a Physics-121 SCI course and Chemistry-215 SCI course. I enjoy it because it is forced studying in a productive manner. I forgot where I read this, but many educators say for every unit you take you should be studying one hour per unit your class is worth. I am taking sixteen units therefore I should be studying sixteen hours a week. These SCI classes will help me accomplish that through, making myself accountable to go to class each week and get extra help. It is amazing review and reflection time on what we just learned in class. It also gives you an opportunity to ask any questions that you have, that you were unable to ask in class due to time. I also like hearing from different people on how they are learning the material because it might also help me. It is very helpful to have someone in the same shoes as you, since you are taking the class together it is a much better time to get to know your class mates and forum study groups. So far from the first three weeks / four weeks of class I have gotten A’s on all my quizzes given in my main classes thanks to my SCI helper classes. I do not regret taking these classes at all, actually I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to take these classes."
2020,Spring,SCI 0121,SI,1,577,"I am here because I have failed my second semester of physics because I didn’t learn anything. I knew I needed help, but I was too shy to ask people for help. I’ve done most of my stuff on my own and I felt I was capable of overcoming everything alone, but I guess not. I want to learn, so I am here to get supplemental help. I am also here because I know Physics will be part of the MCAT, so I definitely need to learn it and reflect it on the test. "
