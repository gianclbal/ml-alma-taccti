2020,Spring,SCI 0220,SI,1,645,"I want to go into the civil engineering field because that is where modern construction lies. I want to be an engineer, however I feel the title may be beyond what I am after. For me, a degree in engineering and in STEM will give me more insight for a construction career that can be promising and innovative. I have always known that I want to go into sustainable construction and while that might now sound like engineering or research, becoming a civil engineer is the right route for me to take. Not only do I want to do construction but I want to be good at it, I want to inspire and make new things with a purpose so that I can be innovative. That is why I am studying engineering, so I can take what I learn and better apply it to the construction industry. "
