2020,Spring,SCI 0220,SI,1,445,"I think there were many values of my community and family that helped me navigate through college. For example, my middle school was more of a college preparatory where they wanted to teach us and get us more ready for high school and college. I was also in a summer program that had the same focus of trying to teach us more than normal schools. For my family, they didn’t really finish college so my brother and I are kind of the first ones that are going to finish college. My brother attends UC Merced and is about to graduate this semester while I’m on my second year so I also have my brother to guide me through college whenever I ask for help."

2020,Spring,SCI 0220,SI,1,645,"My family is the main reason I am in university. From a young age it was assumed that me and all of my sisters would each obtain a degree from a 4 year institution. My parents work in education and so that has also been a big influence on mine because I have always been surrounded by learning whether that be school or at home. In high school my dad would always tell me, “it does not matter where you go to college, just that you go.”  I always liked those words from him because in a way, it took off some pressure to apply/get into a top prestigious school. Out of all the kids, I am the only one to not attend a UC school however that honestly doesn’t mean much to me. I am happy at SF State and am on a path to success with an engineering major.  My family values education and learning and that is a driving force in me. I am also raised to work based on completion, in other words to do all my work start to finish before playing. “Work hard play hard” is my philosophy on education because hard work deserves a reward upon completion. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0220,SI,1,646,"How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?  My greatest influence from my family has been, hands down (or rather ‘hands together’ for applause) is my significant other, Claudia. She has been my moral support, financial aid (she helps with my rent, so I don’t need two jobs.  Allowing me time needed for attending class and studying) and at times the audience I need to bounce ideas or my written essays off of. She does this because she realizes graduating is important to me, not because anything I’m studying is sure to benefit her in the long run.So, in essence, I guess the greatest values that have contributed to my character, in regard to my navigating through college are perseverance, patience, empathy and support. I’ll be 50 years old  in a few short months. Let’s face it, expecting a career to change the course of my life at this juncture is a bit far-fetched. Yet, finishing what I started back in 1991, in hopes of making some career changes because of a CS diploma is paramount.  Everyday I struggle mentally and often doubt myself and my ability to keep up academically with all the younger generation of classmates. I’m working on that. But for now, I remind myself, graduation isn’t tomorrow, class is. Show up for that.  Stay committed and exercise patience, eventually, graduation will be tomorrow."
