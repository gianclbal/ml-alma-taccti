Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0220,SI,1,445,I am here at San Francisco State University because I want to get my degree for Mechanical Engineering. I chose to take Mechanical Engineering because I have always liked cars and modifying cars even though i do not own a car of my own. I chose to attend San Francisco State University because it is closest to home other than City College and I went to school right next to State at Lowell High School. I didn't want to be too far from home and stay at home with my family to save some money.
2020,Spring,SCI 0220,SI,1,644,"I am here because I need to get better at math and get a better understanding so A) I don't fail the class and B) So I can have for fun with it when I encounter this type of the future instead of blatant frustration. The current math teachers are frustrating but they are the top brass and if I need to advance in my career and life, I really need to learn from these guys or I am not going to get anywhere. I don't really like going to tutors mainly because they have a different teaching style from other teachers and they usually confuse me more with a complex subject like math, but I need more time with the material and this is the next best thing, so ..... here I am."
2020,Spring,SCI 0220,SI,1,645,"I am here in the PHYS 222 lab because it is an additional requirement for the lecture. Beyond that, I am in Physics because it is required for the civil engineering major and for a good reason too. Engineers use tons of physics and calculus in their careers; to the best of my knowledge most engineers rely heavily on physics in their work. If being an engineer is my goal then learning the skills an engineer needs is what I must do.  It is one thing to take physics but it is another to understand it, to know the material and how to apply it to the real world. I am hoping to become confident in my ability to learn and relate physics to the real world and to things I encounter in my working life."
