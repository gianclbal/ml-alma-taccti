2020,Spring,SCI 0220,SI,1,645,"When things get challenging in my academics, whether that be from the course itself or outside factors like a worldwide disease, I try to remain calm and think out what my game plan should be in order to have the best success possible. This week with all of the changes on campus that has not been easy, especially with my own frustration on the situation. Nevertheless after gathering all the information about the situation and weighing all of my options I can prepare for what the coming weeks may look like.  I am a person who always does better when I have a set plan/routine I can follow. This week was hard for me because no plan or routine was in place for a few days and so I was very confused on my own course of action. Now that more information is available to me and I have a plan I am less stressed about my plan for education and living situations. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0220,SI,1,445,"When life gets challenging I like to focus on myself and rethink a lot of things. Depending on what kinds of challenges, most of the time I like to just go work out or play basketball but if it's a big challenge that might be holding me back from doing work I like to just isolate myself and focus on myself and see how I can improve on myself. I would think and rethink all the possibilities before doing something that might lead to another thing. "
