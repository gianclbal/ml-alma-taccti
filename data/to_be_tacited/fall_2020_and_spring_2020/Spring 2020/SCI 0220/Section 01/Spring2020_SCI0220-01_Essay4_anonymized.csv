2020,Spring,SCI 0220,SI,1,445,"The question that I came up with is how to find speed and velocity of an object. If you know enough values to plug into an equation you just have to use the right equation depending on the situation and which values you have and just plug them in. After you’ve plugged them in, you can easily solve for the answer. This can be applicable to peoples’ everyday lives when they want to do experiments or if they just want to find the speed and velocity of objects such as cars and trains and anything that moves even a ball."
2020,Spring,SCI 0220,SI,1,645,"The concept of tension is one I want to learn more about in relation to forces. When reviewing my notes on tension I learned that in a system where two masses are connected by a chord the tension is constant throughout. This was surprising to me because I feel that a change in masses as well as a direction of the pulley to tug would affect tension. Furthermore, if the masses are at equilibrium I would expect tension to have a different effect in the system than it would if the masses were moving. What I learned from simulations in my lecture homework was that acceleration of the masses will be equal when the chord is inflexible. This is because they move with the same velocity over the same period of time.   As a civil engineer this kind of analysis is useful when looking at suspension bridges because the calculations of cable tensions holding up the bridge are crucial. Knowing what forces will always be present in cables can determine what designs are suitable or not for a bridge. While a different and funky design might be a cool idea for a public entity like a bridge we must make sure that mathematically it is safe to construct. I want to completely understand tension in chords in order to be a better engineer and I am glad these exercises in lab and lecture are helping be understand better. "
