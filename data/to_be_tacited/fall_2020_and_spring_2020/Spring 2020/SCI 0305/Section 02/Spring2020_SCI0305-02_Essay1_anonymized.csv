Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,2,733,"I am here in SCI305 because I did not understand many concepts from 305 when I took it. It is a combination of how it was taught to me and my lack of digging deeper to understand the applications and concepts. My instructor and I both treated this as a straight math course, and in doing so I failed myself. I want to learn the concepts and grasp the understanding of all this, so I can be more successful in current and future classes. I have learned that 305 is truly a fundamental class for engineering, and I am thankful SCI305 was born. Honestly, I struggle a lot with calculus 3 concepts, so sometimes I feel really behind because I always have to refresh on the basics. Sometimes, I honestly feel stupid, but I know how to get out of that feeling, and that my friends is why I am here in SCI305."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,2,734,I am here in sci 305 because I'm at the literal end of my line. If I don't pass another class i wont be allowed to continue. I'm here because I'm fighting my hardest at every step and its never enough so now I'm doing even more. If i had the natural understanding i would not be here. if i had strong method for learning on my own I wouldn't be here. I'm here because I'm struggling and am desperately grasping for any hand hold to slow my fall from grace.
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,2,735,I want to have a better understanding of the topics and what they mean on a deeper level. I want to be able to visualize them better and know what these tools I learn mean in the real world. I hope to be an engineer one day that designs creative gadgets or tools that can be used in everyday life. I have a desire for learning and dont just want to understand the math but the actual thoery and what it means. Also this class allows me to sit with students and just ask questions about related topics aswell like from my 451 class. I am very appriciative of this class. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,2,736,"Why am I here? That’s a question everyone should ask themselves at least once, especially in college, when you’re on the path to starting a career, to really starting the life you’ll lead maybe for the rest of our lives. But why am I here? Why am I going to college? To get a higher education, to experience a sort of working environment while making friends and making contacts with people that might help me out in my future, such as having references in classmates or professors that I’ve interacted with and had for my courses. Why am I in this field, in the field of Engineering, specifically Computer Engineering. It’s because I’m passionate about both the mechanical and the software elements of Engineering, and Computer Engineering seems like the bridge and the best of both worlds. I would like to major in Computer Science, but I enjoy the hands-on approach to projects and tech. But why am I really here? Honestly, I just want to be financially stable for later in life, work in a field and profession that I am fairly passionate in, and to make my parents proud. Kinda cheesy, but it’s the truth.That’s why I’m here."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,2,737,"If by ""here"" you mean the university setting, I'm here because I want to do something productive and proactive with my professional life. Since I am first-generation college in my family, I feel I hold a significant responsibility to do something with this opportunity presented to me. I want to get past university not only to prove to myself that I can but to also set a path for my sister who also wants to attend university whenever she is able to. Although times and opportunities have significantly, I still see university as the gateway to at least a stable job in the engineering field. I'm doing this honestly because I need a job that I am content with, a job that lets me embrace a passion that is slowly burning brighter and hopefully never diminishes. I want a job that doesn't necessarily make me happy but does in fact make those around me happy whether it be with the product I help produce, my work ethic, or my personal actions. I feel university can help me accomplish that and so far it has. A couple of bumps here and there were felt but they were definitely avoidable. My life goal: makes others happy through something I helped push forward and out into the world."
