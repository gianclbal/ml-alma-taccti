2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,2,735,When life gets challenging I try to take a break. Sometimes meditation or prayer can help. I like to seek help if there is help for the situation. If I can I get away for a minute and go to nature and it helps clear my head. I spend time with my wife and talk to her about it and that can help. Then once my head is clear I can reproach and try to come at the situation differently. I dig in and try to maintain a balance of work and life without losing myself. Most of these methods are just healthy ways I relieve stress so I don't freak out. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,2,736,"Oftentimes when life gets challenging, I’d just stop everything, so close to the point that I would feel like giving up. Giving up is easy, you stop being responsible and you start being lazy. Then abandoning everything else becomes easier and easier. By that, I mean that if I stop working hard in one class, the same goes for the rest of my classes. I get sloppy, then lazy, then I just stop working altogether. I used to be this way a lot in high school. I would barely pass classes and feel like I was lucky while being lazy to the point where my luck ran out, and I reached a low. I failed classes, I skipped school. When life gets challenging, I begin to reflect on who I am right now, why I’m here, and why I’ve given up essentially. I had a turning point, and a revelation, then began to work as hard as possible, and barely passed high school after retaking courses, doing extra, and focusing on graduating with passing grades. I felt really lucky, but also really fortunate. When life gets challenging, more times than I’d like to admit, I step away from it all for a bit to reflect, I get a bearing on what’s hindering me, then I attempt to to take things slowly, dedicating myself to performing my best for each task at hand, one assignment at a time, one class, etc. When life gets challenging, when it gets too overwhelming, stressful, whatever it is, I take a step back, realize what I have to do, why I’m doing it, take a deep breath, do a little reflection, maybe have a revelation of sorts, then jump right back into it putting my best foot forward. Or I try to at least, I’m definitely not perfect at any of what I said. I’m only human after all."
