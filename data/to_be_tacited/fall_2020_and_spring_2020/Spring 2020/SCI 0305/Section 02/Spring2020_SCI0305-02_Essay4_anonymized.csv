2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,2,735,"The material relates to society in several ways. For one, understanding the basis of converting from time to frequency is key to all aspects of technology around us, for example, communication systems, music, radio, pictures, video.  What we are learning ties all aspects of education together, like math, science, engineering, and many other fields. What makes it special in engineering is that it is not just theory, but ideas put to work. It allows scans at hospitals to be possible. Police and fireman to communicate.  Transforming from time to frequency gives a better visual of how the universe works. "
