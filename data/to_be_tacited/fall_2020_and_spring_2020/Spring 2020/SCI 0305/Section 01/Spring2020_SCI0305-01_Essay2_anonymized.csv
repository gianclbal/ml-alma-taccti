2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,725,"When life gets challenging I like to try to keep going and take it day by day. I like to sit down and make lists of things I need to get done, things I should get done and things I don't need to do right now. In these lists I like to give myself a timeline and an approximate time each task should take. This gives me a clear direction of where to go from where I am that is challenging. Having a set list of tasks keeps me motivated to complete these tasks in a timely manner, but sometimes it's nice to build a list with someone else to get their opinion.  Being able to make a prioritized list also helps me manage my time so that I can get help and can avoid getting burned out as best I can. Obsessing over my failures is something I'm prone to, but this never helps me in a positive way. I find that shutting down and running away from dealing with an issue makes it far more difficult to face whatever the challenge is."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,715,"What do I do when life gets challenging?When life gets challenging I usually depend on friends and family to lessen the burden.  I let them know that a difficult time is ahead, and that I may need some adjustments in normal responsibilities.  That allows me more time to meet whatever the difficult circumstances that I face.  Plus, I am a pretty optimistic person, I believe that I will do the best that I can do, make the best decisions I can to prioritize, and complete the most that I can. The result is then the best it could be, and I don't have to feel as though there was more to be done.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,714,"When things get challenging, I get after it. When things get challenging, I try harder. I wake up earlier, and go to bed later. In school things get hard sometimes. For me it helps to relate to other students in the same struggle. We all think we are the only ones who struggle with motivation but if you survey your friends, most of them are also trying hard to stay motivated. For me things get difficult because I procrastinate. Things are not as difficult if you are on top of things. You have to stay in front of the power curve, when you fall behind and at the same time experience a slump in motivation it can be really discouraging. During these time I find it helps to get an intense workout in. From the brutality of the workout I find my discipline and get back to work."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,728,"“What do I do when life gets challenging?”  Looking at this question my mind asks, what kind of challenge? Cuz I really don’t know. Not saying that cuz like I don’t face any challenges, we all have challenges. Usually I’d say big life challenges, I need to talk to others to decide on what to do. I feel like I’m generally rather indecisive. So, choices are always a challenge. Like I had to decide to either commute to school, move, or not go to school for a year, and try to apply some where closer. It was honestly was a shitty time. I fucking hate making choices. I ended up just commuting / taking public transportation to school. And it sucked. But that’s one thing you kind of learn from difficult times is that no matter what you choose to do, time continues to progress, and with it, everything becomes easier. Not to be sappy or shit, but it really does. My dog died last week. I cried every day, I really just couldn’t stop seeing it in my mind and reliving that experience. But after some days, I’m able to just not think about it as much, it’s become much less overwhelming. I guess, some challenges, there’s not always anything to do but wait for it to pass, to get better."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,713,John Ellis3/13/20SCI Question: What do I do when life gets challenging 	I do not have any certain technique I rely on when life gets challenging. I decide to stick through whatever situation I am in and try to believe in the fact that things will get better and it will be worth it in the end. When I am faced with a challenge in life I often get discouraged but remember the idea of the future and try to focus on improving my situation instead of folding under the pressure.
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,720,"When life gets challenging I tend to look for ways to take my mind off of the difficulties. This is through many various methods such as being with close friends and family, exercising, or relaxing at home and watching sports, tv, or movies. I think mental health is very important for everyone so I try and make that a priority when I experience tough times in either school or life in general. It is also useful for me to try and maintain a schedule and plan ahead so that I can maneuver easier through tasks when I get overwhelmed I know what I need to do and when I should be doing stuff. Challenging times are experienced often at this point in my academic career, but it makes it easier knowing that my peers and professors are there and I am not the only one experiencing difficulties. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,727,"When life gets challenging, I tend to isolate myself a lot. I like being alone as a way of taking time to figure out what I need to do and what time I have to do it. Also depends on what my challenges are.  Some challenges require me to group with my friends. such as studying. but still I like to study alone when I feel like I have a major challenge to accomplish."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,716,What I do when life gets challenging is stress out. I stress out a lot when things don't go as planed. I typically am the type of person to have most things in my life controlled and expected but there are times where things don't go as planned and this creates stress. challenging things are something I have faced many times in my life and what I do during these times is take a step back breath and assess the situation. think of ways to solve this problem and create an effective solution or idea to help ease the stress. I have noticed in the pass when times get challenging I want to ignore the problem and do something else that doesn't stress me out but eventually I have to come back to the problem and when I do its usually a bigger problem because of time.  
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,718,"Question: ""What do I do when life gets Challenging?""             In this world, there are lots of challenges that we might need to face and some challenges would be very difficult or some would be easy to overcome. For me, when my life gets challenging, I would probably eat something to calm down the stress that I had on the challenge or I might take a long break to get my mind clearly to solve the problems. For instance, when I was studying for a Midterm on an Engineering class, I might spend lots of time reviewing everything every night to keep the mindset. Also, I would take a long break to continue for the midterm to get every stuff understanding able. In other words, if I took a long break and took a long time to think about it, I would face my challenge much better. Also, when I face my challenge in school, I might ask for friend help on something I might not know and try to figure it out as a group to solve the problem. Overall, if a person has a challenge that they need to face it, there is always a way to solve it and every problem will be solved."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,724,"When life gets challenging, I do not back down and give up.  I keep pursuing whatever I am pursuing.  I know that the challenge will eventually go away.  I think about the results of accomplishing whatever I am trying to accomplish.  Also, I try to think of ways that I can get through the challenge.  I consider using resources that will help me get through the challenge. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,722,"I have two modes when life gets challenging. I have my hunker down and get shit done mode where I get so invested in working and getting stuff done that I sometimes forget to eat and go to the bathroom. I also have my ultimate procrastination mode where I put everything off until the last minute and struggle to get through things. I need to be better at doing things little by little and chipping away when I have the time rather than stressing about doing it all in one go. However, I do think taking breaks is healthy and necessary at some points. Right before school got suspended I was very stressed out with school and also stressing about personal problems that I really needed a little break from it all. In this past week I have been able to deal with what I needed to deal with and get my mind off things for a while and now that its time to get back into the swing of things, I am much more ready to get to work."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,726,When life gets challenging I tend to reflect on what's been happening around me and the things I can do to change the outcome of the challenging things. I try to be as proactive I can. When I notice that the things that challenge me are out of my control I tend to regroup and keep to myself until I get over the hump. I don't usually get down on myself but I really try to slow myself down until I get back to a place I'm in control. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,729,"When life gets challenging I often re center myself. I always put in perspective what my ultimate goal is, both personal and educational. With every negative force, I believe I can combat it with a positive one. It does take a lot of energy though, but I remind myself that I have made it through tough times before. Sometimes I need to take time for myself, and other times I reach out to loved ones to talk it out. At the end of the day, I cannot fall into despair or whatever, I have to keep moving on but I do take my time to pick myself up. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,721,"To avoid any experience of challenging semester from the courses I'm taking, I would learn the material ahead of time or seek for other resources (whether it's tutor, creating a study group, or enroll for a course that would support the difficult course I'm taking). However, if the course spikes in difficulty where I need more help than the resources I have now, I would talk with the professor during office hours about the subject matter for a better understanding of the material(s) being taught in class.   "
