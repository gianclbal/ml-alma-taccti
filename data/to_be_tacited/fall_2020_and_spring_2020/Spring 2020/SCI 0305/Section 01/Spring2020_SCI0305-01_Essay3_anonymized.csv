2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,730,"My family has always valued education and are supportive of me going through college. Although they are biased and have pretty traditional opinions about certain majors, they do want to see me continue in higher education. I definitely share the view that education is important, although not always a good fit for everyone given there are other options, and am considering attending graduate school in my future.The recent semesters since I declared my major in engineering, I've met other students who I share classes with and we support each other by making study groups and giving advice about future classes. It's definitely helpful to have support from others who are also in my shoes, especially with more difficult classes. It's also encouraging work with a group of people that have similar goals."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,728,"Some of my values that have helped me get through school have been dedication to completing a what I have committed to. Growing up, my Mom ran a farm to support the family. So myself and my brother were expected to help out and work around the farm. And my moms a perfectionist, so when we were given a job, we didn't just have to do it, we had to do a completed, high standard job. Like I swear my mom things doing the dishes involves sweeping and mopping the floor, by hand, cuz swiffers are for lazy good for nothings. I think growing up with that kind of high standards, I put more pressure on myself to do well. So in a way that actually has been a negative thing. Cuz I get more stressed about an assignment or exam, and generally end up doing worse because of it. And then beating myself up over it. kind of dumb. But besides the perfectionist thing, I do feel a strong dedication to finish courses to the best of my abilities. Also growing up with a hardworking mindset helped, I don't think I would be in this major if I didn't rise to the challenge. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,722,"My brother has been the biggest contributor to helping me navigate through college. He is five years older and went through the same city college to university transfer that I did. We both have had to put ourselves through college so he has helped me with a lot of the bureaucratic nonsense that comes with the whole college process. Outside of my actual classes, I've had financial aid issues and registration issues and you name it that I have had to navigate through. Most of the time I can deal with it myself but there have been times where I didn't really know what was going on and why I was having a hold on my account and my brother has been able to help me figure it out and get it resolved. The biggest help that he has given me is once I transferred out of community college and came back to SF, he has let me stay with him rent free which has taken a big burden off my shoulders of having to work through my classes to afford rent and groceries. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,718,"Question: ""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""        In this world, there were lots of value that our family or the community would have helped us to show us the road throughout the college. However, for me, the values that my family gave me throughout the college was very helpful and they were supposing me very well throughout the college year. For instance, when I have some midterm that I need to study out, my family would able to help me out when I am trying to focus onto study. In other words, they would help me out on the food and other stuff that I need while I am studying for a test. Also, the community did help me out too by having the library space for me and my classmates to study together to get on the midterm or quizzes thought out the college years. Overall, the community and my family had already given lots of good values when I am still in college and able to experience of being suppose by many people that I know in college can my study much better in class and my college life. Also, it can change the road that how I can go good throughout the college years."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,731,"I apologize for doing this so late, I forgot to submit it.My family has helped me significantly throughout my college experience. It has been a long and laborious experience pursuing my degree. I have been to multiple schools, and have as many horrible experiences as excellent ones. My family, and the values they have taught me, have really kept me in check and focused on the endgame. There have been many times when my judgement has been clouded with doubt and stress, and they always have been supportive in what I am doing. With their support I am able to see the big picture and remember that this is a great decision for my life and it will all be worth it once I complete my engineering degree! "
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,729,"All my family - and most of my community - know is work. That mentality definitely translated into my personality, but I have the opportunity to channel that energy into my school work. I come from a supportive family, and honestly my moms made me believe I could do whatever I put my mind to. So my family definitely fuels my eagerness to pursue my career. I am who I am mainly because of what they taught me and I've been able to carry my own in my academics. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,724,"My family never really taught me to give up on things.  So, I guess my family not teaching me to give up on things could have helped me with not trying to give up in taking classes and trying to do well in my classes.  I am not sure of any other values that my family could have that could have helped me navigate through college. "

2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,719,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""- I think that growing up with a dad who was an engineer with a highly analytical mindset helped prepare me for the type of thinking required in engineering. My family always valued education highly since as long as I can remember so the drive to learn and be my best was always present. And while that did definitely produce pressure it more-so instilled an ingrained appreciation for knowledge and eagerness to learn. I think above that though my parents constant reminders to put my happiness first and pursue what I loved and what made me happy has been much more useful as it has given me perspective in college, it allowed me to take a step back and realize that while on paper some decisions may sound beneficial if it wasn't contributing to my overall happiness it may not be worth the effort, which I think is easy to forget in such an achievement based education system.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,732,I don't really feel comfortable sharing.
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,721,"The values of my community and family helped me navigate through college by providing me motivation to continue despite how difficult the courses may become as the semester continues. For the community, I want to help others on the subject matter whenever they were to struggle. But to do that, I must understand the material myself. So, with that in mind, I would use that as motivation for me to improve in the courses I’m taking. As for family, I want to return the favor for their sacrifices and belief in me from the start of college. I also use that as my motivation to push myself to do well throughout the semesters."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,725,"The values of my community or family have helped me navigate through college by helping me cope with failure and how to move on from it. In my family failing is seen as a part of learning. Focusing on failing is useless; focusing on WHY I failed is the important part to slowly build up myself or my knowledge. Perseverance is the most important value imparted to me by my family. Though I tend to internalize my failures, it's nice to have someone to remind me that academics are not the only measure of a person's worth. Especially with the shelter-in-place my family is supporting my academic efforts as best they can, and as best they can understand with the strange new class formats. I have a great deal of support from my family and they understand that sometimes I mess up and that I shouldn't expect perfection from others or myself."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,713,John Ellis4/6/20SCI Question: How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?         	I do not believe the values of my community or family has had much aid in helping me navigate through college. I am a first generation college student from my family and I do not have a close relationship with my family members. Therefore besides financial help they have not given much help with navigating through college. My community before moving for college was very small and offered very little guidance for college. My highschool did not hire a counsellor to help students with college plans until after I graduated. Overall I am finding my own way through college with the help of peers in my classes and not many other external assistance. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,720,The values of my family have helped me navigate through my academic in many ways. Some of the ways in which their values have influenced me is in the ways that I interact with my peers as I make sure that I can always lend a helping hand to a classmate while also making sure to reach out and ask for help from others if needed. Making sure that my friends are succeeding is sometimes just as important as me succeeding in a class which I have found to be helpful as it keeps me making sure that I am on top of my game in my classes. It is always important for me to also hold a value of respect for my professors/peers which originated from my family and I believe it has been helpful in building a slight network among the department. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,723,I would say not so much. Coming from a Hispanic family we are very close and often get together to do almost any activity. Most students live far from campus and often would not want to take place in the events going on in campus. This distancing that other students seem to be OK way because everybody commutes is vastly different compared to other schools were most students live on campus. However now that we are stuck at home we are forced to try to study with friends online and its very inefficient and hard to convey everyone thoughts clearly.

2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,714,"I came from Diablo Valley Community college, one of the best most competitive CC in California. A lot of my friends ended up at Berkeley or UCLA or Davis, Sanford, Purdue. At DVC I was part of MESA (math engineering, science achievement). We had a room that had two walls turned into white boards. We had a culture of problem solving and collaboration. Somebody would be working on a problem and everyone would try to solve it and people how had taken the course would teach it. It was beautiful to watch. Most students all focus on the problems they are assigned but we would seek out other peoples challenges and help each other. "
