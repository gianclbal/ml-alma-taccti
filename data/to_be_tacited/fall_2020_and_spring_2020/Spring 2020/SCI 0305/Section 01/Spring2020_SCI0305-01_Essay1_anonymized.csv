Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,713,"John Ellis Jr2/18/2020I am here in this SCI class for a few different reasons. One reason why I am here, is to be able to better understand the material learned in the parent class with the help of my peers and the instructors of my SCI class. Having this extra help will allow me to be able to achieve a better grade for the parent class. With this help I will be able to create a good base understanding of the material and build upon it with new future topics in following semesters. Another reason why I am here is, I like to procrastinate with studying. Having this class allows me to set aside a designated time every week to better understand topics that we have already covered in the parent course or to prepare ourselves by working on material that we may encounter in the future. The last reason is to be able to meet new people. Since some people are taking the same parent class as I am, I am able to connect with these people and we are able to benefit each other by discussing our lecture and creating study groups to prepare ourselves for tests or to help each other with homework."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,714,"I am here for many reasons. Life is full of adventures but in order to take part in many of these adventures you need money. Why am I studying engineering? Mankind has been innovating since the beginning of time. There is a natural inclination in man to build, create, and destroy. I am here because I was born into this world. A world that I still find very mysterious. The mystery has made me curious. So I study the world to better understand it. It is almost a spiritual pursuit. The idea of harnessing nature. Using the physic's of the natural world to the spectacular advantage of man is intriguing. To control a particle or to make an ecosystem. We are essentially gods in this world. I am here to learn how to create. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,715,"Why am I here?  I am here because I want to get the most information out of all my classes.  To do so, I want as much exposure to the concepts as possible.  Because I am an Electrical Engineering major, I believe that Linear Systems Analysis, and generally signal and systems, to be a foundational class that other classes will build upon.  Plus, I believe that some of our best work and learning is done in groups, so I think the actual class concept of working in groups will also be beneficial.  Additionally, I am hopeful that learning from classmates that are of more senior standing than myself could give me some insight on some of the teachers to target or avoid, and answer some of the other questions I have about my future endeavors.  Finally, I believe that the process of getting a degree is really an exercise in gaining knowledge that can be applied in the future to change my beliefs.  Thus, I am hopeful that I can exercise that hypothesis."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,716,I’m here for one reason which is to learn something new every day. I hope to expand my knowledge about the type of work I want to do in the future. I believe the small classes that don’t seem to mean anything is a lot of knowledge to work with. One of my classes was talking about binary numbers and computers. I’m a mechanical engineering major and binary numbers doesn’t seem relevant to my major but I do think that understanding how computers work and think. I know for this class all this information even though I have a hard time grasping the information will help me succeed in the future. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,717,"The main reason I'm here is because I found the lecture don't provide much support in solving exercises due to the broad amount of material from each chapter.I've been advised during the orientation to take this support to help me improve my understanding of the class content. So far It's been helpful sitting in a table with other classmates discussing and solving problems that are challenging at some point. Also the different level of knowledge of students helps me to understand in a one to one interaction questioning why someone solved an exercise in such specific manner. Details are important specially refreshing some math from previous classes that are covered during this class, not such good examples using Matlab but at least they provide a general idea. I would like to have not just solving random problems but Past exams.I also wonder if we would be allowed to use a cheat sheet and/or formulas from the book."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,718,"Question: “Why am I here?”            In this course, I am trying to get some help some other classmates and the students that had recently took this class, ENGR 305, for help to get the course topic understandable and major able to catch up to the class. Also, in this class, I could to make some classmates that I never seen before and able to get their help as a group work assignment to do some of the problems on the worksheet that had given in this course. This SCI class can help me to more practice problems on the topic that might talk about it during the class times and it would might show out the topic for the help on the subject better. Also, I want to be here is to get more information to work on the subject better and it would help right after the class time to understand the topic better. Overall, being here, in the SCI class, it can help me better on the subject better and able to ask more classmates to help me on the topic better and the concept understandable."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,719,"I'm not totally sure, Mechanical Engineering is definitely something that I'm very very interested in and am passionate about but sometimes it feels like I'm killing myself with the workload. I suppose I'm doing this to fulfill some sense of purpose or higher calling, most of the time I really do love it but I get tired sometimes, the phrase rat-race comes to mind. I do think fulfilling our potential is one of the highest callings we can chase so even though it's hard I do think it's worth pursuing."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,720,"I am here because I am taking Linear Systems Analysis as a requirement for my major which is Mechanical Engineering. This course I am in is a supplementary course that is meant to give extra work in an attempt to help performance in the class. I am a mechanical engineering major due to my passion for science and mathematics in school along with my hobbies in automobiles. Hopefully, with the help of this course I am able to have more success with the corresponding course. I had previously struggled with the prerequisite course circuits analysis and had a year gap between so I thought this would be a good course to take for the extra help."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,721,"Roger Truong  SCI305  Reflective Journal Essay #1  02-18-2020  916324765     My name is Roger Truong. My major is mechanical engineering. I’ve heard many bad stories about how difficult ENGR305 can potentially be from several fellow classmates who have already taken it. This made me want to take part of this class (SCI305) to further improve my knowledge and understanding of the course. In some cases, if I were to not understand some key points from John Kim’s lecture; by being part of SCI305, I can potentially get a better understanding of those key points from lectures other than just having to participate in study group sessions."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,722,I am here because I want to pass this class. I took this class last semester with Haji and I ended up with a D+. I took the lab last semester too and passed but I struggled passing the lecture because I didn't do too well on the exams. I am taking this class for the second time and I want to take it more seriously. I signed up for this class in hopes that I would get a bit more practice and help figuring out the problems that I couldn't figure out last semester. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,723,This isn't my first so class and from the past I know they are super useful. 305 is a difficult class and having a forced study group with students that have take the class already is a great asset. My only problem is that that they take a unit in order to be in the class and in my other school they were optional extra sessions and we were free to come and go as we pleased. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,724,"I am here to help maintain the world.  I can help maintain the world by working. I am in this world to work, doing any kind of work.  Also, I can be here to try to make the world a better place. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,725,"I think that I'm here to contribute to the lives of others for the general good. I am pursuing an engineering degree to understand the physical world and develop the basic building blocks to contribute to solving problems in the future. Even if I should fail along the way, I need to remember that failures build up to relative success and the only way to learn is to persevere. I desire to be of general help and to help others who are more capable than I to do well. I want to be a part of the technological side of living well and support the pursuit of a good life, and hopefully sustainable living. I don't want riches; just enough to not live in constant fear of failing to meet basic needs and want that for others. If something I can make or contribute my efforts to can make that happen that would be satisfying to me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,726,I'm here because I want to get the best grade I can possibly get in this class. I know if I didn't get any tutoring or supplemental learning I'd probably fail. I care about my grades and I really enjoy the topics although its difficult. I really like that there is a space where we can come for help it means a lot. The space seems safe to express my concerns and questions. Although we have this space I feel that we all can do better about getting administration to give us even more resources like other schools in neighboring cities. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,727,Why am I here... I guess the reason I choose to be in SCI305 was to review concepts of ENGR 305 and create a stronger foundation of knowledge that I'm expected to know. The other reason is to just review concepts and to accumulate any credits towards my degree that I can. To learn everything that I can.
