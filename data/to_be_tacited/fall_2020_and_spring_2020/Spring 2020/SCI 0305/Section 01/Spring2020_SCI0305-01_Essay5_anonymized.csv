2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,730,"Initially, I was a Computer Science major but wanted to switch since coding wasn't very interesting to me. I decided on engineering in my junior year because I was interested in the construction industry from my last job. However, I decided to continue in Civil Engineering as a minor and major in Electrical Engineering because that was the subject that I knew the least about so it seemed the most challenging out of the available engineering options. I knew almost nothing about electronics but I was always curious to know how many devices worked. I also declared a minor in Physics because after taking Electricity and Magnetism, I found that I also really liked learning about the theory behind physical phenomena. Although I'm not enthusiastic about math, I do enjoy applying in different topics within engineering and physics."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,719,I want to go into my major because this is something I'm good at and genuinely enjoy. Engineering is also a noble profession in my eyes so even in the tough times it's worth it.
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,732,"I've always enjoyed making things and designing things. I've done wood working, some metal working and the likes either creating art or developing something functional. I've always had a a desire to understand how things work and how to improve them. These are all things that engineers do or strive to do. Now I enjoy anything mechanical in nature, from a sewing machine to the workings of a bicycle. So I decided to go with Mechanical Engineering because it was the most balance of all engineering field. I can go into any field I would want afterwards. I can go into aerospace, electrical, civil,  or any engineering field I would like."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,726,I went into this major because its engineering is a topic I've always been interested in. I've always enjoyed math in school so engineering took it to another level.
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,721,"There are a few reasons as to why I’ve decided my major as mechanical engineer. One reason is to help create methods to provide an easier life to future generations to come. In addition to providing easier life for everyone around the world, I also want to help the environment by preventing excess amount of pollution that would enter the atmosphere. I was originally under biochemistry major for a few years. It took a while for me to realize that the major wasn’t for me because I don’t like to memorize concepts (biology). So, I’ve decided to switch majors to mechanical engineering soon after."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,729,I want to go into my major because I realized that I enjoy exercising problem solving skills. I am a firm believer that things can continue to improve in ways that don't hurt the environment or result in the displacement of a community. I want to be a part of a team that takes part in the development process of something useful for the community. I believe that my role as an engineer is to ultimately can give back to my family and community who has always supported me. It goes without saying that my voice in this field can speak volumes to others - especially to young girls of color. I'm pursuing something that interests me and that will help me achieve so much more. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,715,"I have always liked electronics and toys, so to go into a major that I would have a chance to help design some type of electronics is very appealing. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,717,"As a mechanical engineering I'd like to go over thermal fluids focus area, to learn more aboud layer boundary and applied fluid mechanics, piping and things related."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,723,I knew i wanted to do engineering but as for the electrical aspect i just randomly picked it.
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,725,"My major is computer engineering. I wanted to go into my major for the breadth of knowledge it provides. In my major there are both electrical engineering aspects and computer science aspects. Knowing how data is processing at a low level in a computer contributes to the knowledge of how to utilize it in higher level aspects like programming. Knowing what the hardware is doing and why it's doing it will help me write efficient programs. My major also gives me a wider range of knowledge for future jobs as I will be able to be a bridge between hardware and software. I can choose what aspect I want to have for a job as well, although it's probably more likely I will end up as a programmer. I've always wanted to write programs for embedded systems and to explore internet of things, and computer engineering seemed like a good program to go into to pursue my goal."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,714,"I got into engineering because I love making things. I took woodshop all 4 years in high school and I took shop class in 7th and 8th grade. My dad was a brick mason when he was my age and taught me the basics of construction. So after high school I worked as a carpenter. In carpentry you are given dimensions. There is a mathematical and geometrical ideal. Your skill and technique determines home close you can get to that ideal. I enjoyed the numbers, the dimensions. and I enjoyed taking an idea and making into a solid product. That is why I started learning engineering. Also I loved math in high school. For some odd reason I was put in an advanced algebra class in 7th grade. The first algebra 1 class taught at my school for 7th graders. Ever since then I thought I was good at it. Since then I have learn machining and other manufacturing techniques and I am excited to make something at the next level. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,718,"""Why do I want to go into my major?""     My major is Mechanical Engineer and the reason that I want to go into this major is that I was trying to understand something that my parents have did it in the past and I want to learn to do it in the future. One of my family member used to be a mechanic and I am really interested to car and lots of cars part that we need to know how to fix and really enjoy to it. Also, this major is very helpful for me to find work in the future and able to get information on it. This major is very broad for many work in the Engineering area and this can able to work on other part for different jobs from the society. Overall, the reason that I want to go into my major is that I am enjoy fixing car and able to create some new supplies that are relates to cars part get enjoy from the Engineering classes for this major."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,716,Why do I want to go into my major?mechanical engineering is a passion of mine because since I was a kid I want to go into my major manly because it is awesome to create something that will one make life easier for people and two as a challenge to my mechanical engineering knowledge. i have made so many things that involve moving parts and designing more efficient ways to do something. I thrive on making things more efficient. repetitive tasks done automatically. this will save time and reduce error in tasks. I want to work on self driving cars because I believe that this will save more lives on the road. Human error creates faults in many things that can fail. this is why computers and the processing power that we have will help solve so many solutions. I enjoy this field for the endless possibilities of solutions and constant innovation. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,713,"John Ellis5/4/20Question: Why do I want to go into my major?I was drawn towards my major because I found many of the other majors were not for me. My major is Computer Engineering and I have found myself to have many of the same interests as other Engineers. I have always been curious about the way things work, and also wanting to make things work better, faster, and more efficient. I want to go into Computer Engineering because I think my interests align with some of the key characteristics of Engineering. Besides being interesting, I would be lying if I said the money involved wasn't an influence. In my understanding so far Computer Engineers make a decent amount of money, and more than a large amount of other majors, and money is a very important resource in today's world. The combination of these factors made me decide to go into Computer Engineering."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,720,"I want to go into mechanical engineering, because there are so many things in it that fascinate me. I have always had a strong background with science and math and going into this major was very interesting to me to learn so much about all the applications of math and science that go into the creation of the objects we utilize in our day to day lives. Hopefully, I will be able to find a way with my major to help others through either design or research, but that is one of my main objectives. Everything I have learned so far has been so interesting and it keeps me wanting to know more and more."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,722,I guess I've had an interest in robots since I was young and used to go to the maker fair. I was introduced to battlebots there and fell in love with them and also fell in love with science. In high school I took a bunch of science classes and ended up really liking computer science and physics. I was lucky enough to have good science teachers who gave us good projects to take on that ended up fueling my interest in circuits and coding and whatnot. My senior year I made a battle bot from scratch with an arduino and a wireless xbox controller and a 3d printer. Ultimately with my major I would like to go into robotics in some way but I feel I am still a long ways off from specializing in that yet. I am losing some interest as my college experience is taking a long time but I want to push through and try to make it work. Even if I cant get a job in robotics I would probably work somewhere else and try to do robotics on the side.
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,724,I want to go into my major because I am interested in Electrical Engineering.  I think the Electrical Engineering career has good jobs. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,728,"Why do I want to go into my major? Good question, I ask myself that a lot. I really don't know sometimes. I felt like when I was first choosing a major, I liked math and art, but art seemed easy, not that I was ooh so amazing, I just wasn't challenged or engaged by it. So, I kind of went for the more math and science stuff, and it was challenging, it was engaging. It seemed like something I could enjoy and be good at. The more classes I took at community college, the more engineering disciplines I kind of just crossed off the list of possibles, including mechanical. Until I took a machining course and some 3D drafting courses, and it was really fun. I loved machining, it had the precision, detail oriented, and hands on skills I really enjoy learning about. And the drafting courses were almost like drawing, they were easy, and I really felt like this is something I could actually do without extreme frustration and boredom. So yeah, that's kinda why I chose ME. "
