2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,713,The past few weeks have been overall difficult and I am not sure of a question i can formulate.
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,730,"In Dr. Kim's class, we went over sampling. Why is it that the sampling rate must be twice of the maximum frequency? For example, when our devices sample our voices for a call, they take around 40k samples/second, which around twice the frequency people can hear. Sampling rate must be at least twice the maximum frequency in order to recover the entire signal. Otherwise, the signal will be aliased. For devices, when taking analog signals and sampling to get to the discrete signals, the rule of f_s>2f_max is followed."

2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,714,"I learned last week about statistical analysis of data in my engineering 300 course. The application of statistics in industry in fascinating to me. What I find more interesting is professor Ozer prospective on life. He is constantly trying to prepare use. He is trying to prepare us to be knowledge able, so when the opportunity presents itself we will know how to respond. I also learned today that I don't know how to do Fourier transformations like I thought I did. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,723,I dont feel like writing this.
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,732,"I've studied a little bit and wrote a program recently about image processing. Though society is using a lot of image processing now a days there are still fields that don't use it enough to it's full potential. I use to work in a stock room where I maintained inventory on a few 1000 different parts. One thing I found myself routinely doing was counting bolts, nuts, washers and the likes. So I actually ended up creating a program that could detect and count washers and hex nuts. Instead of counting 1000 hex nuts by hand we could easily use a program to take a picture of the hex nuts then have it automatically count how many of those are in the picture. This could be done with a camera that once turned on gives a live image and continually counts the objects. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,718,"A question that I have a concept that was covered in class in the past few weeks is What is a Convolution Integral and how do we solve for it?             Throughout my class notes that I had from my notebook, I can understand that a convolution is an integral that express the amount of overlap of one function as it is shifted over to another function. In other words, there is one function that is trying to blend into another function that was mention by two functions. Also, when we try to do the convolution integrals, we might need to flip one function on the other side and later you just need to overlap the other function to show the convolution throughout the process of the integral formation. For instance, if two function that show in a different position of the graph and later you can flip one of the graph and later we just move the function that was flip to the other side and later we just figure out the integral for each part if it get overlap on the function. In other words, when you move the inverse function, it would mostly touch the regular function and figure it out the integral for each part of it overlap it each other. For these information, it would generally applicable to people's live and it could be used to the benefit society because it can show the function would be showing on how they overlap to each material that we need to form it and combine it together for a better picture in a 3-D shape. Also, it can help the designer to create the shape to be overlapping to each other and generate the formation of a different materials that we need it in the society. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,720,"Why are fourier series important to know? Fourier series are important because it helps us analyze periodic signals. They are important just as fourier transforms are used in analyzing non-periodic signals. Using the fourier methods we can find out a lot more about the signal than what is initially seen. This information that we get can then be used in signal processing. I'm not too sure if there are actual real world examples of the fourier series being used, but I do know that they are important in signal processing so I am sure there are many applications that I do not know of."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,721,"In class, we've learned about different types of signal processes. Some if not all of these types of signals are also used in our every day life such as radio, phone calls, etc."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,716,the concept that was difficult for me to comprehend was linear time variant system vs linear time invariant systems. This concept was confusing not by the word but by what it represents. the words themselves makes sense in my head where this system is represented by time and how it varies throughout this system. but that what makes it confusing is how it is represented in an equation.System A: System B: System A is a time variant system and System B is a time invariant system. I think that this would apply to the real world in signal processing. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,729,"Well, in class were are learning about signal processing. One of the reasons why I chose mechanical engineering is because of its heavy involvement advancing technology. Learning about the math and mechanisms behind communication devices is hella interesting, and to know that this is what engineering entails is exciting to me. I always see myself working on new and/or existing systems that will benefit communities and can better improve existing conditions. I will eventually be that someone, along a whole team, that is responsible for the modifications or creations that ultimately help my community. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,719,"Fourier Transforms: I decided to go quite in depth to fourier transforms to try to genuinely understand the material so as to maybe make up for the lack of in person lecturing, yet I still feel that I;ve only scratched the surface of the theory behind them let alone their practical applications. The basics behind a fourier transform as I understand it is it acts to transform the signal into the frequency domain and provide a different viewport into the breakdown of the frequencies which go into building the original signal. In a practical sense this can be used to remove certain tones from a sound, compress a visual signal and shave information off of it in order to compress it, the uses are near limitless."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,724,"What is the Fourier Transform used for in real life?The Fourier Transform is used in MP3 audio files and remaking photos.  For example, JPEG file compression for pictures uses Fourier Transforms.  The Fourier Transform can remake a picture, even though the picture being remade might not be as good quality.  If someone does not have enough space on a hard drive to store all of the picture files that they want to store, they can use JPEG file compression to compress there picture files so that they can store all of their picture files on the hard drive.  Therefore, the Fourier Transform can benefit those people who want to make their picture files smaller to store on a hard drive.  A lot of people seem to like to listen to music.  People can listen to MP3 audio files to listen to music.  The Fourier Transform is used in MP3 audio files.  So, the Fourier Transform helps people to enjoy listening to music."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,717,Basically we use Laplace transform to solve linear ordinary and partial differential equations. For example solving a numerical inversion of Laplace transform to study the time dependent thin film flow of a second degree fluid down an inclined plane through a porous medium. How the fluid evolves with time
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,727,"honestly, convolution was difficult to understand at first. not conceptually but the mathematical solutions. looking through my class notes, the written formulas suddenly made sense about where they were getting the tao limits of the integral. that made convolution a lot easier in processing. being able to refer to explicit definitions that were in my notes."
2020,Spring,SCI 0305,SI,1,725,"Why is the Nyquist sampling rate important for audio processing?  Some of the important information I have learned in class is about sampling rate, specifically the Nyquist sampling rate. It is two times the highest frequency of the input signal and is used in things like cell phones and DVDs. The sampling rate ensures that there is the minimum amount of loss with the minimum amount of data saved. Lower sampling rates cause an inaccurate reading by failing to capture enough data, so in voice related audio it would be choppy. Higher sampling rates than strictly necessary causes there to be so much more information to be processed by a device that it becomes inefficient. The balance of having enough samples to accurately portray a signal, but no so many samples that data is difficult to process is an important part of making efficient, functional devices."
