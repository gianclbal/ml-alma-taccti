Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,662,"I'm here because I want to be. I really like math and I'm glad to keep persuing it. In the STEM field, because I like the sciences in general. I feel like I don't have anywhere else to go. I want to do well in calc 3 so I'm really grateful that this class is still here. Though this school doesn't feel very welcoming. I'm still having a very hard time socially, but the professors and proctor's I've had in classes seem pretty friendly. I want to do well in math and I think classes like these are a great way to reinforce and better understand subjects that's I learn about in class. Plus I feel like the classes are going pretty quickly, so the extra help here in the SI class is very helpful. Sometimes I wish I didn't come to this school however. Like I mentioned earlier, most of the time I feel like I'm here because I don't really have somewhere else to go, although it doesn't really matter. I'm hoping that math will land me a good enough job, and I'll be able to just done away the rest of my life in a sort of ok career."
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,663,"Gerardo NunezWhy am I here? I ask myself that question every day for about maybe the past 5 years. Once you start college and feel that “freedom” you never felt before your life changes rapidly. However, that same “freedom” can backfire and create bad habits. So, I am here because I was pushed by my family to pursue a higher education, an education they never had. So I took this challenge and decided on studying mechanical engineering because I felt it is the only major I am interested in and feel is worth my time (pay off eventually). So far it’s been tough and sometimes, honestly, I don’t wanna be here. Nonetheless, I make sure to always pick up the “slack” and keep track of it because you should not drop the “slack”, especially in engineering. So far in my tough journey I have a little bit of “slack” on me, so I have to pace myself and pick it up so I can overcome my obstacles and get through this and please my mum and make her proud. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,466,"I am here for many reasons. I never really knew what I wanted to be when I was growing up, but then during high school I realized that I like doing math. I decided to apply as an engineering major due to this fact. When the years came by with all these classes, I realized that I like being in this major. Now, I know what I want to do and that will drive me to do what I need to do to be able to finish and get a degree. I want to be the second person from my whole family to be able to graduate from a university. This will keep pushing me to strive to be better. I may not understand the material as of now, but once I learn and practice more problems I am sure I will appreciate everything that was taught to me. My end goal is to graduate with a degree and make all the money that I have spent for schooling worth it."
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,664,"I have always had an issue with math, as in I don't know how to start problems. This has been something I always needed to work on, and I feel like this class with not only help me get organized and understand topics and find out why the way to solving these are different, it will also help me to understand where it starts and it would be a nice midweek review of concepts we have learned. Especially since the lecture is fast-paced and I would need a mid-week review with all the material so I can understand the next day of lectures. I have taken calc 2 last semester with the SCI course, and I feel like that really benefitted me. I also feel like, I would benefit from working in a group and having people next to me would really help me understand the concept because they will have a different way of explaining and doing the problem. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,665,"Jesse Olmos 915123786 Journal Essay 	I am here because, Im a mechanical engineering major and currently taking Calculus 3. This is the first SCI class that I have ever taken, I decided to take it because I believe it will help me in my journey to pass Calculus 3 and continue on my path to obtain my degree. Before signing up for this class I never thought that SCI classes were a big help. However I have now realized that they truly help especially since the class itself is a really fun environment within itself and the work we do is learning with one another and not simply copping notes that the professor has written down on the board. I really enjoy this SCI and I know that it will help to pass Calculus 3 this semester so I don’t have to repeat it next semester, I believe that everyone should a SCI class because they truly do help."
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,482,"I am here because I want to further my understanding in my Calculus class.  I want to take full advantage of this course and try hard in order to really understand the material and pass my actual Calc class.  I am here because I am pursuing a further education so that I can get a degree and have a successful career in the future.  I am here in San Francisco because when it came time to pick a school, I wanted to get as far as possible from home.  Years later I am so glad that I made this decision because I would not be who I am today had I not.  I have met the most amazing people and had some really awesome experiences and travels.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,666,"I am here because I want to be able to do better in my math class. I enjoy math because I've always been good at it. I always been someone who enjoys helping other people learn math. I'm here because I want keep up with my math class and not fall behind for whatever reason. Another reason I am here because I want to have a solid foundation for calc because I will be continuing onto higher math classes. I sometimes struggling to not use my calculator because I have always used it in my pervious classes. This will be a good chance to practice doing all the work without a calculator. I also want to make new friends who will be taking higher math classes like calc 2 &3 so that we can help each other then. This can also make new opportunity to meet people who have the same major as me. I also have an interest of one day teaching this class, because i think its important to help my community. Also, keep this program going because its really important to me and to people learning math in the future. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,667,"I am currently taking calc 228 and I have struggled with math throughout my education experience so the more practice the better. I'm currently majoring in civil engineering and I hope to concentrate in environmental engineering. I haven't figured out my minor yet but hopefully, it will be something like comm or something in the humanities. Another reason I am taking this class is that it would make my life much easier if I strengthen my math skills. I also took a sci class for calc one and even though I didn't pass the class it helped me understand the material, and I got an A in clac the next semester. Currently, three of my classes are related to calculus and vectors and derivatives so practicing clac, in general, will help me in my physics class as well as my statics class. Overall I think improving my math skills and derivative skills will be a really important skill for me in the future. "
