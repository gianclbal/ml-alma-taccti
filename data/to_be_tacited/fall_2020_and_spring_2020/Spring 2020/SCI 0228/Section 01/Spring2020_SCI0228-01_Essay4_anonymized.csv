2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,466,"I always thought about this question ever since I was in Calc 2. I always thought, ""How are these complex math problems going to help me in the future or in real life problems?"" I never found the answer to that question while I was in Calc 2. I went with what I was learning due to the need of the class to move on. Although, once I got to Calc 3 I still did not see the need of it during the first exam. The first exam started with vectors and such, but once we got into polar coordinates and more graphing I had found my answer. Once we learned that we can find the volume of a polar coordinate it made me realize that we could use that in real life applications. Once you work with polar coordinates, you feel as if you can find any volume within any shape. You might feel overwhelmed at first. But once you learn how to do it, you feel as if you can accomplish anything that is math related. Some examples of this is that you might want to find the volume of a pool noodle that is in a shape of a parabola. We can graph this pool noodle on a x-y coordinate plane and solve for it, depending on the length of the noodle. We would have to find the integral of it to be able to find the volume."
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,662,"I was just thinking about conservative fields and curl. It's interesting to see how these vector fields work within hydrodynamics. We were shown a video in class and it talked about the curl of the stream and how particles rotate depending on their position, let's say, in a whirlpool or in a stream. One of my questions was suppose we were to have a river flowing and we wanted to have some sort of hydro-based generator to store kinetic energy from the river into potential energy to be used later; 1) would it matter if we built the generator on the left side over the right side (or vice-versa) and 2) Suppose that the particles in the river on the right side rotate clockwise (I'm not sure if they do, but for the sake of the question let's just assume they do), how beneficial, if at all, would it be to divert the right half of the river in a clock-wise manner in an attempt to increase kinetic energy for the generator. I'm not sure if we even use hydro-generators too much anymore, but I really think that there are a lot of opportunities to really maximize the energy we can make from the river and keep energy production eco-friendly. In- theory, this wouldn't really be too hard to figure out I think because there are a lot of ways to test this out and implement much of the data. And the more efficient generators could be used throughout the United States potentially lowering energy costs in the long run."
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,666,"I can contribute to science by learning things people have already discovered, even though I am not making new discoveries, I will most likely share what I know with people who aren't aware of such topics. This will hopefully interest people into looking into the topics and keep the science community striving. Without people's interest in science it may become less and less important in our lives and discoveries. By learning for myself I can hopefully one day make use of what I learned into making something productive as an engineer. Being an engineer has taught me so much more about how we interact with the world around us. So by contributing to the science community we are keeping that world live, in order to keep making new discoveries and promoting growth in the community. Without any of this interest we wouldn't have this technology today, which has come along way in the past 50 years."
