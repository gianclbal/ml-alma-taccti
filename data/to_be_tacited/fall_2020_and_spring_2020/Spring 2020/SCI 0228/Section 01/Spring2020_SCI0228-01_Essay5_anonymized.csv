2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,668,"Reflective Journaling Essay #5For 5 minutes, journal reflectively on:""Why do I want to go into my major?""This essay is meant to remind you of your purpose. This is not meant to be a formal essay. It should be stream-of-consciousness writing from the heart. You will be graded on participation only, not on the specifics of what you say.  5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150-200 words. I am interested in pursuing a career in astrophysics and astronautical engineering because I want to excite the world of science while reminding them about the importance of taking care of our planet. From my ex-christian lens, I long to be a part of something bigger than me, such as the unfolding of the story of the universe to stir from pseudoscience towards a real understanding of our past, present, and future. Lastly, to qualify for space exploration. My fascination with science begun on a school field trip to the Chabot Space & Science Center when I was seven. Seeing all the exhibits, especially the spacesuits and capsules filled me with the hope that one day, I too, could travel far beyond Earth. Unfortunately, like many, I didn’t have the best introduction to STEM courses in my 6-12 education. I came to the realization your gender, parents’ origin, and color of your skin determined how someone treated you in a classroom. Although the education system hasn’t gotten any better, my mindset has completely changed from having open discussions about it with friends and faculty to finding better ways to cope with self-doubt. I don’t know where I would be without that kind of support… I mention this because I was so traumatized that it took until my junior year of college to declare what I was truly passionate about, although I knew since 7 years old."
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,666,"I have always been interested in the way things work in everyday life. I was very good at math and science in school, but I didn't like science alone I wanted to be able to plan and make things. This is why I wanted to go into engineering in college. Being able to understand the world around me has changed my mindset even more. Now that I know more complex equations and theories I look at the world around me different. For example I was riding my motorcycle on the highway and seeing different bridges and street lights and it made me think of what I learned in math class using integral to solve complex engineering equations of static forces. In addition looking at the way I am able to lean on my bike without fall off due to the forces and direction of acceleration always fascinates me when im out in the world. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,667,"I chose civil engineering because I am Interested in becoming an environmental engineer I specifcially really find waste water treatment plants to be really interesting. I overall would like to make a difference as far as helping create more environmentally sustainable solutions for the global community. I also really love science and designing and creating things, I've always leaned towards more creative hobbies and interests, but I have also always been interested in science, ecology, and environmental solutions. Engineering for me is the meeting place between creativity/design and science/environment. I also took a couple of engineering classes in high school and they were the first time I felt like I could keep up with the smart kids in my classes, I struggled with math but in engineering the playing field was even, I could out design them, and take creative approaches to my projects and designs. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,662,"I want to go into my major because I think math is really important and I think that there should be a lot more people in S.T.E.M fields in general. The world can really benefit from the sciences and math helps keep everything uniformly structured. If society ever wanted to advance to the point of space travel, we would have to apply our astro-physics and math theory to traverse safely. On the other hand, if we didn't want to leave Earth, we need models and projections to sort of look into the future and change our habits so that we don't end up killing the planet. I can guess that there are a lot of opportunities to optimize things like the spread of disease in forests and other non-human areas, and better represent data we've collected for growth and harvesting models so that we waste less food/water and still improve the quality of life for everyone."
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,466,"There are many reasons as to why I want to go into this major. When I was in high school I did not know what I wanted to be when I was older. I always had this trouble of trying to figure out what I wanted to do in future. Then I was talking to one of the teachers about what I wanted to major in and I told them that I did not know what I should apply for. We then looked over my grades to see what would be the best fit for me to apply to. My math grades were always my best. After talking to my teachers about it I decided to apply as an engineering major and that is how I got into SFSU. Coming into SFSU, I did not know what I was getting into. I was going into everything blind. After awhile I figured the flow of everything. This made me realize that I actually liked the classes that I was taking. As the years went by I knew that everything would only get harder, but it was fun. That is why I kept pushing for this major."
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,664,I joined this major because I liked math and I thought it was interesting. I wanted to take a challenge especially because math is hard but I think it is fun. I also do think that I enjoy having group work in math. Especially because I can take some time and understand other people's points of view. It is interesting to understand other people and their methods since math doesn't always have just one way to figure out an answer. I think that since math was such a struggle that doing this sci class really helped me figure out what I should be doing in order to succeed. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,665,"The reason I wish to go into my major is because I have fell in love with engineering and everything involved with it. At first when I chose engineering as my major I wasn't sure if I was going to stick with it to the end. However once I got into the engineering classes I realized that it is something that i truly wanted to do. Especially because engineering is a part of everyday life, everything that we interact with on a daily basis was built with some form of engineering and many people do not realize this. Another big reason why I chose it is because when I was your my father always wished for me to grow up and be an engineer so I really hope for one day to show my dad that I have achieved it and see the look on his face when I accomplish my goal. "
