2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,662,"When life get's challenging, I just try to not think about unnecessary stressors and focus on completing the things in front of me. Although I have a hard time being distracted by a lot of things, making small efforts when things seems overwhelming makes for a lot of progress in the long run. I try not to ponder on things that'll bring me down and keep putting in effort in many of the critical things I  need to do. If I don't know what to do, I'll just end up fixating on math homework and work out some problems that I have worked through in the past (though not too far, I want to keep things relatively recent). I also sometimes distract myself by playing some video games or working out on the tips my therapist is helping me with. There is a lot I need to do through out the week, but I try to imagine that it's not that much and that since I've made it past last week, I can work though this one as well.It's been hard recently though, and to be honest I'm incredibly disappointed with the school and my programming professor (Karum Mehta, I regret taking him and the whole class has been a terrible experience). "
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,663,When life gets challenging I just do my best to figure out a clever way to overcome the problem. Sometimes we overthink things when actually the solutions to problems are super simple. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,667,"When faced with a challenge I take a couple of deep breaths and try to push on through. My main flaw is second-guessing myself when it comes to challenges I think I need to work on just trusting myself and my ablitys. When faced with a challenging time, some things that help me are to drink tea, play some music and do some art or sewing something that is repetitive and meticulous to take my mind off of the challenge at hand. I also recommend Yoga or dancing or just something to get one's mind busy. Focusing on centering one's self and opening one's heart to those around them and all of that hippy stuff I grew up on. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,466,"When life gets challenging there are many different ways to distract me from it. My favorite thing to do is to take a lot of naps and try to catch up on sleep to make me feel more rejuvenated. Another thing I try to do is to surround myself around a bunch of friends and just try to go out  as much as possible. Depending on how I feel, I just stay at home and not do anything. I would lay on my bed and just turn on Netflix or a streaming service and binge watch a show. If life gets too challenging to the point where I do not want to deal with anything or anyone, I just drive back home to Los Angeles. When I drive down to LA that is when I know that I need to lay back and not worry about anything. Home is where I can get away from everything. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,664,"When life gets hard I basically try to change my routine and do something that would distract me from the problem/ situatiom. When I was living in sf i would take a walk on the the beach listening to the ocean would really help calm me down. So,etc,es just sitting there and letting the breeze soothe my worries would also be a good stress relief. An example of time that life got really challenging would be when we got thencovid virus and were quarantined would be one of the most challenging time. Where we had to stay home, a way I got rid of ,y stress was by doing other tasks like cooking, baking, excercising and basically anything that would keep my mind away from the fact that we were stuck at home. When life would get challenging I think I also go and get advice from my friends or a life mentor who I trust and could depend on. I don’t think I have one specific way to get over a challenging time but I think the main method I use is distraction. Usually the distraction really helps me basically get an overview of the problem and that would help me get a solution easier. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,666,"When life gets challenging I tend to put things on pause. Having a challenging in my life puts a lot of stress on me so I tend to take a break and relax ease my mind off things . I do this because I believe that I can overcome that challenge once I've had time to clear my mind and have another go. This strategy usually works because giving myself time I can think about different outcomes. Being a very logical thinker I don't always do first thing that comes to mind unless I don't have time to weigh my options. This has helped me overcome many challenges in the past and is currently helping me get through school. Another way I deal with challenges is to read or watch videos on what people have done who have been in my shoes. Getting a different perspective helps me decide on what to do for myself. Talking to my cousin about such things is helpful for me because he knows me well. Having someone's input can affect my outcome because I may not see every thing that I need to take into considerations. Overall, my process for dealing with challenges has improved as I grew older and it is now showing some positive feedback as I am reflecting."
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,665,When life gets challenging for me I have the tendency to want to be alone. Not because I don’t want to be around anyone but rather because being alone allows me to better reflect upon the situation and think about how to overcome the challenge. Whatever the challenge maybe from school to a life situation I like to go about it alone. I know that not every challenge can be won or bettered but even then being alone and thinking about it helps me to decide how to go about it moving forward. I believe that for me a period of being alone and self reflection have always been the best for me find the best way to move forward. I have been doing this since I was in high school and so far it has always worked for me so I have been doing it ever since have seen no reason to change my method.
