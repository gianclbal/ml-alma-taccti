2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,668,"Alexis VazquezSCI 228.01April 8, 2020Week 10Reflective Journaling Essay #3For 5 minutes, journal reflectively on:“Describe how online classes have impacted your learning and what you are doing for self-care. What concerns do you have for your learning and your well-being?” This essay is meant to remind you that who you are, your values, and the people that are important to you are strengths. This is not meant to be a formal essay. It should be stream-of-consciousness writing from the heart. You will be graded on participation only, not on the specifics of what you say.  5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150-200 words.  After you finish your essays, we will provide some class time to discuss your thoughts, to the extent that you feel comfortable sharing.This whole couple of months or year, I should say has drained me to the max. I was crying last night with my sister about how hard it’s been for our family - we have been tested in all ways like financially, emotionally, mentally, and physically. As much as homework and online lectures can serve as a distraction right now, they have just become a nuisance just on top of the state of the world right now. Today I was woken up to the news that Bernie Sanders had suspended his campaign -- I poured my heart and soul into campaigning for him since 2016 and I can’t help but feel empty inside and numb. This pandemic has taught us that we are not in the same boat, we are in the same sea, and some of us don’t have the proper equipment to survive the storm. I realized that the US is more corrupt than I thought and no one but us can stand up for ourselves. Bernie was keeping me sane throughout this pandemic because just the thought of him fighting for us and winning the nomination gave me a peace of mind that it would get better. As for self-care, before today it was making time for the things I love like singing, dancing, and writing, but as of now, I think just getting my pain and anger through punching a bean bag or something. I want things to get better and I think I’m just so drained at the moment to move on. I am doing everything I can to keep it together but I’m really at my breaking point. I worry about all the workload required from these online classes but also all the support my parents will not get from the government for being undocumented.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,662,"Online classes make me feel more disconnected. They have greatly impacted the way that I learn and the efficiency of the material that is being covered has been compromised.The only book i managed to bring with me was my math 301 book, but I;m mostly having trouble with calculus 3 and my book is still back at my dorm. I've tried most of March and half of April to talk with Jessica Robinson about the housing situation, and only now (4/15/2020) have I gotten anything from her, and she didn't even answer any of my questions, she forwarded the email to someone else even though she is the head of housing in UPS (I'm frustrated but I digress). I've almost only had problems surrounding this whole ordeal. Some of my professors have been very helpful and open to flexible and spontaneous office hours, but over all, I want to be able to like, save the lecture so I can refer or review the class again because sometimes I miss out on notes and there's nothing else to fall back on. My main concern about my well being is that I already am immune compromised and I have to go back to school to pick up the rest of my stuff during the peak of the outbreak (approximated graphical peak); and being shut in all day it taking a toll on my health as well. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,466,"Online classes have impacted my learning in many ways. It makes me feel unmotivated, but I have to attend each online class to make sure I do not fall behind. The impact at home makes me feel cramped with my family. It feels as if they do not understand that I have to go to class too and work on homework. They expect me to drop everything and help with whatever they need while I am in class. They also try to talk to me while I am in class. What I do for self-care is that I just take long naps or I sit down and have a cup of coffee. I am concerned that this whole online classes will make me not retain anything that we had learn in this past semester. I'm scared that once we get internship or job interviews, they'll ask specific questions from classes that we are taking currently, but we cannot answer them due to it being a rough time right now."
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,664,"Online classes have been very interesting to me. I think that at times I am able to really concentrate in classes, but then it is very easy to get lost and blank out. Just listening to classes is one thing, but actually taking exams are harder. I feel like actually taking exams are much harder.  Especially for math, in-person exams we would get partial credit, however now we only get full points or no points.  Online classes have been convenient, but it is hard to keep track of all of the classes and hw assignments. The concern I have is the subjects I learn this semester since they are online, I will not have a strong base and because of that, it will affect my future subjects. Another concern I have is, due to everyone having online classes, sometimes I am not able to attend my morning 8 am classes due to wifi issues and I am afraid I am not getting my 100% education. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,665,The shift to online classes have effected my learning more than I expected it to. At first I did not think much of it but after a few weeks I realized it was bigger adjustment then I though it would be. I have found that it is more difficult for me to stay focused and motivated during these online lectures as it is not as easy to interact with students or teachers. It is easier for me to learn in a classroom setting rather than through a screen. As for personal self-care I have been trying to do self workouts in my room and reading more books instead of only watching tv.  My biggest worry for my learning going forward is being able to stay focused and motivated in my classes next semester if this online instruction is still in place. Since I realized it is easier for me to learn in a more hands on classroom setting rather than through a screen.
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,667,Online classes have definitely affected my learning negatively but I am slowly adjusting as we go along. I think most of all I miss group work so I'm really glad I have this class so I can still work on calc in groups. I am also really missing my friends so that impacts me negatively and also the increase of work overall makes it really hard to keep up while I'm dealing with so many other issues that are popping up in my life. But as we move along I am learning in different ways than before. I did have a 40-minute commute to school so that extra time is nice to have. I've picked up my ukelele again which is really fun its nice to feel productive and like I'm learning something. It's giving me small victories which is really important because I haven't been performing as well in tests and quizzes. I also have been cooking more and drinking lots of tea which helps a ton. I've also been infrequently going on short runs and doing yoga on days I have a lot of anxious energy. I did also get my unemployment card in the mail so that's rad. Overall the day to day is getting easier. So things are looking up. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0228,SI,1,666,"Online classes have changed a lot for me because I am much more lazy at home. I also do not enjoy sitting at home all day long working in the comfort of my own home. There is no discipline here because its my own room. Having a professor in front of me, creates an environment that makes me want to learn. Compared to being in my room feeling like I have double the amount of work because I have to do classwork and homework all from one chair for all my classes. It gets to the point where I need to find different places to study. I miss having student interactions which has had an effect on my mental well being. I see the same three people all day, conversations are not as much fun because its the same. Also, being home all day makes me some what depressed because I'm here stressing about school with no where to escape to.  "
