2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,604,"As I said in the previous Reflective Journal whenever I get to a point where I feel like something is getting to me or I have a lot to do I say to slow down and take things a step at a time and it usually calms me down to a point where I'm never really stressed. The reason I think this way is because my parents, they had two kids before they were twenty so they understood that the road ahead was going to be extremely challenging. My parents would always stress how they took things one step at a time and controlled what they could control. Which in hindsight seems very obvious, but a lot of people are very caught up in the moment and don't realize how much they can accomplish if they just sit and do something one step at a time. To be fair though, this has taken a long time for me to really realize it because I was pretty unmotivated and lazy in high school and my whole first year in college. But, I am still glad I sat and realized it because it would have never led me to actually pursue engineering. "

2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,601,This is a tough question to answer. I came from a complicated big family. I am the youngest of 5 and the first to go to college. My grandparents adopted me and have taken care of me ever since. I feel as if I owe my life to them for saving me from my biological parents at a young age. They have since then paid for the majority of my education and have provided a place for me to live and food to eat. I feel I owe it to my grandparents to see me graduate before thy move on. They are both in their 70s with mild health conditions. They have taught me skills and lessons that I may have not of gotten from having young parents. I also have benefited from this scenario by having examples of my siblings shortcomings and have used those to my advantage to learn from their mistakes as well as my grandparents. It is largely because of them that I want to be able to provide a college education for my children.

That is true in my community right now, a lot of job is getting more high tech right now, their requirement is need to get the degree in the college and get the experience in the game.

My parents are actually the ones to convince me to go to SFSU , when i was a bit skeptical because I was thinking my financial aid wasn't going be enough for me to live here. Fortunately things worked out OK, We dd not have to pay anything out of pocket.

Although i did have to leave my current work to move up here, but they will still have a spot for me when i come back. Even though I may be far away from home, I still know that my family will always have my back. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,602,"My family has always been there whenever I needed them. They try to give me the best advice they have. Since I started college they have been really understandable since it's really different from high school. Yes, in college you get to choose your own schedule but it does not mean you have more free time. There is always something happening everyday. Since I work and go to school to help myself and my parents, it's hard sometimes to keep up or even see where you left off. Whenever I am struggling they always try to help me in what I need, that being physically or financially. For example when I'm not at work they know it's because I need to work on homework. At times it could be really hard but I'm happy that I have my family supporting me throughout the way and motivating me."
