2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,604,"In my opinion, the most relevant lab is the ocean acidification one since fossil fuels are on the more recent side of history. The effect we have on the environment is very bad, but when it comes to the ocean it is a whole other beast because by messing with the ocean we may mess with the food chain. At the bottom of the food chain, there are these little plants in the ocean called phytoplankton and they contribute massive amounts of oxygen and they also hold massive amounts of Carbon Dioxide. Since they cover basically the entire ocean it makes them half of the world's carbon sink, so if the ocean’s water increases in acidity and temperature, the phytoplankton won’t survive. Which in turn means that the biggest carbon sink is dying, making the global temperature rise and making the oceans even warmer which just kills most of the things in the ocean. This then becomes an even bigger problem because the ocean has the largest source of biodiversity for the entire world which means most of the world's food webs are tied to the ocean which makes them all that much more messed up. So if we can avoid screwing up our biggest resource on this planet I feel like it would help a bit."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,599,"When we learn about the oxide and reduce in the class, which we can think about how the food to touch the oxygen it will change to the food, to become it can't eat, like a apple, we need to put something on it to protect it, so we can make sure it can eat. Also, when we talk about the rate reactant, we can think about the Temperature, for example, when we not put the milk into the some place is cold, the milk will can't drink in one day, but if you put it in the place is cold, then you can keep then milk a long time. because the temperature can effect the rate of reactant, which mean when the temperuture is high, the react speed will increase, but when the temperature is low, the speed will decrease. When we learn about the acid rain, which the compound is make from the factory, which is a human act to make it, so it can be fix it by our act, the government can stop to use a lot factories, to make less gas to produce a acid rain, or use something to make the ph value to be balanced."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,598,"The concept of light interested me this whole semester. How different light's have all different sorts of wavelength'sand frequencies. It's used to help us see in the dark, to helping us take x-rays at the hospitals. I then asked myself, is there a way we can use light to be more efficient to help light the streets? Answer is that yes it can, in this particular case its the concept of florescent lights. This type of light shines brighter than the non florescent ones. They can help by putting them in parks for the nights and even neighborhoods. Especially in not so safe places where it's not an ideal place to live in. It would help the residents of those neighborhoods feel a lot more safe. And being able to put them in place wouldn't even cost much for the city. As replacing the old bulbs with the new ones aren't to difficult to do. This would greatly benefit the city. Helping the community should always be at the top of the city councils list. I know things are tough right now, but in these trying times is where we as communities can come together and help each other out. Updating light fixture in city streets is one definite way we can improve our cities. And one way learning about how light works helps out.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,602,"In my English class we've been talking about COVID19 and how it has affected many people around the world. This is very important because many people are losing their job and even their homes because they can't pay the rent anymore. For example not many people have essential jobs to be working during this pandemic. Whatever they have saved in their saving account has to last them until this whole situation is over. The only thing is that nobody knows when this will finish but when it does end, it won't be the same. In my class we decided to focus in one situation that we see is happening around where we live and do more research about it. After we find the answers we want we will share with our classmates to make them feel like there are small solutions to some of the things around them. For example getting yourself involved in activities inside your house, controlling your anxiety, or even helping yourself with mental heath. Mental health has been one of the biggest problems right now since many people want to leave their homes knowing that is not the correct time to be going outside. Limiting everything can help you and your family stay safe. "
