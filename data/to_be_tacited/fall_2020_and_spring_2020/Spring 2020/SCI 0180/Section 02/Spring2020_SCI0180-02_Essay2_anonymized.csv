2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,600,"What I do when life gets challenging at school is what I do is wake up hella early like I used to do in high school. I'm talking about waking up at 5 or 5:20, by waking up this early I would have enough time to eat a pimp ass breakfast and study hella coo and cram a bunch of knowledge in a short amount of time. Other things I do when life gets academically challenging is that I ask fellow peers for help or I go to some sort of tutoring to help me. Other things I do when life gets challenging is that I simply forget about them. I forget about these challenges by having me time, by doing my hobbies like playing video games, hanging out with friends or watching a show or movie to help me get my mind out of things which honestly really help a lot."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,603,"What do I do when life gets challenging, I would find any possible solutions to face this challenge like when I don't know what to do in school I would ask friends about the class. I would ask questions like chemistry and math I would look up on youtube and look back at the lessons since now everything is recorded so easier to go back at the lesson. Another challenge I faced is how to go to San Francisco State because I live in San Jose I would get their late to my classes but now I use the train then taking an uber to make it to school but I have to leave early like 6:49 am I have to face the challenge every time I go to school but it's worth it. A challenge today can be easier or harder but in the future who knows it could be easier because you are doing the hardest challenge at the moment that is my mindset that is what I do when it gets challenging."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,601,"Lab 6: Cartography (Map Making)            When life gets challenging I usually do several things. I always start by having some sort of little “freak out”, I start to get worried and have anxiety of all the things I have taken on and have to accomplish. Then the real actual first step is to start by writing down in my personal planner what has to be done, when it has to be done by and exactly when during the week I am going to spend time on each task. This works best for me because my planner acts as sort of a roadmap towards my goals which is 100% completion with the highest quality of work in the most efficient way possible. When I don’t write out my weekly goals, I find it easy to get distracted and not accomplish daily tasks ultimately steering me away from my intended goal. I also find it hard to keep track of all the things I need to get done without my planner."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,602,"When life gets challenging I try to leave aside whatever I'm doing and just take a break. When I leave everything it gives me time to think what I'm doing. Sometimes when you feel challenged you don't realize what you did until you stop. It helps me to relax and think what I should do first instead of doing everything all at once. At least in my opinion when I'm stressed I tend to do everything that I have to do all at the same time to have free time. One thing I learned is that you can't do that, for you to progress on something  you have to start doing one thing instead of five things. It's really important that you take care of your self first before anything."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,598,"When i hit a brick wall on life, usually what i would do is i would just immerse myself into playing video games or with a good movie or show or have a good gym session. Or I would also go to my favorite spots to eat, depending on my budget. It doesn't happen to often but  when it does i usually like to just drift myself out of reality. I'm sure that's what most people tend to do. Especially being a student sometimes the workload just gets to you. My parents sometimes don't understand, that its not always as easy as they think it is. That's why when they see me relaxing for a bit or playing video games or watching tv they would get mad and tell me to be studying instead. I do like to take long breathers constantly so i won't go to insane, and it also helps out with my work too, because sometimes i would be stuck in a problem and then after i take a break, i suddenly see the solution. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,599,"when my life gets challenging, I will do something to relax myself first, for me I will say, when my life get challenging, it mean its the way to be grow right now because every challenging I can learn a lot of things in there, so I need to face to there. But i need to relax it first, so I can face to it 100% and get a good result on it. Also I will try to talk to my friend for that because your friends is a good support for u to do those challenging. and then when u face that don't be shy and nervous because its not goo for you to having those, overcome those is good for us in the future. so just relax when it get challenging and ready for facing it. that what I will do when I got challenging on my life every time."
