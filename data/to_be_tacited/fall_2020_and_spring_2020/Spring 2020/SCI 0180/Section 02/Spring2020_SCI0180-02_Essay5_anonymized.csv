2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,600,"""Why do I want to go into my major?"" The reason as to why I want to go  into my major is because which is mechanical engineering is simply because I want to make cool stuff. When I was younger I sucked ass at most of my classes, however I did alright/good in math. My math teachers who were former engineers at one point motivated students. I want to get into my major because I feel like i'll be able to do almost anything. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,599,"I want to choose environmental science because I like to know about trees and the earth, when I in high school at Hong Kong, we need to choose 2 different major to study. I choose geography and chemistry, and i like a lot when I study about trees. When I come to America, I know that there's is a major is about it, so that's why I want to choose this major, I mean this is the major I like to study, it is fun to do it, I can go out and see how the trees looks like, I remember that someone tell me different trees have different smell, I think that is interesting, which make me more to choose that . But my mom don't want me to do this because they think do the job about the tree is not worth, and I can't get too much money, so they want me to change the major, but I try to talk to them about it, and they change their mind which let me to choose this major. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,601,"The main reason I decided to go into my major of BS Environmental Studies: Natural resource Management and Conservation, can be attributed to my upbringing in the Boy Scouts. One summer when I was in middle school, I went and stayed a week on Catalina Island where myself and hundreds of other scouts to part in earning merit badges. One of the merit badges I earned at the end of the week was Environmental Science. Environmental Science merit badge was one of a selected handful of “silver ringers”, meaning a required merit badge to earn before becoming an eagle scout and thus my interest in the environment was solidified. I would ideally love to continue my education in graduate school focusing on a master’s in public administration or master’s in public policy. I wish to use the technical science skills gained in my undergraduate program and combine them with a public administration degree to go into a city state or federal agency where I can further promote my interest for conserving the natural environment."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,602,"I want to go into my major because I've always wanted to be part of building or creating something. The person that really got me more into this was my dad. My dad owns his own company and he does the concrete with any patterns they might like. This semester I'm taking ENGR 100 and my focus is Civil Engineering. I have learned a lot in that class that is really interesting. I noticed that you have a lot of options to choose from. I've been really interesting in foundation, construction and being an inspector. Many might say that is weird seeing a women going into a field like these but in my opinion anyone can do what they wish. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,604,"Honestly, after evaluating all the majors, I realized that the only thing I could bear to study and get really invested in would be Computer Engineering. I feel like the topics you learn in engineering are so interesting because most of the modern world is covered in electronics with wireless communications and connections. Even in chemistry when I sit and watch videos or actually attempt to learn a lesson I genuinely get so intrigued because the concept of Chemistry is so interesting.  It is essentially the building blocks of life itself and why things happen. Which is what makes me so happy about having my major. Because, especially in Computer Engineering, the classes that I take throughout getting a degree are things I can be invested in which allows me to essentially want to try harder at being the best I can be in the subject. Which, I assume, would be better for finding a job "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,598,"The reason why I chose civil engineering is because it's something that in the beginning I did not know what it was. But after searching for what my possible majors could be, it was the one that stuck out the most. Also having the title of engineer sounds cool.  Also, I like to challenge myself when it comes to work. I think also because one of my uncles in Mexico, has a degree in architecture, which does also have my interest but not as much as civil. I also know that the salary and benefits of an engineer are pretty great, even at an entry position. Another reason why i chose this is because, I don't have many friends from home or childhood friends who studied engineering. I would be the only one from my direct group of friends with that title. Not to put down what they got their degree in. Since i am the 1st member of my direct family to go to a university, it also inspired my younger brother to study in the same field that I'm in. So my brother was also inspired by me as well. I'm very excited to finish my journey to become what I've been striving for. "
