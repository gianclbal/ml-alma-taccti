Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,598,"I am here to get a great grade for my chem class. I have not taken chem in a good minute so some of the stuff might go over my head but I am willing to do everything i can to get the highest grade possible. I am also here because i want to succeed in life, hence why I am in a four year university. I transferred from another cl state but they did not have the classes that i needed for my major and so i transferred to sfsu. My intended major is civil engineering, I've been striving to be that since after high school, in which I went to a four year university. I know it won't be an easy road, nothing ever is, but i am willing to put my blood and sweat into it. I am looking forward to the challenges that the semester will bring me.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,599,"I will in this class because, I want to be more good on Chem 180, my English skill is not that good so I need more time to understand the topic, and the topic is really new to me so I want to re-learn it again. I want to review the topic what we did in the class, and then I can understand more things in the topic so I can know how to do homework and do well in the test. And then in the side class I think I can easy to ask other people for the help since we rush in the morning class. I feel that in the side class is a good class for me to do more example question in there, to more understand the topic and working together which is good for me to work on better than doing without myself. so that's why I in this class. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,600,"The reason as to why I am here is simply because I needed help understanding some aspects of chemistry. There are many things that I don't understand and have questions for. I joined this class with the purpose of it helping me in furthering my knowledge of chem since my main chem 180 class is just to short off a lecture, just being 50 min. I also wanted to join the class, because unlike chem 180 with 100+ students, this class is pretty coo just being about 10 people entirely. Another reason why I joined this class was thanks to another peer who recommended I join since we already were in the same chme 180 class. This class was also appealing to me, because it's 1 more unit and there basically is no final for this class since it is just and extension of the main chem class which is coo."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,601,"Lab 6: Cartography (Map Making)            I am here because I feel it is necessary for me to get the most out of my time enrolled in chemistry for energy and the environment as well as a student at the university. I feel by enrolling in this class, I am making the most of the opportunities and resources available to me. This way by being in this class, I know I am taking the necessary steps to set myself up for success and not failure. Chemistry is a difficult subject. However, I personally am very much interested by this topic and am even more enthusiastic in being able to make connections from real world situations and problems that can be traced back to chem 180. Therefore the ability to be able to leave this class with a deeper understanding of the natural environment and my interactions with it are of the utmost importance to me, which is ultimately why I enrolled in SCI 180."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,602,"I am here because I want to learn and understand chemistry in different ways than how my professor does. I also get to ask any of the questions I might have about the lectures we have gone through. Now that I'm in this class I can work with other students that are in my lecture classes and try to figure out what some vocabulary might mean or even solving equations together. Most importantly, I want to make sure that I know what I'm doing in the class because if I don't then there is no point of me being part of the class. I want to make sure that I know everything so can finish Chem 180 with at least a B or higher. I want to make sure that later on when it gets a bit more difficult I have the resources to help me when I feel stuck. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,2,603,The reason I am here at this class because I really wanted the unit to get a minimum of 12 units for my cal grant then my first time coming to this class felt really helpful. Especially when we were preparing for the first exam they gave me the cheat sheet and helped me with questions. I am here to get help on Chem 180 and to pass the class with a B or higher I heard from my friends that the class is difficult. When my T.A. told us about a tutoring class where I can receive a unit for showing up and getting help. I decided I would show up because I believe this class will help me pass Chem 180.
