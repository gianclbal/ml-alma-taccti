2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,596,"Richard Rodriguez Valencia April 28, 2020 						  Reflection 4  Why we need to add and subtract chemicals?  	I have looked at some of the of adding and subtraction of chemicals and it might be weird, but I have seen that is ind of how some bombs were made because they have a chemical reaction that they are forced to make even tho those chemicals don’t really go together and that is what makes a reaction of the explosion because the chemicals try to separate. Of course there are other reasons why chemicals are added and not forced to they just naturally do which then creates new chemicals and those chemicals can create new reactions and so on.  	Other then that I couldn’t find anything else in class that I could relate to but in this early on class of April 28 I had seen that some of the energy graphs and work functions are the same as my engineering class which I think is cool because I really didn’t thing chemistry had to do with Engineering so it got kinda interesting because I really don’t like chemistry. Other then those 2 I really don’t find connections too"
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,133,How can stoichiometry be used to determine water safety?Stoichiometry can be used to determine water safety by possibly taking a sample from a water supply. Then calculating the amount of chlorine (or other substances) that is considered acceptable to drink. This process can ensure that water meets environmental regulations and that its safe to drink without causing health issues. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,595,"The topic that can really help society is all the different types of energy. Before this class I did know that there were other types of ways to get energy such as, soler, and foill fuel. What I didn't understand is how solar energy can actually be better in efficiency. If people were to learn how we could use solar power, it could help us improve technology, and also help the world with its carbon levels. The carbon cycle was actually a very important thing to learn. Although I had an idea of what happens in it, I had no idea how important every step of the way really is. In addition if everyone learns about the carbon cycles then everyone can contribute. This will help future generations. It will provide a healthier world for them to live in."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,591,"One of the concepts in class that was covered this semester is unit conversions.  everyone should learn unit conversions because we are now in global market.  We are competing with not only with the people next to us but with some other person around the world for jobs.  We use unit conversions In many fields cooking, engineering, international business, sciences and even in auto mechanics we use metric and standard size tools, even temperature has 3 or 4 different type of measuring.  It benefits people because the smarter a society is the better off we'll all be as a whole.  The End"
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,219,"The concept that I am choosing to talk about is the carbon cycle. My question is: how can we reduce the effect of excess carbon dioxide in our atmosphere? Our chemistry lab #11 started off by introducing the importance of carbon dioxide in our world’s atmosphere, but how higher levels are dangerous.Coming back to this after i first thought about this topic, wow. We can see how this pandemic has influenced the carbon emission in the atmosphere in such a short amount of time. It’s simply astounding seeing pictures of clearer skies in cities that used to be heavy with polluted skies. It’s also great seeing nature start to recover from the pollution we cause while living our normal lives.This leads me to answering my original question though. How can we reduce the effect of excess carbon dioxide in our atmosphere? What we learned is that carbon storages exist as part of the natural resources of the Earth that can absorb excess carbon dioxide. We can help these habitats perform better by enriching them with biosolids and just overall making sure that they are healthy and thriving such as by warding off pests or, in the case of trees, preventing deforestation or at least limiting it."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,592,"Energy Temperature and Wave length Relationship? Kirchholf discovered the inverse relationship between energy also known as temperature and the wave length. The overall wave length corresponds to color and the more energy there is the smaller the wave length is. The most important think to remember is that the shortest wave length = highest energy = highest frequency= cancer. This is important to remember because based on the energy levels and the colors being shown we can see what kind of wave lengths will hurt us or not. For example, we know that the sun has a very high energy level that can cause burns on our skin, this is why we use sunblock to reflect some of those rays. Another thing would be seeing how strong specific waves are. Tv remote rays are not harmful to us because it has such low energy but microwaves have high energy waves that can cause radiation. Overall this is a very useful tool to understand in our daily lives, we can understand the waves we do use and be more aware of what stringer waves can do to us. "
