2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,593,"When life gets challenging I have a few things that I turn to. Usually, when I am stressed or worried I will take some time to go skateboarding. This takes my mind off of things and it relaxes me as well. It is sort of like an outlet for all of my stresses and hardships. Another thing I will do is turn to my family and friends. Being around my friends always makes me feel a lot happier and they remind of the good things in this world. My family always comforts me as well. There have been many times this semester where I have had to call my mom or my dad when I was stressed about something in school or another worry I had and both of them always help me out. I have also recieved lots of help from my brother. When times get rough I also try my best to maintain a positive attitude which I think is the key to getting yourself through difficult times. One more thing is listening to music. Music always relaxes me and calms me down in times of worry."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,594,"SCI 180  Edgar Ivan Alba  920393211  2/25/20  ""What do I do when life gets challenging?""  When life gets challenging, I usually just take a break for myself, a breather. That's when I reflect and observe what going on, only that way I can have like a plan where I can at least try to move on.  It’s important for me to have a growth mindset and have room for mistakes. It's been really hard to adapt to the commute to school, I feel like I would be more successful if I lived on campus because all my resources are there on school, but I have to come back home every day and I spend an average of 3-4 hrs. on transportation to get to school and back. When this semester gets challenging the thing I would do I guess is reach out for help on the subjects that I need the most help with, for example on my math HW I need tutoring to complete my HW."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,590,"When life becomes challenging, I turn to many things.First and foremost is music. I was placed in music classes when I was very young, about 6, and learned many instruments and studied music theory for a ling time. As a result, it has become part of my life, and I rely on it to keep me going. Aside from playing it, I listen to ALL types of music. Rock, Rap, classical, country, latino, Bollywood, jazz, you name it. My general rule is if it slaps, I listen. Secondly, I have many plants at home that I care for. Since I couldn't bring my cats to school with me :/, my plants are my babies. I find taking care of another living thing is therapeutic. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,592,"Adrian Burgos What do I do when life gets challenging? 	When life gets challenging I tend to fight til it goes away. I reevaluate the situation and compare it to what I’ve already overcome. If i can make it through worse things than I can handle what's next. I see things as something that won't matter a week or month from now. Time heals most and most things are fixable besides death of course. I think everything can be resolved with simple conversation and understanding and a plan too. But it's all different I guess. Despite changing my outlook on things I go to therapy, meditate, workout, and shop when I need me time to distract myself. I also stay busy with friends when I need to get my mind off things. We go out in the city and fins something new to do all the time. Take pictures and enjoy where we are, school may be tough but the city makes up for it. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,591,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?""     When Life gets challenging, what do I do?  I guess it depends on what were talking about.  I guess the most obvious answer is asking questions.  What do I need to do to get past this challenge?  Usually the answer presents itself.  I would ask people for help.  Sometimes I need to analyze what the problem is, break it down into smaller manageable pieces.  Sometimes I need to step away and come back to it at another time after I took a break.  Sometimes just bitching about it releases the stress.  Once you realize that doesn’t get it done you realize that the only one that’s gonna get it done is you so you got to get work"
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,219,"When life gets challenging, I always need time to recharge and take a step back to look at things from a bigger-picture standpoint. Sometimes when you are in the middle of everything, you get tunnel vision and become blindsighted. Since I am my most efficient self when I am calculated and organized, I take the time to re-evaluate things.I acknowledge that going through challenges are necessary in growing as an individual and I use that to motivate me to move forward from any potential setbacks. I also go to my friends who I feel comfortable opening up to and express my feelings so that I do not just keep them weighted in my head.Other times, depending on the challenge(s), I resort to activities such as meditation and working out to help clear my mind. Clearing my mind often helps me reconsider certain challenges under a clearer mind."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,133,"I'm assuming it's just pertaining to school so, when life gets challenging at school I tend to be consumed by it but it in a good way. I spend all of my time focusing my energy to solve the issue at hand. Balancing work, school, extracurriculars and my sanity is challenging. I literally have no days off not even with this whole corona-cation. I plan my weeks out thoroughly so that I know what I need to get done and at what time. That's how I overcome challenges at school and this practice helps me overcome challenges in my personal life as well. "
