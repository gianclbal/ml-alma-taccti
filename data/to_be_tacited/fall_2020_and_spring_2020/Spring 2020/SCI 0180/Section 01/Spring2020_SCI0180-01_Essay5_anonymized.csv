2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,591,I wanted to get into engineering because I was into cars and motorcycles.  I went to school for automotive and never really pursued it.  When I decided to go back to school for a bachelors degree I thought this was a good way to be around something I enjoy doing.  I decided not to go into auto mechanics because I felt I would rather work with my brain than work with my hands.  I felt that I was decent at math and like to problem solve and create and thought this would be a good fit.  
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,219,"I want to go into the STEM field because I was always fascinated by science, technology, and engineering growing up as a kid. More specifically, I am interested in their applications in real-world situations. Projects that range from improving and innovating a specific product on the market like creating flying cars, to positively impacting the longevity of this world itself through solar technology, the work needed to continually strive to accomplish these feats lies in the STEM field. To me, as daunting as it is to equip myself with the necessary knowledge through a STEM degree, I believe that once I am that moment where I am working on a diverse range of projects in innovation, I will find a type of fulfillment in my life from accomplishing one of my goals and not giving up or caving into other career fields. While I am actually interested in various fields of study such as some aspects of business or even in teaching, having an expertise in engineering and technology is where I want my focus to be in terms of professional development. There is just something about the STEM field that really catches my interest, perhaps the limitless possibilities in innovation and discoveries that are out there just waiting to be uncovered; and no, I am not planning on uncovering them myself, but I do want to be part of the development of concepts and ideas and how things came to be. I personally have met a good amount of people who work in the STEM field and the way that they convey what they work on makes me want to also be able to communicate like them in the future. Overall, while I have a deep respect for people with expertise and dedication to their chosen field(s), I highly admire those in the STEM field and know that one day I would like to build myself up to the point where I can work on different types of STEM projects and potentially work under the influence of tech giants who have a very real positive impact on the lives of everyday people."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,589,"So currently, I'm majoring in computer engineering and plan to work in a large company, or least that is my goal. The reason I chose computer engineering is that I was indecisive on which part of engineering I would like to pursue, the hardware side of the software side. Luckily it tackles both sides in-depth. It's the bridge between hardware and software. I want to have choices to see what is right for me. Also, I feel my major is very challenging, and that is what I like. I challenge myself in order to become a better worker. So far, I enjoy the classes and taking, and I hope it stays that way."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,588,I want to go into my major which is civil engineering because I was always curious about buildings and how it was able to withstand earthquakes and strong winds. I also want to go into my major because I like math and finding ways to solve things. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,593,"My major is environmental science. The reason I became interested in this major is that I grew up in a very rural area that gave me a strong love for nature and care for the conservation of the environment. My childhood was spent mostly outside doing activities that included hiking, fishing, and horseback riding with my family. I also became very interested in the major after taking AP environmental science in High School. The major seems like it will be really fun as I would get to learn a lot about natural earth systems and nature and I would get to participate in hands-on learning. I am hoping that this major will also bring me outdoors often. I also hope that after I complete college I will be able to find a job that involves environmental conservation and also involves spending a lot of time in the outdoors. So far this major has been very interesting so I think I will likely stick with it."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,592,"The reason I want to go into my major, civil engineering is because I have always been creative as a child. Since I can remember I've always loves building things and fixing stuff around the house. It's a different form of art but is an art to me. I take pride in all the things I've created. When I was in middle school I joined a class called MESA and they allowed me to build and create on another scale. These were things that had meaning like popsicle stick bridges, and cardboard boats. It was fun but at the time but taught me the science and physics behind engineering. I continued this into high school and decided that nothing made me more excited then to go to my MESA club and create. I looked into majors that connect to the stem friend and decided on civil engineering. I chose that not only because of the major but the purpose. I want to create a bridges, cites and build a better world. I want to leave my mark for future generations to enjoy. I know it will be hard but I am so excited to turn this dream into a reality. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,596,"Richard Rodriguez Valencia  May 5, 2020  Why this major?  	At first I had chosen the major of business because I was all about math and felt great about it but really when I got to college there is not a lot of math that is used when you have your company because that is what we have this other employers doing that job. So me creating my. Business was not going to make it worth a while of me using math or maybe it was depending how big it grew, but something that caught my eye was the feel go engineering. At first I tough it was all nerds gathered together to just talk about computers, games and other weird things but the reason why I didn’t understand them was because they were talking another advanced math words. That had really changed my mind about the whole math and the way I view engineers.It would also be something that is really trending in society and the world. The world is seeking for new technology and why not maybe major in both. Create a business and me knowing my engineer way to create things and make the company an actual big deal. My main idea was creating my own car brand so that would actually be cool having that business and with my ideas of technology. Technically everything original by me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,597,"I have several reasons why I chose Civil Engineering as my major. In the engineering field there aren’t enough Latinx people in the field let alone Latinas, I want to change that. I feel as though it’s important to inspire and encourage other young Latinas to be in the STEM field in order to have more representation. Representation of Latinas in the STEM field is important to me because I can help create a diverse professional field that will benefit our society in the future. On a personal note, I want to inspire my niece who I want to encourage her to be in the STEM field as well and be someone who she can look up too. I want to guide and assist when it’s her time to go to college since I know it was hard to get where I’m at. I would also want to leave a physical impact on my community such build and maintain roads, bridges, and dams that will support and make my community better in the long run. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,133,"I want to go into Civil Engineering, more specifically Environmental Engineering, because I want to create innovate designs that will take into consideration our living environment. I want to protect the environment from us, as well as, to protect us from the environment. I want to focus more on air pollution and better ways to store it, abolish it, or reverse it. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,595,"I don't really know what made me choose computer engineering. The reason why I chose this was mostly because it combines two things that I was interested in. Computer science and engineering. I do know that it has a lot of value as far as what it brings to technology. Such as phones, cars, energy efficiency, and so on. I do find the subject interesting but I am still figuring out what I want to do with myself. "
