Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,133,"In all honesty SF State was not my first choice, as a matter of fact, it was my last choice because it did not have my desired major. My major is Environmental Architecture but I am currently following the Civil Engineering path at state. I got a low grade my last semester of my senior year in AP Physics and it wrecked my GPA which got my acceptance revoked by the UC’s I got into. So that’s why I’m here taking CHEM 180 which led me to take SCI 180 so I can get a good grade and transfer out of SFSU. "

2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,590,"I am here, in SFSU taking science courses for many reasons.First and foremost, as an environmental science major, I am studying ti because I have always felt a close connection to nature, and seeing as the older generations are doing nothing to save it, I feel it is our generation's responsibility to step up and fight climate change. Secondly, I am in college because my mother wasn't and experienced many difficulties because of that. I am here to do what she didn't and prove to my family and friends I can go through a higher education. "

2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,219,"I am here because despite all the order that needs to be in place for our universe and the things in it to be in relative equilibrium, I am a product of the spontaneity of our universe. I am here because as humans, we learned to be more present and to have direction in our lives. I believe the human experience is to build and develop a purpose in our lives beyond our primal instincts using the complex minds that we were gifted with. For me personally, I have chosen to try to be a positive effect on those who I am connected with. In this present moment, I am building myself up through education and experiences so that later in my life, I will be able to contribute to the personal growth of others and help them through their endeavours."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,593,"I am here mainly to help myself with my chemistry class and to better master the material. I am hoping that this class will also take some stress off of the studying aspect of Chem 180 and will allow me to study better by having perfect opportunities to discuss the material with the instructors and with my classmates. Chemistry so far is going pretty well I think. The homework can be a little difficult, mostly because a lot of the material on it can be things that we haven't covered yet. But, if I just spend a lot of time on it and study the material while I am doing it, then it usually works out a lot better. I realized that asking questions about it is helpful too. Yesterday I went and talked to my lab instructor about a homework problem and then I talked to professor Lacy about it. The labs so far are pretty cool, although they tire me out a little bit and can be somewhat confusing. At the moment I just hope that I can get enough studying in for my test next week!"
