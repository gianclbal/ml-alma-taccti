2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,589,"I'm very fortunate that I have two siblings that are currently in college that can guide through the college experience. My first semester went smoothly and a part of it will have to go for them both. Also, my parents are extremely supportive. Being a supportive person and respectful person are some of my family values. Keep moving forward by working hard and you'll reach your goal is what I strive for but I also need to be realistic and know my limits.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,595,"In my family hard work has always been valued. This can be seen in a physical state such as people working hard to get the things that they want. This has helped me navigate through college in the sense that I am putting in the effort to do all the things I need to do, no matter how hard they can be. Another value that my community put in me is self love. This is something that I have struggled with in the past. Now that I am in college I know when I need a break from things. It's important to love yourself because that makes you realize that you have value. This can help you in class in ways that I didn't even know. For example I was more confident in my answers. There are other things that I have learned in college such as flexibility. This is the ability to adapt to what is going on. Although it may be hard to do so at times, it is important to find new ways to overcome challenges."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,588,"I really value my friends, especially in college when things can get really challenging. It's hard to do things alone and bottle up your thoughts because it can take a toll on you, but when you have friends around its refreshing because they're going through the same struggles in college and you can talk about things that are stressful and they'll understand. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,592,"When I go through college I remind myself of how much of a blessing it is to be able to come to a university as such. Not only am I first generation to do so but to do it in the city of San Francisco makes it even better. I have the city at my fingertips and I never run out of things to do. Besides that my family never got the chance to go to college because their parents didn’t believe there was much after high school and never knew how valuable a education can be. I remind myself to keep pushing and fighting to make my parents dreams come true and do things that they didn't get the chance to do. I hope I can make them proud and show them that all they have sacrificed has not been wasted. From my grandparents being from Mexico to my parents growing up poor in LA, to me becoming an engineer. A dream and legacy I hope I start. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,219,"One of my communities continually enforced the idea that making mistakes is part of the learning process. That is why throughout college when I have inevitably made mistakes here and there, I never let them keep me down for long before I know to move on and to learn from my mistakes.This same community also taught me to stay strong and persevere through hard times, for not only do they not last forever, but how you overcome them helps shape who you are and builds your character. In college, I have had rough patches here and there that I wish I had never gone through. Looking back on those times recently, I realized that how I got through those times to get to where I am at today is part of my story. I recount those memories as some that I went through but I can help others avoid by making sure they are aware of pre-existing factors that can eventually lead to those harder times that many go through during college.One last concept that was drilled into me is that when you want something, you have to be willing to work hard for it. Especially when you want to elevate your current conditions, you have to put in the effort first before you can see any changes. I was a poor student at many points in college where I thought I could just get by in my classes and for some subjects do the minimal work, but going through college like that is nowhere nearly as satisfying as putting in the work and effort and knowing all that dedication resulted in a satisfactory grasp of the material."
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,133,"My mom and my grandma raised my sister and I. I believe we are all strong-willed, go-getters because of the way we were raised. Having a difficult upbringing can go two ways, you can let your struggles consume you and control your actions or you can grow from them and choose a better path for yourself. I like to think I've grown from it and chosen a better path for myself. These values I've learned have helped my succeed in my educational career and hopefully onward in life. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,591,"""How have the values of my community or my family helped me navigate through college?""                    My parents never went to a four year college, and they never pushed school.  That’s why I never really found it that important.  So navigating college was all me.  Don’t have much to say there.  But I am sticking it out because I want my daughter see me do it   "
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,596,"﻿Richard Rodriguez ValenciaApril 7,2020            Journal Essay 3    Everyone around me really don’t help me with wanting to be in college because most people are lost in life and others just drop out and aint focused on the future or being part of something big. The only 1 person that tells me to stay in school is my dad but he in Mexico and rarely talk to him, but for my mom I don’t want to disappoint her. Other then that is just me wanting to actually not follow none of them steps but mine. There is nothing wrong with being a drop out or decided to go another way towards life but I have noticed that they really have nothing to do but keep living like that and all my neighborhood is like that. Trying to find a good role model isn’t really my thing but I have tried and since people see me as not belonging I decided to make myself my own role model because no matter that I don’t have scolars around me I decided to be one and no matter how bad or weird people look at me I would get where I want. There is not much to who im around because I am who I want to be,"
2020,Spring,SCI 0180,SI,1,593,"Both of my parents are very helpful and motivating to me when it comes to college too. My brother is also very motivating. My mom is always able to give me advice and help me out when I feel super stressed about school. She often encourages me to take breaks from school and to relax but she still pushes me to succeed. My dad did not complete college but he still has a lot of good advice. He always helps me relax and he pushes me to try my hardest. My brother is helpful too and knows a lot about how to help me in college since he is in his senior year himself. I often ask him questions such as, where should I get books or what did you do for this class? My community of friends is also very motivating to me. Many of my friends are in college just like and they know how to succeed in it while also balance it. So their habits lives are often very helpful and encouraging to me. In general, my close community values hard work and dedication, and both of these values have become influential to the way I approach school."
