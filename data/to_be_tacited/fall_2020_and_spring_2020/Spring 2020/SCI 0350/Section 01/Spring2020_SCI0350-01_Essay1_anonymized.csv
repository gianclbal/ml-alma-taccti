Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,572,I am here because I want to expand my understanding of cell biology in the hopes of getting a good grade. This will also force me to review material taught in class instead of cramming all the material a day before an exam. Also this gives me the opportunity to meet some of my classmates.
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,782,"Journal #1: Why am I here?  The cell biology class was dense material from the beginning, and I felt it would be best for me to join the course. I’m here at SFSU after trying several different disciplines at two different community colleges. I started with a biology concentration then I tried anthropology, psychology and even trade. Though it sounds as if I had aimlessly directed myself through classes I had actually gained a lot of knowledge about myself as a student and received several Associate’s Degrees in the process. It made me more confident in myself to choose what is best for me. Now I want to continue my path to getting into medical school and learning more along the way."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,783,"I am here to help get myself a better grade. I have always had issues with my science classes mainly because I have a chronic pain disorder called fibromyalgia. By having this class, I know that it will hold me accountable to do things like my class work and to even get in study time when I know that I do not have the energy to do it at home. Also, because the class is a few hours before my cell biology class, I know that I will be spending more time studying because I will be on campus. It will create an environment that allows for me to feel like I can study. I also like the idea of being able to teach as a way of memorizing the material that I've learned. By being in that class, I'm surrounded by my peers I can learn and reiterate the material in my brain. It allows for me to ask questions and have a more one-on-one experience with a smaller class. I also will feel less intimidated because the people teaching the class and more my peers than they are my instructor."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,640,"I lose myself quite often.... more often than people realize.I'm only here because despite how long I've been in school, I want to prove that I can persist through and get that darn degree. The amount of support and peeps I've met up until this point, have given me purpose to keep continuing through. I've yet to fully bring out my potential up until this point, but there's some small accomplishments/ progress. I was never the ""straight A"" student that people percieve me to be.... but more of someone that has been through many trials-and-errors, mistakes, and failures to be a competent learner in school. I want to extensively live my life where I can place my own ""legacy"" in life. I want to fill people around me with positive memories, love, knowledge, and teachable moments. I want to give inspiring life stories to my future generational family members. I want the people whom I care about around me to feel my gentle compassion in many different ways... that, is how I want people to remember me by.... someone whose able to smile, and remain positive through everything she's faced."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,755,"As a junior in college, and also a commuter I do not have free time for study sessions outside classes that actually fit my schedule and I learn better when materials are repeated and bought to knowledge in groups. I chose to take this class because this is a class offering help regarding the subjects I am currently enrolled in. I am here to learn help me better understand the course material and also because I did look into the free tutoring help on campus but since this is a confirmed help session which I get one unit for being enrolled and fulfilling my attendance it was the best fit for my schedule. After this semester started, this class was a little different compared to what I thought this class would be. This class has really helped me because I feel like since the teachers are past students of that class – they help  us to understand the ways of how the class is carried out and also how we are supposed to expect from the class. Today I am here because as a commuter I am not always able to use the campus resources to fit my schedule and since this fits my schedule I am using this class a support class that helps me summarize the materials taught in class in details. Since I know how to these classes work as a STEM major I look forward to taking more of these classes. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,784,"I am here because I want to further advance my education and be the first in my family to graduate college. My family continually inspires me to be a better person and to give back to the community that raised me. I am here because I aspire to be a scientist, more specifically an anatomical pathologist that works for the Center for Disease Control. I know I have years ahead of me but this is a dream I will never stop chasing. I want to research infectious diseases but also have the ability to treat patients. I also want to travel to third-world countries and help those with little to no healthcare access. Although these are huge goals, they inspire me each day to be a better student so I can get to where I need to be. I am here because I fell in love with the world of science at a young age and want to increase diversity in my field, I want to prove to other young women of color that they can persevere in a field that is heavily male-dominated. Anything is possible as long as you believe in yourself."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,342,"I am here for a whole bunch of reasons. I am in this class to help me understand more, and pass Cell bio, so that I may go on to take my upper division electives, and graduate from this school. I am in this city because I go to this school (a little obvious haha). But I also like the vibe of this city, its much different as opposed to the other cities nearby. I love the culture, style, busyness, etc. The reason I go to school is to one day help support my parents, and so that I may have a decent job where I will not have to worry about stability. I would also really like to make a difference in the world so that I can leave a mark (hopefully a good one) for once im gone. I hope this alma journal doesn't sound very repetitive. Ive this same journal for every sci class I have ever taken. I should really start saving these and turning resubmitting them because I basically have the same response each time. Thank you.Im back. The alma journal was onlhy at 182 words. I need a minimum of 200. Im not exactly sure how I managed to finish these last semester. Hopefully I met the word count."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,785,I’m here to get a better understanding on cell biology and to practice what i have learned in class into more depth. I have taken a sci class before and the first couple of ones didnt work out so well but the latest one i took was great so I’m here to try it again. Hopefully this course helps me more in the class and doesnt confuse me.
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,750,"I am here because I am in need of extra supplementation for cell bio. I am also taken SCI for ochem and figured having the extra help cannot hurt. I have never taken a SCI course so this will be the first semester where I participate in this type of class. I am also here because I would like to create study groups from those who are also in my class. I see dozens of people sitting next to me all the time but we do not have the time or opportunity to socialize with one another. Taking this course will give us those chances to meet and greet in a way with fellow peers. But overall, I am here because I need extra help with cell bio. I also want to test the waters so to say, with taking these courses and what they consist of."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,786,"At San Francisco State University, I aim to jumpstart my pre-medical career and build a strong science and politics-based foundation to become a dermatologist or plastic surgeon. In Cell Biology, I look forward to learning about cellular and molecular mechanisms and apply my knowledge in the laboratory, participating in research opportunities to cement myself as a formidable force in science. By incorporating my knowledge of politics in San Francisco—my lifelong home—I aim to forward medical and computational ethics, fields that pioneer life in Silicon Valley and modern medicine. In doing so, I will learn ways to remediate the homelessness and healthcare-deserts plaguing marginalized lives in the city during my undergraduate career, allowing me to hone my ethics and morals to become an ethical healthcare provider in the future. Furthermore, I hope to collaborate with governmental bodies to forward my dreams of caring for the socioeconomically disadvantaged, promoting camaraderie, healthcare, and human flourishing in my communities. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,767,"I am in this sci course because sci classes have helped my foundation for almost all my science classes that I have taken at SFSU. But, on a broader scale, I am here dedicating my time and resources to this class because it was ultimately my choice. I made a choice to go to college because I see how difficult my parents and grandparents work without a college education. Also, over the summer I volunteered in Thailand and one thing that I did there was teach in the schools. Being there really pushed me and helped me realize how fortunate I am with the education opportunities that I have. Those kids that I taught (ranged from the ages three through twelve) would hike three hours in the jungle every single week to stay in the dorms to get an education. These students in Thailand have taught me to be thankful for the opportunity I have to be able to go to college.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,787,I’m here to get a better grasp on this subject as well as to get help on topics I need more help on. This is also a way for me to meet people in this course that I could gain some help with as well as help them (to the best of my ability). Also to possibly see if there others in my other courses that maybe we could help each other in those courses as well. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,788,"I’m here to learn and expand my knowledge so I can add to the many more ideas that are yet to explore. We are here to be inspired by the loads of information that make us who we are. It helps to surround yourself with people who are also inspired to learn because of the encouragement fed into each other through boost of friendly interactions and assurance. I’m classroom setting, I can’t help but feel invited to learn especially with individuals that are equally eager. I self motivate and try my best to encourage others to learn and understand the importance of concepts so they in turn will do the same. There are many factors holding me here and keeping me from leaving but definitely to environment has kept me steady and focused on my goal. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,789,"I am here to understand the material taught in class better. I feel like I never really want to join or need the supplemental science course offered alongside to the main course whenever I'm attending a course but it doesn't hurt to try the class out. There can only be more that can be learned and can benefit me. I also need some more units after I enroll in all my classes so I think adding this course will help to close the 120 credit gap I need in order to graduate by the end of fall 2020.I'm here to learn and understand the class topics better. I also hope to review test topics before an exam to make sure I know all that I should know which would be on the test. I hope that even if I end up missing lecture classes, that I can attend this supplemental course and make up that loss time."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,790,"I am currently taking SCI 350, as it is necessary to take the supplemental instruction courses that partner with the stem classes being taken as an SEO student. I was originally unable to make it to come to this section, as I am taking chem 233 that would have overlapped with this class. Though, as there was a time change I am thankfully now able to be in attendance. It feels odd now being in a sci class after having taught them for over the past year. I know that it can get hectic and demoralizing when a section gets closed due to low enrollment. Bio can be a little daunting, especially since I haven't taken a sci class for bio since the beginning of sophomore year, I look forward to being apart of the class and am thankful that the section for this class was able to stay open!"
