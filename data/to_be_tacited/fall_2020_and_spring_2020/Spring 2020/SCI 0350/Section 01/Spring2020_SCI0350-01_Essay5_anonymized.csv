2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,342,"Why do I want to go into my major? there are various reasons for this. Some of these reasons are that I find science interesting. I also find my major to be quite challenging. There is also the fact that with my major I could benefit the human race as a whole ,and leave my mark on this world before I depart. Its a degree that is vary capable of taking me different routes, whether it is MED school, research, teaching, etc. It is also something that has the possibility of more stability that some other jobs, and decent pay. But the main reason is for my family now and the future. So I may make my parents proud, help them through retirement and help my future wife and kids by having that steady job I love. only then will I be able to be happy. ONce I finish my career."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,784,"I want to go into my major because I am passionate about healthcare and helping my communities. I feel that with a degree I will only be able to make an impact on my community rather than not obtaining my degree, which is unfortunate. I want to make a difference in the world, which is why I am so intrigued with the world of microbiology. I want to study disease and prevention in my future career (pathology) and hopefully work for the Center for Disease Control (CDC). This has been a goal of mine since middle school and each day I am more excited about the thought of this being my future career. Although I still have many classes left to take, I cannot wait to learn more about microbiology and how it impacts our daily lives. I will take this knowledge with me when I pursue my MD and PhD shortly after."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,789,"My current major is general biology and I will be graduating this upcoming fall semester. I am anticipating my graduation because I want to start the next steps towards my nursing career. I am planning to volunteer in the hospital during summer and all the way until I start nursing school (once the covid situation allows for hospital volunteers). I also am planning to take CNA classes to become a CNA once quarantine is over when in person gatherings are resumed. I was never entirely sure what career I really wanted to go into for myself. I was pressured by my mom to become a pharmacist when choosing majors in the beginning of college and I decided that a biology degree would be the closest to cover all the prereqs for pharmacy school. However, I decided within 2 years into my college degree and after taking a pharmacy technician course that I can't imagine being a pharmacist for the rest of my life. I decided to go after a nursing career using my biology degree as a start with the prereqs after experiencing the kindest and most understanding nurses while I was in the hospital. I had also experience a callous and uncaring nurse in a different hospital stay. That really left an impression on me and I decided I want to be the kind and empathizing nurse for those who are in a vulnerable situation. I really like babies and I want to care for people so I decided that I want to be a NICU nurse ultimately. I may spend some time as an RN and decide whether to pursue a MSN in a specific field of nursing. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,767,"The first time I was introduced to what a science lab was, it immediately sparked an interest in science. The reason I push to be part of the STEM field is because of events that have happened to me throughout my life. Sophomore year of high school my grandpa passed away due to internal bleeding that the doctors could not locate (because they needed to go outside for an MRI). It was told to us multiple times that there was nothing that they could do because he was going into septic shock. A few years later, someone very significant in my life passed away from breast cancer. Then, just last year in 2019 my aunt passed away from breast cancer. Next thing you know, a few months later in 2019 I get told by my grandma that her cancer came back but in her bones; she had survived two different types of cancer and here her cancer returns. These events made me want to pursue a career in biology-- as of right now, I want to do research. Whether it be to construct research on how employees can better assess and treat their patients, or employees in the health department learning better procedures to reduce errors and deaths, or even to help with cancer research. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,750,"My major was chosen because I have always been intrigued on how the human body does what it does under stress. Kinesiology has been a great discipline to get involved with things such as physiology and anatomy on a more advanced level, but at the same time be more involved with how to correct problems might face with their own bodies. An example of this could be helping someone recover function in their hand after a car accident. The major has been great and the community we all have is more tight knit than I ever would have hoped."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,786,"As a biology major with a concentration in physiology, I am pursuing a pre-medical route to forward my dermatology and plastic surgery interests. Generally speaking, I aim to learn about the basics of disease, the human body, and fundamental cellular and molecular processes that sustain human life, as well as other integral biological and chemical pathways. In doing so, I will build a solid foundation for standardized tests like the MCAT and medical school as I aim for high scores on tests to gain admission to the medical schools of my dreams. Though I plan to pursue medicine, I see biology not as another meaningless stepping stone, but a necessary learning experience that will allow me to be the best physician possible."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,755,"""Why do I want to go into my major?""This essay is meant to remind you of your purpose. This is not meant to be a formal essay. It should be stream-of-conciousness writing from the heart. You will be graded on participation only, not on the specifics of what you say.  5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150-200 words. I was in a comp sci major and have taken a lot of classes in college I think based off the classes and what I would want form the classes I would want to be in the major I am - biology physiology. I haven't taken my gwar or a UD physio course but I have taken other bio classes for this concentration. figuring out career options and other ideas on what I would want myself doing years from now... this major is a great fit for my career choice and the concentration has a lot of classes would benefit my future learning … which is why I am in the major I am in. the career I wanna pursue is to be an Obgyn or something in the medical field. I also think that I got into my major to be more self aware of how the world works in relation to science and society. I would love to take hed courses but I would have to declare a minor in it to take most of the classes I am interested in. there are obviously so many other ways that I can be active in the society and give back to the community but I choose to get into biology because that Is something I can rely and focus on something that I see an end goal to which is why I choose biology"
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,790,"I am a physiology major, with this I would like to go into research. Out of undergrad I would like to go directly toward obtaining my PhD. I am currently studying neurogenesis though am unsure as to which avenue of research I would like to go into. The study of functions has always been really interesting to me, though I seem to be having a hard time caring about it on a smaller, cellular level. I am getting through cell bio but I am not interested in continuing studies on such a small scale, at least for the time being. I have had a lot of fun working in my lab as it was primarily hands on and we were able to be apart at every step, though now it is more hands off and have transitioned to a dry lab. Comparing the two I would like to be apart of a wet lab in the future."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,783,"I went into this majoring thinking I had a clear understanding as to why I chose it. Like a lot of people, I wanted to go to med school. Over the years and as I have gotten closer to graduating, I think that has changed. I am more interested on the research aspect of medicine and how pharmaceuticals effect our body. I always said that I wanted to go into neurology because you never stop learning. But what I realize now, is that I want to get my degree in cell and molecular biology so I can figure out what emphasis I want to focus on in my research. It is still a question I am struggling with today. Of course I want to make a difference. I think the only way for me to make a difference is to get in a lab. So I am still trying to figure it out I guess."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,572,What I want to get out of my major is a better understanding in how the human body works. I want to be able to explain biological concepts to my family in a way that shows that I understand what I am talking about. I also want my major to be able to provide me with a job that will allow me to live comfortably. And last but not least I want to be able to help people and make a difference in their health.
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,93,"I chose my major as biology in order to achieve my goal in becoming a healthcare professional and being able to help others. I felt that majoring in biology would be the most straight forward path in achieving this goal and would give me the best set of skills and knowledge that would help me in medical school. So far, I've used the information I have learned in my biology classes to help explain to people certain functions of the body and cells and explain the basic idea. Also, the way bodies work fascinates me and intrigues me to learn more about how they operate and how future technologies could help repair the loss of these functions (aka prosthetic's and future surgical procedures etc...)"
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,782,"Journal #5:I want to go into Biology because the two things that truly interest me are people and science. With this major I get to learn about the different dimensions that science is studied in. I had jumped around different majors to find what peaked my interest the most and which I was doing well in. This science major fit my goals the best and also challenges me enough to reach my full potential. Personally, I need challenges to push myself so that I’m well practiced for the unpredictability of life. I aspire to become a surgeon some day so I welcome obstacles so that I can be better at solving them. Someday that may be the mindset that helps me save a life. When I look back into my school experience the science courses and lessons are the memories that I have most prominently. I had always had an interest in hands on experiences with labs and dissections so the career path I chose along with my major align perfectly."
