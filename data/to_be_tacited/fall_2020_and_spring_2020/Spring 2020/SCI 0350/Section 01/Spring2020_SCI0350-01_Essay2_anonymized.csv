2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,624,When life gets hard for me I usually try to meditate on them. The reason for that is because it helps me emotionally get a better grasp on what problem is troubling me. Then I write what problems I can immediately do something about and what problems I can address in the future. Its like putting things in order and going through the list of tasks. It helps me because if im organized I can better schedule my time and energy and not worry about things unnecessarily. Yeah this is my main method to cool me head when things start to get challenging. I just started doing this because I feel like I can get a better grasp of problems ahead. Its more to get me to feel at ease and take a load off my mind because I know stress especially unnecessary stress can make things worse.  
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,640,"First: I try to reflect backwards, with things I've overcome, failed, and ""works in progress"".I think the strongest skills I have up to this point was due to certain things happening to me that is unique to my own failures and lifestory. Those same mistakes/failures/obstacles, are my strengths/advantages. I've met many great people. I have learned to love myself, and motivate myself.  I have many periods where I lack the motivation to do anything. This 1st week of remote learning was the most challenging academically, I've never experienced such procrastination and frustration over 1 week of remote learning. I am trying to forgive myself through the mistakes I've made so far in the remote learning process.   Most importantly, during this chaotic time, I know I have support from my professors, friends, and SCI instructor peeps. I think the coolest/inspiring moments were my interactions with my professors during this transition. They were PULLING THROUGH during their first Zoom meetings, and had effectively respond to my personal requests/questions."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,783,"I believe over the years how I've managed my challenging life has changed. When I first started college I lost both of my grandparents a year apart tragically. My second year of college things kind of changed. My grandfather was murdered in Chicago, and ever since then it seemed like I couldn't handle things as well as I used to be able to. Before, when I was challenged, I went into this overdrive mode. Where I felt that I had to be perfect. I would become hyper organized and would overwhelm myself with a lot of things so that I wouldn't have to think about the challenging thing that I was going through. A lot of people thought that it was a healthy way to do things, but looking back I Now understand that it was just a way to avoid it. My second year in college, I ended up having a mental breakdown and ended up in the hospital, and at the same time I was also dealing with chronic pain, depression, and anxiety. Once I came out of that, I kind of had an attitude of defeat and failure. I was failing a lot of my classes and when I wasn't failing, I was barely passing.  So now I'm kind of digging myself out of a hole. Now that I'm older and I feel that I have a better support system through my husband and through getting things like therapy, I know that I am not a superhero. When I am overwhelmed, I give myself time to rest. Being pregnant now at the beginning of my semester, I have a sense and a need to accomplish. I want to be able to say that I finished school and had a baby and I think it's possible. So at the age of 27, I finally feel like I'm starting to come into a routine and find myself. It's okay to fail as long as I get back up and that's what I've learned from all of this."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,788,"I do enjoy being challenged, so when I am faced with one I like to ""grab the bull by the horns."" I have never really been one for competition, so I like to think that this makes up for it. A challenge is like a competition between you and your better self. My better self is always what I strive to be in every and any challenge presented to me. I think that a challenge forces me to push forward and think outside of the box, but I also believe it is my will and knowing my self-worth that encourages me to follow through to the end. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,782,"Journal #2:When life gets challenging I have several different ways to become calm and to continue to persist. One of the things I do most often is call a loved one like my sister or my mom to vent about life. Usually, after getting some frustration out and hearing some genuine validation I feel more motivated. Sometimes I look back and read my older journal entries to see how far I’ve come. Reading about the different hurdles I had to get over to be where I am today I realize that I am more capable than I believe. If these things still somehow leave me with negative feelings then I try exercising and art therapy to have myself focus my energy away for a moment. When I encounter challenges I tend to start attacking myself mentally. It’s typical that these feelings will overwhelm me and cause me to be at a standstill. It’s important to me to recognize when I do this to myself and use my coping tools to beat it."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,786,"When life gets challenging, I find distractions to keep me occupied. For example, when an unmanageable stream of homework floods my schedule and I get overwhelmed, I go on walks or to the gym to temporarily keep my mind off the task at hand. In doing so, I am able to destress as I enjoy the sights of San Francisco. Though I am focusing on another task in this process, namely walking and exercising, I am not evading my tasks. Rather, I am regaining my energy as I continue to focus on distractions, allowing me to complete my homework and other school-related work efficiently. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,767,"With living in a city, everything is fast paced it can become difficult to find time to actually enjoy a meal, reflect on your own thoughts, connect with friends and family, and other activities. Living in a city where everyone is ""hustling"" to try and make the ""big bucks"", it puts you in that mode as well. With this said, when life gets challenging, I take a step back and take time to myself. I pause the things around me, and take at least a minimum of 5 minutes alone. I take the time to reflect with myself. See how I am doing. Allow myself to be alone with my own thoughts. When life gets difficult, it is important that I check in with myself. If I do not, it would be difficult for me to keep a sane mind because I would constantly be thinking about my pathway to a career and keeping up my grades that I would drive myself up to the point of exhaustion, which then would take away my motivation."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,755,When life gets challenging I do several things first of which I panic and freak out on what to do and next I ignore the problems and after that I freak out about the problem and finally realize I have no other option then to deal with it. I deal with my problems in various ways example if a paper is due and I haven’t been able to process the information I do what I do when life gets challenging and in the last moment put in my best foot front and do the paper because doing the paper is better than not doing it at all. So basically what I am saying is that when life gets challenging I face the challenge and hope for the best outcomes. I know somethings aren’t in my hands but try doing the things that I can be responsible for. Also when life gets challenging I need to get of my stress so I try to divert my mind from the problem for a while and come back to it with a more focused self. If life gets super challenging I eat ice cream and binge watch my favorite show to make me realize that facing the challenge is better then sitting around doing nothing.
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,572,"What I like to do when life gets challenging is watch makeup tutorials on Youtube because it requires no thinking and it helps to relax me. I also like to get things done, like running errands and doing homework that way it helps to feel productive, so that way I don't feel like I'm a complete failure. It also helps to talk to someone that I trust about how I feel."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,342,"What do I do when life gets challenging?.. I do quite a few things in combination. I usually enjoy exercising and listening to music to relieve some stress. Talking with friends or family to relieve stress, but to also ask for advice on how I can approach the situations which are causing for the challenges I am facing in life. After this I choose to attack the challenges so that they are no longer an obstacle or a challenge in my path. For things like the corona virus there is not much I can do about attacking the challenge. So what I do is talk to my friends and family as much as possible (online of course).if you cant change something, its best to change your mindset about that something (within reason). if all else fails I enjoy going to the beach. This is a place full of good memories, so surrounding myself in a happy place is beneficial to me, and helps me clear my mind/ think."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,750,"Most of the time whenever life gets challenging I like to take a step back and just breathe before doing any kind of response or action. I was always brought up on the notion of ""think before you do"", that way you are defensive towards your actions. One example of when I have to face challenging matters is when I am at work. Usually when I am work and I need some time to think about what just happened, me and partner will just sit in the rig for a bit before going to our next call, and talk about what was just done. Either it being a domestic call or some kind of failure in terms of our intervention, we take the time to look out for each other and make sure we are okay to continue for the day or night. Breathing and talking about the problem are my main ways to cope."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,93,"When life gets challenging, I like to take a break and listen to my Chill spotify playlist to help calm me down or gather my thoughts, or I like to work on something else if I am frustrated, something hands on though, something DIY, like cleaning or organizing something as a form of catharsis.By exerting my stress in a positive way, it helps me gather my thoughts and deal with life's challenging problems. Especially as a STEM major, there are a lot of stressful concepts that appear in different class lectures that are sometimes hard to understand, so I spend extra time practicing those concepts, but if it weren’t for my methods of tackling these life challenges, I probably would go mad."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,784,"When life gets challenging, it feels easy to give up, or lose motivation. And I often do. My major has increasingly gotten harder and it challenges me more than ever before. However, I always remind myself of how far I have come and how much more I plan to accomplish. I want to go to medical school and eventually become a doctor. When life gets challenging, this time I will not be able to quit on my future patients. The important part of a challenge is facing it head on and never backing down. Failure is an important lesson in life but trying over and over again is even more crucial to know. I know eventually my hard work will pay off but, in the meantime, I must keep going not just for myself, but for my family as well. One day everything will make sense and I will be grateful that I never gave up when I wanted to most."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,790,"What do you do when life gets challenging?Life right now is wonky to say the least, and all I'm able to do is just roll with the punches. I feel like I’m a very ‘it be like that’ kind of person. Where am just trying to keep moving through to be able to get through to the next thing that needs handling. I have a problem asking for help even when I happen to need it. It causes problems to arise when things get detrimental. I am unsure if this is due to pride or simply stubbornness or a deep seeded shame associated to failing. Though that may be looking too deeply, and is probably a problem in its own right.Anyway, I don’t appreciate when things don’t go according to plan but I know that it is inevitable and thus I know that I need to just keep going forward- or whatever the closest adjacent may be. "
