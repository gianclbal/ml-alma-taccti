2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,767,"One confusing concept covered in class lecture that is quite confusing for me to understand is the cross bridge cycle. A question that can be asked is what happens during the cross bridge cycle? When myosin head is attached to ADP it will break off a phosphate and it is now holding two pieces--ADP and phosphate. At this point, it will be attracted to actin an it will bind. Once it binds, the phosphate will leave and that causes a power stroke. The power stroke is used for moving forward. When the power stroke occurs phosphate holds the energy that allows myosin to do the power stroke. Next, ADP will be removed from myosin head and the ATP will bind to the myosin head. If ATP binds to myosin, myosin will detach from actin filament. For the cross bridge concept, it is important to understand that when the myosin head is bonded to ATP, it will not be attached to the Actin Filament. It is also important to note that when the myosin head is attached to ADP and Phosphate, it will attach to actin."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,782,"Journal #4:  A concept we have covered in class is the structure of membranes. They are composed of lipids that have a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail. These lipids are oriented different ways to create specific structures. Membrane structures correspond to their specific functions. The way a virus membrane is structured is with oily lipid molecules with spike proteins that are utilized in infecting host cells. We can refer to the Corona virus which is now an epidemic in our time. Currently, we are all being cautioned to take the time to wash our hands thoroughly with soap and water. We can look to cell biology to understand why washing our hands properly with soap is our best defense in avoiding infection. Soap molecules are singular lipids that float around in the water and the tail is more inclined to attach to oils and fats. The tails penetrate the membrane of the virus and pry it open into pieces. The virus is now broken down and has to be disposed of. To do this the soap molecules gather around pieces of the virus to entrap them in structures called micelles. Then with the final rinsing of soap and water the pieces are washed away and no longer put one at risk for infection.    "
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,342,"Overall something that has interested me in this class are the various mechanisms we have covered, and being able to figure out their different transition states, intermediates, etc. I believe this is important and a benefit to society, because understanding this knowledge, we can figure out how to see what products are being produced if we mix different things together or in a solvent. These products can be found in different medications, drinks, makeups, etc. Our everyday lives revolve around chemical reactions. Another thing I think is a benefit, is synthesizing various molecules. More specifically we have talked about synthesizing alcohol. But the general ability of synthesizing molecules is important for the same reasons. Being able to get the molecules we are looking for from different chemical reactions is important in isolating these molecules for future use in the reasons listed above. As our species learns more ways to synthesize molecules or more about these mechanisms that allow us to go from reactants to products, we will also learn more ways of helping people in everyday situations, and in some unfortunate situations, such as disease. There are possibly many applications we may not yet know of, but as time progresses they will be shortly revealed."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,790,"Something that was taught that stuck out to me was the ‘cosmetics’. We discussed the actual uses our body has for collagen and others of the like in the body. Usually these terms are plastered on packaging with no explanation of how they should work or how far down the ingredient list they actually are. Though so far nothing has been proven that any of these used topically would have any effect in improvement of the skin. Most skin care is not backed by the FDA, as we talked about in class, and because there are no real strict regulations of skincare companies have very little stopping them from advertising next to anything on their products. Anything from stating that a product is vegan when not every product is harvested under the same regulations to stating the inclusion of an ingredient when it is the second to last if not last on the listed ingredients- ingredients are listed in order from greatest to least amount found in the product. This is important to our day to day lives as companies who produce products that we interact with so intimately truly have no real obligation, aside from public scrutiny, to keep from blatantly lying to their consumers."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,789,"One concept we covered in class is a type of glycan called hyaluronic acid. My question is: How is hyaluronic acid used in skincare products? My response is : hyaluronic acid is a glycan that absorbs water. It becomes sponge-like and springy and results in compression. This information about the nature of hyaluronic acid helps lab technicians formulate a product that helps rehydrate skin and absorb in more water. Other uses of hyaluronic acid could include providing relief for joint point by keeping the interstitial joint space well lubricated. It is also used to treat dry eye because it is so effective at retaining moisture. Hyaluronic acid is incorporated into eye drops in small amounts. Because we are all prone to mature and develop wrinkles, grow old with joint pain or develop dry eye; using hyaluronic acid can have many benefits for our health and appearance. Since hyaluronic acid is already created naturally in our bodies, there is usually no adverse side effects when using it. However, it is still important to make sure a skincare product is from a reputable brand and actually contains hyaluronic acid and not some other substitute ingredient. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,786,"In class, we learned about treadmilling and its role in actin-based cell motility. Simply put, net actin loss at the minus end of actin filaments allows actin monomers to be recycled for growth in the plus end, enabling for further movement of the plasma membrane. Understanding actin-based cell motility is vital in analyzing diseases like metastasis in cancer, as actin treadmilling allows for the movement of cancer cells to regions outside of its epicenter. Moreover, it allows immune cells like neutrophils to chase foreign invaders quickly as their receptor proteins pick up chemical signals emitted by the invader and form a leading and trailing edge made of actin monomers. Inhibiting these processes can spell doom for cells, as they are unable to alter their shapes or be motile. A possible outcome may be compromised immune response, as the cells in the immune system are unable to respond accordingly when faced with threats of infection. Overall, actin treadmilling plays an indispensable role in cell/cytoskeletal dynamics, enabling the evolution of our immune response."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,755,I want to go into the STEM field because I think that there is a lot of problems in the world and STEM brings out an opportunity to help answer the unknown. STEM field also helps spread awareness and understand the core concepts of life. I also want to join the STEM field because I feel like some thing is missing some understanding towards life I guess I don’t exactly know what but until then I think science is the way to go. A step closer to what the answers might be. Growing up I had been one of the few girls who would do better than the boys and being that most of my friends were male they felt annoyed and couldn’t believe a female beat their scores. Till today people don’t support the idea of me doing science but I’m over those outside opinions. I am into Stem because I’ don’t see my myself doing anything 10 years from today that might make me happy. I am in STEM because I don’t really have a reason to do anything else. I am also in science because of what career I wanted to pursue since I was a little kid. I am in stem for more than just the money not that the money doesn’t sound good but for the rush for the sake of being a part of science rather then anything else.
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,572,How does the cytoskeleton help our cells stay stable? The cytoskeleton consists of actin filaments and microtubules that aid in stabilizing the cell and transporting molecules and protein within the cell and outside the cell. They also aid in mitosis by forming the mitotic spindle that is neceassary to seperate the chromosomes. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,784,"I found the topic of protein tagging really fascinating. If we can tag organelles with a fluorescent protein, can we use this to answer larger questions in science? An example would be tagging a yeast vacuole with GFP, we can then analyze how the vacuole responds to its environment and what would happen to it if that environment changed. Since the vacuole is known to self-regulate its pH and has shown homology to lysosomes in humans, this could help answer larger questions about lysosomal storage disease. With gel electrophoresis we can measure how large our proteins are and how many bands they create by comparing it to a ladder, this would be important because it would give us a quantitative result of this research whereas the protein tagging would be more visual. The interesting aspect of protein tagging is that you can essentially tag any organelle of interest, including the mitochondria. We could verify that the protein was properly localized to this organelle through imaging from a microscope or sequencing its DNA and checking if it was inserted properly. This specific process would entail a PCR so the DNA can be amplified and replicated, then it would be analyzed through gel electrophoresis."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,750,"Something that I have had trouble learning in the class is what all the proteins do and how they are activated in terms of their function. I am having to make lots of charts and diagrams just to keep in mind how they work. This can be helpful later on in life, when I am having to formulate how to correct an issue someone might be facing in their medical life. Either is being someone cellular or surgical, I think that the information having to do with proteins and their function can be relative to how the medical field and medical intervention work in their respective settings. It also helps in other classes, when proteins and their functions are taught on a daily basis. In OCHEM, we have times where we are having to go over the different things that make up functional groups and what their purpose is for the human body. Not to mention, when being quizzed on what they do, having the information sourced from two classes is very helpful."
