2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,786,"Online classes have been a nuisance, as I have run into some technological issues barring me from entering class and getting an optimal education. For example, a few days ago, I was unable to log into my cell biology class' zoom session, as technical difficulties did not allow me to input the password required to enter the classroom. Thus, I missed the beginning of the class, resulting in me missing vital information. Generally speaking, I do not have concerns about my well-being. I am confident that I will earn an A in every class and that the rapid shift to online classes will not impede my education; however, part of me wishes that this semester was cancelled instead because the value of a college education has drastically decreased during this shift. For instance, lab classes cannot be conducted online optimally, as students will be unable to mix chemicals in person and experience true learning that can only be done when grasping lab reagents and tools."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,789,"Since switching to online classes, I feel like it has benefited me more in a way because I don't have to get ready and make the commute to school to get to class. The convenience of just turning on my laptop and attend class has helped me tremendously especially with the lack of motivation to want to do anything sometimes. I appreciate that all my instructors have decided to record and upload the zoom meetings so the students can look at them on their own time and learn at their own pace. Online learning has helped me caught up on the material being taught in class and it is easier to follow along with. Some things I am doing for self- care is waking up to have a cup of tea every morning and taking my vitamins. Even if my sleep and wake up schedule is off, I still make an effort to make some tea, have some breakfast, and take my daily vitamins. Some other things I have been doing for self-care is scheduling my weekly therapist appointment and going to it through zoom. The concerns I have right now is to keep myself disciplined in keeping up with learning the material in class and submitting the assignments on time. I get to learn and review lectures at my own pace so I want to take advantage of this time to study more and understand the material better. I need to develop better study habits in order to do better in classes and get into nursing school. That is my biggest worry right now."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,750,"To be frank, the online classes have really taken a toll on the quality of learning I have had in my classes this semester. I am taking courses that really do need a hands-on approach and not having the in class time to practice what we learn, is not helping. Not to mention the guilty truth that during exams, I have the tendency to look at answers online and not care to have the answer key in front of me instead of having the time to solve the problems how they should have been. The other thing that is really hurting my quality of learning, is not having office hours that are heavily used throughout the semester for academic counsel."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,640,"I lose myself quite often.... more often than people realize.  I'm only here because despite how long I've been in school, I want to prove that I can persist through and get that darn degree. The amount of support and peeps I've met up until this point, have given me purpose to keep continuing through. I've yet to fully bring out my potential up until this point, but there's some small accomplishments/ progress. I was never the ""straight A"" student that people percieve me to be.... but more of someone that has been through many trials-and-errors, mistakes, and failures to be a competent learner in school.   I want to extensively live my life where I can place my own ""legacy"" in life. I want to fill people around me with positive memories, love, knowledge, and teachable moments. I want to give inspiring life stories to my future generational family members. I want the people whom I care about around me to feel my gentle compassion in many different ways... that, is how I want people to remember me by.... someone whose able to smile, and remain positive through everything she's faced.   "
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,782,"Journal #3:I’ve picked up several values from my family and my environment in my experience so far. Personally, I believe it was these values that had shaped my character and laid the foundation that I needed to be successful. In my community I learned the value of helping others and being neighborly. I have moved to only a few places in my life and wherever I lived my parents were sure to meet everyone around and even help each other out when needed. This taught me so much about how to interact with people and be humane. I have a small family so were very close. From my mom I learned to work hard and to be persistent. She had a thick accent and it made it difficult for her to find work but she had worked incredibly hard to communicate better for a better opportunity. She had worked so many jobs and had finally found a position that was more career oriented and paid a sustainable wage. My dad was a popular person in our community and in our extended family. He taught me how important it is to have a community around you and to be someone that people need. I feel that now in college I have these values to help me continue to be successful and become a valued member of society."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,755,"The values of community and family has played a major role in my decision making in college. I navigate my way through college with a lot of advice and understanding from my friends and family. With situation that have smaller impact on me I go to my friends for answers, on academic related situation I go to Project Connect which is my community on campus and with other issues I go to my parents – I go to these people not because they make decisions for me but so I have opinions and views on what I am working on. Navigating my way into college was a huge issue and I could not figure some things out so my high school teachers community and classmates did help a lot on college applications and personal statements. Now that I am in college people don’t really have time to go over others essays and homework so I try asking for ideas instead of wanting them to fix the problem. Community is a big part of my social growth and in college it is important for me to understand the importance of community building in order to help me navigate through college. My family has also have played a major role in my way through college because  without my parents I probably wouldn’t be here in the first place."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,572,"Online classes have been alright, I find it easy to day dream although I used to do that during class as well. I don't mind it, I actually like it more than going to class because I can be in my comfortable environment and still take notes. What I am doing for self care is taking more time to get enough rest instead of getting up early for the commute to school, I get the extra sleep."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,784,"The values of my community have helped me navigate through college because it consistently reminds me of where I come from. I am Latina and I love my culture. Diversity in science is so important and I hope that I can inspire future little girls of color that they can do it too. Navigating college has not been easy, especially as a first-generation student, but the love and support that I have received from my family has been more than enough to help me get through all of my daily challenges. I am grateful for where I am today and for the values that my family has instilled in me, because I can pass them on to my future mentees or even children when they decide to navigate college themselves. These values include resilience, always being humble, assertive when you need to be, and never forgetting where you came from."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,342,"The values of my family and my community have have helped me navigate through my entire time in college. Since I was young, my mother has always taught me never to give up. She would place me in tae-kwondo, guitar, piano, and swimming classes. Although coming home from school and going straight to activities was not my favorite thing to do (and I would often complain), she never let me quit. This attitude was eventually passed on to me. I find it hard not to complete what I have started. I feel that if it was something you wanted then, you might regret never completing it in the future. I live in the USA. One of the best countries in the world. We can be whatever we want to be, and do whatever we want to do (within reason). This country has also taught me that being lazy is not an option. If you want something in life, anything, we must work for it, and sometimes it might not be easy, but there shouldn't be a free ride to anything. Life is hard, we have to work through it. I have many resources, and opportunities that many people around the world could only dream of. I have so many opportunities, a great family, and a great country. For this I am very greatful.

2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,783,"Online classes have dramatically impacted my life. If anything,I feel like it's made it easier. I was traveling all the way from Sacramento to San Francisco, on public transportation, three times a week. On top of that, I was dealing with my first trimester of pregnancy so I was constantly nauseous and I had a form of nausea that was extremely severe. Being at home, I'm allowed to have things like a cup of tea, or to stay in my PJ's because things like getting ready, takes a lot of energy out of me. It has also helped me financially as I would to work full-time to make sure that I had just enough money to go to San Francisco. With the whole covid-19, I then became concerned being newly pregnant and being on public transportation and worrying about whether or not I would get sick. I feel like it allows me to attend class more. The only issues that I'm having now would be regarding my neighbors. They have children and I live on the bottom floor. Their children and themselves are making noise constantly from morning until late at night. It makes it hard to concentrate sometimes. I've had to call my landlord's on them even though I don't really want to do that to make sure that I have time. But I can actually study or participate during class time. I think the thing that I've been able to do most in this crazy time, is just see my husband more. My husband is a healthcare worker and works graveyard shifts, so when I would go to school, I would not see him. I would see him for an hour a day and we lived like this for 2 years. This is the first time that I've been able to actually spend time with my husband or have him around since we became married. Because I'm pregnant, I also can't work. I am a shift supervisor at Starbucks so my job requires that I come in contact with a lot of people. Not being able to work , has actually been a blessing because I'm able to just focus on school for the first time ever. I don't have to worry about finances because my job is paying me to not work. I've been able to do more things at leisure for myself, like reading books or crocheting or planning my baby's nursery. Things that I've never been able to do for myself because I've had such a busy schedule. Just having time to breathe and to take care of myself has been the best thing that has ever happened to me since I started college. I've also cut out a lot of toxic people in my life and if I feel that the conversation that I'm having with a person is negative I am not afraid to tell them that I do not want to have the conversation and that has been the biggest thing that has helped alleviate stress."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,767,"This new transition of having all online classes has definitely brought a toll to my well-being. I feel more anxious to meet the deadlines; especially considering there is twice the amount of work with these online classes. I started this semester with 8 in class courses, and now have to teach myself the material of these 8 classes all at home. It is important for the faculty at the school to try and understand that we are put under very difficult circumstances, and it would be greatly appreciated if the professors and the rest of the faculty would reevaluate grading this semester. Some of my professors have not even responded to any emails nor via iLearn, which has caused me to be stressed, as I want to keep up my grades and graduation plans. I have tried meditating, exercising, listening to music, and even communicating with friends and loved ones as a form of self-care. However all of that does not distract from the fact that what we are going through, this global pandemic, is scary. Peoples lives are being put to a halt. I am concerned that the school is not doing its best to help the students out. The school is letting students down."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,790,"I am a first generation student, and I feel like that has impacted the way I see my education down to its core. My family was very determined in the fact that if nothing else they would be sure to provide me with the schooling I needed to be able to succeed in life. This was instilled at a very young age, starting with preschooling and making sure that I always had an opportunity to be able to read and be able to take in new information. Growing up and seeing everything my parents did to ensure that I had the best education they were able to provide me made me work that much harder to show them that their sacrifices were not in vain. Even now there are several times where I feel like it’d be easier to just give up, to just go to bed instead of continuing to stay up for a class, or spend my free hours doing anything but going to office hours or pouring over homework, though I know that it would cost a lot more than just what I have invested. It is what my parents have invested in me that keeps me motivated to get ahead."
2020,Spring,SCI 0350,SI,1,93,"This a very unique situation and a very different experience from previous online classes I have taken. I do enjoy these structured online lectures. What I mean by structured is that we are still required to attend classes at their designated times, compared to regular online classes where we watch the lectures at our time. This is a nice change of pace as it keeps me accountable and gives me time to learn in a timely manner compared to cramming it all at the end. For self care, I try to go for walks after my final class of the day or in the mornings. Surprisingly, no time for video games.   :(My concerns that I have are the same as others: online classes don't provide the same stimulus to get students to focus, and also like other students, online classes without having the ability to go out to a quiet place to study makes it hard to focus at home with either parental distractions or distractions in your own home. "
