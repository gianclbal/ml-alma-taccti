2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,1,227,"Noah Word  What I do when life gets challenging:  I embrace challenge. I believe we encounter the obstacles placed in front of us in life with the ability to overcome them in certain circumstances. But within these circumstances, when we overcome our obstacles, we often come out better than we were before. Having experienced trial and tribulation we grow and learn. Empathy is simply an instrument of an obstacle. Without the obstacle and the experience of facing that obstacle there would be very little use for empathy. If I have a choice between movies and I am presented with two options: the first being a story in which the main protagonist just passively goes through the story without challenge or obstacle, and the second in which the main protagonist has a plethora of challenges to overcome, I believe most of us would go see the latter movie. Challenge often produces better characters and better stories. We know and understand this instinctively. In the moment those challenges and obstacles are hard and often painful, but I have experienced the benefits of overcoming them and the results of having done so in a positive manner."
