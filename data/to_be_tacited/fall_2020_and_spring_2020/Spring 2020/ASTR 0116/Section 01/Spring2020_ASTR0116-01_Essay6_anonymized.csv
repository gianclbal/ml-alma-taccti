The most challenging part out of all of this was just not knowing if my answers to the lab was correct or not. They made me panic especially during the few first labs because I had to adapt to the class structure as it does move pretty fast. I have learned a lot by jut doing things myself in the computer and has motivated me to be more open with online classes.  What I do for selfcare is just sit back and enjoy some awesome tv shows like Malcom in the middle or anything that is kind of like a sitcom. I recently got HBO and I have been watching a lot of documentaryâ€™s as well, I have been analyzing the way that they create documentaries as a way to learn what I want my documentaries to look and hear visually. Also, I enjoy reading about different culture, so I have been doing that a lot. I think that the only concern is if I can grasp all I have learned from this class. I think this class showed me there is much more to life than just here on earth. And thank you for always making sure that we are doing good on labs I truly appreciate it."

I believe we encounter the obstacles placed in front of us in life with the ability to overcome them in certain circumstances. But within these circumstances, when we overcome our obstacles, we often come out better than we were before. Having experienced trial and tribulation we grow and learn. Empathy is simply an instrument of an obstacle. Without the obstacle and the experience of facing that obstacle there would be very little use for empathy. If I have a choice between movies and I am presented with two options: the first being a story in which the main protagonist just passively goes through the story without challenge or obstacle, and the second in which the main protagonist has a plethora of challenges to overcome, I believe most of us would go see the latter movie. Challenge often produces better characters and better stories. We know and understand this instinctively. In the moment those challenges and obstacles are hard and often painful, but I have experienced the benefits of overcoming them and the results of having done so in a positive manner."

Unfortunately, college was never something we talked about at home since my parents did not further their education past the eighth grade. But in their eyes, I am doing what they could not do. Sadly, lack of opportunities in their home country lead them to come to the United States. And for that I am thankful even if this Country is at times unfair to People of Color, I feel privileged to attend college to further my education. During this Pandemic I have wondered a lot if finishing school would even matter since everything, I do makes me feel useless. I got so use to working hard and going to school that when I had 3 months of unemployment, I felt lazy and like my life was on hold. In the present I feel more motivated to finish. I am hoping less people are affected by this virus."
