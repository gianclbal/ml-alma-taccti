2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,239,"2020 is off to a strange start. The move to online classes have been pretty difficult. I am disappointed because it is much harder for me to learn online. I miss being in SF too. As far as self care, I am trying to keep my room organized because it helps me feel motivated to do my class work. I also moved out of my dorm last weekend, so I have a bunch of extra stuff to put somewhere in my room. I am not too concerned, but I am a bit stressed because it is hard being away from the friends I had made and my SF lifestyle. I am also taking upper division classes next semester, so I hope that online classes won't make it even more difficult than I know it probably will be. Anyways, pretty much all good. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,249,"Online classes have impacted me in a positive way I could say. I am not spending much time on traveling to school and I could focus more on classes. I used to get tired everyday, now I feel more comfortable with classes. However, it is hard to focus on professor when we have zoom classes, especially when there is someone at home.  Overall, I guess it is easier having online classes but I learn more when we have face to face classes. The downside of online classes are not enough to complain so I like it. For self care, I'm totally avoiding going outside and drinking a lot lemon tea or water. I just want everything to be over as soon as possible because it is psychological torture to sit at home for days and weeks. I like to be home but this is too much for me. Hopefully, our summer will be normal as usual. I have plans for summer. I wanted to do some internships for summer but If the quarantine extends I will miss that opportunity. It is also stressful to see line in front of stores and essential items are running out so quickly. Some people just don't know what quarantine is and they go to the store to spend their time or because of they are bored I see some when I go to the store. It makes me so mad. If some people would just listen maybe we could find off faster and easier. I just feel bad for health care workers. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,253,"Online classes have impacted my learning, honestly for the worse as I am a visualize and a hands-on learner so i learn best when someone is teaching me in real life and showing me how stuff works. I honestly still try my hardest when it comes to online classes but ever since coronavirus started to fully become a pandemic my mental health started deteriorating which caused me to not be able to focus with school or life in general, i honestly lost my motivation to keep going on with life when everything started happening since my mental health wasn't in the best place even before coronavirus started happening. With that said what i do for self-care is honestly i try my best to meditate and to ground myself and to just stay positive, i tend to disconnect with everything, school, life, social media, i just tend to isolate myself for self-care which isn't really good but it benefits me somewhat. I have so many concerns with my learning since everything is online, but i will always try my hardest to still try with school even though i won't learn as much- if anything at all since i learn best in a classroom-type environment where i can interact with my teachers and classmates. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,231,"Online learning has not been ideal. I lack motivation to do my work because I live alone now and have no one to push me. This is where I must come in and push myself, which I have been getting better at. I am constantly thinking about how I can make money so that I can stay in my housing and feed myself. Adding schoolwork on top of that is not beneficial. I am glad that sfsu gave us the option for credit/no credit because i plan on changing all of my classes to that option. My self care has been including lots of cooking— I have been making foods that are good for me and also filling so i have energy that my body needs. I think self care is about genuinely wanting the best for yourself and I need to work on that aspect with my school work. I should care more about myself and do the work."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,240,"Online classes have definitely impacted my learning. I have taken some courses online before, but that was to make sure that I was mentally okay and to make sure that my schedule was free. Now that Covid is among us and all of the classes are online, it's very hectic. For the first part of SFS(Zoom)U, my little cousins n my sister's school district was not yet transitioning to online learning. There were some instances with technical difficulties in my classes, so lectures were cut short and what not, but it's just physically and mentally draining to be in front of a screen for hours on end. It's different when this is to do homework, but now our screen times have to be doubled because of this predicament. Once my cousins were officially on distance learning, it instantly felt like a summer vacation for my cousins (my sister's in high school so she knows what's up). It's hard to have to take care of them and remind them that as long as school is in session, they should still be learning and doing their school work accordingly. It makes me feel like a hypocrite because while I'm helping them with their schoolwork, I only get more behind in mine. I am trying to set time for myself, especially on the weekends, but it's hard. My self-care is really just making sure I'm okay mentally, keeping up with hygiene, and listening to music/painting."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,251,"Online classes this semester have been pretty jarring to me. Not because I'm struggling to do the work, though. It is pretty easy for me to do my assignments before the specific deadlines. The real issue is making myself log on every morning to go on zoom or check my e-mail for any upcoming assignments. I was so used to going to class every day and having buy teachers remind me of when certain things were do, that teaching myself to be more responsible about that stuff was one of the harder things to do during this time. In regards to be self-care, I've been doing pretty good compared to most people. I grew up as an only child, so most of my time spent when I was younger was mostly with myself in my room, so I always find a way to fill up my time. This can include doing homework, playing video games, or my personal favorite, watching mass amounts of movies and television."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,246,"Online classes have impacted my learning drastically because I am more of a visual learner who likes it more being taught in an actual classroom then sitting in my room. I need to be able to raise m hand and ask questions to the teacher when I am not understanding something so i can be shown how to do the task at hand. My main concern about these online courses is that I can easily be distracted when I am at home just staring at a computer screen then when I am sitting in a class room being forced to pay attention. I much rather actually have to get up and physically go to class to learn. Some things I am doing at home for self care is making sure I am keeping myself occupied with either painting, working out, or going on walks so I don't find myself laying in bed all day bored and sad. I want to try and keep myself up and active everyday or else I will get lazy and not do anything productive. My family is very active too so they are always coming up with family activities we can do right here at home where we are still following the quarantine guidelines."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,256,"As the adjustment into online school was quite a hefty transition, it took me quite a bit of time to fully adjust to everything. Having online classes has not only sparked confusion in my mind with the deadlines for assignments for each class, but I have also lost motivation. Not being able to physically attend classes and experience that teacher to student first hand environment, I feel as though I am not learning to my full ability. For example, I prefer to take notes when reading them from the board and being home/ attending classes virtually has made it very easy for me to slack off and not do so. As hard as I try, there is always something that causes distractions which in the long run is affecting how and how much I am learning. As for self care, I did take the first few weeks of quarantine to really think things over and come to terms with what's going on in the world right now but as time goes on I am only growing more anxious with when things will get better and when I will be able to physically go outside with no restrictions. I have a tendency to shut everyone out when things get too overwhelming or anxiety inducing, which for right now doesn't seem to be an issue but I only worry that as time goes on things will only get worse. I am a very social person, so having moved back home and not being able to do the things I love with the people I love has been strange to say the least. I am so used to flying back home for holidays and doing the absolute most to feel happy, so having to stay self isolated is something I am still coming to terms with. I know this is all for the better and I can only hope things get better soon."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,241,"Online classes have not been easy. I thought it would be easy since I’ve taken online classes before and it was not so bad. But switching has not been an easy transition for me. it has been so easy for me to fall behind since my apartment doesn’t have wifi. Luckily, I was hoping to depend on the office building in my apartment building but they decided to close that down. I got laid off from my job so with no income that I depend on I couldn’t get wi-fi installed so I decided to move back with my parents. My learning environment has been the most challenging I’ve faced in the last few weeks. I’m doing my best to grasp the information in all my classes but I am honestly overwhelmed. I’ve been behind on most of my classes slowly but surely I know ill get caught up with assignments. Everything is very overwhelming because I’m experiencing an economic stress along with my parents and it’s hard to only focus on school assignments.  I have not done anything to do self-care, I guess the only thing I do for myself is watch the shows and movies I’ve always wanted to watch but didn’t have time for."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,234,"Online classes has impacted a lot with my learning I don’t know if it is a positive change or not but it has  some way been booth like it has made me lazy to do things but it has also made me really organized with the work I have to do and made me follow a timetable and plan my work with eh loads and then make a timetable. I have been focusing a lot on myself in quarantine. I am focusing on things that I have been ignoring and it has made a lot of difference with everything. My concerns about my learning is that because. Of this virus spread my grades will be affected because I didn’t had internet for couple of days and I wasn’t able to complete few assignments, I am afraid that these submissions would really affect all the hard work I put in the beginning of the semester. It adds on top of  my already bad anxiety, i have been trying to catch up with everything since I am home now but it is sometimes too much, I have also been really paying attention in yoga and meditation and it has helped me with the stress and all the chaos. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,243,"Remote learning has been a challenge for me. Lots of factors have gone into this and as many people would have jokingly said before this, ""the struggle is real"". Although I reside with three other family members, my much younger brother and I are the only ones who are not high risk. This makes our lives and our days long, but a necessary sacrifice. Shopping, cleaning, schoolwork, and things I would have done without hesitation are the worst chores of them all. Unfortunately, the toll has been taken on my classes as well. I wish I would have or could have prepared for for what has happened these last few weeks but I have not. I am thankful that before this I took everything seriously and tried my hardest. Luckily, this last weekend proved that I still have a chance when I was able to stock up on so many necessities and groceries, that I still have time for myself. Although I do my best to stick to a routine, besides everyday skincare and exercising, self care will have to wait. I would love to do go back to spring things. Whether its re-organizing all my Pinterest boards or dragging my boyfriend along for a picnic or driving my friends up for an extensive search for parking at Stinson in 85 degrees of windless heat, it must wait. For my classes, I am trying to submit all that I can and not withdraw just yet."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,236,"This semester I have six classes in total. After the quarantine starts, my classes' teaching style totally changed. There are four of my classes start letting us learning by reading PowerPoint or doing homework. However, I'm a person who prefers self-study. This change makes my semester a lot easier.  Compared to the time before the quarantine, I don’t need to waste time commuting to the school or distracted by schools’ activities. I have more time to arrange my schedule and homework, and I don't need to stress out about time management. Therefore, I may finish my work more effectively or even finished before the due day. Besides, my professor also is there for me to answer my questions, and they always reply. I don’t have any problem with this teaching style right now. But my only concern about studying online is missing the fun activities on actual class. Using this class as an example, I finally get into a group in which my friend is in there. However, I can't discuss problems with him like before. And also, I register for the Astronomy lab class is because I really want to go to the planetarium. I've only been there three times, and I don’t have the chance to see it anymore *tears*."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,245,"Online classes have been really hard, for me and for my professors. I don't think anyone was prepared for this kind of situation and everyone has been really struggling with the change, I know I have. Although this time is stressful, I've been trying to find ways to distract myself. A lot of people have been doing Tik Toks but I just enjoy watching them. another thing I'm doing is rereading my Hero's of Olympus books in my backyard. I haven't read them since freshman year of high school. Its bringing a sort of nostalgia which helps with the stress. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,255,"Online classes have had a negative impact on my learning because I can not concentrate while doing homework in a household with several people. I also noticed that I learn better when the classes are in person instead of being online. My wifi is not the fastest therefore it takes me a few days to complete my assignments. I bake whenever I do not work and it helps me relax a little bit. I also like to blast my music while baking and cooking other fun and delicious foods. I am worried for my grades, I noticed that this quarantine has had a huge effect on my hw assignments and it is hard for me to finish the assignments on time because I also have to work and help my mother pay the bills. Having slow wifi also affects my learning because videos and other resources that I need take a very long time to load which makes it harder for me to turn in assignments of time. My mental health is not the best, I recently went through a breakup which made this even worse, whenever I feel lonely, I like to pretend that I am at the beach drinking some lemonade and playing with my dog."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,238,"Online classes have impacted my learning in many ways but mainly in a negative way. In my perspective I learn better when I learn face-to-face and am more hands on. I personally struggle with finding the space to sit down and strictly focus on my zoom meetings or homework. I am concerned about my grades and my chance of transferring schools this Fall 2020 considering I am struggling in some of my classes due to this school transition to online. I can’t focus, much less can I keep up with the emails of  my professors. This situation makes me stress way more than I already stressed in a regular school semester. For my self-care I am making sure to take a pause whenever I am about to do something important, it could be anything from doing homework, laundry, or getting ready to nap. When I pause to simply breathe and feel my two feet on the ground it allows me to relax and feel more aware of how my body feels or how I personally feel inside, referring to emotions as well. With this entire pandemic I am in fear for my health as well. It’s frustrating to see people out everyday pretending like people aren’t dying from this virus. It’s frustrating because people could do about everything to social distance but other wont which defeats the purpose of social distancing. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,235,"To be completely honest, I am worried for myself. Although I have tried so desperately to stay on top of my work since being quarantined, I can’t say that it say been easy. I live in a home with 8 other people. At times things can get so distracting. I am the type of learner who appreciates class activities. I learn better when I can engage and connect with other students. The information does not stick the same when I am reading it off my laptop screen in a room I share with two other siblings. Aside from my academic life, the pandemic has also had an effect on my mental health. I like to be on the move, doing things to distract me. Being stuck in my house all day makes me feel sluggish. I feel like I’m lacking motivation. However, I’ve recently picked up working out. It’s been a great outlet to let out my frustration and put all of my attention into. This has been my main practice of self care lately and I truly feel like it is having a positive effect on my state of mind. I’m grateful to God that I remain healthy during this pandemic, I am just learning how to cope with my current situation and find a routine that I am okay with. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,247,"I have never struggled so much with learning as I have with online learning. I like to think I'm a pretty good student usually in class because I am a people person. I enjoy spending time around others and learning from others but with online class, all of that is non-existent. For the past two months, I have felt so stagnant just in terms of learning both in class and just in general. I haven't learned anything really during these past few months, it's just about getting the assignments done and that's also been a struggle with dealing with my family at home. And going back to me being stagnant, I feel like I haven't grown as a person at all. I haven't had any new experiences and grown as a person. It is the worst feeling for me because I often find myself just laying in bed thinking about other times I've been happy but that doesn't help my case either. Just the other day however, I found a really nice quiet place at the end of a street that overlooks some part of the bay and I just sat there for around 2 hours just sitting in silence watching the ducks swim and fly by and it was one of the few moments of peace I've had. I know that whenever I am feeling down or just alone and empty I just need to go escape to my spot to help clear my head and come back home refreshed"
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,250,"Online classes have impacted my learning a lot. I feel a lot less motivated. With online classes, I don't have to get dressed, or even get out of bed. It makes me feel like i'm not even in school even though I am. I procrastinate more and it causes me to be stressed later on in the week when I have to meet deadlines. As for self care, lately i've been trying to construct a schedule for myself so that i'm not in bed and doing nothing all day. My goal is to wake up each morning, eat breakfast, get dressed, and attend each class. After all of my classes are done for the day, i'd like to eat lunch at a reasonable time and get straight to work with my schoolwork each day so that i'm no longer procrastinating on all of my assignments. I do have a lot of concerns on how online classes affect my learning and well-being. I struggle to focus and for some classes, I will admit I don't take them seriously enough. For my well-being, I notice that there's this domino effect on my mental health. Instead of being productive, I instead find myself laying in bed all day. As someone who has depression and anxiety, this really isn't good for me at all. I have no motivation to get up and get things done when I can just lay in bed. However that leads me to experience deeps feelings of sadness and anxiety. The online classes in addition with the shelter-in-place has impacted me for the worst."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,232,"Online classes havent impacted me so much as far as learning i would say. Its more so making sure i set time to actually get started on my class work. In actuality, online classes have helped me more because i commute from sacramento. and the long commute was extremely exhausting. What i was doing for self care prior to the stay at home orders was gym every day. that was my stress reliever, as well as my drive to stay in shape. now with gyms closed, i ended up buying weights to workout in my backyard. i dont get the same workout i use to but its something to exert some energy and catch some sun. i dont have much concerns as of now, for i take learning seriously and really take the information in if the class is online. i know some may tend to just skim through the material to just answer questions and be done. That is not me, i am always interested in learning something."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,254,"I was going to take my first online class this semester and I was already so scared. At the beginning I was stressed because I couldn't get a good schedule for it (I'm still struggling with it). And then we got the shelter in place order and I was terrified. But now we are in... week 4, I think, of all online classes and I think I'm getting the hang of it, except my original online class, it still drives me crazy. I've been trying to see the positives, like not having to commute every day and I get to save lots of money! Another is that I'm home! I love being home and doing nothing or reading a good book! It's really a new experience for everyone and I hope people can see some positives for themselves too! As for self-care I've been reading a lot! Reading always distracts me and it makes me feel... not so hopeless. However, my body does need to get moving more, as much as I love sitting down all the day I need to have some activity to get my body moving. Back to online classes, I'm scared about the final exams and how we will take them (and other midterms we have). I hope they go okay. I also hope we don't all fall behind, but thanks to all the teachers who are struggling with school and personal life.    "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,252,"To start off, the school was already hard enough to deal with. Going to classes that you didn't really like or cared for. The only reason I'm taking them is that I need to bump my units up. With this whole lockdown stuff, it certainly is even harder to learn from home and I can tell you that it is signally different working from home, rather than actually being in a classroom. Don't get me wrong, it is a lot more flexible but all that flexibility goes out the window whenever we get assigned heavy assignments that is, even, harder and tedious, I don't even know if I'll go to school next semester because I don't have enough money and I am not working, school cost a lot of money, I don't have my financial aid all certified and I don't want to take a whole bunch of online classes if I am not learning anything. I am just not sure when we will go back to normal and it sucks because I wanted to study what I want to become and not have it being delayed because it cost money to get any sort of education. I really hope things go back to normal so I can have something to look forward sooner than later. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,244,"We are all having online classes now due to  Covid-19. I think there are pros and cons for me to have online classes. Having online classes gives me more freedom because I don't have to go to school, so I get more time. Since all the assignments are posted online, and the due dates are also posted online, I get to know when are the assignments are due. Although all the assignments are posted online, but I don't always get reminded, so I have to remind myself for the due dates for my homework. Since I don't have good memory, I often forget the due dates and turn in my homework late. We don;t have classes at school now, so a lot of things are very very not clear for my to do for the classes because I don't have clear explanation from some teacher for the class instructions.This virus is very scary and I have not met something like this before. I stay home all the time now, and I am scared to go out. If I go out to get groceries, I need to wear masks and wash all my clothes right after I get home. I hopr everything is getting better soon, so we can go back to our normal live."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,242,"Online classes have been pretty interesting so far. Although I do not have too many zoom meetings, I wonder if they would actually help more with academic discipline. I often feel like at times there is always something I am missing. As some classes are pre-recorded videos, I sometimes forget to plan out the week and sometimes fall behind with only a little bit of time to catch up. Although that is on me, I can't help to think that everything would've been so much more simple if this situation was unfolded. I feel like I am learning less in certain subjects, one of my classes even canceled the whole curriculum for the semester due to this situation. I was really looking forward to that class too, but it is what it is. I think there are definitely some upsides to this, like spending time with family. It's nice being home with my brothers and to spend time with my parents as if I was still a child. Many pros and cons to this situation, but the lens in which we choose to view it from play a huge role in shaping the time that we have given the current circumstances."
