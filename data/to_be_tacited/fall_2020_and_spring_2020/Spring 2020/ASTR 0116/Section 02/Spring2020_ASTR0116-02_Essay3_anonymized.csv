2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,237,"When life gets challenging, I often find outlets for myself to relax. Usually I enjoy to work on my ceramics projects This is a good way for me to relieve stress because it is a creative outlet. I get to express myself in my clay and it's fun to see where my mind takes me. Additionally, I will take time to put things in perspective. A lot of the assignments and work that I get in college does not challenge me whatsoever. It is hard to find something that actually stimulates my brain, rather than just doing simple busy work or menial assignments. The real challenge here is figuring out my life, and how I will progress for the next couple of years. I hope that I can use all of the stress management lessons that I learn in class to aid my path in life. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,248,"When life gets challenging, I think it's most important to take a step back. Stress management is essential to me since I get overwhelmed easily if I take on too much. I've always made it a point to plan my workload so that I don't have too much hanging over my head at any point, but things don't always go according to plan. Sometimes I do find myself with a lot on my plate, and I'm a procrastinator, which can make time management a lot harder. At that point I always think it's important to remove yourself from the stress for a little bit. Take a break, take care of myself, and take the time to put things into perspective. Sometimes when you're in the throws of a challenging period in your life, it's hard to see the bigger picture. That's why taking a step back to look at the situation objectively and readjusting your plan as needed is so crucial to stress management. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,235,"When life gets challenging, I have trouble dealing with it. I tend to ignore things that go wrong and bottle up my emotions until I break. It is not a good habit, so recently I have been trying too break it. With all that is happening in the world, I have found myself more anxious than usual. However, in times of need I usually turn to religion and my faith. Even if I can't attend church, reading scripture and praying gets me through these challenging times."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,236,"When life gets challenging me, I will try to face the trouble and work it out. For example, I have a hard time studying my accounting major class. I used to think of changing my major to astronomy, so it might be easier for me. However, I found a lot of information about astronomy majors. Some people think astronomy is hard to learn and hard to find jobs in the future. When I told them I was in an accounting major, they hoped they could choose accounting major instead of astronomy because they will face more challenges in finding jobs in their future. Then I just realize, nothing is easy to get. When you have challenges in your life, you can't escape or find an easier way to get through it. Whatever the path you choose, there is always has challenge in the future. If you can't face it and get through it, you will always stay in the same spot and never succeed. Therefore, I should work hard in accounting majors instead of changing my major."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,245,"In all honest, when life gets challenging, I shut down. I procrastinate and stress for about 2 weeks and I don't get anything done. Especially with school work. I have a really bad habit of procrastinating a lot and never fully applying myself to work because I get so anxious and stressed that I just don't want to deal with anything and then I realize I have to get things finished and turned in. Kind of like this ""essay"". I've tried for years to change this, but its like my body goes into shook and I do anything to avoid my problems. Even though I stress about a lot of work, I stress ABOUT my stress as well. So I stress about work and then I stress about my procrastination. Its a really bad habit of mine and I really want to change that about myself. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,250,"Due to the pandemic, a lot of changes have been made. It's made life a lot more challenging for me. I'm struggling to find a safe and stable home for me and my ESA cat after being removed from the dorms. I lost my job in SF due to the closing down of all businesses. However I am doing what I can to make the most of this stressful and difficult time. What I do when life gets stressful is listen to music. When I listen to music, I can just stop and breathe and not think about all the craziness that is going on. When things get challenging, I play the guitar or the piano in order to calm my nerves or whatever I may be feeling. When life gets challenging, I can play with my cat or distract myself with some of my favorite hobbies like painting, singing, music, and much more. Things are really hard but there's so many things I can do to get through it when life gets challenging. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,249,"What do I do when life gets challenging? Recent months, I would say last year wasn't my year at all. I faced many challenges as well as many stressing moments. I am still solving some challenges currently. When I hear that things are not going as I planned first I panic and start to ask myself why is it happening to me and etc. But later I hold myself together and repeat to myself that it's just a challenge and it all for good. I remember past problems that I faced that it all vanished now I don't remember them. When I face new problems I remember that and say this one will be also in the past and I won't be even remembering later on so there is no point to panic or tone stressed. I am a religious person so I often refer to my religion to seek some sort of comfort and solution to my challenges. I think whatever happens to us is all for a good reason. I try to solve the challenges I try to make a best choice and I always try to stay calm however it is always hard. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,241,"When life gets challenging, I try to take a break from homework or whatever I am doing. I usually will take a nap or listen to music and lay in bed. When I am getting overwhelmed with school, I try to plan study groups with my friends so I don’t feel too alone and it also gives us a space to relate to each other. Whenever I’m working, I enjoy my 15 minute/30-minute breaks because work can get stressful and chaotic. In other situations, I really like to think of the blessings I have in life.  Life will constantly get complicated and I’m okay with that because I like looking back at how resilient I can be in situations. Life has already presented me with the most challenging episodes; first-generation college student, learning English as my second language, and my dad’s incarceration. I am grateful for what I have in my life."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,242,"When times gets tough, I often begin by pondering why this situation is tough in the first place. By doing so I will be able to determine if the situation is actually hard, or if it's just the perception of the situation. If the situation is actually challenging, then I will first try to not think about it until it becomes pressing. When it does become such a heavy situation that can not be handled by my strength alone, I will pray and surrender the situation to God. After that I'll be chilling and won't give it as much thought, because I know that God will handle everything. In doing so all my stress, anxieties, and worries just go away because God's grace is sufficient. I trust in God for the peace in Him surpasses all human understanding. Like a glass sea, the stillness and peace in Him destroys all the negative things this world may hold on me."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,253,"What I do when life gets challenging, honestly when life really gets challenging I tend to be very negative with everything, like my outlook on life and with everything. I tend to go to a really dark place when I am very challenged in life, I often think about ending everything when life just sucks. When life throws challenges that i can often mentally and physically handle, I usually just try to get by it and try my best to overcome it but when life throws me challenges when I am at a bad mental state, even if it's really easy I tend to just think about everything that's negative and just thinking about ending everything. I always try to keep a positive mind but sometimes it's just really hard, but yea."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,239,"With everything that is going on right now, it is safe to say that life has become a bit more challenging. When this occurs, I often do a lot of self reflecting and try to understand myself and how I am feeling so that I don't get overwhelmed. More often than not, I resort to doing things that I know will bring me comfort. For example, the last few weeks I've been watching the same thing on Netflix because its familiar to me and calms me down. I also, fortunately, have a loving group of friends that I turn to in difficult times to help me and so that we can help support each other through whatever it is that is going on. I believe family provides an important part in helping when life gets challenging, because they support me so much. There is a balance between being independent and also relying on your friends and family sometimes to boost you when you are feeling down. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,252,"Whatever I do to really make myself do when life gets difficult, I just remember what I do want to do in my life. I really try to motivate myself and really push myself to become what I always dreamed of. If it is these pointless GE courses and other tedious shit, then I will try to do it if it means that I will do what I need to do to get me to where I am at. I talk to my family and also look at some people that just became fuck ups. They are the ones that always put me down no matter what I do. I just tell myself, “All I care about is myself. At least I have my life figured out rather than just staying in my room 24/7, doing God knows what and rotting their life away.” I love the direction I am going in and the more hard work I put, I will become successful in life. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,251,"There was a point in my life when I wasn't the most resilient person on earth. Back when I was younger, whenever I was faced with adversity, such as not properly studying for a test or getting in trouble with either my parents or a teacher, I always would blame other people for my problems or worse, try my hardest to escape the consequences of my actions. Especially if life didn't go my way, such as failing a test or the occasional insult here and there, I never took it well and always ended up getting emotional for no reason. It wasn't until eighth grade, when I finally decided to own up to my mistakes, even if that meant my parents would lose their minds on me. Today, when life gets challenging, I never back down from it. I deal with what is given to me and I don't complain. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,254,"When life gets challenging I don't think of the positives right away. I usually pretend that nothing new is happening and that I just need to do what I've been doing. I don't take that challenge as a good thing. I (still trying to ignore the fact that I am being challenged) start repeating all the ""challenges"" I need to overcome but ever actually do them. However, there are certain challenges that I will acknowledge and I will take them. I guess it all depends on the situation and what the challenge is based on. Going to college has been one of the hardest challenges, I could be doing better to acknowledge it. Balancing time is one of the hardest challenges. My vegetarian diet is only a challenge because I have a meat-loving (is this even a word/phrase?) family, but not eating meat is easy... I did not reach the 150 words but now I have.  "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,244,"We all have challenges and difficulties throughout life. Some people can deal with their challenges easily, but others might be not. Personally, I think I am a very optimistic person, so I can easily get myself out from being challenged. And I also think that most of the challenges are the outcomes or consequences of wrong decisions that we make. When life gets challenging, I tell myself to be positive because I think our mood is the biggest factor for us to think positively. Then I need to think of some ways that I can solve the problems that I have. When I get challenges, I would choose to go out somewhere to make myself happy, then think about what I should do next. I think there are many ways for getting rid of challenges. The most important thing is to be positive for life. When I am being challenged for school stuff, I would reflect on myself and think ""why I get challenged?"". I would go to my friends, teachers, and classmates to talk to them and find a good way to solve the problems."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,257,"These past few months have been difficult for people due to a virus that is spreading across the world and rising in confirmed cases at an exponential rate. This has caused nations to enter a state of hysteria as they fear the corona virus pandemic. It is without a doubt that because of these conditions, many people are newly faced with hardships and must think of different ways to adapt and persevere to the current climate. I was fortunate enough to fly back to Southern California to be with my family before San Francisco called for a “shelter in place” but I was still faced with a challenge as classes were fully transitioned to an online platform for the rest of the Spring semester. Academically, I perform best in a physical face to face environment because I do not lose focus on the subject at hand. While studying/learning alone I tend to doze off and tune out the information that is being presented to me. To combat this, I will utilize the resources that San Francisco State University provides by attending virtual tutoring and advising sessions throughout the rest of this semester. Other than my studies, my family and I are faced with the hardship of moving houses during this time. It has put a lot of stress on my family and I because moving is a long process that requires the help of everybody to ensure efficiency. But, by being together and keeping frequent communication between the family we will persevere through this difficult time.  "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,247,"When life gets challenging, my first reaction is to usually pretend to try and ignore it. I know this isn't the best strategy to deal with things but that's just what I do. It's almost like denial, I try to deny that things are tough and just go about business as usual. I also try to just replace the badness and challenge with fun, I do stuff that I enjoy whenever I'm feeling down or things get tough. I think this is a pretty good strategy for helping to deal with a tough time but more often than not, I overdo it. I spend too much time trying to cheer me up and having fun that I forget to take care of business. The last thing I do is I bury myself in other people's problems. I would much rather help someone else though a tough time then try to help myself because often time, I feel a little bit selfish focusing on myself. When I help other people, I feel good about myself because I'm helping someone else which is easier and more gratifying because I would much rather help someone else than me because I prioritize others over myself for whatever reason."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,243,"When life gets challenging I have an excruciatingly hard time getting past it. Maybe it's the over achiever in me that screams, 'it's too late, you failed'. Or maybe it's the failing mental health. Who knows. But I know when things get tough, I eventually get over it, wipe my tears, and finish what needs to be done. Life is life. It's not easy. But it doesn't always have to be hard and it doesn't always have to suck if you are willing to put the effort in. When I was in high school I was perfect. Sike! But really it felt like it. Being in college was nothing like it. Of course binging every idea that it was going to be some exceptional experience didn't help, but man it was not what I thought it was going to be. And now that we aren't even in the dorms or on campus some how it sucks more. That's crazy. But life is life. I can complain as much as I can, but through it all you just have to suck it up. I apologize that this is 22 days and 4 hours late."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,246,When life gets challenging I find myself always turning to my family and friends for support during these times. They are the people that I know will give honest and helpful advice. These people no name better then anyone else and will know the best ways to help me. Other things I do when life gets challenging is talk to myself and try to come up with a plan to overcome these issues. I feel like having a plan for things can clear up any issues or at least keep everything together. I also like to write in a journal when I find myself straggling with life challenges because I feel like I think better after putting the words down on paper.
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,240,"When life gets challenging I usually take a step back and try to analyze what's happening. But more often than not, my emotions tend to take over and a wave of laziness and lack of motivation ensues. It's something I'm not proud of and I am working on that. To help with that problem, I try and reflect back to ""why I am here,"" which was ironically the previous prompt for the journaling. It helps me in a sense that I am reminded of my goals and aspirations and that some little bump in the road will be a story to tell once I have achieved what I want to accomplish in the future. At the same time, I don't focus all of my attention towards the future, but more so try to use that ending goal as motivation to overcome the challenges that may come to me. When I overcome the challenging aspects of my life at that time, it helps me become more motivated to do things (until another challenge comes and this cycle repeats)."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,234,"Life has its own way of being challenging. For me when the life gets challenging I try to take pause and think for a little while of what could be the reason of why I am having this difficulty. Also sometimes I just like to go on long walks listen to songs and just to relax for a little while before I start working on it again. There are a lot of things that I feel like make my life challenging but the most important and at the same time unnecessary one is overthinking it just makes everything complicated. I also maintain a journal in which to be honest I do not write everyday but when the days get tough I write in it and just pour my feeling in it, It helps a lot with my anxiety and stops the process of overthinking because I am writing it down.  "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,255,"When life gets challenging, I often go to music for support or guidance. I like blasting music while cleaning at home, in the shower, or just to dance to it. During hard times, I play uplifting songs to give me some sort of peace. Music is like therapy to me and I do not know what I would do without it. At the moment, I have been struggling a lot with online classes and working from home because of COVID 19. However, I like to take breaks in between assignments so that I can let my mind rest for a bit and vibe to beautiful, soothing music. I am currently stressed out because I missed the deadline for multiple assignments since I do not have wifi here at home. It’s hard because my cellular data is very slow and I am just doing the best I can. I am currently listening to “Hard Times” by my favorite band, Paramore. This song always lifts up my spirit and makes me feel like I can accomplish anything."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,256,"What do I do when life gets challenging? Well, in all seriousness I will probably have an initial breakdown about whatever it may be that I am struggling with. I will question and doubt myself, depending on the situation, and wonder if I'm pushing myself to hard or if I am asking too much of myself. It will take some time, but eventually I will come around to realizing that despite how difficult or challenging something may be, everything happens for a reason. I learn that any mishaps you have along the way will only benefit you in the future and teach you the lesson to push through any struggles. Depending on the exact situation, for example your school work load increases significantly and suddenly your work gives you more house, it is up to you to decide what is more important and what you are willing to sacrifice; work or your grades. When life gets challenging I come to an understanding that sometimes it's necessary to take a break and a moment to focus on yourself and your well being because you never want to get to the point of overworking yourself to your breaking point."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,238,"What I do when life gets challenging is take a deep breath and make sure to check in with myself. I used to never check in with myself and ask myself how I feel and what can I do to change those feelings. An example of life getting challenging for me would be this global pandemic we’re facing. I feel very stressed and uncertain of what will happen with me and my classes. I feel like I’m not able to manage online classes overall and now that I have no other choice but to take online classes i’m afraid to fail the semester. Whenever I'm doing homework and trying to catch up with my classes, I make sure to take a break when I feel overwhelmed. I also like to watch youtube videos and follow along Yoga videos to help me relax and feel better."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,232,"What do I do when things in life get challenging? First, I never give up. Now matter how hard the task and how many times it must be done to get to the final goal or to get better, I remain determined. Sometimes its good to fail, lose, or not get the result you wanted. It shows you that the task or whatever it is that’s being done is of great importance. Further making the end result more gratifying upon completion. I was in the military for 6 years. Having determination and perseverance is of the most vital characteristics you could have. If things aren’t working, there is an effect it can have on the overall mission. Ive been deployed numerous times to numerous places. I’ve been alone as my job specialty and very few times deployed as a small two to three-man team. While being with your coworkers on certain deployments or training can be less stressful than deployed alone, being deployed alone has great rewards. It shows you the hard work is never unnoticed as you are the one and only technician. Knowing your job and the determination to battle any issues to make sure the mission is achieved is one of the greatest feelings. Ive worked incredibly hard over those 6 years and now ive transitioned into being a full time student. The change was hard, it was different. But staying focused and goal oriented, and organized as helped me along the way."
