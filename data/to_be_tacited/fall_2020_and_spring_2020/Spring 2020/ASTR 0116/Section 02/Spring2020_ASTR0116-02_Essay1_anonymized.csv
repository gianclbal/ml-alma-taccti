Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,231,"I am here because my mom gave birth to me. She decided when she was 18 she wanted a baby, so she had one. I wish she hadn’t because her life would have turned out so much differently and would have been much easier if she had not had me. She did not finish college because she found a job that payed well and spent time focusing on that; this made her want to send me to college because she did not get that opportunity. That is why I am here at SFSU. I could have been at my dream school in Chicago, but i chose this school because if was less expensive and I like the city of San Francisco. I am here in this Astronomy lab because it fulfills my GE for a lab and I could not take a lab for the biological anthropology. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,232,"I am in this class because i am taking astronomy 115 and this lab coincides with that class. Also, it takes care of the lab requirement for credit. ive always loved science and astronomy growing up but never really ventured outside of elementary, middle, high school classes. here at SFSU we get to focus a lot more on the stars, planets, go more in depth about Earth, the sun, the moon and its phases. additionally, i get to learn about how and why we learned various discoveries such as moon phases, earth's axis and how it gives us the seasons. solar and lunar eclipses as a result of the moon shadow castes upon earth. how we discovered when planets seem to move backwards, calling it retrograde motion. how to navigate using the north star polaris. the difference between heliocentric and geocentric theories and how one became to trusted as opposed to the other. whats cool about taking this class here is that we have a planetarium and telescope on the roof of the science building."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,233,"I am here because I exist. If I did not exist, I would not be here. Everyone is here for the same reason. Because everybody exists. Everybody is living their life, because life exists. What is the meaning of life? There are many... many meanings to life. There is the each individual’s purpose for life, from their dreams and aspirations. There is society’s purpose for life, which is to get a job and pay taxes. And there’s Biology’s purpose for life, which is to mate and reproduce, to pass on your genes and keep the chain going. Many ask why we exist in the first place. What is the meaning of our existence, why and how do we exist? Some people believe in God, and that God put us here. Some believe that we..."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,234,"Why am i here?It is a really interesting question. I feel like i have asked this question to myself a lot of times but never had the perfect answer. I know there is no perfect answer for it, we just have live this life to know why we are her and to what purpose we serve. As for why am i in the astronomy lab, it is because i have always been curious about astronomy and wanted to know what it feels like to learn and be taught about it and visit the planetarium.Being here feels nice as there are people to interact and share stories with, there are places to connect to and there are memories made and moments lived. As for why i am on this. planet?, i don't know but i feel like everyone serves a purpose for there existence and one day even i will know the purpose i am here and what is my purpose of existence. For now i will say i am here to live a happy and fun life. A life full of mistakes and lessons to learn form the mistakes, fall a nd get back up, wake up with a smile and end the day satisfied with how i spent it, i want to be here and not be worried about unnecessary things like bad vibes. i just want be here and be joyful."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,235,"I believe I am here for a reason, only God knows. I think as I grow up, I'm starting to come to a better understanding of what my purpose is here on Earth, but I do not completely understand yet. Sometimes, I feel as if I am here simply to be an aid to others. I am the friend you come to when you need advice. I am the peace maker. I am the one who always remains calm. I think that these type of characteristics must somehow. be tied into the big question, ""why am I here?"" Maybe I was placed on this Earth so I can help other people. These type of thoughts influence literally everything I do. I have chosen my career path based on this assumption as well. I just want to be someone others can count on, because in my darkest moments I have felt so alone. I Never want anyone to feel that way, so I make sure that no matter who enters my life, I become someone they can trust and confide in. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,236,"I’m in this astronomy lab because I want to learn more about astronomy. And also, I’m good at astronomy when I’m in high school. If it’s possible, I might choose astronomy as my minor major in SFSU. Im here to learn more things that I haven’t know about astronomy, so I can decide should I choose astronomy as my minor major. Therefore, I hope I can do well in this class. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,237,"I am here purely by chance. Random events have transpired throughout the course of time to bring me to where I am today. However in the grand scheme of things, many of my personal actions are meaningless, and my existence is completely insignificant to reality. I feel that I as a person exist solely within my head, and my physical body is just a vessel for my consciousness. I am aware of my existence, and give myself meaning and purpose by looking outwards. Yet, given this many of the things that give my life meaning are superficial, and its hard to grasp what exactly my purpose is other than to simply exist."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,238,"I am here to be the best version of myself. My goal in life is to succeed and accomplish every goal I set for myself by the age of 60 years old. I am here to give my parents in return everything they ever did for me. I am here today in Astronomy Lab simply because it's general education course I have to fulfill in order to continue on with upper division courses or to even graduate. I do not like being here because this course does not relate to my major and I'm failing the class. I am stressing and failing a course I do not need for my future plans. I am here to be the best at everything I do but that only includes things that interest me and topics that relate to my life. I do not like feeling like I'm wasting my time in class simply because I don't need this course, not because the class itself is so bad. I hope after taking this course this semester that I at least get something out of it, anything, even as small as knowing a moon phase. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,239,"Why am I here? That is such a broad question. Universally I think we are here to create something out of nothingness. Each one of us has a unique opportunity to find what makes us happy and what makes us want to be a part of existence. I think we are here to do anything and everything we want to. Globally, we are here creating a civilization out of the millions of us on the planet. Personally, I am here at SF state pursuing a higher education. In this class I am here to learn about laboratory procedures through astronomy of the sky and universe. Each of us has a difference purpose, which all amounts to finding what makes us happy. We are all here with our individual likes and dislikes so we can find what drives us. I'm not sure why exactly we were put here, on Earth, but I think it's important to make something out of nothing."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,240,"I think about this a lot. I feel like I am on this Earth to let stories be heard, whether it be my stories or other folks’ stories. I’m a big advocate for having proper/accurate representation, especially in media. That’s why I am studying at SF State, because of the nice cinema program offered there. While I was there, I appreciated a new setting compared to suburban San Diego. I am the first out of my siblings to attend a university so I am really trying to make them and my parents proud and also learn more about myself and other perspectives while in university. To me, this is my first step into becoming financially independent, since having a degree helps with getting a good job, although in my field, it would mostly be freelancing opportunities. I am here to make not only my name known, but the stories marginalized communities all around to spread awareness and perspective."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,241,"I’m in college to pursue a higher education. I’m in this class as part of the journey to earn a bachelor’s degree in child and adolescent development. I’m trying my best to be as successful as I can be. It’s been three years so far and I’m happy to say I am on track to graduate in 4 years. This makes me really proud of myself, especially because I will be the first in my family to graduate college. I want to be here on this planet to see where else life will take me. There’s so much I want to do. I’ve spent my whole life being a student and I wouldn’t want my life to be just dedicated to being a student. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,242,"My purpose in life, on this planet, here on earth, at this very day and age is to live to serve others. To live a life that does not solely benefit me, but rather to put another before myself in all situations. I strive to live this life everyday, although I am not perfect. As a human the tendency of self-absorption is an instinct, and to combat that would be going against our natural instincts as humans. However, this self-denying lifestyle has been proven and is continuously proven to be the most pleasant lifestyle to live holistically. From many testimonies of celebrities and billionaires that have acquired everything, the one thing that is a staple in all of their stories is that, after acquiring everything, living a self-indulgent lifestyle is not satisfying."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,243,"I am here because Astronomy is lab science that fills out my GE requirements. Specifically, I took Astronomy over the over offered laboratory classes because when my mom went to state she took this class. She claimed it was ridiculously hard and that it almost caused her not to graduate as a student. It's not entirely hard for me, I suppose, although the labs quizzes are somewhat frustrating. I wold have also much rather preferred this class would have been broken up into two days juts as the lecture is. Only for the purpose that some the information would stay more relevant in my head rather than only in the beginning of the week. In addition, I wouldn't probably feel so tired by the end of the 3 hours and still want to remain focused. I am here at San Francisco State University, the same reason people go to community. It's close to home where I can commute easily, I can work a lot if need be, but I also get some of the same experiences of being in ""real college"". Staying in the dorms is a special kind of hell. Although I'm grateful for the opportunity, I think I could flourish just as much if not more else where. I was born in the city, grew up ion the city, and now living my early adulthood in the city. Living in the city is fun but the goal is too hopefully transfer by 3 years. So I can spend my junior and senior year trying internships and exploring new places. However as of right now, I think Lab 116 is not so bad. And I like the planetarium."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,244,"“Why am I here?” is a very good question to me because I have been thinking of this question for a long time... If you ask me why am I in this class, I would say I need to class to fulfill my GE requirement, but this is not the only reason because there are other lab class that I can choose to fulfill my GE requirement. I wanted to be in this class because I think ASTR is a very fun subject, and I can know more about our planet and the Earth, etc.. Being in this class is very fun because people in this class are very nice, and it is easy to communicate with the teacher. If you ask me why am I here at SFSU, I can immediately tell that because I love this school. I was struggling on choosing college schools when I was in high school. And I felt that SFSU is a very good school for international students because people in this school are very open to international students, and I don’t feel being discriminated as an international student at SFSU.Why am I here in SF? I think SF is very diverse, I can meet all different kinds of people in SF, and people in SF are very open to everything, and I feel that everyone can be accepted in this city."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,245,"I don’t really know why I’m here in this class. One reason was to fulfill the requirements for my regular astronomy class? I guess I am here because I like astronomy. When I was in high school, I wanted to become an astronomer but I ended up coming to college for child development. I want to learn all there is to astronomy because our world is all about astronomy. We are small insignificant size things compared to everything else in the universe. Plus we never know when the world is going to end or how it’s going to end, so we might as well learn about it. Also I needed to take this class if I was gonna take the regular astronomy. I’ve got to say one things though, we are so much inferior compared to a lot of things in this universe, even on our planet. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,246,Why am I here? You can take that in many different directions. Physically i am in this class I am here because I want to graduate from college and I need these credits plus I like learning about astronomy. If I want to take this question even deeper I can say that I am here because I have a purpose. I don’t think I have exactly figured out what my purpose is but I’m working on finding it. That’s what college is supposed to be all about. This is the place where people go to learn more about the things they are interested in and they will guide them to their purpose in life. I think my purpose is to travel to third world countries and help people who really need it. I want to travel the world and learn about different cultures. That is my dream and hopefully my purpose. Maybe I am here to become a famous activist for human rights or maybe I’m going to find something else like criminal justice and follow that path to become a lawyer. Whatever it is that I end up doing I hope that it is something that makes me happy.
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,247,"I am here for numerous reasons. In this moment of time, at this spot in the universe, surrounded by these people. The simplest reason is that this is all just mere chance. I am here because conditions were right for my existence, nothing else. I happened to be born into the 21st century and happen to be fascinated by astronomy so I ended up here in Thornton hall. But if I ask once again, why am I here, a new answer can emerge. I am here because I followed my passions and dreams and right here and right now, happens to be apart of that journey. I am in this class because I was forced by SFSU to take a lab and I originally thought to take a classic lab, either chemistry or biology, but then I saw that Astro lab was a thing and my curiosity was beyond peaked."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,248,"Why am I here is a pretty loaded question, and even though I feel like everyone thinks about it all the time, it’s difficult to articulate how one feels about their place on this earth. I think the idea that everyone has a purpose is nice, because it implies that we’re not just here by happenstance. I don’t really believe in fate. I don’t think we have a predetermined role that we’re meant to fulfill, I think you can decide your own purpose, find for yourself what makes you feel happy and complete. If I had to choose, I would say I’m here to make stuff. I like to create interesting things, that’s what makes me happy. I want to have fun and love and be creative, and that’s why I think I’m here."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,249,"Why am I here? Everyone interpret this question in their own way. I would choose to answer in the way of why am I here in this class. I chose astronomy 115 because of GE requirement of the university. Also, we have to take one lab course and I choose Astronomy 116 thinking it will be easy if I will take astro 115 and 116 simultaneously. The reason why I chose specifically this type of science because I have never taken this type of science in my education life. I thought it will be interesting to learn about sky and universe. I wanted to try something different and i went for it. This course seems easiest out of all other science lab courses. Overall, I'm so far more than satisfied why I'm here. As I expected this course is pretty interesting and I found out more things that I wasn't aware of. Also, astronomy wasn't quite the same as I thought and I found answers to my questions. I have taken some other classes in my previous years of education and I surely can say this one is the most interesting one. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,250,"I believe i’m here to serve a purpose. My purpose is to learn, gain knowledge, help others, and grow from experiences. I learn in order to gain more knowledge because that’s how you get far in life. I want to learn so that I can have a career I enjoy and help others who need it. I’m here to make mistakes and learn from them so that I can grow as a person and become better not only for myself but for others as well. Although mistakes can be seen as a bad thing, I hope I make many so that I can grow from my own mistakes and experiences and help others along the way who may make the same mistakes or need help. I’m here to bring others ease. When i become a nurse, I’d like to help thousands and thousands of people who need the aid. I want people to be comfortable even in difficult times and i’ll do whatever it takes in order for that to happen. My purpose is to help and serve others whenever it need be. I’m in this class to complete my courses and get where i need to be. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,251,"I am here for two reasons: 1. I need to pass this class to get rid of a GE 2. I am very curious about our universe and the various things that inhabit it. I took astronomy last semester and really enjoyed it. Not just because the class was really easy, but also because the subject matter is always something of interest for me. I am infatuated with space and other planets far from us, so I wanted to further my study of astronomy by taking this class. I’ve been watching movies since I was a child, and the movies that always interested me were those that took place in space or on a foreign planet. Movies like The Martian or Avatar or any other science fiction film filled my mind with wonder about what was out there in the universe. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,252,"To be honest, I don't know why I am here. We are all following systems in this society and it kind of bugs me out. Maybe its the American dream or whatever everyone else is doing so everyone just followers each other. It's really weird. All I ever want to do is smoke a joint and play video games. But society doesn't let you do that. If you want to be successful in life in America, you got to follow the system. It doesn't matter what the hell you do. I'm trying to change the system so people can do whatever they want so they all have their own tasteful personality. Not just one computed reaction when someone says hello to you. I want to learn to be myself out there and do whatever I want so that way I can become successful without following a corrupt system like we all are. It sucks it just makes us look extremely weird and not smart at all. I sure hope being in college can be the right direction for me instead of being a waste of time and money to where I worked so dearly hard to be at. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,253,"Why am I here? Throughout my life, I've always wondered what the meaning of life is and what's our purpose as human beings. I never really put that much thought to it until my high school years and that's when I really questioned everything around me, after watching movies like the matrix and other sci-fi movies that involve a simulation type of world it really just like opened my eyes to everything. I started questioning things around me and I just feel like we're in a simulation. I also believe that there are other types of life out there in the Universe and that there are alternate universes where you made a different decision from what you made. But even after that I really don't know why we are put into this earth. I don't know why I'm here to be completely honest. I've been just living my life to the fullest each day at least because I know life is short and that you don't really have much time on this earth especially all those climate changes and all that. Plus I am also transgender so the life span of a trans woman of color is very low and I am just trying to live my life until someone finds me annoying and murders me. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,254,"I am here in this class because first, I had to take it. I needed to take a lab in order to complete a section (honestly I don't really know most of these GE's) and I didn't want to take the lab for Biology so I'm here. As for the second reason, I could have not come to class today, but I am here because this class is only once a week and it's quite interesting. We get to do more hand on activities which is how I kind of learn better, or it's proven for people to learn better this way. I have Astronomy lecture 15 min before this lab so it's really helpful to have these back to back so that it is easier to not forget information and to ask follow up questions I still has from the lecture. While this class is like three hours long it sometimes feels less, but then some feel long. I also get anxious when I see people leave early because they finished early because then I start to think that I'm going too slow. I think I should review the lab right after it too because I need to go at a slower pace to fully understand something."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,255,"Why am I here, you ask? I am here because I am required to take this class, well to be exact, I have to take any lab class. I chose astronomy lab because astronomy has always been an interesting course to me. It is amazing to learn how there are other planets, galaxies, and so many starts outside in outer space. Not only that but I also wanted to learn about the Sun and Moon and by taking this course, it is allowing me to do so. In astronomy, you get to learn more about constellations and also makes you question things that you never thought about. For example, are there any parts in the globe where Polaris can’t be seen? By taking this astronomy lab course, it allows me to experiment and learn about Polaris and also how to find the distance of a start and it’s altitudes and azimuth. If I hadn’t taken this course, I wouldn’t have known much about this topic. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,256,"I am here because Astronomy 116 is a course I am required to take alongside Astronomy 115. I am here in San Francisco because at the time of applying for college, I thought I wanted to move away from home and experience a new city. I am here at San Francisco State University because I fell in love with the city when I first visited back in 2017. I slowly became aware that San Francisco is not where I see myself in the future but I am still here to gain the experience of loving somewhere new on my own and accepting the challenge of being independent. I am here because I want to make my parents proud, and because they want me to be successful. I am here because I want to be successful. "
