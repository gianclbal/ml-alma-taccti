2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,238,"My values have helped me navigate through college much easier than I would have if I wasn’t sure of what my personal life values are. My values are influenced by my family values, I learned about values and respect thanks to my family. I learned that what one believes in is what we one should always stick to and follow. Moving away from college has shown me alot, like living on my own for example. Not only has this showed me how to live alone but yet it has most importantly showed me what my true values are. I have met many people now that I am in college and including myself many of us forget what our values are and allow other people disrespect our own values in order to satisfy theirs and that’s not okay. It’s always good to respect others and understand that people won’t always agree with you and you might also not always be right. I think it’s important to always consider other people’s feelings and values when thinking about commenting on them."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,256,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college in the way that I have been exposed to the idea of always putting in full effort to get the best results for my entire life. I have been taught that if there is something I truly want, it is fully out of my control on how I perform to achieve that certain thing. Essentially in college, that is the mindset I with hold in order to succeed and how I strive to do my best in class/ get the best grades I possibly can. Values such as being open-minded to the teaching styles and how my peers may act around me in a classroom, as well as staying positive through any struggles I may have in college. Staying positive and working through any difficulties is what has allowed me to stay true to myself as I am aware that not everything can be perfect or come easily. It is up to me on what I hope to gain from a class or situation, which for the past two years has helped me immensely in achieving good grades and a healthy mindset through college."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,239,"I grew up in San Clemente which is a beach town in Southern California. I also grew up in a household of doctors who stressed the importance of doing well in academics from a very early age. This means that I always strive to be in advanced classes and to try my best. This has positively impacted me in college for a few reasons. First, I am ahead in my G.E. courses at SFSU because I have credits from AP classes that I passed in high school. Also, I am much more interested in achieving a higher education because I feel its importance and relevance in my life. I am also able to be around people who may not necessarily have the same academic strive I have, and to not be influenced to copy their actions. I have learned to be my own person, while still taking some principles from influential people such as my parents and my brother as well as adapting new ones through wonderful people I have met in my life."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,235,"My parents have always stuck by the saying, hard work pays off. They came to this country as teenagers. They were dirt poor. My parents had no help from anyone. Coming to a country where you don't know the language, you have no one, and the system is stacked against you, it can seem almost impossible to succeed. However, they took whatever jobs they could, moved up, and soon became business owners. My parents made a name for themselves with nothing else but hard work. They've made sacrifices for me beyond my comprehension. Because of this, I make it my duty to make them proud. I have to succeed so that all their hard work was worth it. This is what keeps me going. Any time I begin to feel discouraged, or a lack of inspiration, I remember who raised me. Moving away to college, especially from a small farm town to SF, I almost felt like I was a foreigner too. However, I knew that if my parents could succeed in a new environment, I could do the same. My parents inspire me to peruse and education. My parents morals and values have got me through this big change in my life. I am going to get through college and hopefully make them proud."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,232,"Values go a long way in how we can make decisions, act, and treat people. Values can affect our lives in nearly every aspect. Specifically, for college, the values of my family are important. Being that I am the first of my family to go to college for a degree is huge. My little sisters are right behind me, with one of them also attending SFSU currently. Education was important for my family, for both of my parents it was not something they could easily do as I can. My mother had me and by brother by her age of 23. She did a technical school to learn specific trade to get a decent job to support us. So as we got older she emphasized the importance of going to college to increase the chances of having a successful future. Additionally, my time in the Air Force also increased my value of education. I wanted to get out of the military and pursue education, as it was payed for, to increase my options of employment an better pay."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,242,"Most of my direct family are immigrants that didn't finish school so they haven't really helped me navigate, however the life lessons they have taught became tools that helped me navigate through school. Whenever I am uncertain with where I want to go in life, it is always my family that supply me with encouragements and support in whatever road I choose to take. My parents play a big role in pushing me to always persevere despite how daunting a path may seem. They have always taught me to persist and to look at situations at a different angle to see it from a different perspective. More often than not, this analytical skill has allowed me to see things in a different light. Not only has it become second nature, but it has become a part of me, and it allows me to navigate not only through college but through life as well."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,247,"The values of my family and where I grew up clearly reflect on who I am today. It was always about being kind to other people and making people smile and laugh. I'm not quite sure where I picked up these values exactly but I know they have always been apart of me. I strive to help other people, whether that's a simple smile as I walk down the street, or a funny joke, or a person to rant to and lean on. These have helped me navigate not only college but my whole life. I believe that the most important thing is happiness and to truly be happy, you need to spread that happiness to others to help amplify it. Think of when you eat dinner, it's so much better when you eat with other people than by yourself and I believe that translates to life. If you are happy and can share that happiness with others, it only amplifies and grows. I have been able to meet and become friends with some really awesome people and it has also helped me have a mutual respect for my elders and teachers. Creating a positive environment around me so that there is never much room for negativity. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,236,"My family is a full Chinese family, and they will have a high expectation for me in college. In my parents’ value, they will expect me to have a straight-A in college, get scholarships, graduate early, and find a good and steady job in the future. For me, I only agree with half of their idea. I agree with the part of doing well in college, but I don’t agree with the part of being a nerdy person and find a steady job. I think my parents’ expectation is too old fashion for me. Everyone has their own personality and their things to like to do. If I listen to my parent’s expectations, I won’t have a chance to pursue my dreams anymore. For example, my parents expect me to choose as many major classes as I can so I can graduate earlier and get scholarships. But I will choose to take as many interesting classes in college as I can, such as piano class, astronomy class, language class. Even though people think astronomy class is hard and too much math, they might not get a good grade. For me, I still want to take it because I’m interested in astronomy. If I didn’t take this class, I would miss the chance to learn astronomy with such well-prepared equipment in college today and the same-age classmates together. As for the grades, I would try my best to do well since it’s one class I’m interested in. I have a responsibility to do well in the class I choose."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,254,"My family is one of the main reasons of why I go to college. I am lucky enough to have an older sister who I can go to for help. I honestly have no idea how she did it when she started college. She had NO ONE! she had to find out by trying new things and exploring. This experience of hers has made me realize that I am no where near independent as she is. I rely on her and my parents too much, which is a gift to me but at the same time, I know it will hurt me in the future. My mom did not go to college, so this college stuff is also new to her. But, she is always encouraging my sister and I to ask, and to take advantage of the opportunities we seem to bush off.  "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,249,"The values in my family helped me navigate through college.Specifically continuing college.My family is very serious about education and there was no such thing dropping off from college or not continuing education after high school. I have many friends who dropped from college when they got married because they started having kids etc and they had no time for college. But when I got married there was no such question, I was solidly told to graduate no matter what. So, here we are I'm still in college planning to graduate next year. I fell behind a year and I'm a transfer student. In order for me to graduate on time, CURRENTLY i'M TAKING 5-6 CLASSES each semester and taking summer and winter classes. Education is very valuable in my family as well as in my husband's family. Diploma is everything. This was the impact of my family values to my college navigation. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,251,"I have been very lucky to have lived in the culture built by my parents. Even though at times I have felt that they wanted me to have a specific career, they have been supportive of my decision to study film. My dad never really cared which school I went to, so it was easy for me to find what school fit, and that is Sf state. I am also incredibly lucky to have parents who are more than willing to help me with financing my education. We do have to take loans, but my parents assured to me that no matter what, we would find a way to pay for my schooling. Another important aspect of my family life are my two older siblings, who have always encouraged me to live my best life. Whenever I felt pressure to exceed a certain expectation for school/college, they have always been there to reassure and support my decisions. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,244,"When I just graduated from high school and knowing that I am going to college, I was very confused and lost about myself going to college because I knew nothing about college life. I was very lucky that my parents told me that being independent, honest, and working hard is very important as a person, so I take these values as suggestions for me going to college. After three years attending college, I found that what my parents told me is very useful and true. In college, no one would tell what to do, so I have to be very independent. Being honest is also very important; being honest is not only for school work, but also be honest to friends and teachers. I think working hard is the most important thing for me as a college students because if I don't work hard I would not pass my classes and be able to graduate from college."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,243,"Navigating through college was not exactly easy. Maybe it is because of lack of feeling connected to my family, which then would allow me the capability to be involved in a community. Severing ties between community and family was exactly the answer. At San Francisco State they are many communities. Many communities are ranked from surface level similarities. These would be communities of race and ethnicity. For race I would identify with other people with African American origins. If we were to take another step, I would identify with those who are creole. Creole people are those in ethnic groups which originated during the colonial era from racial mixing mainly between Africans and European. Specifically for my family everyone on my dad side is French Creole, hence my last name. For ethnicity you choose between Latino or Hispanic. People who identify with latino refers to people who are from or descended from people from Latin America. Hispanic refers to people who speak Spanish and/or are descended from Spanish-speaking populations. Most people notice the difference as if your family originates from Brazil you are Latino and if your family originates from Spain you are Hispanic. For me I would identify with Hispanic as my mom's dad or Papa, has a family originating from New Mexico, Spain, and (no one is 100% which tribe) Native American. Being intertwined with these two cultures allows me into communities celebrating Black (Creole) heritage, Hispanic (Mexican) heritage, and simply being mixed. All problems aside San Francisco State has large populations of both groups of people where I found and met many friends. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,241,"I am the first in my family to attend college, so, the college world is something completely new to my family and I. My parents immigrated from Mexico to seek better opportunities, such as a good education for my siblings and I. my family values education because we know we can gain even more opportunities if we are educated. My family is supportive of what I do. It is important for me that they support me because I want to be able to make them proud and make sure their sacrifice is well worth it. I am the oldest of three younger siblings and it is important for me to be a responsible role model. it is a role I didn’t expect would mean so much for me but I value my role as the older sibling. I always want to help them as much as I can since I didn’t have anyone help me. as for my community, I received a lot of support from other fellow first-generation students and people who wanted to see a Latina receive her Bachelors degree."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,240,"I think the values that kept through with me when I moved away from my family was to have a system. None of my family went to University after high school, so they didn't experience the college dorm life, but I grew up learning to keep certain systems and routines in place in order to keep my sanity, for lack of better words. Even though Mary Park Hall didn't really have a lot of room, I was able to stay organized and plan out my day to make sure I did what I had to do for (almost) each day. One of my favorite things to do was fold my clothes the way my mom taught me. Folding clothes always gives me this nostalgic feeling, because I remember being young and folding our laundry to Avatar: The Last Airbender re-runs on Nicktoons Network. It's comforting to find ways to feel at home from 500 miles away. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,255,"Respect and generosity have been the two most important values both in my community and my family. I come from a small town where a lot of people work in the fields/agriculture. Most of the families here are very humble and like to share with other people. My mother always taught me to respect others no matter where they came from or who they were. This helped me navigate through college because I met a lot of people who came from different cultures and races. I appreciate the diversity here at SFSU, it has helped me grow and appreciate other cultures and learned a few of other values from them. Meeting different people has helped me out in the work field and I am very thankful for that. Back home, I did not associate with a lot of different races because most of the people were Hispanic/Latina. I respect other people's values and beliefs and I believe I am very generous as well. College has been a fun experience and I am glad I was exposed to other beautiful cultures."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,245,"I didn't think I would make it through my first year of college, but with the support of my family and friends I was able to have confidence in myself and my knowledge. I don't know how I will do later on of if ill even graduate, but right now I am still going for my family and friends. I want to make them proud, and to know the people that doubted me that I can be successful. That I wasn't accepted to San Francisco State by accident. For years I was always known as ""the dumb one"" and I guess that sort of rubbed off on me, but my family and friends have had confidence that I an smart and I just need to see it. The least I can do is that, because I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,246,The values of my family have been a huge help in getting me through college. My family have always valued education so they have always pushed me to strive for the best when it comes to grades and school. They keep me check so i don't slack off and get everything done. My parents also value relationships with friends and other people and this has helped me navigate through college by helping me be very social and meet new people because going into college i knew no one. My family have always taught me how to step out of my comfort zone so i can grow as a person and learn more about myself which is a huge part of college because I am still in the process of learning what i like and my passions. College is all about being out of the box and finding yourself away from your family and friends. My strengths have always been being able to find my way through uncomfortable situations and putting myself out there. I am very proud of those skills because I have experienced so many new exciting things and make friendships that i know have helped me grow into who i am now. 
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,253,"I think everyone in my family went to college but in the Philippines so when i was growing up me going to college was something i knew I'd be doing after high school, both my parents graduated with a bachelor's degree back in the Philippines and my sister graduated with a nursing degree also in the Philippines but i, on the other hand, is the first-ever in my family to attend college in the United States which is a big deal to my family so they kinda forced me that i had to go to college which i was planning on doing already but- yea. Having almost everyone in my family attend college kinda pressured me to do well in college but they didn't really help me with anything like my FAFSA- i had to do everything with no clue of what I'm doing, i had to attend orientation on my own- basically, everything i had to do by myself with no help so my family didn't really help me navigate through college, they kinda just forced me to do it yet didn't help me navigate through it if that makes sense so i had to navigate and help myself go through my first year of college by myself. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,250,"My family has never really enforced many values or beliefs on me. My mother went to a two year college, my dad became an electrician, and my brother went straight into the army. However I believe I was able to develop values through my teachers and friends. My favorite high school teacher, Mr. Goldman was always there for me and encouraged me to do my best whenever I doubted myself with my school work. When I was struggling with school or with life, I would always turn to him and he would always do his best to help. I like to believe that I've adapted those values and I work hard in school and help others along the way as I learn more and more. My friends have also helped me. My friends are all incredibly smart and hard working. They are all truly inspiring and to see how far they’ve gotten with school has encouraged me to work hard. I believe support systems like teachers and friends have a huge impact on your schooling because they’re able to offer the support that I needed. They helped me with whatever question I had and I want to continue to work hard for them."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,248,"My parents have always been incredibly supportive of me pursuing whatever avenues I find interesting and engaging. They are both artists by trade so they obviously were excited when they heard that I wanted to go into an arts field after college, and I've never felt that I've had to prioritize earning potential or job stability over my own happiness. I'm a pretty motivated person, but I know that I'll always have my parents there as a safety net if I ever need it because they understand the challenges of working in a competitive industry. This has greatly affected how I navigate college and education in general, and I can thank my upbringing for teaching me to be a confident and diligent learner. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,2,252,"Nothing hasn't really really been helping me throughout college so far. I can only mainly thank my girlfriend for helping me get through it. She's a bit older but she is going through the same situation as I am too. It sucks. College really isn't my way to go study cinema. I would say a film school or art school, but what I have to do to just take classes for my major? I don't think that is great motivation or help from our community at all. If anything, they should offer classes of what we want to take. I have gotten many ideas from my friends but none from my community. I just want to do what I wanna do already so I don't have to do all these GE's stuff. I really don't see the point of doing it and whenever I ask a higher official, they all say the same thing, ""I don't know"". It is excessive and tedious."
