2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,258,"I want to go in the stem field because I've always been fascinated in science. I remember growing up and watching a lot of science based shows that I really liked learning from. Since elementary school, science was always and still is my favorite subject. Whenever I had a science project I always tried my hardest than other projects like writing. I know when it comes to STEM it incorporates a lot of things like writing and math. So, I'm learning to improve on those skills because they're very important in science. I feel that careers in the STEM field are sometimes under appreciated or forgotten. A lot of science, technology, and engineering have incredibly changed the human race and how we live. I've always wanted to be a part of that because they're the ones who are changing the world for the better even if it doesn't seem like it to people. I've always dreamed of working in a lab and conducting experiments or tests and research so to have the opportunity at a university is so amazing. I'm going to do my best to get a career in the STEM field because I know I'll find something I love. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,261,"I have several reasons for it. First of all, I can explore and understand what is going on in the world by studying the four areas at the same time. By attempting the activity, it lets me think problems critically everyday. and if i have basic knowledge of technology the scientific method, computers, essays, i will be more ready to adapt to the changes than people who have no experience in the field at all. Moreover, studying STEM provides me as a woman more opportunities to have jobs even related to men in workplace. It can eliminates gender discrimination such wage gap. Therefore, it can create gender equality society and women can live more freely as men. In order to create a successful life in the high tech world, STEM field is significant for young people to know what is happening in this world in many aspects. Because of these, i want to fo into the STEM field.  "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,263,"There are many reasons why I want to go in the STEM field. Even though, the major I am in is business. Since my major is business, I feel that it related to STEM because any company can relate to any type of business. For example, technology is in the word STEM, and there is a lot of business that either builds technology or educate others about tech. One reason is job availability. Since STEM stands for Science, Technolgy, Engineering, and Mathematics. Those fields have a more in-depth, wide range of fields with new jobs still coming each time. This means with the education of STEM, I have a bigger opportunity to get in a job when I get older. Another reason is how it relates to the future. I feel that people that go into STEM careers make the world keep involving. I want a job not only to help the world but also my future and everyone else too. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,273,"Since the reflective journaling essay today is ""why do I want to go into the STEM field?"" I just wanna begin by saying, I am going into the liberal and fine arts field. Very risky in times like these, I know. If I were to go into STEM, however, I would want to branch out into the Science of Math field. I'm not very good at math or the memorization of scientific terms, but I do find myself enjoying the challenge I'm given. My limit for Math is trigonometry to basic calculus and for Science, I'm limited to very little Biology. If I were to go into the STEM field, I would want to pursue a career in being a Math/Science professor, or a researcher.If I was in the field, I feel like my main goal would be making the world a better place whereas some of my peers would do it for the money. I would want to apply the skills that I have gained from my background to perhaps solving the math to make better space predictions or the science to find the cure to deadly diseases. PATHOS is everywhere and they really get to me. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,272,"I do not want to go into the stem field... I want to go into cinema. Stem is an interesting subject i think. I always enjoyed science, but never was really good at it. Just wasn't organized enough. I really liked chemistry because it was the easiest for me to understand and I had good teachers for it. I think I struggled the most with physics and biology. I thought biology would be more about just animals and stuff, which I know the most about and would love to learn about, but boy was I wrong. Physics was just bs. Did not enjoy it one bit and was unable to grasp the concepts very well or be interested in them for that matter. I think if schools offered more unique sciences than just the main three of chem bio and physics, you would get a lot more people interested in exploring different fields."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,276,"I absolutely do not want to go into the STEM field. Ever. I have NEVER been good at science. School is very important to me and I always put school and studying over everything but science doesn't care. My brain cannot entertain the idea of science. However, I do love science and I always wanted to be good at it. I especially loved chemistry, even if it's the only class I ever got a B in. I find science incredibly interesting, my brain just doesn't work like that. I excelled in the arts even when I was a kid. I started acting at a really young age and was always ahead of the game with my reading levels. Once I got into high school I breezed through all of the advanced English classes, and was a top performer in drama and got my own production on the school news network. But, I needed a tutor in every science class I took. Once I got enough credits to graduate I stopped taking it altogether. I was always decent at math. Until I got to Calculus. I did okay for awhile but I'm also terrible at taking tests and quizzes and when it comes to STEM, I can't talk my way into an A like I can with an essay. I like using words, but science is always very numbers and straightforward language that's difficult to understand for me. I like making sketch shows and sitting in front of my computer editing short films for 18 hours at a time. So I'm still a dork, just not a science dork."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,262,"Personally, I don't have a desire to go into the STEM field. I feel like math was not really hard for me growing up, however, science has always been something that I struggled in. Many times, I do find it interesting it just is not where I excel and it isn't my passion. General education, however, has helped me find ways to like science more for sure. Overall, the main reason I think I don't want to go into the STEM field is because I feel like I've always just been more attracted to creative projects rather than math/science type of activities and I found my passion for making film and tv shows and have had it for many years now. I have noticed though that in everything that one does, the scientific method in some way or sort does come up more than someone would think. Like oftentimes, when you're stuck trying to figure out a problem what does someone do? They make some kind of educated guess on what is the best way to figure something out and then they test it. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,267,"I actually do not want to go into the STEM field, i want to go into the performing arts field. I.e. singing acting and dancing because ever since i was 13 years old when i did my first musical i have been in love with the stage, my major is even Theater Arts. I have done many musicals and have no desire to do anything else. I would absolutely love to be on Broadway one day. In high school i was in Show Choir, played the guitar and piano and Advance Drama as well as Advance Dance/Choreography. Don’t even get me started on my love for music and just singing in general. I have been singing since I was 4 years old and this is the main field I would like to go into. Don’t get me wrong some things in the STEM field are cool, like Physics, in high school I took Honors Physics and AP Physics II."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,274,"I do not want to go into the STEM field. I am Accounting Major, so I am not trying to go into the STEM field. The reasoning as to why I do not want to go to the STEM field is because I feel like science and mathematics isn't in my skillset. I believe that I am not smart enough to be able to pursue in the STEM field. I do believe that STEM is a necessity in today's world. Science and math can be seen everywhere and I'm glad that we have people that want to pursue into this field. Maybe they want to make a change or contribute in society. New technology and innovations can be created from those who study in the STEM field, therefore making a change in society, economy, and perhaps the world. But for myself, I simply believe that I can't make any contribution to society if I were to study in STEM. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,266,"I actually don't want to go into the STEM field. I have decided to study social work. I have always been concerned about the well  being of others and the injustices they are faced with, and pursuing a career in the stem field would not be the right path for me. I have enjoyed many of my science based or even math courses, but I dont think in the long run I would truly be happy if I made the choice to be in a STEM related field. On the other hand I do really understand the importance of these fields. I just do not think I would be the right person for it. Even if I did go into the STEM field I have no idea what I would study. I have always been interested in the human body, so maybe something related to that. Maybe anatomy or biology. But even thinking about it stresses me out because I know how hard these subjects can be. But I'm sure like with anything if I put the time into it, I would start to get it. But it just isn't my calling. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,260,"I am not very interested in going into the STEM field. I am a BECA major, so I’m more interested in creating media. However, I have always been excellent at math and science and my mom used to tell me I should go into STEM. I have deep respect and admiration for scientists because they have the courage to look for the truth. Science tells us the way things work, to the best of our capabilities of understanding. It’s the infinite journey to find out the how and why, whether it’s how basic cells are the building blocks of all life, or why the sky is blue; science is the search of understanding. It’s hard to think philosophically or even spiritually without considering science, as we rely on it to explain the world (and universe) around us. I’ve always had a curious mind and wondered how things work, and so I’ve always loved science, but I do not have a passion for it. My favorite kind of science is Astronomy because I think space is beautiful and terrifyingly fascinating. Space is such a vast, dark place and we are just a speck on the cosmic scale of existence."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,271,"My relationship with math has always been rocky. I remember teaching myself basic algebra and feeling there can't be anything harder in life. However, in high school I started improving the most in my math classes. The math teachers I had were amazing and I always felt like I could approach them with questions. Since I felt the most comfortable in their classes my learning environment was much better and it was easier to get better grades. I think I was also inspired by their passion for teaching math. A subject I used to dread became something I could look forward too and math homework became the easiest for me to complete. As long as I knew what I was doing, completing math problems felt super satisfying. Putting in my headphones to listen to my favorite jams while completing math worksheets became homework I looked forward to. Once I graduated high school I wasn't sure what to major in but I knew I would be comfortable pursuing something even if it had math involved. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,270,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field?... Huh. To be honest, I never thought of myself as someone that had an interest in going into any of those categories. In fact, I went into college having the arts as my main pursuit. I guess I was naive to believe that I'd become a great artist and that I wasn't going to run into ""that"" many problems going into the real-world. But the more I realized that college is going to be the first four-years of my life where I really form my identity as a person, I had begun to understand that these years are actually very important. If I was going into the world with that mindset, I basically knew that I was going to get eaten up by literally everything at the very moment I think I know it all. So in order to find all that trouble, I decided on going into finance or more specifically accounting. What my reasoning for making this switch, will always boil down to is that I was fearful that I wouldn't be respected by people for my choices and that I was going to probably die broke and become a huge disappointment to everyone around me who believed in me. The kind of person I actually like to believe I am, is someone who thinks logically and carefully before heading into things that I'm well aware are too big for me. So if I wanted to place a safe bet for my future, I would definitely put my future in a direction where I know I'll get both money and respect. That's the sad truth pill I had to swallow. And it sucked."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,277,"I am not a STEM major. My major is International Relations with a minor in Global Peace, Human Rights and Justice Studies. I took this class simply because in my opinion it is the most interesting physical science which is one of the general education requirements. Overall, I have really enjoyed the class and it has given me a better understanding of Astronomy which is helpful for the astronomy lecture class I am currently taking. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,275,"I do not really want to go into the STEM field. I don't think that field of work is really suited for me in my opinion. I just enjoy studying different fields of work in the future, I would probably prefer to be able to work with cars or a similar type of work in the field, I enjoy making things or fixing things to be able to see them work and look at how I can make a couple of metal objects all come together to make a moving machine as to where before it was just stationary object. Though my college career still continues maybe my choice of a career or ideas of what I want to do in the future will change, and maybe I will fall onto the path of STEM field of work, who knows it is a question that is in the air as of now."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,265,"I actually do not want to go into the STEM field. I am actually terrible at science and math. I am in astronomy  because it is a requirement at San Francisco State. I chose astronomy because I thought it would be an interesting class and so far it has been. I actual have a bachelors in history and Chinese here at San Francisco State, so I am pretty far away from the STEM field. This is technically my last semester before I enter the credential program for which I am very excited. But for right now I have absolutely no interest in going the STEM field. I believe that is reserved for those who are good at math and science. My talents are those for social science and english. That is why I want to become a history teacher. "
