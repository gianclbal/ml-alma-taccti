2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,258,"I do know why I’m in this class which is because I want to learn more about astronomy and the sky, planets, stars, and all that. To me it’s so crazy how the universe is so big to put it simply. There’s so much that humanity hasn’t discovered and to some people that’s frightening. To me it’s amazing how we’re just this small planet in a small galaxy in a gigantic universe. It seems never ending and that’s what I find so crazy. Sometimes I think that we don’t really matter in comparison to the whole universe. I know I matter to people but to the whole universe I really don’t know. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,259,"I am here for several reasons and those reasons can be broken down to more reasons. For instance, I am here in this class room because I am a college student who wants to get a degree and gain an education. I am here as a college student because I want to utilize my education to help me expand my growth for what I will do for the rest of my life. I want to expand my growth because I would like to contribute to the world as my career and help people and the environment in ways such as art and communication. I want to help the world because I believe there is still hope in humanity and that our conflicts are not necessary because we all want the same thing (I would hope) love and happiness. I would like to think we want positive things because I think that’s part of the meaning of life. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,260,"I am here primarily because I need a lab credit to graduate. I actually took the astronomy lecture about 3 years ago, so much of the information I learn in this lab are very distant from my memory. I've always loved space and cosmic objects, so when it came down to choosing a science to take, I knew I wanted to take astronomy. However, it was really difficult for me because the concepts can get very complicated and there was obviously a lot of math and physics involved which are not my strengths. My only hope is that I'll be able to pass this class and graduate smoothly. I'm disappointed that I neglected to take the class sooner and now I have to struggle to understand the concepts all over again. I do enjoy going to the planetarium and having the extra push to look up at the moon and stars. It's a nice opportunity to deepen my appreciation for space. As a senior this semester, I am trying to have a chill last semester and this class is a little more stressful than I would want (with all the quizzes), but I do need to graduate. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,261,"When I think about this question, I did not come up with the strong reason. However, this made me think that how I want to live in my life. I consider myself that I prefer to stay with someone not being alone. I feel happy when I am with someone and I want to make them happy and comfortable by staying with me. In addition to it, I love listening to others. Therefore, the reason why I am here is to be a person who listens to others and make them comfortable and happy. This makes me happy too. Throughout this question, I also got to think that I want to spend productively and meaningfully in every single day. Why I am here? because to make someone and myself happy. In order to do it, I found my path that I have to love myself first. Otherwise, I am not able to love someone. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,262,"Originally, I’m here in this class because San Francisco State University has a requirement for a science lab in order to complete a bachelors degree. A year ago, I chose to take astronomy because the other science class named intimidated me, I’ve never been good at science so the idea of taking biology or chemistry sounded scary. I had a pretty bad experience in the astronomy lecture in the fall of 2018. I almost failed the class and it really discouraged me. I pushed off taking the lab for a couple semesters because of it, but now that I took this class I'm pretty happy I did. I'm starting to learn some of the concepts I was supposed to learn in ASTR 115 and I really like the hands on nature even though I have to work pretty hard at understanding the information I feel like. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,263,"The reason I am here taking an astronomy lab is because I took an astro lecture class last semester. Since I took the lecture I thought why not also take an astronomy lab too. But, I was interested about the stars and how the universe came to be. I never took this class in high or middle school. So I thought it would be interesting to take a science that I have never taken before. Taking this lab made me understand the universe more than the lecture because there are hands on activities that show what a lecture class can't do(because I am more of a visual learner). The time that I had spent in this class made me want to go outside and look at the sky more often. I was able to find Venus with the help of people from the SFSU observatory. Now whenever I look out at the night sky, I can spot that planet."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,264,"Why am I here? I am here to get credit for science. I am here because I left my other class early and I don’t want to miss two classes today. I am here because I want to get an education so that I can get a good job. I am here because I care about my grades and about the effort I put in. I am here even though I really want to be napping outside in the sun or at the beach. I am here because I want a good grade in the class. I do not want to fail. I am here in San Francisco because it is one of my favorite places ever. I am here to go to school and make a life for myself. I want to be here and I am happy I am here even when I feel sick and tired. Sometimes I forget why I’m here, so this is honestly a good reminder. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,265,"Why am I here? If this question is pertaining to the astronomy lab, I am here to fulfill the GE requirement from San Francisco State. I take it concurrently with the Astronomy class taught by Chris McCarthy. These two classes are a science requirement from the university that are needed to graduate. If this is a philosophical question I am not sure why I am here. Many people struggle with the question of why they are ""here."" Some find answers in religion or simply do not think about why they are ""here."" I tend not to think about why I am here and simply live day to day. I find it pretentious to think about it and self congratulatory and those who do view themselves better than others. I am here to graduate from San Francisco State University with two degrees and find a good job to support a family and myself. I believe that is why I am ""here."""
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,266,"I am here because I need a lab in order to fulfill my General Ed requirements. I originally was going to take biology, but after I took the biology lecture I was not very interested. I have never studied astronomy before and I figured it would be interesting, which it is. I was nervous for the lab at first because I had no idea what kind of labs we would do or what they would consist of. So far it has been good. Everything we have been learning has been aligning with what I’m learning in my astronomy lecture, which helps so I’m never really too confused. I was also nervous for the length of the class. 3 hours is a very long time to remain focused on one task with no break, atleast for me. But thankfully we usually finish pretty early which is a plus for me, because I don’t know if I would be able to focus "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,267,"To be quite fair I'm not sure what anyones purpose is on the planet. I along with most believe my purpose is something greater than what's expected. I believe I am here to spark change, be a spark of something that should have been present long ago. Now, Im not saying I have higher power, but what I am saying is that I can be part of a higher power to help bring light to everything on earth. my purpose is change and enlightenment. I will be the solution instead of problems, and this goes for me being in college, or my personal life, or any job."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,268,"I am here because I deserve to be here. I have worked very hard, both mentally and physically to get where I am today. Coming from a low-income family, having no financial support, and growing on my own were some things I had to face. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,269,"I’m here in my Astronomy Lab class because I need the class to finish the lab portion for my general education.  I’m here to learn from all of my classes and carry on the knowledge throughout my life. I go to college to get a degree in order for me to get a good job once I graduate. Being able to go to college will give me the knowledge I need to know what I should do when I get my job as a business major. I’m here to stay and see my dogs grow. I’m here to become a person who can inspire others and help others who are in need. To live life to its fullest and see where life takes me. I’m here to see nature and admire how beautiful it is. Lastly, I’m here to help animals who are in need of help and the species that are close to extinction. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,270,"I am here because it is apparently required if I take the Astronomy lecture course, which I am. But as the weeks go on I've started to realize why I ""keep"" being here, and it's because I actually enjoy learning about this stuff. The first time I was exposed to this field of study was in 8th grade science class which included a section of Astronomy and it was a blast. I guess since then, I've forgotten how intriguing this whole field of study was and the reason I keep coming to this lab is because it's fun and interesting, though I wish I wasn't as long as it is; I realize though why that is."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,271,"I try not to think too hard on questions like these. Otherwise I'll start digging myself deeper and deeper into every possible reason why the universe would lead me to where I am. Thinking about this question in a broad context, there really is no reason for why I end up anywhere. Yeah, someone or something influenced me but in the end I know I decide why I'm there. Astronomy's not my strong suit, nor was it ever an interest of mine, but I'm here nonetheless and what I get out of it is all up to me. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,272,"Why Am I Here? I Think you could interpret this so many different ways. In terms of this class, I would say I needed the extra unit to complete this GE requirement and so Im here in this class now. In terms of Sf state, or studying cinema here at sf state, i would say im here because I have a passion for film and I want a college education to help me in my future aspirations. In terms of why im here like why do I exist or ”why am I?” I would say because of my parents choosing to have me. And because I came into existence on the only known planet to support life. I think this question is super broad and can be taken in different directions. I guess I just answered the different paths that I thought about when reading this question for the first time."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,273,"I am here in this lab class because I needed to finish one of my general education requirements. I am also here because I took the astronomy lecture class in the spring of 2019. Anyways, I really like this class. I feel like I am doing a lot of the hands-on stuff that we never got to do during the lecture class. It’s also fun getting to collaborate with the other students in the class. I am in this class because I also chose to be in the class. I chose to take a path that would teach me about the stars, the moon, and what lever else is above us. So far, I feel like I have better understanding with the moon phases, and I’ve also learned the difference between the big and little dipper (finally). The same can be said about asterisms and constellations to me. Also, we got to go to the planetarium a couple of times and it was great being able to see what that was like. It confused me at first, but soon I was able to catch up."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,274,"Reflective Journal Essay #1	The question “Why Am I Here?” can be interpreted in many ways. I can talk about why I am here at this current moment or why I am here on Earth. The reasoning as to why am I here in this Astronomy Lab class at San Francisco State University is because I am just trying to fulfil my lab General Education credits. I need these credits for my General Education in order to move onto my Upper Division General Education classes and my Upper Division requirements for my major, which is Business Accounting. Then I’ll get my degree in Business Accounting, find a job, get a home, and start a life with my own family. 	I can also talk about my purpose as to Why Am I here on Earth. Thinking from an evolutionary perspective, my purpose in life is to pass off my DNA and produce offspring in order to keep my family tree going."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,275,"Why am I here? I don’t know exactly, I don’t think I am here for any specific reason that I know of. I do also think that I’m not here to just be a blob and not do anything productive in society as well as not do anything for my life’s purpose. I do hope to be successful within myself and my capabilities. Not as much as successful with money but more towards helping others. I naturally enjoy helping other people and helping people in need. But in the smaller picture in this class I am here because I need this class as a requirement to be able to graduate and get my degree and move onto my career. So I’ll be able to get on with my future life goals, and succeed for my “purpose” in my life. I also do hope to be able to make contributions to help better my family. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,276,I’m in this class because I am an arts major and terrible at science and picked the science class that would be semi interesting but also satisfy my GE credit. I come straight from work so I am usually late and then I am here sweating. I’m here because I sort of know what’s going in astronomy and try to pay attention. One of my best friends back home is also an astronomy minor and enjoys teaching me what I don’t understand. He says it makes him feel smart. Overall this is the only science with a lab that I thought I would be semi successful in. It takes a lot of effort for me to study and work for this class because I have a short attention span with things I’m not fully interested in. The labs are better than if I were to be in biology or chemistry because I can at least understand what’s going on in this class. It’s more logic based and memorization and that’s something I can do easily. 
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,277,"I am here at San Francisco to further my education and to get my degree in IR. It is crucial for my success in the future to have a college degree in something I am passionate about. Now on the other hand, I am in this Astronomy Lab class because I am currently taking Astronomy 115 and decided to take the lab tied into that class. It is a general education requirement for us students to take a lab class with one of the science classes of our choice. After much thought, I did not want to take biology with a lab, nor take chemistry with a lab as those classes seem to be more difficult. This class seemed the most interesting to me and for that reason I chose to take it. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,278,"I am here because of my family; they brought me up, and went through numerous obstacles for me to have a better future. I am here because of my friends, whom gave me confidence, happiness, and love. I am here because of everyone who gave me strength to continue, whether it be right or wrong. I am here for a purpose, just like everyone else. Though I may not have a set purpose everyday, what strives me to keep going is the unknown future; it can always be a better day tomorrow. The experiences I went through, also shapes why i am here today. Whether it be good or bad, the influence it gave me, made me a better person today. I am here, because I look forward to what the future holds for me; the experiences I can gain, the new connections I can make, and also the new places I can explore. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,279,"""Why am I here?"" is a question that runs through my head surprisingly multiple times a day whether it be me exploring the bay or walking to my classes. When I ask why am I here I don't wonder what I am I doing in this particular location, no matter how sketchy it is, but I wonder what brought me to the Bay Area. Moving from a suburban/farm town in Southern California its crazy to think that I moved away 6 hours away. I am here because I wanted to further my education  and move away but wanted to still have a chance to be free. "
