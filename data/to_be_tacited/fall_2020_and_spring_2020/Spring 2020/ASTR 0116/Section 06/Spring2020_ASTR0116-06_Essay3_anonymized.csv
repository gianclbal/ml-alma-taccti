2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,269,"What do I do when life gets challenging? Well, I think it depends on the situation whether it is from a quiz, an exam, or an assignment. However, for me, I feel challenged when I do my quizzes or exams. When that happens, I know I can't give up and continue to study even if I end up with a bad grade I'll know that I still tried my best. With a bad grade, I'll feel really upset about it and doubt myself. But, knowing that if I continue to doubt myself and feel upset I wouldn't get anything done. In other words, I need to find a way to study better and find other options to remember important information for the exams or quizzes. Sometimes I would also go and talk with  my mom about what's going on at college and how upsetting it was. She would tell me that it's okay and continue to just do the work and keep trying. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,273,"When life gets challenging for me, i try and make myself busy. I do that by doing some homework, maybe cooking when I want to try to, journaling about movies I've seen or journaling my goals, or draw. Recently, however, I have been sleeping off my stress. When I make art, I like to invest some time drawing new things, trying out different mediums. It's just therapeutic and relaxing to me.When it's school work that stresses me out, I try and plan out how I'm going to do all the work. I write in in planner for me to not forget, then space myself by avoiding it and finishing things 2-3 days before they're due. When I do avoid my work, I revisit old video games that I used to play (right now it's minecraft because i just remembered my old password). I also like to watch movies or tv shows I haven't seen before. I also like to shop online, especially when I'm so stressed I just treat myself (If I have the funds that day or not). I love art and retail therapy. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,265,"When life gets challenging I tend to think to myself that it gets better or that tomorrow can't be any worse than what is happening right now. I think this topic is in reference to the coronavirus that we are experiencing right now. Obviously this is a serious epidemic but, I'm looking on the bright side. Teachers and students now have a relatively lighter work load, people get to spend more time with family, do what they like indoors, because here in San Francisco we are on lockdown. But I think things will get better. This isn't however good for our economy but it will recover as things always do. Something that I usually never had time for was reading, but now since everything is online I have much more time to read and complete projects I had to put on hold due to school. So when life gets challenging I always remain optimistic that things will get better."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,278,"When life gets challenging, take a step back and find the problem. It may be hard, but that's life. Tell yourself there is no such thing as failure- only learning opportunities to better yourself. When things don't go the way you want it to go, just tell yourself that better things will come in the future. Whens things don't work out, there's no harm in trying again; failure will only bring you experience.  Everyone goes through challenges in their life, you are definitely not alone. If you want things to change, you need to start with changing yourself. Don't procrastinate and hold things back to the last minute, as things will only get more stressful. Surround yourself with things that bring you joy; don't get addicted to your problems as they are only temporary. Stop comparing yourself to others people; everyone has a different story. You can't have a positive life with a negative attitude. Always stay positive. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,261,"When life goes challenging, I firstly try to understand the situation which is changing from the normal life so that I can face it calmly.  In addition to it, I would think of the challenging in a way which I need the situation to step up in my life because I believe human beings have learned and achieved from having more failure than successes. Furthermore, there is no failures but lessons, so I see hardships as lessons. Considering hardships in a positive way is helpful to cope with them. Thus, I take challenging positively because they teach me important lessons I need for my better life and it’s the time to learn and step up. But some hardships are way too serious and hard to go through, so I sometime feel I want to give up and run away from the situations. In the case, the most effective way for me to solve them is to ask my people whom I respect and gain some advice. Dealing with them after all is me not my people but their advices really help me and cheer me up. Those things are my way to solve the situations when life goes challenging."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,262,"I feel like there are definitely things that I do whenever times get hard or life feels too overwhelming. Some things that I try to do to take care of myself are read. I like to read easy fiction during times where I need to calm down, mainly leaving me reading many young adult novels, but I like it because it is simple and easy to escape the world for a little bit. Another thing I like to do is write, sometimes journaling, or writing poems or whatever comes to mind can be helpful and cathartic when you have a lot on your mind. Another thing I like to do if I can is plan out some sort of plan of action to make everything feel more manageable. I've noticed if I feel like I have a lot to do, I can write it all out and figure out when I can do it. This usually helps me when I'm feeling truly overwhelmed. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,260,"When life gets challenging, I usually just feel everything more intensely. Sometimes I get frustrated with myself for getting overwhelmed by things, but then I try to remind myself that I can learn from each bad experience. For all those times I cried or got angry when life threw me curveballs, I also learned that things have a way of working themselves out in the end, and that they usually get worse before they can get better. Right now is a very challenging time for the whole world with the virus that’s spreading. I think it’s an important time of growth for everyone. We need to use this opportunity to unite as people and become more compassionate and empathetic towards each other. I think, instead of seeing this confusing and stressful time as a disturbance in our lives (which it is, in a lot of ways), we should focus on healing ourselves, both physically and spiritually."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,277,"When life gets challenging I do different things. Depending on what's going on or however challenging the situation is my response varies from time to time. There are times in which I shut down and don't know what to do, I just freeze and waste time thinking. On the other hand there are times where I don't want to be stuck so I do whatever possible to leave the state I am in and work on whatever challenging problem I’m faced with. When stressed I like to go to the gym and run my life out or paint to relieve the stress."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,263,"When life gets challenging, there are many ways I would try to calm myself down. If I’m stressed out I would go to my friends to calm me down. Usually just talking to them will help me relieve the stress or problem that I am having. Another way that I can get through a challenging problem is finding things that I love to do. For example, art, gaming, or watching videos calms me down too. Then after I calm down, I would overview what my problem is and then brainstorm ways to fix it. Lastly, test all those ideas and probably one them can fix that challenge. One of the problems that I am currently having is online classes. It is great that I don’t need to leave home to go to class, but I feel lazier and less productive. The way that I had found to fix my laziness is video chatting with my friends. I know it doesn’t work for a lot of people, but it does for me. They push me to do my work and if I’m distracted they would tell me to go back to work. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,274,"What do I do when life gets challenging? Whenever life gets challenging it can be very difficult for me to get back on track. I can hit a dead end or even an obstacle in my life, but it won't stop me from moving on and getting through it. I always have that mindset that whatever issue that I have going on, it isn't as significant enough as the other issues that people face in a daily basis. There are people in the world who don't have basic necessities that a human being as to have. People don't have access to water, food, medicine, and even a home to call their own. Thats how I overcome these challenges I face. I see that I should be thankful for the life I have and to have to motivation to overcome any challenge that comes my way because my mere issues don't compare to what others are facing. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,271,"Challenging to me means things that go beyond my control. Whenever aspects of my life start to stray from the plans I've so carefully thought through, that's when it feels everything starts to crumble. When things starts to change really quickly, the best way for to me cope is to focus on adapting. Adapting is what I know I should do but that doesn't mean it comes easy to me. It may take me a while but learning to change with the change has always helped me cope when life gets challenging. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,275,"When life gets challenging I usually take a step back and try to stay calm at any situation i run into. I always try to keep a positive outlook on life and the bumps that occur with it. As well as when I face a challenge that i become stuck on for a while I always try to talk to a person who has faced a similar problem or an older person, just because they have more life experience than I do and they may know what to do in certain situations that I would have never thought of doing. Also a good idea that I learned from a class in high school is to always just brain storm and try to write out ideas of what to do before taking any actions and writing out the outcomes that could occur if I was to go down that road of which I am choosing.  "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,267,"when life gets challenging I tend to t try and beat the odds of what can come to be. I don't want to be like everyone else and take an L, I want to take any challenge given to me. Challenges to me are small roadblocks, and how would you get passed that roadblock? will you turn around and accept defeat or give it all you got and run through it, even if that means getting knocked down a few times. “Challenges are what make life interesting and overcoming them is what makes life meaningful.” – Joshua J. Marine"
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,266,"Unfortunately, I need to work on handling tough situations better. In the beginning, I usually tend to doubt myself and focus on the negative aspects. After dwelling and making myself feel worse for a while I snap out of it and realize feeling sorry for myself is not going to fix my situation. It really helps me to remember that whatever is going on and the bad feelings at the moment are all temporary, and soon everything will pass as long as I work hard and put all my effort in. I also have a really good support system. My mom is always my go-to when I need to vent or need advice, she always has my best interest in mind. Writing things down also helps me to relieve stress in tough situations. I am really big on to-do lists and staying organized to help me stay on top of everything that is going on."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,259,"There are certain things we can control and what we can't control when life gets challenging so it is important to recognize what we can and can't control in order to stay calm. For instance, I can not control what happens outside my life such as the virus outbreak and I can not control other people and their thoughts. I also can not control the fact that school will be online now and I am under a 24 hour curfew, preventing me to see my family. However, I can control what these things make me feel. I can control my actions after these facts have been acknowledged by me. Knowing I can not control those other things allows me to control my peace of mind and it helps me focus on what I can control which is myself. So, at a time like this it is best to practice self-care and review my values and morals and begin to work on them more. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,272,"When life gets challenging I tend to take two approaches. One approach, which is my usual approach is to try and take a step back and figure out what options I have and way the pros and cons. I am not good at having issues in my life. I like to find solutions to them immediately or they will bother me until its done. My other approach is sometimes is to just try and put it out of my mind for as long as possible. This is rare because its hard for me to forget about anything because most things will bother me to no avail. But every once in a while, I will put something off because I so much don't want to deal with it. But overall, I try and deal with whatevers making life hard, as soon as possible. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,276,"I often try to be as adaptable as possible. I try and take life as one day at a time and just move through each day. There's no reason to stress about the future if. you have no control, and right now, I have no control. All I can do is stay inside and hope everyone else does too. I moved back home which was nice at first, but now I've realized it's not  what I need,  so I'm planning on coming back to SF so I'm not living alone.  I always  try to do what is best for my mental health, because if my mental health is in  check, I will be able  to handle problems easier. Staying home has forced me  to look at  the positives. I've been able to paint more, sleep in, watch my shows I'm behind on, and when I focus on that, the idea of having to do production classes at home doesn't suck as much. That's all I have to do is just live in the present. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,258,"When life gets challenging, I first start to overthink everything because that’s what I always do. I start to think that everything is going wrong because of me and I’m doing something wrong. My emotions get all crazy and my anxiety gets worse. I start to blame myself for everything and sometimes I don’t know how to stop thinking like that. After a while someone usually notices that I’m acting different. They start to tell me that I’m overthinking and that I can’t control everything. Once I see that they’re right I usually calm down and start to think rationally. I calm myself down and I say to myself that everything will work out in the end. I do things to make me relax like read, draw, do some self-care like face masks and watch movies. I talk to my friends and they always make me laugh. I talk to my family too because they support me through everything. I realize that I’m not alone in these challenging times and things will get better. "
