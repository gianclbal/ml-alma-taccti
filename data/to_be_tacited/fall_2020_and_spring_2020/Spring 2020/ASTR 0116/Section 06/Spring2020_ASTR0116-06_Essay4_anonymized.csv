2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,269,"Online classes hasn't really impacted my learning except for two of my classes because I've been taking online classes for the past two years. I've been struggling with my Calculus class and Astronomy because I've been confused about it and needed the classroom environment we had before the lockdown. Also, since I'm able to do class at home I'm able to spend less money on transportation. I'm able to watch what I eat and lose the weight I want because of the online classes. The concerns I have about the online classes that were originally on campus is the technical difficulties and not being able to have a one on one conversation with the professor when I need help. Especially for Astronomy Lab, I'm not sure if it will continue to become difficult for me because no one really helps each other through the breakout rooms unlike in an actual classroom environment. I think it would be better to require the whole class to be in Zoom and have them actually do work together instead of just leaving after instructions were told so the students can actually help each other out. Overall, despite the difficulties, I really do enjoy having online classes. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,270,"Online classes, for the most part, have been pretty okay. In some classes, it's great because I get to be less stressed about my style of earning and others are kinda harder because of it. But I think there's always going to be a part of this whole online class world that involves students feeling that they can slack off, which I'm heavily feeling right about now. On the bright side of that, I can worry a little less about classes and focus on trying to adjust to this (hopefully temporary), new way of life. Being a mostly introverted person has made my computer have a lot more value since it's what keeps me from going insane. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,259,"Online classes have not been the best for me and my learning ability. I am having a hard time staying focused and being motivated when it comes to online assignments and quizzes. However I am trying my best to learn from this challenge and hopefully do well in my classes. It has impacted my learning very much, I do not feel like I am getting the most out of my learning anymore since it is not as personal and one and one as in person. Also, online classes for me are hard because I am not in an environment that involves learning familiarity to me. For instance, I am in my room doing my online classes when I am used to being in a class or at the library. My brain has the mindset to rest when being in my room which makes it hard to focus. This also makes me want to practice self-care even more because it can be stressful being an essential worker and trying to continue school when I have never taken an online class in my life, let alone taking 5 of them at once. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,263,"Online classes had impacted my learning a lot. In the beginning, being at home had made it harder to do online classes, because home is more of a relaxing and chilling place. But since it had been more than a month of staying at home, I have figured out ways to concentrate more on my school work. I found that finding a spot just for school or work would help me concentrate more. Before I just stayed in my bed and did all my work there, but it would get distracted. Now, I try to do more of my school work on my desk. Also, once in a while if online classes get me too stressed, I would just stop and do an activity that would relax me. Then, when I feel stressed, I would go back to work again.As for self-care, I haven’t been doing great with that. I haven’t done a lot of exercises and gone outside to at least get some sunlight. But I have been doing a lot of activities that would help me relax, like watercolor and puzzles. I want to fix my problem with not being able to get exercise by using my switch that I have; buy a game that involves exercise. As for getting sunlight, I need to remind myself to go out once in a while and stay there for 30mins. So I can get my vitamin D.  "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,264,"Distance learning and online classes have been very challenging. I do not take online classes for a reason because I have an extremely hard time learning without sitting in a classroom. I was evicted from the dorms and forced to move home where I have little to no WiFi. In order to turn in assignments I must go to the Home Depot parking lot 15 minutes from my house. Self care has taken the back burner without a doubt. I have no motivation to get myself ready or do anything with my days. I think that if there was an end date to this that I knew I would be more motivated. With living at home my full time job has become helping my parents with teach their classes. Both of my parents teach kindergarten and are very unfamiliar with technology. I have became their tech support, video director, and teachers aid. Needless to say this is all way above my pay grade. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,281,"The switch to online classes has impacted my learning in a positive way, I believe. This is I no longer have to commute to campus. The commute to campus takes four hours out of my day, so with that aspect removed I have more time to spend on homework and studying. On the other hand, I find it very hard to study at home. My academic situation would be perfect if I could go out and study at a cafe, where I can focus. Unfortunately, I can't do that so I am currently in the middle of overcoming this obstacle. As for my well being, I do not mind not leaving the house for extended periods of time so I am doing well on that front. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,261,"Since all classes in this semester switched to online classes, I got more time to focus on each course as well as taking care of myself in my home country. In addition, Because we cannot take lessons in person, each professor explains as detail as possible so that we can easily understand the lectures via online. This helps me to work assignments a lot too. On the other hand, however, because i have a huge time difference, it is slightly difficult to catch up some zoom lectures. This sometimes affect my health. But, online classes are the best way to keep learning lectures in this sever situation. and staying with my family provides better self-care practices. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,273,"With all of this online schooling coming on as a sudden change, I find that some parts of schooling are easier than others. A few things that became easier are time management. I feel like you, as well as my other professors have been really lenient on all the deadlines and it's making it really easy for me to succeed in my schoolwork. This assignment, however, I did not pull through on time. But anyways, everything else in terms of getting my school work done is on track. As I now currently live in a two bedroom apartment at home with seven people, it's harder for me to show up to zoom meetings. I sleep in the living room with my younger brother. So for that, I really appreciate the zoom meetings not being necessary, but still making sure we can reach out to you for questions.In terms of self care, I have been trying to make some time for myself. That usually means journalling, trying new hobbies, and drinking lots of caffeinated drinks. A variety of caffeinated drinks. I have also bought myself some new noise cancelling earbuds to distance myself from my loud environment during the day as well. Also, I have been expanding my interests in music and movies. Watching a variety of different things that I find myself enjoying."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,266,"Having all online classes has definitely been an adjustment. It has been very stressful keeping up with all of my classes, on top working, and everything going on with the virus is just added stress. Each professor I have is doing things differently and all have very different due dates. The hardest part for me is finding a balance, and a good schedule that works for me. Thankfully all of my instructors have been very understanding of everyone's situation and have been very flexible with a lot of the work since it is a difficult time for everyone. I have not had much time for self-care. I have been working a lot more which is scary because I don’t want to bring any sickness home to my family, but I have to work to pay for school and other necessities. I have been working 2 jobs but recently I have turned in a letter of resignation for one of my jobs because I have been getting very overwhelmed and need more free time to do my schoolwork. But I have been getting doing better as the weeks have progressed. I am hoping this will all be over soon, and we can all resume to our normal lives."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,272,"Online classes haven't been to jarring of a change as I have done online classes a bunch in the past, but it was a pretty massive disappointed in terms of the experience and work I was going to get done this semester. I am a cinema major and I was supposed to take a bunch of production classes this semester. That entailed being on campus everyday to work with all the expensive camera equipment and collaborating with students on film productions. The switch to online has basically taken away all the important aspects of these classes. All of our projects have been cancelled. We no longer can check out and work with the equipment that the school has to offer. I can't collaborate and work with my fellow classmates since we have to social distance. It has kind of been a huge pause and stop in my progress of building a portfolio and getting really important experience that I can use in the future. So it's pretty disappointing to lose that due to this pandemic. I will also probably be graduating in the summer as well online too so that is another disappointment. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,278,"Online classes are definitely hard to manage with so many distractions at home. As the quarantine progresses I feel like my motivation for school has drifted to other things. At first I would still attend zoom meetings, but as lesser and lesser students show up it gave me the mentality that it is not necessary to attend. Also being home gave me more of a reason to procrastinate because I cannot get work done at home, the vibe at home just makes me want to chill and laze around. Adding on the connection in my room sucks! As the semester is coming to an end I'm trying my best to catch up with all work due. Don't know if I would count this as self care cause it's also hurting my wallet, but I've been doing a lot of online shopping because of all the sales and free shipping deals going on. During quarantine I've also eaten better as my meals are more consistent and also home cooked. I've been gaining a bit of weight too, so as of right now my plan is to exercise a bit more. It's kind of weird because I thought time would go by really slow during the shelter in place order, but it's surprisingly going by really fast. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,271,"I feel lucky in that I've taken a lot of online classes already. In a way, I am at least prepared for that aspect of this quarantine. What's been more challenging is losing the social capabilities of classes. Before being sheltered in place I really thought I wasn't much of a people person. Now I really miss seeing friends in class and even listening to my teachers talk about that they're passionate about. The best thing I'm doing for self care right now is keeping to a schedule. The first two weeks of no school I easily fell into not getting out of bed until 1pm and staying up until 3am. Now that more assignments are due and the semester's almost over, I've needed to create a better schedule to stay on track. Little things like making sure to drink lots of water and make my bed every morning have allowed to regain control over my day. Every time our shelter in place is extended I get mixed feelings. I am happy that those who really need social distancing can be safe but I also start to think about how much longer I need to stay alone and inside my room. This semester was supposed to be the ""bounce-back"" semester for me. I really felt like I was doing everything right and making the best changes for myself like going to the gym. My concern is I'll fall back to old, self-destructive habits. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,275,"Online classes have been a little bit of a struggle, it kind of hard adapting to all of the classes being online and knowing and remembering all the due dates, just like right now I am doing an assignment that is already over due. Not that I didn't want to do it before but with all the classes being switched it was hard making a schedule to be able and do all my classes like before since the Corona outbreak with my work schedule even being more hectic and schedule changes happening and worrying how I am going to be able to afford my next meal, it was hard to adjust plus since you don't have the teachers right in class with you to be able to ask for help if you get stuck on a problem or just confused on what to do next."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,258,"Online classes have impacted my learning in a variety of ways. I never liked any online classes I took in the past because I felt I couldn't retain the information as much as I needed to. I felt that I didn't pay that much attention. And I realized that teachers are SO important. Now I feel the same way but I'm trying my best to stay on top of all of my classes. It's gotten more challenging since there are other things going on in the world but Im, trying to find better ways to cope. I know that scheduling and planning helps a lot which I am going to try and do from now on. I feel that doing so will help ease some anxiety I have about keeping up with my classes. With the planning i'll figure out time for myself to relax and just have some me time. Self care is really important whether its doing a face-mask or even just journaling about my day. I know in these hard times its difficult to remember to take of yourself so I'll try that because I know I've been lacking and it shows in my health and my classes. I hope we don't have to stay as an online class because I truly don't like it. I rather be physically in class. I know some people are so happy because they don't have to get up. And I get that because I am glad too but also it's effecting my learning. Some other ways I want to self care is doing things that I like to do. This is limited since we can't go out but I'd like to start reading more, going outside more often, painting, doing puzzles, and maybe try to go to the beach or at least stay in the car and look from a distance. It's ridiculous how so many things can get ripped away so fast. That's why I also ant to start journaling because I'll try to understand what's happening in the world and realize that we take many things for granted. I hope everyone else is doing self care and they're staying on track of their online classes. It certainly is nothing we expected this year but I hope everything turns out ok. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,267,"Online classes have proved to be very difficult for me. It has been such a drastic change in my day to day schedule that I have fallen off of many assignments. I was not expecting this as I am sure many students and staff were not. Nor was I prepared for the limitations that have been put on the services pervaded like the Library or the student center. I was working for a while so I was able to leave my dorm but that has since stopped and now I feel like I am trapped in the dorm until the semester ends. As far as self care is concerned I try to distract myself from the fact that I am still here by listening to music, which is kind of a perk, since no one is really here I can listen to my music as loud as I want and as late as I want. The main concern I have regarding my learning is how all of this will impact my GPA/grades because like I said this whole online class thing caught me off guard and I was not prepared for this at all."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,276,"I have absolutely no structure. I also am currently three hours ahead of California so most of my classes start at 2/3, and I sleep until ten minutes before and then I don't go to bed until 4AM because I'm talking to all of my friends still in California. I have decided it will be best for me to go back to SF so I can maintain more structure. I also have a lot of tasks to achieve once I get back, like getting my house in order for next semester. If I have a purpose like that it will help a lot so I am excited to go back and deal with that. I hate online learning. I am a production major so the majority of my classes are just coming up with random busy work assignments so that they have something to put in the grade book, but they're boring and I have absolutely no motivation for. I'm also terrible at science so having to take my last two science classes online is royally messing up my plan for a class I thought I could understand with instruction. Not to mention, none of the students are taking these classes seriously which makes all the work on me. That's about all I have to say."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,274,"Online classes haven't much impacted my learning because I am already taking two online classes. Online classes isn't really take hard because teachers usually give us assignments that should be finished by the end of the week. The only hard part of these online classes is managing my time and putting time aside to actually do the school work that I am assigned to do. For self-care, I usually play a lot of video games or use the dumbbells I have at home to work out. Unfortunately, my sleep schedule is really bad right now because I usually sleep around 5am to 6am. Then I would wake up at 2pm to 3pm, and that pretty much takes up half of the day. As much as I love sleeping, I gotta use my time wisely and actually finish my school work. Some concerns that I have for my learning is how the next semester is going to look like. I wonder if classes will just be online or we will be back to normal by next semester. For my own well-being, I hope this shelter in place ends by beginning of June because staying at home can be really draining. As soon as this shelter in place ends, I am enjoying anything I can when I get out of the house. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,262,"I think online classes have affected me a lot. As someone who has trouble learning online in general, moving all my classes online has really impacted my focus and motivation, which have in turn affected my grades. Along with struggling to learn online, I don't have the most reliable/constant access to internet, so it has been tricky navigating that along with all of the due dates for my classes. Mainly what I've been doing is trying to manage due dates by checking iLearn on my phone and then going to a family member's house to actually do the assignments. Self-care wise, I feel like I'm struggling to push myself to take care of myself, however, more recently I've been doing much better at self-care which has helped me a lot. I've been trying to journal every night and set goals for the next day. This has helped me wake up and feel like I had things to do, rather than just watch tv or engage in other unproductive activities all day long. Along with journaling, I'm attempting to try new hobbies and see what I like to do. I feel like outside of quarantine, I did not have much time for hobbies and/or I didn't know what hobbies I had. So i'm hoping to find things that relax me so I can bring those into my daily/weekly activities when my schedule is busy again. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,260,"Moving to online learning has been very bittersweet for me. On one hand, I hate having to commute so much, so it’s nice to save the time and money I would otherwise be spending on BART. I like being able to eat/do whatever I want while taking my classes and just not having to leave the house. However, the fact that this happened literally right in the middle of the semester has put a lot of stress on everyone. In terms of learning, I can’t keep my f****** deadlines straight. My planner has become more important than ever, but I’m losing motivation to even log on sometimes. Everything feels more relaxed (online tests are always open-book), yet more stressful all at once. For some of my classes, the entire syllabus for the class had to change. It’s especially hard for us seniors. We wanted to be able to enjoy our last semester on campus with all our friends. We wanted to see our family from different states/countries on graduation day. We wanted to embrace the place many of us spent the last 4 years loving (and hating sometimes). I fear I’ll never see some of those friends again."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,265,"Online classes are given me more free time but I think have also hindered my learning experience. It's more difficult to pay attention to classes rather than do something else. As an online joke people have started calling colleges zoom university which has some truth to it. For self care I have watched movies and read books. For a time I was working out but have since taken a break. I told myself tomorrow that I would walk to the store and buy more food. I think that this virus has taken a toll on most people and me included. I am concerned that the virus will last longer and that it will also hinder my education longer. Since the virus broke out It ruined my plans for summer school in Taiwan which was a major path to graduating for me. Now I am ""stuck"" in San Francisco and will be doing a virtual summer program. I think this will last into the summer and I feel terrible for those students graduating this year who won't be able to walk. The virus just irritates me. I also feel bad for the people who are stuck with their family members who irritate them or are in a bad situation. I'm not super concerned about my well being because I am close to stores and have housemates who are healthy. I am also lucky to have my parent's netflix account which they share with me. I believe that I am well situated."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,277,"Online classes have impacted my learning negatively. It is definitely a lot harder to concentrate on school work and remember when assignments are due and whether or not I have a zoom meeting or not. I had one class online already which is a poli sci class and it wasn't bad having one class online and the teacher had everything set up great for learning. There are some classes that are just all over the place and hard to follow in terms of what they want or how they've helped us during the switch. All these other classes getting moved online just ruined everything but what made it worse was having to leave my dorm and move back home. I have to babysit my siblings while my parents are at work and they can be distracting at times. 	To try and get rid of the stress all of this has brought up I either work out, go out on a run or paint. There are weeks however that I don't feel like doing anything at all there's definitely a lack of motivation at this point."
