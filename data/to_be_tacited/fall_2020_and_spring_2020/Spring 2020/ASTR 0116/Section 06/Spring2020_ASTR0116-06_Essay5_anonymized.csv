2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,262,"I think the values of my community and family as a whole have really motivated me to continue persevering through college and reminds me not to give up. Being a first generation college student and an older sister, I think that having those roles and pressures really pushes me to try to do the best that I can. I really want to finish my degree and set an example for my sisters and cousins. I try to paint higher education in a brighter light to them because I want them to go as well, or when things are hard I downplay them a little bit, but it's nice to have them look up to me and ask me questions about college. Community wise, I feel like being a Latina woman has also really makes me push myself and try to accomplish a lot, since I am a film major and there is not a lot of representation in my field, amongst many others. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,271,I was the first of my seven siblings to start college so family values have always been an important part of my college life. When I'm often overwhelmed by school I remind myself I'm not just here for myself. My struggles are not my own. Every challenge I can overcome and every good grade I can achieve is my of showing my siblings this is what's possible for them. I'm very fortunate to have supportive parents who don't ask very much of me. While deadlines and exams seem to pile on more stress I don't ever feel that failing or falling behind will disappoint them. The motivation I have for school right now goes beyond just the family I have now but the my potential future family. Growing up with so many siblings I've always kept my future family in my mind. 
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,258,Since I've moved back home I feel that having my family and the loves I love near me help me stay motivated. When I was in San Francisco I was on my own and I think I started to forget who I was and what I want to do. I never had anyone to talk to and it was really hard for me to make friends. Now that I'm home I realized who I am and I'm not alone even though it may feel like that sometimes. I know I won't be with my family forever but right now at this time in my life I'm really glad they are because I still don't know what path I want to take in my college career. But I know with their support I'll figure out what I want to do. I also need to remember that I can accomplish things on my own. As long as I stick to doing things for me I'll be successful. I feel that I'm in a good place in my college career and I think I'll succeed even more in the future. My family has always been supportive of me going to a good college and getting a great career because I know they didn't have an opportunity unfortunately. I want to make them proud so I can support them. Specifically I want to support my mom because she's always supported me in pursuing my dreams. 
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,278,"My family has always been an advocate for me to go to college because no one in my family did, and when my sister dropped out all their hopes had gone to me. They cannot stress enough how important going to college to get a good job was, so ever since I was little it was planted in my head that I for sure was going to college whether I want to or not. In a sense, I felt like this did me good for a long run as it motivated me to challenge myself in something my family has never done, but it also meant I had no role model to look up to when things get tough. My friends, in this case, has helped a lot; going through similar circumstances we supported each other and grew bigger. The friends who stayed, and the friends who were made, all made college an experience that's unforgettable. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,273,"Well, in terms of my family's collectivist-ish culture, I have become a very social person, whether it's when I'm with family members or friends, or just people I can be comfortable around. In terms of navigating through college, however, they have been really supportive about what I want I want to major in. Currently a film studies and communication studies major, and my family has been nothing but supportive all the way through. I think they're supportive because my cousin CJ and I are the first two from my grandfather's grandchildren to go attend college in the US.Sometimes I feel like I'm under some pressure to do better in school. I felt this a lot growing up because I never had the best grades and it would always be held against me. But going to college, I see that I'm doing a lot better, not just in terms of grades but for my mental well-being too. I go home every weekend because I decided to work there, but I feel so much better having some distance from my family and having my own freedom away from them. Because of this freedom, I am able to take more responsibility and do things on my own terms. So when I have homework, I am more motivated to do so."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,263,"Since being locked at home for a while with my family, there have been some ups and downs. When I am bored I can sometimes rely on my younger brother; playing some games (like, Mario Party or Just Dance) with him on the switch. But when I do need to do my school work, I tell my parents and my little brother to try not to bother me. For example, when I had a midterm coming up, I would tell my parents in advance to not bother me during that midterm. The midterms were required to have zoom on with our mic and camera on. Since the walls in my house are not that sound proof, we can sometimes hear each other, even with the door closed. It was nice that my parents would know how school was going for me since it has been all online classes. They would also let me have my space when I need to do my school work. They have been very supportive."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,281,"I have had the greatest experiences of my life during my time in college, and I would have never been able to have these experiences if it weren't for my mother. She has been extremely supportive to me. She provided financial aid to me and gave me the opportunity to study abroad. While I was abroad I was able to meet the kindest people and was able to go on various trips to sight-see. I owe all of these experiences to the ones who have supported me. As Isaac Newton said, ""If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants"". Someday, I hope to pay them back. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,265,"My family has always instilled the values of commitment and hard work. From elementary school my parents have told me that I will go to college and pursue a higher education. So I knew early on that I would have to get into any school of higher education. I would say that my family as a whole has helped me through my struggles at college but I have also learned to become independent and ask for help when I need it. But right now my goal is to finish my education here at San Francisco State and then enter into any kind of job. I guess the values that were given to me by my family was just to work hard at something and you can attain it. They also try to instill good work ethic but every college student is a master at procrastinating. Although I have asked how my friend does it, he has an incredible work ethic that I would like to obtain. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,269,"The values of my family helped me through college through their support and love. Even if I do struggle with my classes, they would always say it’ll be okay and I’ll get through it and do my best. The amount of support I get from my family helps me work harder in all of my classes and to make sure I graduate with a degree. I want to be able to graduate so I can get a good job so I can help support my family whenever they need help like they do with me every day. My mom is someone who is really important to me and supports me a lot. Because of my mom, I do my best in school and want to make her proud. From my immediate family, only my dad has gone to college but he didn’t finish so he wasn’t able to get his degree. So I would say, I’m the first one to go to college and will graduate with a degree."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,266,"Throughout all of my years of schooling, I am really grateful that I have had a really strong support system. They have always been very open and trusted my decisions in school. A lot of my friends have felt a lot of pressure from their family to study a certain field, and I'm glad I do not have that experience. I think they have not pressured me because they know at the end of the day they trust me to make the best choices for myself. Throughout high school I was also relatively responsible. Of course, I made mistakes and bad choices but for the most part, I did what I needed to do. So when it was time to move out they trusted me to do what I needed to do. Which was a really nice feeling. That they were not breathing down my neck calling me around the clock. That made me feel better about myself and the decisions I made.  "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,259,"The values of my family has given me a positive outlook on college and helped me navigate through college to be focused and determined to do what I want. My family really wanted me to go to college to get an education and hopefully get a good career with my degree. At first, they did not understand my major being communications and wanted me to do something more familiar such as being a doctor or getting into law. However, that pathway of education is not for me and trying to explain to them was challenging at first however eventually they tried to understand and are now supporting me in college. This also motivates me to do better and get the most out of my education as a communications major to not only learn for myself but to show my family I don't have to be a doctor or a lawyer to have a good career in my life."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,261,"The values of my family and my community have helped me through college by the support they give me since I study abroad this university. My family has been supporting me a lot even though i left my family to study abroad another country. They have motivated me mentally. On the other hand, my community such as college friends and people whom i work with also are important because they are the reason why I have gotten to be strong. When I struggle with study, my friends always spend their time for me as much as possible at library and help me to solve studies. I do not think i could pass two years in this college if i would not have them. Moreover, my friends changed me to an active person. I originally am a person who has a negative thought, have less confident and hates to try something new. However, people i have attracted me how trying new things are amazing. Being one of their members, the way fo my thinking completely changed to the positive thought. This also can say to my co-workers. most of them are much older than me and have a lot of life experiences. I learned that nothing problem to express my honest feeling. Those people navigated me how i want to be. I am today a person who plenty expresses what i think and want to say. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,267,"The values that my mother has instilled in me regarding education has been paramount in my college career. She has always taught me that education is of the utmost importance, she even encouraged me to take college courses while I was in high school My mom has always set the bar for my academic achievements very high, she has pushed me even when I thought it was too hard. Not only does she push me to succeed in school she has taught and still teaches me to never limit myself and anything that I do is worth doing well. My mother had two basic rules growing up in her house 1. Be a good person and get an education. Following these basic guidelines have stuck with me. Coming from a relatively low income single parent household it will give me pride to accomplish getting my degree and show that its not about what you have growing up its about the values that are instilled in you growing up that make the man."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,277,The values of my family have helped me navigate through college very well. My family is always supporting me and my decisions for the most part. If they do not approve of something they defonetly share their opinion and we go about the situation differently. If i need their help they are very welcoming and try to help me at the best they can. College is a priority to my family as it ensures a better future than one without a degree.  My twin sister also attends college and we help each other with homework and share our opinion on how to make things better. Overall I am definitely very lucky to have the support system that I do.
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,272,"I think that my family values have been a big influence on my navigation through college. Both of my parents are extremely hard workers and they tried to instill that in me from a young age. My mom is a superior court judge and my dad initially worked at and owned his own family business for 30 years and now works at the San Francisco Mint building, making currency. They both are in their 60s and have had a lot of experience so they always try to emphasize to me how hard I am going to have to work to achieve my goals. Being a black man, they both would tell me that I was going to have to work ten times harder to do what I want to do. This has made me try and stay on school and work and extracurricular activities because it gives me experience on trying to juggle different committments that I will have when I am out off school. I would say that my parents values for hard work were one of the biggest things that has influenced my college career. It gave me a  strong sense of work ethic and encouraged me to try and achieve more and put my mind to the things that I want to do. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,274,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college by allowing me to see the importance of school. School and college is something that needs to be taken seriously. Being a first generation college student means that I am going through a new experience with no guidance from my parents at all. Also another thing is that college is somewhat expensive because we make enough money to not be considered low income by the government. It is what it is and I'll do everything I can to graduate college. I know people can see how college is a sense of freedom away from parents and even having a fun time away from home. But for me it's entirely different, I can't experience that full college experience of living in dorms on campus because of financial difficulties. At the end of the day, college is just more education and an obstacle for me to get through. "
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,275,"The values of my family and community has greatly helped me through my college career. When ever I have faced adversity or a difficult challenge someone in my family or community has always given me advice on how they have resolved a similar situation or referred me to someone who has been in the same situation. As college goes on I try to stay connected with my family and ones who have helped me along the way because I know without the help of their guidance I wouldn't be where I am today. But I also do know that as I grow I have to make my own decisions in my life, and though I am starting to to rely less and less on my family I still feel like I should reach out to them whenever I am stuck, but I know the best options for me is to try and figure it out on my own as I grow older."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,260,"I have always been determined to do well in school, and one major factor of that is my family. No one in my family finished school, so they have always looked to me to be the one to break the mold. Since I’ve been in college, the only family I’ve had in my life are my parents and siblings, and they’ve kept me on track by believing in me and telling me how proud they are. I am so appreciative that my parents have supported me financially throughout my time at SFSU, especially my mother, who has supported me my whole life and helped me build a good character and strong work ethic. I also love the friends I’ve made here and the BECA community as a whole. Being in such a tightly knit major, you see a lot of the same people over and over and, a lot of the time, you end up having to do production projects with them. It’s times and classes like these when it helps to have a strong sense of community on your side. I am so incredibly thankful for all the talented, kind, and compassionate people I’ve met."
2020,Spring,ASTR 0116,--,6,276,"My family was never religious. We never went to church on Sunday's or for Holidays. The only church services I've been to were my baptism (My mother is very italian and insisted I have Godparents even if she didn't want me growing up in the Catholic Church) my maternal grandfathers funeral, and my best friends confirmation. Even so, my family still instilled a lot of values in my every day life. There's two things I learned from my father, loyalty is everything, and being rude might get the job done but it'll alienate every one around you. I learned both of these from observing what he didn't do. He was never kind to those who meant a lot to him. He believed parents are not supposed to be your friend. However, anyone who was useful to him got the utmost respect and loyalty, until they weren't. Since moving out I have done my best to be kind to those who are kinds to me, and never betray a friend. I've bonded with people quickly and easily since going to college, and that's a really good thing considering I moved across the country with no contacts or friends. That being said, my mom gave me the most important value: adaptability. My father moved us around a lot and always had big plans for us, but my mom was actually the one planning everything. No matter what situation we were put in, my mom found a plan to make it work out as best as it could. She was the true breadwinner even though she didn't work. She taught me that even when situations seem overwhelmingly insane, you can plan and you can fix it. After moving here, as excited as I was, I was still terrified. But I planned, I got a job and made friends with my coworkers, and one of them not only led me to join a fraternity that I love more than anything, but also ended up asking me to be his girlfriend three months ago. So, even though I never had a strict book of values, my parents still set me up with some pretty great life skills. "
