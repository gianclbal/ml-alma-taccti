2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,540,"Kinetic and Potential energy always add up to the total energy. So how can this apply to real life? Say you are on a swing going back and fourth, no matter what point you are at in the swing your potential and your kinetic energy add to be the total energy. When you reach the highest part of your swing on either side Potential is equal to the total because at that point there is no kinetic energy acting upon you. At the center and the lowest point the kinetic energy equals the total because there is no potential energy acting on you at that point. This is a concept that it super important to keep in mind because then you can remember Ei=Ef or Ki+Ui=Kf+Uf. These ideas in mind help the process of doing the rest of the math a whole lot easier and straight forward. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,537,"Recently, during quarantine, my nephew has gotten into Beyblade Burst and has forced the rest of the family to battle with him every day. This has taught me a lot about mass distribution and torque. It's interesting to see what I am learning in class affect my life. Beyblades are spinning tops, but made of three components that greatly affect the performance in the arena. They are made of an energy layer, forge disc, and performance tip. I have noticed that if the energy layer of the Beyblade is symmetrical, there is an even distribution of mass which leads to the bey spinning longer and keeping its balance when hit by another bey. The forge disc gives the bey its mass, pulling the center of gravity down and making the bey harder to destabilize. The performance tip is what determines the pattern the bey will make in the arena, they can come in a variety of shapes. Typically, if the performance tip is round and wide the bey will take over the center of the arena. If the tip is skinny or shaped with jagged edges, the bey will move around more which is optimal for attacking the other player but uses up the energy transferred from the rip of the rip cord."
