2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,540,My mother works in retail and never got to go to college so she always pushed me to pursue what I want education wise. My sister was able to become a lawyer with my moms support and I am able to study science and film now because my mom is supporting me. She has always pushed me to work hard at whatever it is I choose to do. It's her hard work that has inspired me to even go to college in the first place and now I hope I can someday make enough money to take care of her. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,73,"I feel like online classes have made it a little harder to learn. For a time, I thought that it would be easier if I didn't have to commute, or leave the house if I took an online class but now, being forced to have all classes online, it has definitely changed my perspective. I now feel like being in class environment helps a lot. It is hard to be focused and remain focused at home. I fear a little that for example, when I take physics next semester I will be behind in the class. Its not so much that I don't understand what the instructor is saying but I don't think i fully grasp the concept like I did at the beginning of the semester when we were in class. For self care, I am making sure that I workout everyday since it makes me feel a bit accomplished afterwards as well as spending time with my dogs."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,537,"Online courses have really taken their toll on me. At the moment I am considering dropping out of the semester. I haven't been doing anything for self-care, I don't have time to do anything anymore. I have to babysit and continue all of my classes, I never have time alone. I haven't been able to learn or keep my focus in my classes, I really just feel like giving up on everything. It was a dream of mine to get through college, but now I'm not sure I was meant to handle to stress and pressure of it all. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,539,"My parents generation was the first on both sides of my family to immigrate to the United States back in the day so getting a college education is huge for them. Both of my grandpa's earned college degrees- one in business finance at Colombia and the other in Japanese studies at Sacramento State. My parents and my aunts and uncles also earned college degrees all at UC Berkeley. Going to college and earning a degree or two is a ""must"" in my family. I didn't want to go to college, I would have rather become a outdoor guide in different parts of the world but my parents said I can do that after I get a degree, just as a backup. I see the importance of a college education in some career paths but in others it isn't really necessary. I think I know what I want to do after college but I feel like I want to see more of the world before I commit to a ""real"" job. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,535,"Online classes have impacted my learning in many ways; I am truly not a fan. I am a hands on learner, so doing online classes is extremely difficult for me. I notice I do not focus, retain information as well, and overall, I am just struggling with all my classes. I myself also have cognitive impairment, which makes it even more difficult for me to remember things, focus, and learn new material. I noticed that a lot of not just professors, but also classmates, don't seem to understand that online learning is not an accurate representation of how an individual would do inside the classroom. Online learning is not meant for everyone and their learning comprehension/abilities. I have just been trying to do the best I can with my work, and am just trying to get through the rest of the semester. I usually just make myself some tea or coffee when doing homework to try and relax myself. Overall, I just wish the professor would understand that online learning isn't meant for everyone, and some people like myself, are really struggling with it. I feel stuck as well, because I have no one to go to about these concerns in my other classes, and they just keep giving me more work, since they think online courses are much easier, which is not the case for me. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,536,My family values have helped me navigate through college a lot. My parents have shown me to work hard and to be an honest and caring person. Thanks to them I know what is it like to work hard every day and work for what I want. I understand that nothing will be given to me that the only way that I will be able to get what I want is to work for it. My mom has taught me to be an honest person and to care for others. I believe that this has helped me make some great friends throughout my life because she taught me what it was to give respect so I know what to expect from others and I know how I am supposed to be treated by my friends.
