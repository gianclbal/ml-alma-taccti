2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,538,"What I do when life gets challenging is I alwats take a step back and view the situation.  Depending on the stress level that i am i either go and run it out in the gym,  keep my mine busy, or just take the challenge head on. Typically things that challenge me is not understanding a topic in class. For this I just google examples and explanation in ways that o would understand. Once i think i know it i do practice problems. Something i don't tend to do is ask for help.  I don't ask for help because I always have the fear of the teacher saying no."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,541,"I do a lot of things when life gets challenging. Sometimes my favourite thing to do is hanging out with my friends and spending time with them. I always try to distract myself with other things when I hang out with my friends. We try to binge-watch series on Netflix, hang out at Dolores or go places we don’t normally go to. When things get really challenging there are times I just miss home and I just want to be with my family so I tend to drive back home or if things get challenging back home I drive back to the city because I know that my friends that are my home away from home will be waiting for me and will make me forget about things going on. If it's not sunny in SF or back home I tend to drive towards Santa Cruz or seaside where there are beaches and it's nice and warm."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,73,It has been a bit of a challenge to get use to the way things are at the moment. I find it a little harder to focus for classes at home online and it has been a bit difficult to understand concepts when not in the classroom. Even though I find those a problem I am glad that we are still able to continue learning and talking/ interacting with our professors and our peers at this difficult time. What I try to do is take a step back and reassess the problem instead of taking it on head first which usually brings me a lot of stress. Even though readjusting to life at the moment is different I realize that there are ways to look beyond like taking simple walk with my dogs and family and looking at the brighter side. Im grateful that we have resources if we don't have computers and I also saw the the food pantry was giving away food for students if necessary. Its nice that we won't have to restart the whole semester and lose al the progress we've started and are able to communicate through zoom.
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,533,"What Do I Do When Life Gets Challenging.When life gets challenging, first I simply accept it. Accept it and face it as I do with all my other tasks. I want to talk about most recently the pandemic and specifically how challenging it is too remote to online courses and learning. This is an example of when life is challenging. One I accepted it and I knew there wasn't something I can do to change it. I adjust very quickly. I set up even more planner/calendars with the exact due dates and when I cant get to an assignment I try to make sure I don't forget about it and accept its okay to do it later rather than never. When life gets hard I talk to my mother as my emotional support partner I talk things out with her and we find solutions to everything. We never leave things on a bad note. And that's how I deal with a challenge in my life. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,537,"Sorry, I could have sworn I turned this in already. I tend to give up when life gets challenging, I don't think I am a very good self-learner. I can handle online classes alongside IRL ones, but right now it's just too much. On top of school, I have to babysit my nephew for my sister who has to work from home and nothing has shown me more of how incompetent a mother I'd be than babysitting a bratty 4-year-old. Right now as I am trying to write this he's yelling at me. I can't handle this quarantine any more. I don't know what I'm going to do about this semester, but I am already behind in all of my classes. This class at least should be easy to deal with, but I am extremely scared for my calculus and chemistry classes. I was behind before the lockdown but now I am finding it even harder to catch up."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,539,"Take a chill pill, drink some water and get to work. The end results will make you feel better than not doing anything about it. If it doesn't turn out the way you wanted it, learn from what you did wrong and move onto something that make you happy!"
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,536,"When life gets challenging I first calm myself by doing controlled breathing or taking a nap. I know a nap might sound like the opposite to thing to do but sometimes you just need to mentally escape from your problems for a couple hours and also give your body a brake too. Next thing to do is to write out everything I need to get done in my planner. Color coding is my best friend when I have plenty to do. This helps me stay organized by separating my tasks. For example, studying, tests, homework, things that need to get done ASAP, and other things would each have their own color. This helps a lot so that when I am just looking at my planner I know that I need to do. This is what I do when life gets challenging in my educational part of my life. When life gets challenging in my personal life, then that is a complete different story. If it something stress related then I would take a me day. This means having a day where I focus on myself and just relax my mind by not doing any work and just spending time with my loved ones. When life gets challenging you need to find what works for you because just because something works for me doesn't mean that it will work for you too."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,534,"As life has been challenging lately I have unfortunately shut down a bit. It's been hard for me to reach out and ask for help. Trying to pull myself out of a slump and personal anxiety about life, and the world around me, I am working on reaching out for help, communicating my troubles, and trying to stay focused on my work and studies. Even talking to a friend about my challenges will greatly help and relying on my family during challenging times. I am usually a physically active individual and find a huge stress reliever to be running and working out, so to help myself through challenging times I am making it a goal to myself to get back into working out regularly. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,535,"When life gets challenging I really try to map out and make a list of everything that I need to do and what is stressing me out. Typically, school is a contributing factor to my stress, and just seems to add onto my stress level. When this does happen, I make a list of every assignment that is due in each of my classes, and then when they are due by. It really helps calm my nerves and prioritize what I need to do. I do this also with doctors appointments, what I need to buy from the store, and so forth. Additionally, when life gets hard, to just overall help with my stress levels, I tend to drink a lot of coffee, listen to music, and relax in nature. I notice it significantly helps calm my nerves and relaxes me. Even if I’m only able to go outside for 30 minutes, I noticed that it significantly helps reduce my stress, and coffee just makes me happy because I truly love drinking it."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,540,When life gets challenging I focus on what is most important. If I'm overwhelmed with assignments then I make a to do list and do what is most important first. In times like now I've had to prioritize myself and my family so my academics are struggling a little. I'm very bad at online courses which is why I never take them unless I have to so the rest of this semester is going to be very difficult for me and I'll have to do a lot of prioritizing.
