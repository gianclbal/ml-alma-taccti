Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,533,"I am here taking this SI class because I'm afraid of not passing my Physics class. I'm afraid of asking for help. I don't want to hate a subject because I'm too slow of a learner. I'm taking SI because it helps me not be afraid. I've taken SI before and I went into it just thinking about a study group type of class, and it kinda is like that but I've discovered it's more than just studying. You meet great instructors that are positive and want everyone to learn and have a good grip on the concept in order to be confident when taking a quiz or exam. SI class provides help and support."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,534,"When reflecting on the question of why I am here, what first comes to mind is my intention to build upon my learning and knowledge. Physics and math has been pretty difficult for me during my college years, so I am here to learn about these topics and persevere through the difficulties. I am here to become a well-rounded individual, while also pursuing a concentrated area of study. Taking physics at SFSU is a requirement, but more importantly I am here to help better apply the concepts I learn in this class to my higher education and use this as a stepping stone to other areas of study I will come across. I am also here to help open doors for myself in the future and reach greater opportunities. I want to make new connections in my brain while also building a foundation of necessary education for myself. I am also here, enrolled in this sci class to help myself ask questions when I am not understanding a concept in physics. Sometimes it is hard for me to open up when I do not understand something and often I think that I have to figure something out individually. Taking this class will hopefully open myself up to asking question and pursuing help with my questions. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,535,"The reason I am here is because I am continuing my path as a biology major. I have never taken a physics class before, so when I was enrolling in Physics 111 I was super nervous about how I was going to succeed and do in this course. I also am not very good when it comes to math and logical thinking/ long wordy problems. When growing up, I was always in and out of hospitals because of my medical problems. Due to this, I had the repetition of doing math problems, or solving word problems, which is why it is a little harder for me compared to everyone else, to solve logical and critical thinking problems and takes me a little longer. I was hoping by taking the Physics Sci class it could help me to continue to succeed despite some obstaclesI have faced in the past and the obstacles. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,536,"I was not sure if I wanted to take a sci class but I have never taken a physics class in my life so I knew that this class was supposed to help me out. I decided to take this because I want to be able to pass my physics class so I won't get farther behind in completing my major. The reason for wanting to work so hard is because I want to try my best to finish college in 4 years, even though I know that it is pretty much 5 years now. I still want to try my best to finish as soon as I can. Meaning if I don't pass my physics class, I will be behind on my plan. I am also taking this course so I can be able to go to PA school and this class is a requirement for my major which will get me into PA school."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,537,"I think I'm here because of pressure. My siblings are both engineers and I feel expected to major in STEM and make as much as they do. I don’t think I’ve always wanted to go to college, now that I am here I kind of regret it. I’ve wasted a lot of time here and the influences I’ve encountered have made my life more complicated. I need to pass physics and I feel the only way I could do that is by taking this SCI course. I tried to take PHYS111 last sem, but I couldn’t keep up with Professor Xu and had to drop out. I feel more confident under Sturner’s teaching, and with added help from SCI i feel confident to at least pass with a high C this time. Math doesn’t come so easily to me, so I hope that SCI111 can explain things to me in simpler ways than our PHYS111 textbook."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,538,Honestly i don't know what i am actually doing. I just know that i like science and math and i enjoy learnig different subjects and different perspectives of theses subject. Im originally from san Bernardino California and now that im in San Francisco state University. I find this question often appearing. I believe im here to learn and gain more than what i would of it if I was still in SoCal in both my personal life  and school life. Even though learning can be taught be anyone. Its different because i moved to a different city. I am experiencing things here that i would have never learned about myself in SoCal. The surrounding is comfortable. But why am i here more specifically in school. I often answer this question by thinking of the past. I was always a good academically in high school. But now struggling in college is worrisome. So i believe am here to make error in my life to know the disguise what i want. I learned that i want to pursue a career in science. I learned that i want to have a higher education than high school and that i want to be independent and not ask for help. I learned that change is adaptable
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,73,"I am here to fully grasp the concept of physics with a little extra help that may not be able to get from office hours. even though i’m a biology major science is still very difficult for me. I was lucky enough that this class fit in my busy schedule so i could get the extra help. last semester i was a chemistry LA and even I was sh locked when the instructor asked me to be an LA for her class because before her chemistry class i thought chemistry was my worse enemy. I was able to pass her class and being asked to be a LA encouraged me to believe in myself and believe that other classes won’t be as hard as i thought they would be and to give any sort of help a chance so that i could do well. I am here in hopes that one day i could help people who have the same love and compassion for animals as i do. I have two dogs that is so anything for and when they’re  feeling sick or in need of help it hurts me to know i can’t do anything to help and i’m sure many people feel the same way. i feel like if i could in any way help i would and so that why i’m here, so i can get a degree and help other animals because they can’t speak and tell you what’s wrong with them. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,539,I am taking this course to increase/better my understanding of the concepts that I am learning in class. The extra practice and small group learning is helping me become more confident with my knowledge of physics as well as calculus. The general explanation in class becomes clearer after SCI. The course length allows me to ask questions in a setting where the pressure of time isn't pushing me to rush through and just understand half of the concept. I want to get the highest grade I can and also be confident in understanding Physics.
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,540,I am taking this SCI class because I need help to get through Physics. While Physics is not my academic focus it is important for my Biology major. I chose to have Biology as my second major because I want to be able to work with wild animals and do conservation work. Doing Biology and Cinema will hopefully allow me to make wildlife documentaries and raise awareness to issues I care about. So even though I'm not passionate about Physics I recognize that it is important for me to do well in this class and understand the concepts taught. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,2,541,I feel like the reason why I’m in this class has to do with the reason why I’m here in general. Being in this Sci course it's because I want to be able to do good in my physics class these past couples of semesters has been really hard and these SCI classes have really helped because it helps me understand what's going on in class and where exactly I need help. As a first-generation college student it has been really hard to figure this out and try and find ways to help me in my classes these sci classes has really helped me reach out and find people who have the same goals as me and to have a study group of my own and be able to ask questions outside of class. Being able to do good in this class gives me the purpose to get my degree and reach my goals.
