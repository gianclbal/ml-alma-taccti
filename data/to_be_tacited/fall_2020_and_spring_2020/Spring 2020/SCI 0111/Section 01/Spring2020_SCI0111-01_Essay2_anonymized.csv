2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,531,"When life gets challenging the first thing I do is usually cry, I'm such an emotional person. I like to let it all out. Life commonly gets challenging because I get stressed out really easily which causes me to cry. I usually like to get it out of my system because anything will trigger my emotions from keeping them in. Anyways, so after I cry I like to regroup myself and tackle one thing at a time. I try to make a list of all the things that are causing me stress at the moment. Then I figure out how to go about each problem. I also like to be active when life gets challenging. I go on walks and go to the gym. This is probably my least favorite coping mechanism, but sleeping helps too. I'm a sleeping queen. Venting out to one of my housemates does the job too. It's nice to have reassurance or to be told that everything is going to be okay. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,119,"What do I do when life gets challenging? Honestly, the question should be what don’t I do? Obviously, it depends on the situation and what exactly my challenge is. However, a good chunk of time from when I first encounter my challenge starts with me freaking out. I’ve always tended to run from my problems rather than confront them head-on.I’ve found cooking to be a great stress reliever for me. I’ll always whip up multiple dishes to get my mind from thinking exactly what my challenge is. Most likely, I’ll end up eating the food and having an existential crisis while doing so because my mind will start thinking about what exactly is going on. After some time has passed, I’ll calm down and write my feelings out. As cheesy as that sounds, I’ve found that seeing my feelings in writing helps me understand what exactly is going on in my head. I will then make a pros and cons chart to ultimately come to a decision about what needs to be done. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,399,"When life gets challenging I choose to overcome them by having my goals become my strength. For example right now with the situation of the corona virus happening it is hard for me to manage keeping up with online classes because it’s something that I’m not use too. I am a visual learner, but because of this situation I am learning to adapt myself with on line classes. Emailing my professors, watching extra videos etc. In addition, when life tempts to be challenging I don’t let it take over me. I see it from the positive site of it, and focus on what I can control from it. In addition, this has taught me to learn that there is no failure, but that is something we learn from. The situation of Covid-19 has gotten out of control, everyone is panicking, staying at home isolated from others, even families. Also, you want to purchase things in the store, and everything is running out, Leaving others in starvation, and not thinking world wide. There are other solutions to prevent yourself from getting the virus, such as staying healthy, watching hands every time you do something, etc. It’s crazy how a crisis like this has happened in a big country like California, and has been spread out though out the world."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,305,"When life gets challenging I usually begin to worry over other responsibilities or obstacles that I also need to overcome. While that sounds terrible, it’s usually a good wake up call for me and I can calm myself down pretty easily. I don’t ever worry about things that often unless it’s about the well being of my family and friends. My mom even likes to tease me and say that I worry to less and that I need to start worrying about things more but I’ve never seen that as a good thing. By that, she obviously means to just care about my responsibilities more. In my opinion though, worrying over things only stresses me out and I used to worry about so many things that it just wasn’t good for my health. Not only that, but worrying also doesn’t really help with what you’re trying to accomplish. So when life gets challenging, that’s when I typically start to worry again although, it usually doesn’t last that long. After I begin to worry, I’ll usually take a break from whatever it is that I’m doing and I’ll begin to relax and focus on other things. Whether that’s entertaining myself with a video or playing a game."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,529,"Whenever I find things getting challenging for myself, I tend to stress out and get anxiety. I always try to calm myself down and try to not let myself think about it. I try to be positive and let myself know that everything will be ok and it will all workout. I also try to go get help so I can ask questions about material that I do not understand so I won’t be falling behind. If someone doesn’t try to get help they are only going to be struggling even more. It is also good to talk with friends and family and let them know how you are feeling. Talking it out will help you resolve your problems and they will also give you advice and motivation to not give up. The important thing to always remember is that you are not alone, there is always someone that you can go talk to about your problems. It is always better to talk it out instead of keeping all of your feelings to yourself which will result in even more stress and anxiety. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,299,"It is important when life gets challenging to stay optimistic. If I am having a hard time things are not going to lighten up for me unless I have the right attitude. For example, in basketball, if I miss my first jump shot, I will not be discouraged because there are still many more shots for me to take and make. Now if I get down on myself and never take another shot, then it will never improve. The same goes for a quiz or test. I may do not so well on one test, so I can either give up or decide to work harder For the next one. I will study harder, review notes, go over slides. I would even spend more time perhaps. You just have to be willing to improve. It is all about having the right attitude. When things get hard, you have to stay optimistic."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,313,"When life gets challenging, I take a moment to breathe. This is something that just helps me calm down in that moment and relaxes my mind. I am someone that is able to get frustrated easily when things do not go the way that I plan. Initially, of course I somewhat feel defeated, but after some time to think, I reassure myself of what I am capable of. I feel that life gets challenging for the best of us and people are able to overcome that. After hearing about people that are able to make a comeback from even the most difficult of experiences, there is no way that I am unable to do the same in my situations. I just feel that if anyone can do something then that means that I can too. It may take a lot of extra work, but the only thing that matters is that I can actually do it. During those challenging moments I just need to provide myself with reassurance."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,530,"When life gets challenging, I usually have a brief dramatic melt down. I then reflect and regather myself. I usually reflect by crying, meditating, journaling, and/ or calling a close friend or relative who will give me great advice, make me laugh, take me somewhere to get food, and /or take me out to get some fresh air. While reflecting I think of solution and advantages to make my life less challenge. I try not to think of situations as challenges I look at them as mishaps I may/ may not overcome. I try to stay positive majority of the time. Recently, I applied to San Francisco States study abroad program. I was informed about the online admissions at such late notice and I had a less than a week to turn everything in. It was challenging to access the application, find letters of recommendations, as well as write 4-5 essays within that short time but I completed it all and turned in the application a day before the deadline! I believe you can do anything you put your mind to regardless of the hurdles you face."
