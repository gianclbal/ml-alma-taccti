Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,529,"I am at San Francisco State University studying for a biology degree, concentrating on physiology. I am here because I want to go to medical school and pursue a career in the medical field. I am still deciding on what I want to specialize in but I am leaning towards being an anesthesiologist. I am here because I want to have a good career, I want to be able to provide for myself and for my family. I want to be able to have financial stability for the future and to not have my family ever worry about having enough money to pay the bills. I am not pursuing this career just for the money, I also love learning about the human body, I find it very interesting. I would also like to help those in need of medical attention and help them to live a nice healthy life. Being able to get medical examinations has been rough over the last couple of years and some people are not able to afford it, so if I can provide them a service at little to no cost it would be a good experience."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,299,"Why am I here? I am here because I am lucky enough to have the opportunity to attend a school in a nice city. I have come to be interested in math, science, and even business. I ended up choosing bio as my major in hopes of gaining a better understanding of the world around me. I also hope to attend medical school and become a doctor. I feel that going through that amount of schooling and gaining all that knowledge will make me pretty satisfied, and I will be able to lead a happy life with the career opportunities that follow. I am in this specific class to help my understanding of physics, because I find physics interesting."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,530,I am here because I want to fulfill my goals. This class is a requirement to helping me move forward in my career path. I attend because I am motivated to succeed. I am here because I want to gain more knowledge about physics and how I can apply it to my everyday life. Since I added later on in class I am not really understanding how the class structure works. First day I attended class I felt even more confused. I am hoping that the following classes until the end of the semester are more understanding and beneficial to my needs. I need this class for support because lecture can get very confusing however if both SCI class and lecture are misleading then I might need to seek outside help. It was unfortunate that my fellow SCI classmates also did not understand the material and they had been in the class longer than I have. I am unsure if it could be the class structure or the material might be really that hard.
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,119,"Well, to start off, I’m not sure what “here” really is? Why am I here on this Earth? Why am I here at San Fransisco State? Why am I here taking a SCI class? Honestly, I’m not really sure what a definitive answer would be to most of those questions. I’m still iffy on what I want to be when I “grow up.” I’ve always been interested in helping people- but just not sure how to do it. When I was first deciding on which university to transfer to, I chose SF State because they gave me the option to graduate early as a Sociology major. But what was I really going to do with all that saved time? Honestly, the only question I do know the answer to is why I’m talking a SCI class. I’ve personally never taken a physics class before and I’ve heard a lot of horror stories which is why I decided to enroll in SCI 111. Math isn’t exactly my strongest suit and I knew I was going to need the extra support. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,313,"I am here because you can never have too much help. By this, I mean that this is literally a class that can help me succeed. I always struggle with physics concepts so when this course was offered I was more than happy to sign up. I literally need all of the help that I can get because I really want to pass this class. I also get to collaborate among leers and that definitely helps me understand the concepts more. It also shows me that we are all struggling with something. I love how the extra problems and worksheets are helping me understand what we learn more. I am in the sci class because I also would like a gpa booster. I’m in school because I want to be a doctor. I feel like that is the only career I have had my heart set on. So I’m pretty determined to ace all of my classes."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,58,I am here because I didn’t know what I wanted to do  after highschool I didn't really have a goal or anything. And didn't just want to stay at home and basically throw my life away. I am here because college seems to be everyone else's goal. It should be mine too then. I'm here because I basically just want to do something with my life although right now at the moment I'm not so sure what i want yet. I thought that a good goal for now would  just be to get a degree hopefully in the way i find what I'm passionate about. Honestly it wasn't a bad Idea I have really liked college life and  being away from home. I'm here to explore and find my own meaning in life and learn along the way.
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,399,"I am here at Sf State to succeed and have a better future. I am a first generation student, and the oldest of my siblings. I want to be a role model for my siblings, so they can have someone to rely upon. Hearing my mom’s history, and seeing that she didn’t have the opportunity to go to college is what motivates me to be here where I am now. As a younger girl my mom had to work, and help out in the house, making it harder to finish her education. Now, she has to work really hard to be able to afford paying rent, and I see her struggles. I don’t want to go through the same struggles, especially knowing how expensive it is to live here, this is why I want to succeed and have a better future. In addition, in order to succeed and become my career I have to first get a bachelor in Biology, and I would get it by graduating from SFSU. Lastly, I am here to be able to help my family out, and support them economically."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,305,"I’m here because I have a love for Astronomy and space. I’ve always been enamored by the stars as a kid. It sounds strange but the reason I even became interested in space was because of rocks and minerals. When I was younger, I was told to pick out a book to read from the library. I had never been to the library nor had I ever been able to pick something that I wanted to read. There were so many books to choose from that I just couldn’t bring myself to pick one. So, I asked the librarian what I should read. As a joke, she told me to go read some of the books about rocks, minerals, and gemstones and that was exactly what I did! I ended up reading all the books they had on rocks and I didn’t know what to read next. So I did the same thing and asked the librarian for a suggestion. I told how I really liked the books about rocks and how I already read all of them. After thinking for awhile, she told me to read the books on planets because they were, “kind of similar.” Listening to her instructions, I began to read about Jupiter,  Mars, and Saturn. I became extremely fascinated in the sizes of these planets and what they were made of. Ever since then really I have been interested in space. So if I had to answer the question, I would say I’m here largely in part because of that librarian."
