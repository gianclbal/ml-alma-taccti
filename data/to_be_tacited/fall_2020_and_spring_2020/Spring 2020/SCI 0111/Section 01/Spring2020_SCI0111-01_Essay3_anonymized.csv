2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,305,"The values of my community and family have helped me to navigate through college by giving me the guidance and support necessary to find the path that I think will be the most enjoyable for my future. Last semester I switched majors for the third time however, I believe it will be the last time that I do so. I switched my major to Astrophysics because I’ve always had a love for astronomy and space but I never really saw it as a potential career until this semester. My friends, colleagues, and teachers have helped me to realize that Astrophysics is the field that I would love to pursue in life and I am very thankful to have their insights and advice. The only thing I am slightly worried about is the course load of this major. However, I know that I will not be alone with any problems I have as there is a great community of Astrophysics and Astronomy majors here on campus who I can use as resources in case I ever run into any trouble. I am very excited to be taking more Astronomy and Physics courses and I can’t wait to tell all the things I’ve learned to my family."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,313,My family’s values have definitely helped me get through college. My parents have always taught me about life through discipline and restrictions and I feel like those are things that I needed. College has been an extremely difficult period of adjustment. I think that discipline has really helped me buckle down and take things seriously. My community has also provided support and instilled values in me. My community has definitely reminded not to forget to take a breath every once in a while and not stress myself out. College has been one of the most stressful experiences in life for me and it has been such a whirlwind. I have taken time for myself at some points and I definitely do not regret it. They have kept me sane and helped me realize how important my mental health is during times like these. My family has also helped me to realize the importance of a support system.

2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,529,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college by motivating me to work harder in my studies. My family has showed me that if we want something good for our future we have to go out and work hard to get it. They showed me that having an education and degree will have many opportunities for me for a career. All they want for us is to be financially stable and happy with the career paths we have chosen for ourselves. They don’t want us to be struggling the way they have growing up. It motivates me every day because I want to show my parents that I will take the opportunity they gave me to go to school and make something of myself. I want to show them that their sacrifices will not be in vain, we will all work hard and appreciate what we were given to make a better future for ourselves. These are the values I carry with myself to help me navigate through college."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,399,"I come from a low income family, where throughout my years I’ve seen how hard they’ve worked, specifically my mom, to be able to give me and my siblings a stabled life. Seeing her wake up every morning, drop us off with the babysitter, and then going to work, coming tired and exhausted, she would still be there for us by making sure we had finished our homeworks, and cooking for us every single day, no matter how tired she was. My mom has always worked in kitchens where she has to work with precautions because she can get burned. This has helped me navigate through college by pushing myself further, and not giving up. I want to succeed and give my family a better life, since they have taught me to value my education, and see how hard it is to be working at a minimum wage. In addition, all of my mom's hard work made me realize that education can make a big difference in someone’s life by having a stable job, earning enough money to live, without having to suffer."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,119,"My family values have always centered around working hard and being kind. Both of my parents are immigrants- my dad came to America in the 80s and my mom came in the late 90s. They both came with about $20 in their wallets and stayed with distant family friends they barely knew. They worked odd night jobs while going to school in the mornings and afternoons. Now, my dad is a radiologist and my mom is a pharmacist. Something that has been instilled in me at a very young age was to have a very strong work ethic. My parents would definitely not be where they are right now if they didn’t possess the discipline needed to get through it all. A second value that was instilled in me was being kind- when my parents first came to America, they stayed with people they barely knew but these people were kind enough to drive my dad to and from school and another family let my mom borrow their car so she could take to her night shifts. They’ve taught me to help strangers like this as well without expecting anything in return, which is what led me to begin starting a club known as Hearts for the Homeless at SF State. This club helps educate the homeless population in San Francisco on heart health and also does weekly blood pressure screenings to make sure they are safe. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,299,"The values of my family and community have helped me quite a bit as I try to navigate my way through college. Specially, this year has been a trial of those values. There’s a saying that my mother and father like to pass around from time to time. It is, when the going gets tough, the tough get going. This year has been particularly tough with all the unpredictable circumstances and everything else that comes with a pandemic that the earth has never really experienced. Only a sad person lets the challenges of life consume them, so that means I will face these challenges to the best of my abilities. I will continue to face my schoolwork with the same effort, while taking the time that I have off to better connect with family and realize what is really important. I may even truly out some new things and see if I can maybe find a new passion. There is always a balance of good and bad, so where there is a lot of bad, there must be a lot of good to. You just have to be willing to look for it."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,532,"My family always valued success, if that makes sense? Like doing the best you can and growing from it and using it to to do something great in the future. Always enforcing how great growth is and learning itself is a privilege. For me now just having my family in my mind is one of the values I carry because I grew up appreciating everything I get. So when im in school that is one of the things that I have in the back of my mind, making sure that I know why I am here. Even though it does get hard for me, I always try finding my way back to this and making sure that I am back on track. Even though moving from home has changed me, I always try going back to the roots of home and making sure that I reset my mind and start again with the values I grew up with. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,531,"College has always been an option. My parents and family made sure to get it through to me that nothing else is an option. Honestly I've never really questioned or had doubts about going to college. Most of my friends in high school also had an effect on me because they're stands were high too, so college was a must for them. They were the ones that kept me on track with when applications were due for CSU's and UC's, and when the people were going to come to our campus to help families complete the FAFSA application. One of the biggest reasons I'm here is because I am an older sister of four girls. Being that I am the oldest I feel obligated to be successful, to be a role model to all my little sisters. In general I am first generation, so I feel a lot is expected from me. Sometimes the pressure is real. As for my community I come from a small town. Everyone knows everyone. I feel like my community is very caring towards me as I higher my education. I hope to become a dentist one day. I believe the Dentist in the area has reached out to my mom to take me under their wing. For example like with internships, help with advice on how to study and pass the DAT. I'm very grateful for those around me that continue to support me and remind me why I'm here."
