2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,530,"Physics is the language of the universe. The things we learn in class help us understand what happens in our everyday life but from a deeper perspective like why the moon has less gravity than Earth. This past few classes have helped me understand friction and tension. I now understand  when 2 people are pulling a rope, tension remains the same. Physics can relate to may things in our every lives like moving something across a desk causes friction, if I was not in this class I honestly would not know that. I also did not know how to measure gravity before this class. I am learning pretty cool things. I am not sure I can make it to 200 words so I am going to rant about how doing online classes now is not the best the university could have came up since the corona pandemic. I feel like it is a lot harder to learn now. To be honest these zooms are pretty useless as well. Teachers are moving way to fast through material and it is dumb to ask things via chat. All i have to say is if I do not pass my classes... I am not sure how I would feel."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,305,"In the lab we learned about elastic potential energy. More specifically, what is the relationship between a spring constant and elastic potential energy? The formula for elastic potential energy is PE=(1/2)kx^2. Given this formula, we can see that elastic potential energy is equal to one half of the spring constant multiplied by the displacement from the equilibrium squared. What we can gather from this equation is that the spring constant is directly related to potential energy. What this means is that as the spring constant increases, elastic potential energy also increases. Taking this into consideration, I figured that a larger spring constant would also correlate to a longer period. To my surprise, the opposite is actually true. The reason for this is because the period of a spring is inversely related to its spring constant. We can see this in the formula for the period of a spring which is T=2π(m/k)^(1/2). Given this equation, we can see that the period of a spring is equal to 2π multiplied by the square root of the mass divided by the spring constant. We can verify our statement that the spring constant is inversely related to its period by plugging in increasing values for the spring constant. After doing this, we will see that as our spring constant increases, our period for the spring decreases. This information could be relevant to someone designing a pinball machine as they could then choose a spring with a higher spring constant in order to launch a ball without making much noise after the ball is launched due to it's shorter period."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,299,"The question that I have comes from the balance lab. The question is: What are the factors that affect balance. In order to find out this information, we must know the definition for balance. The definition of balance is momentum divided by weight. In the case of a beam, we know that achieving balance is affected by weight and momentum. This tells us that balance can be affected by mass, as well as gravity. An example of this is a 1kg apple. We can calculate the weight of the apple by multiplying the mass, which is 9kg, by the acceleration of gravity, which is 9.8m/s. From this we can see that the apple weighs 9.8N on earth. Therefore, there would have to be two 9.8N apples on either side. However, the placement of the apples is also key. Say the apple on the right is placed closer to the center of mass than the apple on the left. Then the beam will tilt to the left, and not be in balance. Both apples have to be placed an equal length from the center. In total, momentum, weight, mass, placement, and acceleration due to gravity all affect the balance of two objects on a beam."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,313,"The topic that I choose to compare to the real world is about work and energy. How does work and energy apply to the real world and society today? In terms of energy, I am going to be talking about potential and kinetic energy. Let’s use baseball as an example. A pitcher winds up before he pitches the ball. This represents the potential energy before it is thrown. When the pitch is released, the potential energy is then transformed into kinetic energy. The energy from the releasing motion is what causes this change. Another example of this can be our everyday use of cars and automobiles. The gasoline tank holds the potential energy and as you start the car and ultimately move it, this converts into kinetic energy. All of these examples result in a change of kinetic energy and this is the definition of work. That change from an initial kinetic energy of zero and a final kinetic energy of a different number is what is used to calculate the amount of work in the world of physics. In these scenarios, we would take the initial amount of kinetic energy as being zero because there was only potential energy to begin with."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,58,"The lecture that was covered to revenant information in the world. Was in last class when had was about the corona virus at the time you guys were going over it, it didn't seem as such a real threat and now its been a month later.I had realized that some social topic discus in class are more important than the actual material. This class was the first one to discus the corona virus as a serious threat and look at us now basically everyone in house arrest.So what I learned in this class basically was that that the material learned is not important but mostly the idea of being able to adapted in new situations and new environments because class is life is not always to remain the same.Adapting is key in survival . An actual concept I learn I physics is that speed is squared on impact so a few miles over the speed limit can make a huge difference in a car crash."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,399,"One concept that was covered in class was momemtum, inelastic collision and an elastic collision. A question I have is, how the center of mass is calculated? So far, what I know is that the center of mass is a balancing point betwen two objects. In addition, the center of mass is going to be closer to the larger mass. In order to find the center of mass specifically eventhough will know is closer to the larger mass, you take all the masses times its position, and then divide by all the masses added together. Now, any point you pick you have to be consistent with it, specifically since your answers will vary. I believe this information might be applicable to people’s lives because now they would be able to find the center of mass of any obejct they liked. For example, if someone who is driving a truck, and has to go up a hill, all their stuff and weight will be supported by the back, and of both back wheels. In additon, anybody who drives a car or a bus, when turning or going around a ramp, the reason for it not to tilt around is because the center of mass is right there. It makes sense because if we think about it, the center of mass is closer to the larger mass, allowing things to stay firmly."
2020,Spring,SCI 0111,SI,1,529,"One of the concepts that we learned in class was how to read a position, velocity and acceleration graph. One of my questions would be, how can we prove that the graphs are showing a change of direction? We can learn this by using a coordinate system and labeling it in the directions of positive and negative. First, we can tell the position by the line on the graph. If the line is linear slanted up, the position represents that the object is moving away from the origin at a constant speed. The line can also be curved, like a parabola, and that shows the position moving away from the origin at an increasing speed. The slope of the line shows whether the speed is increasing or slowing down. This will be able to show the velocity of the object in a separate graph. Similar to the position graph, if the line is linear slanted up, the velocity is increasing. The slope of the line for velocity then represents the acceleration. For the acceleration graph, we can tell if it is accelerating by the y-value on the coordinate system. The line for acceleration will be a horizontal straight line. With the values of velocity and acceleration, we can determine if the object is slowing down or speeding up. If both acceleration and velocity have the same sign, they are speeding up. If velocity and acceleration have opposite signs, it is slowing down."
