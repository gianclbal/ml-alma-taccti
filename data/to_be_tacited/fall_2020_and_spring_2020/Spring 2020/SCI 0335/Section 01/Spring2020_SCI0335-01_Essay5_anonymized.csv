2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,767,"The first time I was introduced to what a science lab was, it immediately sparked an interest in science. The reason I push to be part of the STEM field is because of events that have happened to me throughout my life. Sophomore year of high school my grandpa passed away due to internal bleeding that the doctors could not locate (because they needed to go outside for an MRI). It was told to us multiple times that there was nothing that they could do because he was going into septic shock. A few years later, someone very significant in my life passed away from breast cancer. Then, just last year in 2019 my aunt passed away from breast cancer. Next thing you know, a few months later in 2019 I get told by my grandma that her cancer came back but in her bones; she had survived two different types of cancer and here her cancer returns. These events made me want to pursue a career in biology-- as of right now, I want to do research. Whether it be to construct research on how employees can better assess and treat their patients, or employees in the health department learning better procedures to reduce errors and deaths, or even to help with cancer research. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,744,I want to go into my major of chemistry because I love how it is very  useful and there is a high demand for chemistry majors. It never made  sense to me to go into a major that wasn't in high demand. I cant afford  to spend part of my life getting a degree where I might have trouble  finding a job later. Although a degree doesn't guarantee anybody a job.  It only makes sense to seek out a job that pays well. I don't want to go  the rest of my life paying off student loans because the major I chose  doesn't pay much. I feel like many degrees are worthless or are the  equivalent of a Microsoft excel certificate of completion. I can't see  myself doing spreadsheets forever. I like working hands on and in a  laboratory.
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,768,"The main reason I wanted to be a Cell and Molecular major was sole because I’ve always have been interested in science and wanted to one day pursue a career in the medical field. This major has always been hard to keep up with but has challenged me in so many different ways mentally and physically. With my current major and my minor, which is Latino/a studies, I want to be part of making a difference in the Latinx community through medical-related jobs. I believe as of right now, this community is very under representative and never given any help. As a Latino myself, I want to inspire change and outlooks of how we are essentially perceived and create new pathways through science and challenge the norms that are expected of us. Whether that might be a scientist or a doctor, I want to be an inspiration to others that just anyone can make it far and achieve what we want. That’s what this major means to mean, an opportunity to make those goals, a reality."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,769,"Currently, my major is biology with a concentration in physiology. I chose this major because ever since I was a kid, I knew I wanted to do something involving STEM, more specifically science. I have always wanted to be in the medical field because I have a passion for helping people and I have always been fascinated with how the human body operates and functions. I felt that the perfect major for me to go into was biology, kinesiology, or public health. I chose biology because, although seemingly more difficult, has a flexibility of options because starting college I was unsure of what field I wanted to be in. I initially chose neurology and decided that I wanted to be a neurologist, however I took one neuroscience class before realizing that neurology was not for me. I panicked because I didn't understand what I was going to do for the rest of my life, and I was already too far into college to start over. However, I knew my passions, and realized that physical therapy was a better suit for me. It combines fitness and the body, and I can still pursue that career with a biology major. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,774,I want to go into my major for many reasons. I grew up loving science all throughout high school and middle school. So naturally I wanted to be a biology major. I did also love fitness and working out and I'm an athlete so I wanted to be more in the physiology side of biology. I also grew up loving medicine and that takes me to want to become a PA. This major is the perfect path to this program and it will prepare me the most and help me do well. Biology always has interested me and it is something I like learning about in school. The main reason of why I want to go into my major though is my professionalisms after college. I go to high school to go to college which I then go to more school to become a physician Assistant. I want to spread healthy habits and make sure everyone is taken care of. All my classes have prepared me and have interested me greatly. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,777,"I wanted to go into Biology in order to go into healthcare, and understanding the body and how it works to stay alive is very important. I actually hated biology my freshman year of high school, because my teacher sucked. However, I took anatomy my senior year with an amazing teacher, and realized that this is what I actually wanted to learn about. I finally took anatomy here this semester and was so excited. Understanding the body's processes and how it has developed cells into these specific machines that all work together is fascinating. I also learned a lot about the body when I was becoming an EMT. I learned more about what can go wrong in the body, and it is awesome now to connect those diseases and problems with their deep down cellular or chemical causes as I learn more about the anatomy and histology of the body, and how physiology brings all those together to explain what's going on with a patient. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,772,"The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is that I enjoy the sciences. While growing up I have always found my favorite subjects in school to be things like Earth science, biology, algebra, calculus, etc. I like solving math and science-related problems because I like how challenging they are and how they really push me to think. I also want to pursue a career in medicine by becoming a physician and thankfully the most traditional route of studying science in my undergraduate education actually suits me the best because of how much I genuinely want to learn about STEM and be involved in it. I think STEM is a way to better understand the world and I think my natural curiosity has lead me to go into STEM because of how it allows me to think about questions about the world while also allowing me ways to answer those questions. I also want to be in STEM because I want to represent my community and as a Filipino, I want to see more people who like me in the scientific community and hopefully by doing so I would help to encourage others like myself to also follow a path into STEM."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,781,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field?STEM field is useful in many different professions, by studying STEM, we learn science, technology, engineering, math, research methods, and problem solving, which helps us in the future with job search, because we have learned many fields. When working in hospital or any other places nowadays, everyone should be familiar with technology, and aware of recent researches, because many things are being researched not and new solutions are coming up to make our lives easier. With my science major in biology bachelor’s degree, I want to go to med school. My future goal is to become pediatrician, I love kids and I have my own kids, whenever I go to their monthly/yearly checkups I feel like I belong to the hospitals working with kids. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,776,"I want to be a physiology major because I started gaining an interest in biology when I started college, mainly because I became more curious about the human body. Whenever me or my friends got sick, I would do something like a diagnosis about why we’re sick. I would start thinking scientifically, even though I didn’t like the science before. And before I knew, I was already interested in almost anything related to biology. I started thinking scientifically(mainly biologically) during my day to day life, which basically became something like an instinct to me. My previous plan was to become a pediatrician, until I learned that there was a shorter alternative to having a similar career, but with less schooling, so I changed my career to becoming a physician’s assistant. I can continue to diagnose and prescribe medicine to patients of my own. I would think of random scientific topics for a while and it would be stuck in my head, until I tell someone about it. Sometimes it would be a theory or just a curiosity thought, which made me even more fascinated in the field of science. When I go to class and learn more about the scientific topics I’m interested in, I actually find it fun to learn, even if I'm just reading articles."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,775,"There are a couple of reasons I want to go into the STEM field. First of all, like many STEM students, I wanted to work in science when I grew up. I always enjoyed learning about biology, chemistry, and physics. I did not really like English other subjects that did not have to do with science. I was a kid and looking back, a very creative one. I feel my creativeness helped spark my interest in science in the first place. Another reason why I want to go into the STEM field is because I can become a veterinarian by studying in it. Since I was young, I also not only looked forward to working in science but also working with animals. The animals can be domestic, non-domestic, exotic you name it. My interest in this started because I really loved dogs. I would always ask my parents for a dog. I started asking since 1st grade and I did not get one until my sophomore year of high school. It was one of the best moments of my life. Another reason I wanted to become a STEM student is because I wanted to make a change in our environment. By learning about the different toxins in our environment, hopefully I can learn more about these things to create cures for some diseases in the human society. I also wanted to bring aware for conservation of the environment and by becoming a veterinarian I can use animals make people be the change through inspiration."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,780,"I honestly went into my major because the overall goal in life is to become a pediatrician. Growing up I had the same pediatrics doctor and she inspired me to do the same. She was very helpful and guiding through my childhood. In high school, she helped me choose my school and pick out the school that really focused on the sciences. She was actually the one who said to apply for the major. There are also reasons why I chose this major and its because its such a wide range of sciences. I am studying all aspects of life for prerequisites then towards the upper division classes I start learning about the human body and every little detail about it. Though it is a lot its fun to know how and why your body functions as it does. Also if you get sick you can self diagnose the problem and fix it yourself rather than go to a doctor ONLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCEs. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,698,"I like this question because very often we are always mindful on a day to day bases as to why we want to do the things we want to do. I want to go into Biology because science is cool. I think it is so interesting to learn about ourselves and how the world works around us. More directly talking about my major, which is Biology with a concentration in physiology. I thrive to help people. I want to be able to figure things out in my head and rule out options. The more I know about human anatomy the more I will be able to understand how our body works. I don't think there is a cooler major because why wouldn't you want to learn about how your body functions. Why would you want to learn scientifically about yourself? I think that point alone is a very interesting aspect when looking into my major. This major then will help me continue to go to school for Physician Assistant and hopefully become one so that I can help people. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,770,"I am a biology major with an emphasis on cell and molecular biology. With this major, I intend to go into the medical field and most likely become a nurse or a nurse practitioner. My mom is a nurse (RN) as well. She has inspired me to go into this work field. She gets to meet interesting people and help them with their health. There have also been incidents in my life in which I wish I knew what to do to help people that had near death experiences. I want to be able to react to those experiences with authority and knowledge on how to help those people. I have always been a caring person, whether others deserved it or not. I feel like this attribute will help me as I make my way into the medical field. I am also a determined individual so this is something I will continue to work for until I achieve it. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,764,"I am currently a Nutritional Science major and I am still in between the two concentrations; Food or Community and Nutrition Science. Although, I plan on pursuing Nursing after I finish Nutritional Science. I chose this degree because I believe it would be beneficial for pursuing a career in the medical field. I enjoy the classes I am taking because they are both challenging and fun. I especially love the lab I had taken this semester, in which we went into depth of the scientific concepts related to cooking food; it’s just unfortunate that our lab was cut short because of the pandemic. I enjoy learning a lot about the science behind the food we eat, and I find it interesting to see how what we consume can affect the human body. I am looking forward to the other classes I am taking for my last year in SFSU and learning more about what it takes to become a dietitian. If I am unable to get into a Nursing program, at least I would have a degree in another field I enjoy."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,766,"I enrolled in this class because organic chemistry is one of those subjects where most people struggle a lot in and I do not want to struggle like they did so that’s the main reason why I am here. For me, chemistry is a fairly difficult subject because for the early classes, a lot of it was calculations and math is not my forte. Leading into organic chemistry, you have to either be able to visualize the different molecules or be able to recreate it using a molecule kit. There are only a few molecules that are dealt with in organic chemistry but they contribute to a vast amount of organisms in the world. To better understand what compounds these molecules can make, I decided to take SCI. Since the class is taught by students who took organic chemistry, they know what the professors are looking for and how to approach certain questions. From what I hear, this is one of those classes that shows who is ready for a very hard class that is not necessarily required knowledge but is used when going to medical school. Hopefully I will learn the little tricks needed to get that A in the class."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,779,"I find the stem field extremely interesting compared to other field.  Within the stem field, there are many unknowns and constant research taking place.  It requires the individual to be very creative in order to find many of the things that affects us.  I love learning about the human body which fascinates me.  I see the body as a well built machine that is able to heal, grow, reproduce, and function without us noticing all of the work it does.  For example the body goes through many protocols in order to maintain homeostasis and we aren't even aware of all the things going on.  I enjoy learning about the different parts of the body and how all those parts work together to create the whole body. Apart from the body, I also liked the STEM field because I had a lot of interest within the planet we live in.  Learning about the physical properties of our environment and the different species around the world.  The STEM field gives you knowledge of who you are, what you are made of and the environment in which we live in.  All these are questions that we still being answered which makes it more intriguing and fascinating.  Within the STEM field, you have the ability to impact tremendous lives for the good. Also STEM field pushes an individual to challenge themselves in a level that will transform them into someone else.  "
