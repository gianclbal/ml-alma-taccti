2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,779,"One of the concept that we learned in class that I found fascinating was the during a Lab in which we created the main ingredient used in Tylenol and other major pain killers.  I thought this lab was very interesting because throughout my life, I've used an extensive amount of pain killers for injuries and pain.  I was always curious on how the drugs were created.  Completing the lab gave me a perspective on what pain killers are about and the compounds that creates it.  Apparently it was a very easy and cheap compound to create which I thought was cool.  The lab also thought me that too much of the drug can be detrimental at a point which makes it important to monitor the usage of intake.  With this knowledge, I can pass it down to friends and family members that aren't aware of all the information.  It would be cool to learn about other drugs.  Having such knowledge would change how an individual see's things around them and allows them to make better decision for themselves and those around them.  The professors and instructors on campus were amazing and put in the effort to pass the knowledge down to the students and the students were eager to absorb the materials. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,781,"This class is related to reality, for example we had to write down the formula for remdesivir for our quiz 1 , which is now maybe used to treat Covid 19, its antiviral medication. Especially now during pandemic, I understood that chemistry is important in our daily lives, to make prescriptions, for example Tylenol, is very useful drug, it helps to stop pain, fever, headache which is very helpful. Now during covid 19, doctors and chemists working together to find the cure for covid 19 and come out with the drug, or vaccine. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,768,"Through organic chemistry, there are different challenging and diverse topics that sometimes make you think harder, and twice before connecting this beyond the class. If we look at a topic such as the grignard method, it seems to always find complement the reaction into having complete synthesis or solution. So a question would be what is an inspiration or spark that motivates you to solve to issue faced either in front of your or later down the line. For me at least, what motivates me to always solve something whether that is a problem from a class or an issue with my financial stability or something big as figuring out my next step in life, I always think of one thing, my dream. I want to work hard to become a doctor or something in the medical field that I will encounter various difficult issues. So by maneuvering these issues and finding different tools to overcome these issue and find a way to pull through will only prepare me for the greater goal that I have. You need Br and Mg to complete the synthesis problems and so in a way, that represents the things that motivate you with the passion that you have in order to reach your goals. Without those motivations like without using Grignard, then there is simply no way you’ll solve the problem, the end goal. I believe in a lot of ways that this is the mindset of the community and in society because, in order to have a working society and in order to have a safe community, you need those variables to maintain the goals to keep it running. There is always a connection in our everyday life through the things we learn in class whether we can see it or not. But it is the barriers in which we overcome that prepare for our future."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,766,"I enrolled in this class because organic chemistry is one of those subjects where most people struggle a lot in and I do not want to struggle like they did so that’s the main reason why I am here. For me, chemistry is a fairly difficult subject because for the early classes, a lot of it was calculations and math is not my forte. Leading into organic chemistry, you have to either be able to visualize the different molecules or be able to recreate it using a molecule kit. There are only a few molecules that are dealt with in organic chemistry but they contribute to a vast amount of organisms in the world. To better understand what compounds these molecules can make, I decided to take SCI. Since the class is taught by students who took organic chemistry, they know what the professors are looking for and how to approach certain questions. From what I hear, this is one of those classes that shows who is ready for a very hard class that is not necessarily required knowledge but is used when going to medical school. Hopefully I will learn the little tricks needed to get that A in the class."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,770,"In class, we talked about NMR graphs and how they can be used to identify the structure of a molecule. This information is relevant because it can help us determine structures of complex molecules and help us understand their purpose. NMR is still something I tend to struggle with as it was talked about briefly in our lecture. Another important concept we learned is the concept of naming molecules. It is important to name molecules properly so that people know what kind of molecule they are dealing with, especially if it is being used in a lab or for pharmaceutical purposes. In lab, it is important to know the names of the chemicals that are being used to ensure that the chemicals do not react in a way that is dangerous for the user and the class. In class we also go over many different kinds of reactions. This is especially important to know when it comes to synthesizing of a certain molecule. There may be many different ways and processes to synthesize a molecule. Understanding why, how, and the conditions in which these reactions take place is also vital. It is important to know these reactions and their outcomes because again if in a lab it helps ensure lab safety of the user and class. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,776,"A concept that was covered in class a few weeks prior was the nucleophilic aromatic substitution, in which Anderson calls the “SNAr Reaction.” I don’t particularly have any questions about it, but I DID find it interesting. Anderson showed us a sequence from the book that had to do with the quinolone antibiotic known as Ofloxacin. Since finding the cure for coronavirus has been the craze in the science community, Ofloxacin was also one of those antibiotics taken into consideration. The mechanism in the book showed how the antibiotic is formed. This kind of information can benefit society because of the infectious virus currently spreading. Ofloxacin is used to treat respiratory infections, so the process of making this antibiotic can be used in many labs around the world and used to test if the treatment is positive or not. Using the nucleophilic aromatic substitution method, other antibiotics and medicines can be made as well, which will benefit the pharmaceutical society. As technology advances, more medicines can be made using this concept, which will be able to cure more infectious diseases."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,698,"In the past few weeks, we have been learning about all these different types of reactions. And I know all these reactions are important to learn. It just has been difficult to memorize them since there is no need to study the material really hard since we are doing a test open book. We did talk about Advil or aleeve in one of the reactions and how there are different forms of it to be allowed to be used for consumption. Other than that, this is all I know about the types of reactions that are happening and to my knowledge. I wish I could input more about the different types of reactions!!! Other than that we have been doing everything online and our professor has been really on top of his work. He has been posting and giving us quizzes. We no longer have exams, even though the quizzes feel like mini exams. It helps to do zoom with my peers to catch up and to help with any of there confusion. Or sometime when I have questions, I am able to ask my peers about it and get some clarity on the type of reaction or even whole mechanism."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,780,"Todays date is May 1st and I am going to talk about the community and my everyday life. At first the semester was going great, classes weren't as hard and everything seemed to flow well. Then the fire nation attacked AKA COVID-19 happened. Then the world went spiraling as well as my classes difficulties. The professors and students were confused on whats going to happen, a lot of the professors transition to online was rather difficult and long. Some longer than other but now its ""okay"". I can truly say it is much harder to focus in an online class due to your surrounding and what can easily distract you at home. Going to a coffee shop isn't even an option because of the whole shelter in place act so you are forced to educate yourself at home. Though it saves us commuters a lot of time, it is a blessing and a curse. A lot of professors are understanding of our situation and more lenient on assignments/homework/quizzes/tests but again a new experience all together. Some classes are easy and some hard it depends on how the professor transitioned to online. Many professors find it difficult to email students or even update the ilearn page so we have no idea whats going on. Graduation is still up in the air but if it points towards an online ceremony I would be really upset. I didn't go to this school for 4 years to graduate online.   "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,775,"After looking through my class notes, lab notes, and textbook, I realize that Organic-Chemistry is definitely something that can be used for the future. For example, we are currently in an epidemic with the Corona virus. Vaccinations are creating using the structures of the virus and what you can use to destroy it. this can be done with organic chemistry. Because we learned so much about reactions and making certain functional groups react and go away, Organic Chemistry can be very much used to combat viruses. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,767,"The concept of proton NMR is confusing for organic chemistry II. The proton NMR is especially confusing when dealing with carboxylic acids. One question about the topic is, what are useful indicators of how to figure out the structure of a compound when looking at a proton NMR graph/chart. When dealing with spectroscopy of carboxylic derivatives one helpful tip is to figure out where the oxygen is located. Also, figure out if the oxygen is located in an ester. You know that an ester is present in the carboxylic acid derivative structure if when calculating the degrees of unsaturation (UN) using the molecular formula and you get UN = 1 and there is two oxygens in the molecular formula. Another tip is to make sure there is no carboxylic acid peak (11-12 ppm). Next, an OCH peak should be around 4ppm with proton NMR. If dealing with carbon NMR the OCH peak will be about 60 through 80 ppm and a C double bond O peak around 170 to 180 ppm. A nitrile will be present if the molecular formula of the carboxylic acid derivative has a degree of unsaturation of 2 and if there is a nitrogen in the formula. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,777,"What I am learning in organic chemistry is very relevant to everyday life, and to me. Organic chemistry is really relevant to everyone's life and society because it is very involved in keeping us all alive. This is important for me as I am studying biology. Understanding the molecules involved with our bodies and how they react with each other is incredibly important. It is important now as I learn about the biological systems and how they use these organic molecules, as well as later in my career. I hope to go into healthcare so knowing how molecules interact with each other as well as with different drugs will be important. It will also be important to understand how blood chemistry is affected by different body processes and the different things in the body that could affect those levels as well. Overall, organic chemistry as it relates to the body and biology is very important, not only to my life but everyone's life. Organic chemistry is also very involved with what we eat. All food whether it's ""organic"" or not should mainly be made up of organic molecules. And the reactions that happen are how we are able to cook and bake and change food from raw to cooked or combine ingredients to make something new. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,764,"When talking about amine formation and converting carboxylic acid to different functional groups it had me thinking a lot about how our body breaks down the food we eat.. In my nutritional science classes we have been discussing a lot about energy metabolism and how the body breaks down the foods we eat. The building blocks of proteins we eat consist of a carboxylic group, amino group, hydrogen, and a specific R group. While reading our organic textbook, I noticed how they mentioned the importance of active amines in the body; it states that amines, specifically 2-phenylamine/ Beta- phenylamine, contribute to behaviors, appetite control, and muscular activity. These structures connect to certain neurotransmitter sites in nerve terminals. This brought about diet pills in which drugs can link to these sites and increase satiety, making an individual feel more full for a longer period of time. (Vollhardt & Neil, 2018, p.936). It is the chemical structure of 2-phenylamine that allows it to be targeted by drugs that can play a role in controlling weight and fighting obesity. Also reducing amines with alkyl halides or carbonyl compounds, reductive amination, were concepts we went over in chapter 21. (Vollhardt & Neil, 2018, p.951).Through mechanisms like this is how amines can be converted to ammonia, which is done in the liver once the amines are taken apart from the amino acids in protein. These concepts directly associate with how we metabolize the foods we eat, and a better understanding of our energy metabolism can help individuals feel more cautious in the foods they’re eating."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,772,"In my organic chemistry lab, we learned how to synthesize Benzimidazole through the Philips Condensation reaction using o-phenylenediamine and formic acid as starting materials. The limiting reagent was o-phenylenediamine at 0.99 mmol and the theoretical yield of Benzimidazole was 0.117 g if all of the limiting reagent was used. The reaction involved a two-step mechanism. ​The product was a heterocycle that is defined by ​a ring ​that has atoms of at least two different ​elements as its members with Benzimidazole containing two heteroatoms of nitrogen. Some experimental techniques that we used in the procedure were handling moisture-sensitive reagents, the use of a biological pipette, refluxing, and isolation by precipitation. The question I ask is why it is important to understand how to synthesize heterocycles? Heterocycles are often used in the pharmaceutical industry to create drugs such as Lipitor and Piroxicam. This applies to people’s lives and benefits society because Lipitor is used to treat high cholesterol and reduce the risk of various heart complications and Piroxicam is a drug used to relieve the symptoms of painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. These are particularly important health issues to address in American society where obesity and diabetes are common and the aging Baby Boomer population is in need of medications to address their health concerns and symptoms."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,769,"I chose the topic of electrophilic attacks of disubstituted benzenes. We covered this in lecture. My question is how to distinguish whether to put specific molecules in the ortho or para directions. When looking through my class notes and lecture slides, I realized that sometimes you have to treat the benzene with certain reagents to block off either ortho or para positions, sometimes even meta positions. After blocking one of these positions it is easier to place another substituent in another position. Once placing the substituent in the position that you want, it is also easy to remove the substituent that you used to block the ortho, meta, or para position. This is important for people's lives because some of these chemical reactions and chemical products can be used to make medicines, something that many people take on a regular basis. If these reactions and products are not done correctly, it puts the health of the patient at risk. Another example can be seen in making chemicals for skin care. Many benzenes are used in the formulas for skin care and makeup, and cannot be wrong or done incorrectly for the sake of the health of the skin and the safety and well being of the person using these cosmetic products. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,774,"Why do we have to block certain spots on a benzyl ring when trying to add molecules? This was a tough idea I had at first and I quickly got the hang of it. There are different kind of directors. Meta directors, para directors and ortho directors. Certain reagents will direct molecules to certain positions on the ring when they are mixed together. I could not grasp this concept. It took many attempts to figure out what these things are. But I quickly learned that you need to place a specific director with the reagent to block a separate position in order to direct it to the right place. In all honesty, I don't see myself ever using this in real life. For society it can help, specifically with chemists and researches trying to form different drugs and they need to try different mixes of reagents and it helps to know what does what. This information was a big part of O chem in our last test. Its relevant in the class itself considering it is all reactions and learning about so many different reactions. This goes along with all the different reagents we have learned and mechanisms to help us understand why these reactions happen and it helps us understand why they are necessary. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,744,When we went over the U.S. Standards for Lead levels in food it was very  interesting to me how low levels of lead in food made it past the  screening process. It seems like humans have a very complex relationship  with the element Lead. It's almost like a love hate kind of situation.  Because of its unique properties lead has so many applications. But too  much exposure to lead could kill us. It makes me sad when you hear stuff  on the news about lead in the water supplies of poor communities in  America.
