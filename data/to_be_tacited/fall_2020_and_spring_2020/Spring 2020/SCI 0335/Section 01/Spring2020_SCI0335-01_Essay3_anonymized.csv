2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,775,"My values have helped me navigate through college in so many ways. My values have shaped who I am as a person and who I am as student. Some of the main values I go by are to be humble, have goals, having the right attitude brings me to the highest of altitudes, and one of my important ones is never giving up. I strive to live by these values because I receive satisfaction from each and every one of these things when I achieve them on a daily basis. I set them as goals for everyday life and when I reach them, those are big steps towards living a more fulfilling life. There are many things in college that try to bring me down, classes, grades, gpa, not understanding concepts, but by never giving up, I choose to keep moving forward. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,781,"How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?In my family all members have a high level of University education, and my mom always says that I believe on you and you should have a high education too. Also, I am a mom and I want my kids to be proud of me, like I am proud of my parents. My husband has a master’s degree and I don’t want to fall behind him, I want to have masters or medical degree to in the future. I want to get high education, because in the future I can help my kids to do well in their studies, and work in prestigious jobs where I can afford my family and day offs with my kids. There is a correlation between parental education level and influences on children’s learning and goal. Since my parents are educated, I want to get high education and hopefully my kids see that both parents have high education and will try to get high education. I do believe that high education is not just about having prestigious jobs and money, it’s also about the way people see the world, the way they think is different.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,772,"I believe that the values of my community and the values within my family have greatly shaped how I go through my college career. Both of my parents immigrated from the Philippines and have worked very hard to get into the careers they currently are in order to provide for our family. I think that because of their experiences they have instilled in me the value and importance of handwork and perseverance. Because of being raised with a strong emphasis on these values I find myself putting in a lot of effort into my school work and these values helped me throughout times where I felt that I was not smart or good enough to be in college in which I was able to overcome these feelings by knowing that I had to keep going. I think within my community, being Filipino, there is a strong emphasis on family and so by working hard and getting to a position where you can provide for your family is something that my parents have always wanted me to do. As such, I view my path through college not only as a journey for myself but as a stepping stone to getting myself in a place where I can provide for me and my future family."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,768,"I Believe my family is what keeps me sane when it comes to successfully doing well in my education and doing the things necessary to be independent. Without the support of them and the constant words of encouragement, I feel like things would be 100% harder to keep going without anyone in my corner. At the end of the day, my hard work and my dedication are all thanks to them because they have given everything to get to where I am today.  As for my community, I am actively involved in my Latino community finding ways to give back and help those dealing with mass incarceration along with the immigrants that are constantly being targeted. To know that I am doing this and to have met so many different people and doing good in this world makes me feel like I’m doing something and making a difference. The values of community, integrity, respect are something that continues to push me every day into the goals that I want to achieve for myself, my family, and my community."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,766,"I enrolled in this class because organic chemistry is one of those subjects where most people struggle a lot in and I do not want to struggle like they did so that’s the main reason why I am here. For me, chemistry is a fairly difficult subject because for the early classes, a lot of it was calculations and math is not my forte. Leading into organic chemistry, you have to either be able to visualize the different molecules or be able to recreate it using a molecule kit. There are only a few molecules that are dealt with in organic chemistry but they contribute to a vast amount of organisms in the world. To better understand what compounds these molecules can make, I decided to take SCI. Since the class is taught by students who took organic chemistry, they know what the professors are looking for and how to approach certain questions. From what I hear, this is one of those classes that shows who is ready for a very hard class that is not necessarily required knowledge but is used when going to medical school. Hopefully I will learn the little tricks needed to get that A in the class."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,780,"Navigating through college has been pretty awesome. With the help with my cousins It has been smooth sailing. Her and I have the same aspiration so I literally copied her template, class, and more. My family has been through the struggle and seeing that pushes me to do my best and try my hardest to achieve my goal. Not so much family but a family friend but another influence to my life is my pediatrician. Growing up my pediatrician has been there with me throughout my whole childhood and she very much influenced my thinking. She guided me through the classes and inspired me to be who I aspire. She was kind and always helpful. Helpful in a way that she was there for me in my health and mental health. I wanna give back tot he community and do the same for kids. Hopefully one day I can inspire one of them to become a pediatrician."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,777,"My family has always said that school should come first. Even though school feels like forever, it really is a short portion of your life, and it truly shapes the rest of it. The things you learn set you up to learn more and more as you live and grow, even after you've left school. But the foundation of knowledge that is built in school is incredibly important. Last semester, I did not put school first, I put work first. While my work was important, it made my grades suck. I realized I'll be working forever, school is short. This semester I have really tried to focus on school and on my classes, and it has made a huge difference. Remembering this has been extremely helpful and rewarding. While my classes may still be challenging, giving myself the time to get good sleep and do all my school work has made them 1000x easier. I will take this knowledge into my senior year and finish strong."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,779,"I come from a family that values and holds education at a high pedestal.  My family doesn't contain a strong line of individuals that have been fortunate to attend college.  Having the opportunity to attend college makes me feel utterly lucky and blessed.  It has been a huge motivation throughout my college years.  My whole family and community as well are all behind my support group cheering for my completion in college.  My family has taught me the value of working hard to earn things that you want and it was been something that I've applied during my times in undergrad.  I've envisioned things that I would want fro myself and have put the work in order to achieve those things.  Sometimes its not always easy but with repetition, I've been able to accomplished many things.  Ultimately, I enjoy learning new materials and acquiring knowledge. I've had the absolute honor of learning many things from outstanding professors and peers throughout my years in college.  All these materials have widened my perspective about the world as well as career plans.  I attribute all of this towards my family and community because they have installed a hunger of learning within me which I am grateful for."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,769,"Personally, I am a first generation college student. My parents did not go to college, and always have told me stories about how they wish they went to college and got an education. They always taught me that with a college education I can do anything I wanted to in life. As I was growing up, my parents pushed me academically on a continuous basis, wanting me to always take higher level, honors, and AP courses. Also, I grew up well off, always attending the best schools in my city. These schools, I can say, have definitely prepared me for college and have always pushed me to be my best academically. Being a part of these communities has had a large impact on my education, as we were always encouraged to do better in school and encouraged to work hard for what we want. We were taught that college is a very big deal and will always be beneficial to have a college degree under our belts for the rest of our lives. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,698,"Through college, you really get to explore other people’s values and try to respect everyone. You also do not want to lose your own values. The values of my family have really helped me, preserver, through the hard times. They have a big motto of “everything happens for a reason and God has a plan for you.” I think this really helped when I was not able to get the courses I wanted and which in turn pushed me back a year. I was very upset and mad at the world but with those values and words of wisdom, I was able to really center myself and let things be. Now, this semester I got those specific courses and I have been acing all of the test with solid “A’s”, which is something I don’t think I would have been able to do if I had taken it this past semester. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,776,"The people in my community know which classes to take for college, so they helped me navigate which classes to take for my major, so I can graduate. Some of the people in my community were older than me, so they knew how to give me advice, as well as which professors to take. Ever since I entered college, I didn’t know anyone who was in my major, so I didn’t have anyone to turn to for help, but after taking courses that related to my major, I joined a community of people who were in my major and knew what to do to get into graduate school. On the other hand, I haven’t really associated with them much and just continued to take my classes that were listed on a piece of paper. Until I had enough, I decided to take action and went to clubs and on campus activities that would improve my communication skills. After meeting the people from my community, I had a greater sense of what to do in college, besides taking classes and not doing anything else. Asking the people who has known about the community longer than I have, helped me with my decisions on what was right and wrong in college and they taught me how to do things that would make me a better person throughout college."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,764,"My family has always valued education; my parents prioritize my brother and I education. They have been wary of me working just in case it would interfere with my education. I was motivated to focus on finding a job that would relate to my career goals. My family has always encouraged me to join organizations or volunteering that was related to my future goals. In my first few years of college I volunteered in Ronald Reagan Hospital and when I moved to the Bay Area I decided to work for CSD. It’s a company that works with autistic children, and I figured it would be great working experience for me to have the opportunity to work with clients that experience developmental delays. I feel like it’s a small step to working towards a career in the healthcare field, while also being flexible enough to work around my schedule as a student. While in quarantine, I have been staying with my older brother and his two housemates. They are always working and being in an environment with working individuals has also made me more focused on online classes. Is it much easier going to the zoom lectures and getting my homework done when there are also people around me who are just as focused. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,771,"Mental health and self-care are what my friends and I have valued throughout our college career. We all understand how rough semesters can get when plates are full and when life factors get in the way of our studies. We showed importance in having a support system when faced with the stresses and anxiety of school, because sometimes we only have each other who truly have an understanding of what we face. We made it important that even though we go to different schools, we take the time to hear each other out when we feel depressed or on the brink of an anxiety attack. We value giving each other optimism and positivity when feeling low. Interesting enough, none of us are psychology majors. However, we all understand that within our culture, mental health is not acknowledged, which is why we provide awareness for each other. All peace and love within my group of friends, which I greatly appreciate. Every one has depressing times one in while, or a long while, so it is important to find a group of people that take the time to give you that consideration, listening ear, and at times a shoulder to cry on."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,770,"I have always held school as my top priority. My family also values education as we all share the same belief that having an education will me a better chance at becoming successful and living comfortably. I value the determination my mother has to provide for my family, and that is what also motivates me to be successful in school because I want to be able to make her proud. She has a strong work ethic and that is something that I continue to work on as I progress through my school career. I truly believe in the statement that knowledge is power. You never know when you are going to need that knowledge. Another one of my values is being a good listener. This is something that I feel like I have picked up on my own. I enjoy listening to people and empathizing with them. This is an important skill to have because it helps build trust and strengthen relationships. College can get pretty stressful and it is always great to have a friend there who can listen. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,744,"My family and community have helped me navigate through college because  they motivate me to go to school and learn and experience new things in  life. The community that I grew up in made me want to leave so bad,  because I knew it was not the place I wanted to spend my whole life in.   The people I grew up with have made bad choices in life. Luckily I was  able to learn from their mistakes and I was able to finally get out of  the life that I felt trapped in for  so long. Neither of my parents were  educated and it motivated me to get educated because I didn't want to  go through my entire life struggling. I hope that one day college will  put me in a position where I could help my family and community."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,774,"my values of community has helped be throughout college in many ways. community to me means coming together and supporting and helping one another and iv made friendships with many people who have given me a sense of community within my experience at SFSU. Its helped me a lot with figuring out what classes to take and has helped me with studying and has given me a support system that I can rely on to help me through this challenging time as a college student. my family has always helped me by pushing me and my mom always keeping me accountable in school. Its been nice having a community and family that makes me want to do good in college and be the best I can be. I want that kind of support system for myself and for everyone else going through college. Overall, my true core values with community has aspired me to help out others and create a safe and loving community. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,767,"I am a first generation college student. My ancestors did not have the luxury of going to college, let alone, some of them could not even go to high school because they had to work alongside with their parents and siblings for a small amount of income in order to keep a roof over their head and food in their bellies. For this reason I am very grateful to have this opportunity to be able to have an education and obtain a degree. When I think about my family, it reminds me to continue to keep on pushing to achieve my goals and to be thankful that I get to even go to college. I am reminded that I have parents who are very supportive of me to help get me through my academics. Without the hardships and sacrifices of my parents, I would never have been able to have the opportunities I have today."
