Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,763,"I am in this class because I have taken supplemental instruction in the past and I believe it is really helpful. It helps me dedicate a time to actually study and practice because if I wasn’t in this class I would most likely study in the last minute. It also helps me to create study groups at other times. I am at SF State because I want to take advantage of this opportunity that I have to get a higher education. My parents were not able to go to college, so they have always worked in really hard jobs that only pay the minimum. My family has motivated me to do well in school so that I can get a job in something that is interesting to me and that pays well since they were never able to get an opportunity like this. I also want to represent my Latino community in STEM because I feel like there is not enough Latinos in STEM. Science has always interested me, but I also knew that it is not easy but since I really find science subjects to be really interesting I figured it would be worth the hard work. So I am here to represent and to make my family proud."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,764,"I am in SCI 335 class because I would like to review the lessons we went through in the chemistry class I’m already in, Chem 335, and have a better understanding of the concepts. I have to take ochem I in order to take biochemistry, which I need for my major and I heard about this class when Brent came in to invite students to add the course. In the past I found that I would always study by myself but it helped when I would study with others. I also work better with smaller groups, which isn’t something I can get in a large lecture class like Chem 335. I feel like this class would really help me with organic chemistry because I definitely had trouble in my organic chemistry part I, but the workshop helped me a lot. I also like the idea of being able to review the concepts right after class so the timing of this class best works for my schedule."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,765,"I am at San Francisco State University (SFSU) to obtain a Cell and Molecular Biology  Bachelor’s Major. I aspire to obtain a PhD in Cancer Biology in the future. SFSU will instill the the skills to be accepted and carry out a project in graduate school. As for this SCI course, it will help me learn tricks and skills to do well in my organic chemistry course, pass the exams, and overall exceed in the course. It will help me solidify the course material to do well in class, provide a support group, and allow for extra study time while still earning credit thus bringing my GPA up a little bit which can make a big difference. As a Genentech scholar, I am required to take SCI courses for all my science majors, so this course will help me retain my scholarship. I am located in San Francisco because the Bay Area has great Biotech companies that I would like to network with and hopefully work for under their cancer department."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,766,"I enrolled in this class because organic chemistry is one of those subjects where most people struggle a lot in and I do not want to struggle like they did so that’s the main reason why I am here. For me, chemistry is a fairly difficult subject because for the early classes, a lot of it was calculations and math is not my forte. Leading into organic chemistry, you have to either be able to visualize the different molecules or be able to recreate it using a molecule kit. There are only a few molecules that are dealt with in organic chemistry but they contribute to a vast amount of organisms in the world. To better understand what compounds these molecules can make, I decided to take SCI. Since the class is taught by students who took organic chemistry, they know what the professors are looking for and how to approach certain questions. From what I hear, this is one of those classes that shows who is ready for a very hard class that is not necessarily required knowledge but is used when going to medical school. Hopefully I will learn the little tricks needed to get that A in the class."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,767,"I am in this sci class because it will help support my knowledge for my organic chemistry II class. But, on a broader scale, I am here dedicating my time and resources to this class because it was ultimately my choice. I made a choice to go to college because I see how difficult my parents and grandparents work without a college education. Also, over the summer I volunteered in Thailand and one thing that I did there was teach in the schools. Being there really pushed me and helped me realize how fortunate I am with the education opportunities that I have. Those kids that I taught (ranged from the ages three through twelve) would hike three hours in the jungle every single week to stay in the dorms to get an education. These students in Thailand have taught me to be thankful for the opportunity I have to be able to go to college.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,768,"There are many reasons why am I here, the first being that I really want the extra support in order to do well in my academics especially in my science classes. In general, I really find my passion for learning about new things in my classes and especially being challenged in many ways that I usually don’t in my other classes. I believe that you must be challenged in different ways in order to grow in life, and with organic chemistry, it challenges you in all the different ways. Growing up, I had to overcome a lot of challenges in my life in order to get to where I am right now, and having that extra support definitely helps a lot when it comes to tackling these challenges. I am here to grow, to learn, to succeed, and to find ways to fight norms of being different since we all have what it takes to achieve our dreams!"
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,769,"Personally, when I decided to add this class, it was because I thought O Chem 2 was difficult. I took the class last semester and completely stumbled and failed because I didn't understand any of the concepts in the beginning, and gave up for the rest of the semester. I had just transferred from a community college, where I took O Chem 1. I barely passed that class, and put little to no effort learning in O Chem 1 because the teacher was lenient and gave me a passing grade to be nice. Now I struggle with O Chem 2 because I don't know/remember anything from O Chem 1. I am taking this class because I decided not to take the SCI support class last semester, and I should have to help me better. My decision to take this course also was because it is only once a week for two hours, and I don't feel as pressured to be good in the subject because everyone else in the class also feels uneasy as it is a difficult subject. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,770,"I am taking this SCI class in order to learn more about organic chemistry. This class is like a required study session that I get credit for. I am here because I know I could use the extra help and it would really help solidify the concepts that I have learned in class. It is also a great class to make friends or meet new people that are also taking the same subject as you. For example, there are two different organic chemistry teachers right now so some of the other students can teach us about topics we haven’t learned yet and vice verse. It is great to hear about how other students do their problem solving as well as how they study so that way I could think about picking up study habits from them. I am here because I know that this SCI class will help me get a much better grade than if I did not do this class."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,771,"The reason why I joined a SCI course is to help me understand Organic Chemistry II and to learn beyond what is taught in the short hour of lecture. I hope this course will help me to clear any confusion that I have had during lecture and work it out with my peers. I find it easier to study with a whole group of people because concepts can be learned faster with different study habits and tactics that others have. Especially when clearing up confusions and things that were not understood in lecture, I believe SCI is where that can happen and those skills can be enhanced with that additional hour and a half devoted to group study. But, why am I here? In all honesty, this is the second time that I am taking OChem, so I want to make sure I pass this time. I  want to take SCI because OChem II the first time was difficult to understand from the start and was a lot of information to grasp onto. So I entered the course wanting the help needed to understand all the content being taught in lecture in a more dumbed down and simpler setting, and to force myself to study the content."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,772,"I believe I am here because I am trying to learn what I need to know in order to get into the career I want. I really hope that I will be able to get into medical school and become a doctor one day and so I feel that by doing well in this class and understanding what is going on I can carry whatever I learn from this semester throughout my academic career. I think I am here to be a good student and learn, but I also came to my specific Ochem II class knowing that Professor Anderson is known to be really good at teaching and working with students and so I think I am in this class because I am eager to know more about chemistry and want to learn from a professor who is passionate about teaching and can teach their students effectively. I think on a bigger scale, the reason why I am here at SFSU is because I knew I wanted to expand my worldview and decided that going to a school far from my hometown would benefit me because it would allow me to interact and meet new people and give me the opportunity to make long-lasting and meaningful connections."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,773,"I am here because I want to ace O Chem 2, and I am tired of failing my classes. I stuggle making friends or gathering the courage to make plans with classmates to study together outside of class. It helps to trap others in a small confined space, thus minimizing their possible escape options, and forcing them to talk to me. I also often get lost in the material, and it helps me tremendously to have others bring focus back into what is important and what is being tested. I also needed one more unit to become a full time student. I needed a slightly lighter load this semester, because my grades have been pretty bad and my living situation has been super unstable. I gain from working with peers and I love teaching others and seeing their eyes light up with understanding."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,774,"Im here to help me with O chem 2. This is my first SCI class and it has so far really helped me learn the topics I have seen in class. I would like to get an A in O chem 2 because I struggled with O Chem 1. This is a great way to help my GPA as well as give me the knowledge I need in order to do better in my class. Im also here, in college to get a degree and get the information I need in order to pursue the career I want to go into, which is PA school. My parents have pushed me to go into college and so that was my goal.  I like science and love my degree and I'm here to make a difference in this world. To become a PA and help people and push them and get them through the tough times of they're life, especially if they have chronic illnesses. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,744,I signed up for 2 SCI classes this semester because in the past SCI courses have really improved my learning. My very first semester at San Francisco State University I took a total of 3 SCI courses and it was my best semester GPA to date. Since that semester my GPA has not been as good. It was that first semester that has been holding my overall GPA over a 2.0 average. So this semester I needed something to change so I've decided to go back to what worked for me in the past. So far I've been having a great semester for the first time in a long time I finally dont feel like Im behind in all my classes. It is a great feeling and I hope there are more SCI courses offered here for my upper division classes. I really enjoy learning in this type of environment.
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,775,"I am here because I believe I have a purpose. My purpose is for me to bring joy and happiness to those around me. I am a Catholic and I believe it is one of my duties to bring joy and happiness and spread the faith to those around me. This is important because I believe God is the truth, the way, and the life. I really believe in a lot of the teachings in the faith and it is important for me to follow these things and also important for me to show other people. Besides my purpose I believe my career path is to become and environmentalist along with a veterinarian to show the world how important it is to take care of the environments and animals inhabiting it. And taking care of environments and animals takes care of us because we are all affected by the animals and the affected environment. This is very important to me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,698,"I am here because I want to further my education. I want to be able to continue my passion for learning because I think that it is amazing to have a growth mindset. The ability to always learn more than what you did yesterday amazes me. I do believe knowledge is power and amazing things can be done with the right knowledge. I am here because I want to eventually get to a place where I can help people. I always visited Mexico and would see that when trying to access their form of a hospital or emergency room, it was always a struggle for families. I want to be able to do probono work for families in Mexico, while also being a PA in the US. That is why I am here, and why I want to learn what I can. I know my father didn’t get the opportunity to do so and now I want to be the one to help as much people as I can."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,776,"I’m here because I want to improve my studies in chemistry. I’m not good at chemistry, so I need lots of help and time just to learn something new. I’m hoping that being in this class will help me learn more concepts of studying and learning. Being a visual learner, I can’t just listen to people talk and learn from that. Someone has to write it down or draw it for me to imagine what some type of problem looks like. When the professor asked us to shout the answer in class, I didn’t know the answer nor what to say, so I usually stay silent. I hope this SCI class helps me to know more about what I’m learning and helps me study more efficiently with all the practice problems they give me. So far, they’re helping, but my time management is a problem. I’m also taking this SCI class to help with my time management on studying. Going to a class which helps me study and manage my time. I know that I’m being productive in class and I’m not distracted on my phone and I can ask other classmates for help. Knowing that this is a class that supports my Organic Chemistry class, I feel like I can ask for any confusions without being shy."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,777,"I am here because I did not do good in ochem 1. There were a variety of factors that led to this, mainly having to do with my job, but also definitely due to a lack of effort on my part. I scraped through with a C, and I know I can do better. I missed some key classes in the beginning of the semester due to work training, and had a limited amount of time to study because I was working insane hours, and so I felt like I never fully grasped the core concepts, and so just felt lost throughout the rest of the semester. I'm hoping this class will help me solidify the knowledge that I need to have to succeed in ochem2, and also give help and hints as to what will be useful to study for tests. It also gives me a chance to get some study time in the school day, since my time outside school is still a little limited. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,778,"I am here as a student to learn from my peers and my instructors. I want to earn my Bachelor's Degree in Science with a concentration in Physiology. On the way, I hope to also make connections with the student body. I believe that making connections, understanding one another and expanding our views is important. It's easy to be stagnant and get comfortable with our routine."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,779,I am here for a lot of reasons. I am here to get an education but more importantly learn more about myself and my surroundings. Education is something that allows an individual to have the ability to think and be creative within the world in which they live in.  I am here to have the ability to think differently when it come to challenges and problems that society faces. With the people that I have met here and the professors that I’ve been able to learn from it was been a rewarding experience 
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,780,"I am here in school to honestly make a living. Growing up was pretty hard and the root of the problems are started from the lack of money. Money is such a variable in life and to especially live in the Bay Area requires money. So here I am in school trying to become what I love doing and that's helping people. I think I strive to be in the medical field because helping someones health is more important than anything. So knocking out health and the main variable in life ""money"" at the same time could potentially help me in my future. In terms of ""why am I here"" in this sci class, is to honestly help me in the class. Organic chemistry isn't my strong suit so being in here is really helping me out. Quite honestly this class saved me in my other classes too because I took multiple sci classes before and not only for organic chemistry."
