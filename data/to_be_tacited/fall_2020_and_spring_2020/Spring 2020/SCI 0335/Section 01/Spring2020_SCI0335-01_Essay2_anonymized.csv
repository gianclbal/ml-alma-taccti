2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,772,"Being in school, I find myself getting more stressed and overwhelmed by the things I need to do. For example, I am taking classes that are harder than the classes I took last semester, so I often get stumped by the work I have on my plate. During these times when things get challenging, I try to take a break from what is giving me stress, I might take a walk or exercise so that I can give my mind a break and just focus on working on my body. I might reach out to my support group, which consists of my friends and family. They are people that I can talk to when I feel overwhelmed and I’ll often get advice or words of comfort which helps to make me feel better. I will also talk to my therapist and ask her questions and tell her about how I am feeling. She’ll help give me steps to deal with stress, advice on how to manage my time or reassure me that everything will be okay. When life gets challenging I try to talk myself into a positive mindset and try not to be hard on myself, which gets difficult because when life gets difficult, the stress can make things worse. So being good to myself is something I work on in order to better whatever situation I’m in a little bit better."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,770,"When life gets challenging the first thing I do is take a nap. I then try to make a list of things I have to get done in order of priority or due date. I try to knock things out one at a time, but sometimes it gets hard to not think about everything I need to do at the same time. I try not to overwork myself and do things like go to the gym to give myself a break. It is important to give yourself a break in between work so that you do not get burnt out. Another thing I do is talk to my loved ones about what I am feeling so that it does not get bottled up. Expressing your feelings is very important as well. Once I have completed everything I need to do, I try to reward myself by going shopping or getting some of my favorite foods and drinks."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,698,"Life is interesting honestly. It has its ups and its downs for a majority of our lives we live in the down portion. So, what do I do when life get challenging…? I rely on my support system to distract me. My family is everything and I always go home every weekend in order to keep our connection strong and to stay in their lives. They truly are my everything because when I am down they help cheer me up and when I am happy they definitely know how to keep my mood that way. Another thing I do when life gets challenging is see all the possible ways I can help succeed in whatever situation I am in. Really evaluate every aspect of the situation. This can be by seeing how life got so hard in the first place and seeing how in the future I can avoid this struggle again. Also, understanding that it is okay to struggle because no one’s life is perfect and I think the sooner we realize it the easier life gets. Everything will end up okay and we will see the end of this tunnel and to continue to look for the positive side of things. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,767,"With living in a city, everything is fast paced it can become difficult to find time to actually enjoy a meal, reflect on your own thoughts, connect with friends and family, and other activities. Living in a city where everyone is ""hustling"" to try and make the ""big bucks"", it puts you in that mode as well. With this said, when life gets challenging, I take a step back and take time to myself. I pause the things around me, and take at least a minimum of 5 minutes alone. I take the time to reflect with myself. See how I am doing. When life gets difficult, it is important that I check in with myself. If I do not, it would be difficult for me to keep a sane mind because I would constantly be thinking about my pathway to a career and keeping up my grades that I would drive myself up to the point of exhaustion, which then would take away my motivation."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,774,When life gets challenging I clear mind and trust the process. After of course I worry. I worry a lot about grades and everything in life. I have gotten better with this as iv had more of a calmer mind and focused my energy into positives and not negatives. With school If I worry about a test or its getting hard I just take a step back. Life is always challenging we just all need to learn to chill and not let things get to us as much. I eat some food and drink lots of water when life gets challenging. I also talk to my friends and family and play volleyball to help me with challenging times. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,764,"When life gets challenging and I am feeling overwhelmed, I always try to find time to pause and look at all my past accomplishments. This motivates me to face whatever challenges I may face in the future. I also make sure to list down my priorities, what needs to be addressed first, should be top priority and taken care of before everything else. I find that writing down all my tasks helps me stay on track and organized. I try to also practice self-care because when I do get stressed it takes a big toll on my health, and that does not help me accomplish anything. With that in mind, I think it’s best to stay proactive when it comes to my health and studies. It’s better to maintain my health and study early than deal with the repercussions. Another thing I like to do when life gets challenging is working out, playing tennis, or anything that keeps me active; it helps clear my head or sometimes help me think things through differently."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,771,"When life gets a little challenging, the first thing I do it pray. Once that initial and important step is done, I make a to-do list, especially if my problem is time (which is usually the case). Making something that seems to be overwhelming into smaller and more simpler steps makes the situation of the challenge easier to handle. I find it easier to face a challenge when I know what I am up against and plan ahead and being able to see the challenge as a whole and being able to break it down into smaller easier tasks makes it simpler to conquer. Other times, I look to friends for help, just so that I don’t feel so alone. I feel that if you have trusted friends that can help you through the rough stages in life, it makes living and pushing through that obstacle with ease. Also, having friends to help you along the way and listen to you vent when things are overwhelming and become stressful can help in making your mental state stay or become healthy again. What I have learned lately is that a healthy mental state is needed to conquer any challenge thrown at you."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,776,"When life gets challenging, I first deal with the problems that need to be completed first. In order to do that, I need to create a life of things that I need to check off while trying to complete my tasks. I then try to find a way to calm myself down from all the stress I’m going through just to get through the challenges that I need to face. To calm myself down, I play games, listen to music, and basically do anything that will make me distracted so I can focus on it after. This will sound like I’m procrastinating, which I kind of am, but I stay more focused on what I need to do after doing all those things. When I manage my time good enough for me to squeeze in time to play games and relax, I’m confident that I can finish whatever I need to finish, fast enough. If I don’t have the time and things are still challenging for me, I just listen to my favorite music while doing what I need to complete. I surround myself with my friends, so I can stay positive and have people supporting me when I am having a hard time. Having people covering for me makes me feel more like I’m in a safe environment and lets me know that I’m not alone.   "
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,768,"For me when things get a little tough or challenging I usually try to take a deep breath and self-reflect everything that I do. I feel like when things get tense up and start to build through stress as well as anxiety, I go to the gym to get rid of that tense feeling. As for what I do when things get tough in my classes and learning the materials, I try to always ask a question and be on top of everything, so it doesn’t get to that point. I have been through a lot in my life that has taken a toll on my mental well-being and truly believe that life is too short to let something small get in the way of something greater. I think what works the best for me is if something gets to the point of feeling down or giving up cause something is getting to that point, I talk to somebody whether that is a friend or a family member to get reminded of that love to keep pushing through."
2020,Spring,SCI 0335,SI,1,779,"When life gets challenging which always happen, I try my best to slow down the process but maintaining my work ethic.  The first this I’ve learned and always trying to put to practice is the knowing that life will get hard which enables me to prepare for what is to come.  By having an understanding that things might go wrong, it allows me to be ready when it does happen.  I try not to self blame myself when life gets challenging because not everything is in my control.  I try to do many things to distress and get my mind out of the problem so that I can think about other things.  I’ve started reading and meditating in order to distress during a stressful situation.  Sometimes I would watch my favorite tv shows and just not do anything for that day.  But most importantly, I remind myself who I am and where I came from which never fails to get me going.  My family’s journey in a pursuit for a better life is something that has continuously motivated me.    I’ve had many mentors and people that I’ve been inspired by throughout my life.  Their words continue to motivate and guide me when things get hard. "
