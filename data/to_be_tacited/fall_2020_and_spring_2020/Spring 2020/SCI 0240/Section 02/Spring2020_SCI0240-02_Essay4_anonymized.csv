2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,706,"In biology lecture class, we learned about mammals. Mammals evolved 200 million years ago. Mammals are warm - blooded, vertebrates with hair or fur and have mammary glands that produce milk (only in females) for their offspring. Mammals also give birth to live offspring, but there are some egg - laying mammals, such as the duck - billed platypus, so mammals can be both viviparous (live offspring develops inside its parent) and oviparous (offspring are laid out by parent in the form of eggs). Learning about mammals is especially important and relevant for people because we are humans and humans are mammals. Knowing about our species, in this case, humans, can help us to better understand our bodies, our reproduction, and development. For example, when female humans are pregnant, they develop an organ in their uterus, called the placenta. Now, you might wonder what purpose or function does a placenta have? Well, a placenta is an organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby during pregnancy. It also removes waste from your baby's blood. Lastly, a baby's umbilical cord forms from the placenta too.I am sure many people have heard that eating your placenta can be beneficial to your health, such as improving a person's energy or providing good nutrients for your body, but it is actually harmful. Why? Well, despite cooking and preparing the placenta thoroughly to eat, many harmful bacteria and diseases can still be present in the placenta, which can cause serious illnesses, so if you are contemplating about eating your placenta, don't eat it. Talk to your doctor."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,581,"The topic I want to explore for this reflection is surrounding sexual selection and behavior, more specifically asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction. Ultimately, the question would be “what are the differences between asexual and sexual reproduction, including pros and cons for each?”. Starting with the main difference between asexual and sexual reproduction is that fact that asexual reproduction can be accomplished without a mate or partner, whereas sexual reproduction requires a mate or a partner. Pros for asexual reproduction include not needing a mate to reproduce, not requiring a change in location for reproduction, and having a short gestation or growth period. Cons include occurrence of genetic mutation, lack of diversity, and issues may arise if there are a large number of new organisms. Pros for sexual reproduction include strong variation within species, stops an allele from mutating drastically, and even enjoyment for (I believe) two species. Cons would be that there could be genetic malfunction, it can be time consuming, the need for a mate, and could cause imbalance to the ecosystem. Each demonstrate a vast example of pros and cons, but generally, both types of reproduction (both sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction) are necessary to each species and our environment."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,707,"The question I want to ask is how ecology relates to my life and the world today. During this week, in lab we talked about conservation. We learned that conservation is the act of protecting, preserving and restoring. In this Zoom session, we also went over 5 Mass Extinctions such as celestial bodies (asteroids), volcanoes, climate change, continents drifting and habitat loss in general. We also talked about how there are six mass extinction topics which were mostly caused by humans; we learned about the acronym HIPPOC which stands for Habitat Loss, Introduced Species, Pollution,Population Growth and Climate Change.             Each of types of extinction additions to the world can help society to better understand how to prevent or at least lessen the amount of damage being done to the earth and its environment. Look at it this way, in this sense, when you know something is going to happen or how it will happen, you might want to find a way to prevent it from happening or at least find a way to make sure there isn’t much of it happening at a time. This is why knowing these different mass extinctions naturally caused or by humans is a huge factor in this section, at least in my opinion.             I learned some of these topics when I took AP Environmental Studies in high school, so essentially relearning the subjects and hearing how other professors or teachers take them into account can really show how it affects humans, especially if they’re studies done and researched on. Climate Change for example is a large one that we might not be able to fix, but we can find ways to prevent the change we are bringing on the world. Climate change not only affects our weather patterns and animal lifestyle, but it also affects human lifestyle; when learning about how it could affect us, take CO2 for example, a change in CO2 can change pollution levels, creating extreme weather events and enhance the growth of other diseases. If we found a way to lessen the amount of CO2 released especially since we know this is a manmade problem, then we could better our environment for every living organism. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,609,"A concept that we recently went over was conservation biology which can very easily be applied to the real word since it is about the real world. Conservation biology covers the preservation of life by integrating many fields such as Ecology, Physiology, Molecular biology, Genetics, and Evolutionary biology. Being a Molecular biologist, I was interested on how conversation biology could possibly be applied to my specific field. I was shocked to find out that we can use molecular biology to see how related species are and to determine genetic diversity. Genetic diversity is important because we can keep track of which species are going extinct. This ends up having a domino effect on an ecosystem when there’s a shift in genetic diversity."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,550,"So far, biology has been one of my more interesting classes. I really like how biology covers more than just body systems and stereotypical plant biology. What has been particularly interesting to me is the concept of evolution. It closely reminds me of science fiction movies and video games like pokemon, maybe one day with intensive studying of evolutionary patterns we can see where the human race will be within the next few million years. The study of evolution and how creatures change to better suit their environment is extremely interesting to me. Comparing the similarities between species and following their own ancestry is also extremely interesting to me. I feel knowing what our environment is doing to us and the animals enhabiting will help us to better our lives with the power of technology. Many scientists have stated that humans’ evolution has actually halted because of advanced technologies that help us in our daily lives. Scientists speculate that the only change we will see in the future will be a darker, browner overall skin color seen in most humans to deal with warmer temperature, but otherwise in the case of survival, our lives will be helped through the power of technology."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,399,"A concept that was covered in class the past few weeks was the concept of disease ecology. A question I formulated is how do the scientist ditect the different types of disease transmissions, and what are they? Based on the lecture notes they are differen types of disease that get transmitted differently. Some get transmitted by horizontally or vertically. There is also clinical and sub clinical disease. Non clinical is when it is later developed. This information is applicable to people’s life because like I didn’t know, other people might not know that their are being put on danger since there’s deseases that exist at birth, diseases that get passed on person to person, or in general diseases that animals can carry. This is relevant information since as we seen in one of the lectures a timeline where all the diseasees that have been developed just like the COVID-19, which caused a pandemic fear on everyone since it’s a disease that can be passed on by person to person just by being around them."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,545,"I was having trouble picking only one concept to be relevance to society so I will be really broad and I will just pick the concept of Biology as a whole. So just the idea of Biology is really needed for a society to grow. Without anyone knowing what the study of life is the world would be back to the stone age just like if chemistry wasn't learned about too. With Biology people can find ways to help humanity in medical ways because thats a part of biology too. With Biology there are so many advances in medical technology that allow humans to modernized. Back in the day before medical ideas were not really known people were unsanitary and die early, but now with the power of science we solved a lot of humanity's enemies like smallpox and TB. Those diseases have killed millions of people, but because of the invention of antibiotics we destroyed them. Not only antibiotics helped defeat those diseases but vaccines are also a great thing we discovered. It stops those deadly diseases in their tracks by giving people immunity to the diseases and without people to infect those diseases will go extinct. Humanity's next enemy is Coronavirus hopefully we can defeat them."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,709,"A concept that was covered in class in the past few weeks in lecture was the major life cycles of Schistosomes. A question I was able to formulate from this concept is: Why should diseases such as Schistomiasis be spoken about to the public? After looking through the lecture slides and my own notes I was able to notice that diseases such as Schistomiasis are hardly spoken about, but it is a very harmful and murderous disease. It kills close to as many people as Coronavirus has, but yet we never hear about it. This is mostly because of the fact that this disease can be found in only certain parts of the world and does not spread nearly as quickly as covid-19. However, the blood fluke that causes this disease named Schistosomes, can be found living in contaminated water. Many do not know beforehand that they are swimming or just simply putting their hands into contaminated water therefore, already putting themselves and especially their immune systems at risk. If more unknown or less popular diseases such as this one was brought to light, more of the population would be educated and take more precautions so they are not putting their bodies at risk."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,638,"Science is a timeless method and it is practiced through all areas of focus, from biology to chemistry.The career field I am chasing is medical and more specifically, patient care. I am fascinated how the human body works and the ailments that can come from failure in it's function. In terms everyday life though, I cannot see much application. Also I feel I should explain that I am not necessarily learning in class, but just practicing problems or answering them. Animals are part of ecosystem and even though must are hidden from us, they come from the same genetics as we do but from great distance in relation. We are all related and live on the same planet so it should be noted that if certain species were to ever go extinct, it would result in dire consequences for us. For example, if bees and birds were to die off, the rate a which pollination occurs would drop astronomically, ruining the oxygen levels in our atmosphere."
