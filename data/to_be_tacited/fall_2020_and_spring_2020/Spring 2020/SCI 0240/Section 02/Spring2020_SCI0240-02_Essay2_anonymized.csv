2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,399,"When life gets challenging I choose to overcome them by having my goals become my strength. For example right now with the situation of the corona virus happening it is hard for me to manage keeping up with online classes because it’s something that I’m not use too. I am a visual learner, but because of this situation I am learning to adapt myself with on line classes. Emailing my professors, watching extra videos etc. In addition, when life tempts to be challenging I don’t let it take over me. I see it from the positive site of it, and focus on what I can control from it. In addition, this has taught me to learn that there is no failure, but that is something we learn from. The situation of Covid-19 has gotten out of control, everyone is panicking, staying at home isolated from others, even families. Also, you want to purchase things in the store, and everything is running out, Leaving others in starvation, and not thinking world wide. There are other solutions to prevent yourself from getting the virus, such as staying healthy, watching hands every time you do something, etc. It’s crazy how a crisis like this has happened in a big country like California, and has been spread out though out the world."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,706,"For me, when life gets challenging, I like to take a break and do something that I enjoy. It is sort of like a breather. For example, I might read a book, watch food videos on YouTube, ""pig out"" on snacks, or exercise. No matter how stressed or challenging my life gets, I know that other people have it much, much worse than me, which makes me feel that I can overcome the challenges in my life. Another thing that I do, is I ask my family and friends for help. I talk with them, in order to come up with solutions. Most of the time, the challenges in my life involve my academics. I often get stressed, especially when I learn new topics in math because it takes me longer than everyone else to understand the topics and actually know how to apply the math concepts. I also freak out when my professors tell me about upcoming exams, tests, or quizzes. Luckily, my college has many tutoring services and academic resources to help me when I am having trouble in school. However, I usually attend office hours that my professors provide and form study groups with my classmates when I do not understand something and need extra help. Finally, the main method that I use when my life gets too challenging, is naps. Everything is better after a nap because you are well rested, which causes your mind to be more clear and you to be more relaxed, instead of stressed out."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,707,"I’m a person who naturally stresses themselves out without cause. Essentially, I can overthink and tend to put too much on my plate at one time causing me to get frustrated or feel like “everything is too much.” I am though not someone to give up easily when moments like this come into my life. When life gets challenging, I like to take a step back from all of my work and attack each task one at a time; I’ve gotten better at listing out what needs to be done and what is done and this has slightly improved my work ethic, in my opinion. In the event where something becomes super challenging however, I tend to shut down and try to start from square one; I would restart from the beginning and try my best to avoid the same mistake as the first time, or I would let life continue to be challenging and just use the experience to my advantage in order to tackle new tasks. I don’t shut down easily, I will challenge the challenge in life until it exhausts me; I’ve come to learn that I can really be stubborn especially when challenges come up in life. The most common way for me to deal with all of this however is simply by listening to music, sleeping it off, keeping my frustration inside and like I mentioned, by taking a step back and looking at the problem from a different perspective and not allowing myself to shut down easily. In the most basic terms however, I like to persevere and challenge life whenever I get challenged, sometimes to accomplish my goals or to see if life can hit me with something harder. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,710,"When life gets challenging, there are two main things that I like to do. I like to take a moment to figure out what is challenging and why that thing is challenging. Identifying the problem or obstacle in my life allows me to figure out possible solutions. I also like to talk to others about the situation. For example, last semester I was facing a lot of issues in my personal life and was having trouble adjusting to college life. I did not have many friends to confide in yet, because it was very early in the semester. But as I was always early to my eight am philosophy class, I began to talk to my professor before the rest of the class arrived. My professor genuinely cared - he still does care - about my issues and how they have affected me. My professor provided new and philosophical perspectives of the issues that were challenging me. Talking to him and hearing his unique ideas about my situation has definitely helped me work through the challenges."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,581,"When life gets challenging, I tend to sit back and force myself to take a look at the bigger picture. I need to pause and reflect on what is going on. It is important to look at each thing that is happening, then one by one, conquer each of them, if possible. It helps to make a to-do list, even if it is just for small things like rearranging a binder. Other than that, it is important to take time for yourself. We need to take a break and evaluate how we feel before it gets to be too intense. With that, we need some selfcare to make sure we can perform to the best of our ability. Taking a minute out of every day to focus on your breathing can help. When life gets challenging, it is important to pause, reflect, and react in a proper manner that benefits you."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,638,"What do I do when life gets challenging? If you mean academically or mentally, I keep persistent. I am a naturally stubborn person, so it takes much to offend or bother or worry me. You would be surprised what does upset in contrast to the norm. If you mean financially, which I never had problems with, I would live tighter to the wallet. If physically, then I would assess whether I have been keeping hydrated and getting my 7-8 hours of sleep. Routine is my key to stability and overcoming obstacles and at the base of that is keeping organized. Having everything in order and in line has kept me on a successful tract. The number one thing though is the people I surround myself with. I learned at an early stage in my life to cut off those who were an anchor and would not help me ascend in any way. It is when my life becomes challenging is when it becomes interesting. Then I grin. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,709,"When life gets challenging, which it does pretty often for me, there are a few different routes that I take to release the stress. I usually turn to my family or friends to vent or ask for some advice. The first person I normally go to when I feel overwhelmed and stressed by life, is my mom. At the end of the day I am just feeling so many emotions so what I really just need is to express those feelings through words to someone that I know will not judge me, but simply support me and remind me that I am not alone. For the times that I am not up for speaking to someone about my problems, I get creative. I start drawing or painting, and its normally Disney characters or something Disney related since Disneyland is and will always be my happy place. When I just feel like lounging and not putting much effort towards anything, I get comfortable on my bed, open up my laptop, and start binge watching on Netflix."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,609,"When life gets challenging, I tend to distract myself usually with school or homework. For example, when I got my identity stolen last year, I focused most of my attention on school than with adulting problems. I don’t like to think about problems, I’d rather ignore it until I can’t ignore it. However, if it’s school that gets challenging, I seek out help or any resources because I don’t like to struggle. If the problem that is making my life challenging is out of my control, I’d rather disassociate from reality by turning to sci-fi tv shows or just playing videogames instead. Recently with the whole COVID-19 crisis, I bought Sims 4 on my PS4 and I played it all throughout spring break to forget all the problems that are out of my control and live a different life for a little while. To sum it up, if life gets challenging, I try to mentally escape my situation for a while to recharge before continuing the daily struggle of life."
