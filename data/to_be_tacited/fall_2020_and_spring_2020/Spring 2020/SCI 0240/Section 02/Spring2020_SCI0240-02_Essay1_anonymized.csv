Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,706,"Hello, my name is Nanxi Huang and I am a college first year. I am here in SCI 240 class because last semester I learned about what SCI classes were and I took one for biology 230. I felt that the biology 230 SCI class, that I took last semester, was extremely helpful in helping me pass the biology 230 lecture and lab class. The biology SCI 230 class was the first SCI class I ever took. It allowed me to practice the science concepts and topics that were covered in lecture class, prepare and review for biology exams, as well as giving me another resource when I am confused about something and need help. I also like how SCI class allows you to meet other students that you can turn to for help and form study groups with. For me, the biology SCI 230 class was very effective because it actually helped me understand and think more in depth about the content I learned. Lastly, SCI classes are graded based on class attendance and participation, so if you attend every class and do the activities, then you will get an A and earn one unit, which is a good deal. For this spring semester, I knew that I wanted to take another SCI class, so my previous SCI instructors recommended SCI 240 to me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,707,"I'm here because I chose to be here. I want to do well in college and if I can take a tutoring class that will help me with my major while also earning a unit of credit towards the total number of units that needs to be competed. I’m here in SCI240 because I took SCI230 and that class helped me to understand and clear up my confusions that I had in BIO230. Plus, I was able to meet other peers who are looking to major in Biology and since some of us relate with each other, I can ask for advice on which classes to take for the next semester in order to keep me on the right track. But aside from that, I’m here because once again overall, I want to be successful. I want to become that Pediatric Physical Therapist. But to get there I have to finish my GE’s here and learn the basics and underlaying knowledge of the world of Biology. This concept isn’t easy for me to grasp and now since BIO240 mostly feels like theoretical information and a lot of words, being here and studying with others taking the class will help me and motivate me to keep pursuing the task to be successful and will give me the motivation to get that passing grade. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,708,"I am here because last semesters SCI course was extremely beneficial to me. I believed it played an immense role in the grade that I got in the biology lecture and even our lab course as well. Sci courses are super helpful and really do allow the students to understand the material from lecture much more than a student who isn’t taking this course. I am here because I need a good grade for the course and I believe that this SCI course, just like last semesters, will definitely allow me to acquire nothing below a B. I am also here because it allows me to associate much more with my fellow colleagues and help each other out to take down any type of problems and questions that we need help on. Lastly, I am here because I really want to learn the material much more than I would in lecture alone as we go more into depth and break things down in the SCI courses. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,638,I am here at San Francisco State University because I want to learn in an environment different from where I have grown up. I have recently declared my major in Biology with the Physiology concentration. I am excited to keep learning in this academic journey of mine. I partially describe myself as a scholar and I feel the most scholastic taking part in the scientific activities. I am physiology to prepare for my inevitable application to California physician assistant programs. Physician Assistance is a very desirable job in the medical field and patient care has been an interest of mine for a long time. I am in this supplemental science course as form of extra preparation for mt upcoming exams for the next three months. Medicine is a deep career interest of mine ever since my early years in middle school. The thought of having ill people looking to me for guidance compelled me to keep focused on the relevant course because I feel medical treatment is satisfying form of affection and care a human can give to another. This is why I am here at this school and in this class.
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,581,"Frankly, I am here because I need help in this class and I want to be successful in my classes. This semester is much more stressful than last semester, so I need these SCI classes in order to help me understand the material and be able to utilize what I learn. Because these are all lower division classes, I am holding myself to a higher standard and I want to increase my knowledge. SCI usually gives me tips, tricks, and a lot of practice for what I need to know to succeed. I’m in SCI because I need the tools to help me graduate and do my very best. School is hard enough as it is, but having SCI is something that we cannot take for granted as we only have so many classes they are available for. I am here because I want to do well and move on into my career path with confidence."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,399,"I am here at Sf State to succeed and have a better future. I am a first generation student, and the oldest of my siblings. I want to be a role model for my siblings, so they can have someone to rely upon. Hearing my mom’s history, and seeing that she didn’t have the opportunity to go to college is what motivates me to be here where I am now. As a younger girl my mom had to work, and help out in the house, making it harder to finish her education. Now, she has to work really hard to be able to afford paying rent, and I see her struggles. I don’t want to go through the same struggles, especially knowing how expensive it is to live here, this is why I want to succeed and have a better future. In addition, in order to succeed and become my career I have to first get a bachelor in Biology, and I would get it by graduating from SFSU. Lastly, I am here to be able to help my family out, and support them economically."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,709,"I am here in order to build a better future for myself, and as well as for my family. Sci helped me pass bio 230 last semester, so I know it'll do the same for me this semester for 240. My major is pre-biology at the moment and my plans for that is to become a doctor. In order to get that far in my dreams, I obviously have to pass biology class. With the material and short lectures it is very easy to become lost and confused and next thing you know, fail. I cannot afford to fall behind, especially in my biology classes so I have to take all the precautions necessary to keep that from ever happening. With this sci class and studying on my own or with a group, it is certain that I'll pass and hopefully continue my passion of science in medical school."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,710,"I am taking this SCI course because I have a goal of someday becoming a doctor of veterinary medicine. In order to achieve this goal, I will need to get accepted into an accredited veterinary school. Veterinary schools are extremely competitive and only students with high GPA’s and hundreds of hours of animal/veterinary experience are admitted. To ensure that I stand out as an applicant for veterinary school, I am striving towards a 3.8-4.0 GPA all throughout college. Last semester, I took a SCI class and it definitely helped me get an A in a class that I thought I would struggle in. I really enjoyed the discussions and activities the SCI class provided and I think I can still benefit from what SCI has to offer. SCI class is like a formal study group where we do review activities, such as Kahoot or mock exams, and I enjoy everything about it. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,550,"I feel I signed up for this class because it seems that biology is going to prove difficult for me. The lecture class also doesnt really suit my learning, I need more of a one on one environment for true absorption. I need to work it out on my own on paper or know what material to focus study on. This peice is essential for me, making the mistakes now and seeing how to avoid them keeps me from doing this process on tests/quizes. Working my issues out here will be my main support aside from homework.This class will help alot in the future towards my understanding and for memorization. After taking the first test I see the class is very terminology heavy and I need to memorize alot. Kahoot and working with classmates already helps with that so I think Im set for the future. The posters help my memorization as well."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,545,The main reason why i am here is because i needed 12 units so i can be considered a full time student. Because before i had 10 units because i was only enrolled in biol 240 and Chem 115 which are both 5 unit classes. And my advisor recommended i shouldn't take any more regular classes because chem 115 and biol 240 are hard classes already and im taking them together. And i wanted to be considered a full time student so she recommended i take the support class for chem 115 and biol 240 so i can have 12 units. I suppose the second reason why im here is just for the extra support im case if i need it since these are some hard classes so it wouldn't hurt to just take them. I've taken support classes in the past and it alwats helps. Also its a free A for my gpa as long as i show up to the class.
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,711,"I’m in college because I know that I can make a change in my community. That everything I do with my life will not only help my family but everyone in my community. I have a drive to do better in a world that constantly belittles my community. I’m not shy to say it how it is and it will drive me to success. The only way that I’m able to create a better future for my community is by getting a PhD and create data dedicated in my community and create policy targeted towards my community. I want to create change and its all about finding ways to make those changes. I’m in love with research and the beautiful ness of my Mexican Community, but we’ve been criminalized and dehumanized, and I want to change that. I’m here because I know that this is the start of everything I want to accomplish. I know that I still have years until I finish my life academically but I know that I want to do everything to help my community. It's funny because I’ve never been happier than I ever been because of  everything I’ve been doing lately. I just know this is what I want to do with my life."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,712,"The reason why I am here is to seek help with bio 240 because biology it is not my strong suit in subject wise. I want to be able to develop need strategies of ways to help my studying habits that way when it comes to the exam I can be more prepared and well aware of the information than I usually would. Last semester I barely passed bio 230 with a C- and I want to be able to change that because I wasn’t aware of a sci class and now that I am aware of the class I can meet new peers who can also help me and we can all each learn from one another because at the end of the day we each approach things differently so maybe some of the things they say would be better understood than in lecture. Like it is said the students kind of lead the conversation into the class and I like that people actually converse with each other and engage in the topic. In which I can learn from them as well from their tactics. Overall, I want to be able to understand biology more."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,609,"I’m here because I’m trying to major in the STEM field, specifically I want to enroll in a PhD program after graduating with a B.S in Cell and Molecular Biology. I suppose I’m taking this SCI course so that I can expand my general biology knowledge to see if I can apply biology concepts in my future research work. By enrolling in this SCI Biology course, I’m learning to apply lecture concepts onto real world applications. This is helpful since it will reinforce my confidence in biology concepts, and that confidence will help me feel more at ease in research environments (specifically research labs for PhD programs). I genuinely believe that understanding basic biology concepts will be applicable in my future research work. If I want to make sure that I deeply understand these basic biology concepts, I need to make an effort to discuss these topics outside of lecture."
