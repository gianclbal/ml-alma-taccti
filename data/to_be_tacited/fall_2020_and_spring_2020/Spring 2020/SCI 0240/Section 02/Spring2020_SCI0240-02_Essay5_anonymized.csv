2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,638,"To even discuss and define my reasons for selecting and committing to my major, I first must explain what my major is and what it entails. My bachelor of science, biology with a focus in physiology, involves the study of how either human or animal anatomical structures function. There are options to focus in either animal or human physiology and I have chosen to study human body functions so far. ""Why?"", might you ask. The answer is simple and yet complex. I am pursuing a career I medicine and patient care. More specifically, I want to attend a program to be nationally licensed as a physician's assistant also known as a PA in the american medical field. PA's are in high demand with great employment opportunities and employment benefits. As you may have guessed from the job title, physician assistants provide professional assistance to doctors in their respective departments in surgery to medication prescriptions. They work under the authority of a leading physician. It is one big team and I ant to be a part of it. The major I chose will prepare me academically.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,707,"I want to go into Biology because of my parents. A huge thing for me is wanting to give back to them for everything they’ve done for me growing up. I believe if I have the ability to study a rigorous subject and eventually major in this subject, then I will be able to gather the experience and knowledge truly needed to become what I really want to be in life. Which is either a Physical Therapist Doctor for Children or find a place in the Biomedical Engineering area of science in order to help people. Not only do I want to give back to my parents if I find a well-paying job in order to support myself financially and give back, but I want to be able to help other people.            That’s the huge thing I want to do with biology. I’ve always loved helping other people and being there for them, so if I had the ability to become a doctor or an engineer that helps with children or adults, then I would feel joy from doing this. Biology wasn’t my strong suit in high school, but this also pushed me to try harder and approach a difficult topic. I don’t like taking things the easy way; if ever I like to challenge myself and essentially “make myself stressed”. I am not saying that Biology is stressful, although it can be, the ability to solve problems through science and the human body is what keeps me interested and wanting to keep going and stick with this major.             In short however, I want to be there for other people and my family. As a biologist if something happens to someone in my family, depending on what I decide to go into for an occupation, I want to be there and help them and give them advice on what’s better. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,581,"I want to go into my major because I have always had a passion for science, especially involved in human anatomy. Originally, I wanted to go into the emergency medical technician field, but that was not a reasonable choice for my future. I chose biology with a concentration in physiology because I am interested in the build up of the body and how each part of the body works. The human body is so complex and understanding it takes a lot of practice and desire to learn. I plan on using my major to become a physicians assistant and hopefully work in a small office along side a general physician. My grandpa was a physician and I have always had a great admiration for him and his work. He was very much respected in our family and ultimately, I would like to make him and the rest of my family proud of my work. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,708,"I am currently a pre-psychology major but I am still debating on what concentration of biology to switch it to. I am pulling towards biology with a concentration in physiology but going directly into nursing also catches my attention. I am actually still a bit conflicted with what I want to do but I know something in medicine is what I am aiming for. If I base this question going off of what I want to mostly switch to, I would probably pick biology with physiology as my concentration. I want to go into this major because as I mentioned, I want to do something in medicine and that is a good major to get into medical school one day. I want to do biology/physiology because the human body and the way it works has always fascinated me and intrigued me. I want to be able to help people and fight whatever they have going on with their bodies. I also want to be able to perform surgeries as well. My main aspiration in life would be to be an OBGYN because it has always been a dream of mine for quite a few years now. Something that definitely helped me want to become that much more than anticipated would be the fact that I was inside of the room for two births of one of my cousins. Watching her give birth and seeing the way that the doctor handled everything was so amazing to me. I was even more intrigued after that and it made me want to become that one day. This is the main reason why I want to switch my major into something that has to do with biology and the human body. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,545,I'm a pre-biology major right now. Hopefully by next semester I will be  able to declare my major in Biology. I want to pick Biology Cellular and  Molecular. But biology wasn't the first major I pick originally at  first I was a computer science major and in my second year I decided it  wasn't for me so I switched to Biology. The main reason why I wanted to  go into my major because it was my favourite subject in high school and I  was pretty good at it. I was decent enough at it where I would teach  other students about it if they were having more trouble and my biology  teachers like that. I just find my major interesting and there is so  many cool things to learn about and as a plus the major is pretty  flexable because you can do so many careers through it hopefully someday  I will know what I want to do.
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,709,"I want to go into my major biology with a concentration in physiology to help others and to be useful in the medical field. Since I could remember I’ve always had a passion for science, and to be honest besides English it is one of the few subjects that I am good at. I just know that whenever I enter a biology class, I become so intrigued. I also get the urge to do my part to help in the medical field. I want to make important discoveries, and while doing so I also want to save people who desperately need saving. I just know that if I do not want to become a doctor late on as badly as I want to now, my career will still have something to do with medicine. I’ve never really thought of anything else I’d do with my future except either becoming a nurse or doctor."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,706,"My major is general biology, but I am going to change it to a concentration in physiology soon. I want to go into my major because it will help me prepare for medical school. My goal after college is to attend graduate school and study medicine, so that I can have a career as a pediatrician. I feel that being a physiology [biology] major will give me beneficial knowledge and provide me with a good foundation for medical school. Physiology [biology] is a major that I am very passionate about and very committed to. I will be able to learn and study the functions of living organisms and their organs, which is extremely important to know and to understand, if I want to become a doctor. Another reason I want to go into physiology [biology], is that there are very few females in the science or math fields and I say this because most of my college instructors are males. However, I could be wrong. It is the year 2020 and there could have been an increase of women in the science or math fields already. I just probably haven't heard about it or know about the situation. Finally, I have been interested in physiology [biology], since I was about six years old and my first grade teacher read a magic school bus series book about the human body and getting sick. After that book, I knew that I wanted to study and learn more about physiology, specifically human physiology. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,399,"Science and math have always been something I enjoyed learning about, and it is something I’ve experienced with. Since I was young Science is something I barely struggled with. I actually enjoyed asking questions, and learning new things.     My major is under pre-biology right now, but I will be concentrating in Physiology. I want to go into a physiology major because it focouses on parts of the body, and that's something that has always interested me. In addition, I plan to go to medical school, and as I’ve done my research Physiology prepares you for it. Lastly, I want to become an Ophthalmologist, and in order to reach my career goal I have to major in science. Getting a physiology major will be benefitial because out of college there would be jobs out there that require a science major, such as becoming a researcher, working in laboratories, hospitals, etc."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,609,"I want to go to my Cell and Molecular Biology major because I wasn’t to go into research. There isn’t a specific topic I’m passionate about, but I am highly motivated to be put in a position where I can help give back to my community in some form. Currently I’m in Nicole Adelstein’s research lab(chemistry) where we work on battery research to find more energy efficient lithium batteries. I was originally an environmental science major because climate change is a problem I’d like to help play a role in fixing(since it will require huge amounts of efforts from many people) and being part of a research lab to find more eco friendly forms of energy is rewarding. I want to follow that rewarding feeling and I’ll take up on any opportunities that let me work on current issues. Luckily, being a funded researcher, I can prepare for a PhD in the stem field, probably something in the BioChem field."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,712,"I want to go into my major to be a Forensic Medical Examinar. The thing that has led me to this decision is that since i was little I have always like things that had to do with solving crime and I am really into science. Well something that can let me do both is a forensic medical examiner in which I can be helping solving the death of someone and still be in a science field. It has always been tough because my family has always been about medical field and well I always thought that just meant being a doctor but now that I have done my research I can say there are more than just doctors and nurses in the medical field. It was something that I needed to figure out on my own that way I was sure I knew what I wanted to do. Now, I can gladly say that i will be seeking into my major to go into medical school to become a Forensic Medical Examiner."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,710,"I want to go into my major, because it is related and applicable to the career I am pursuing. My major is biology with a concentration in zoology. I chose this pathway, because it offers many classes that I am interested in. The classes are taught by phenomenal professors whose teaching styles are very effective for me and my learning. The professors, as well as everyone in the biology department, are incredibly supportive and resourceful. As a first year student, there are many things that confuse me and that I have questions about. So far, not one professor or lecturer or advisor hasn't been helpful to me. I strongly think that the zoology concentration is the right pathway for me and will be useful to me in the future. The classes that I have to take for the zoology concentration correspond with most of the pre-requisites for veterinary school, and will create a strong basis of knowledge that I can build off of as I study to become a veterinarian."
