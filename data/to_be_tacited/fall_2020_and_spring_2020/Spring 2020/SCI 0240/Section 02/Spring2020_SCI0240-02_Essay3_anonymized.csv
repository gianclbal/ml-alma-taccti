2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,707,"My parents are native to the Philippines but are citizens of the US; my mother went to college in the Philippines, but my father had enlisted in the Navy back in the day. Due to these circumstances, this would consider me a first-generation college student. Then also coming from a Filipino family, it was mostly a given that I was going to work hard to graduate high school and eventually go to college. My parents always pushed me to do well in primary and secondary school up until the point of high school and after; they pushed for me to go to college because they wanted to me to work hard and get a good paying job. Because of this mindset, I had the drive to want to go to college for the experience and for the learning abilities that would bring me closer to the occupation I want in the future. I would say that a lot of my decisions and family values have definitely brought me towards the desires of wanting to do well and go above and beyond with my education. When you’re surrounded by other nurses, doctors, college graduates or personally, in general, surrounded by family that has high expectations because they come from lower educational experiences and such; it all adds up when it comes to doing well in school. Like at family parties, there’s times where I would constantly hear “Do you have all A’s?”, “How are you in school?”, “Are you valedictorian?”, “Make sure you study hard, your cousin….” My family would rant about other cousins in attempts to get us to try harder and compare all the time. So, it pushes my drive to do better than them and to achieve something higher or equivalent, I'm not going to lie, sometimes it is a lot of pressure when I find out I didn't do so well on an exam or quiz because that's where the points add up, although I want to dig myself into a hole and cry, I always climb out of the hole and put a brave face on and realize that this isn't the end and that I know I am only capable of so much; this all in conclusion pushes my drives to be better in school and to try and reach the expectations of myself and my family around me. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,609,"Being a minority first generation college student, I must constantly remind myself that I am able to navigate through college. I am a Mexican with Aztec roots, math and science runs in my blood. Knowing that I come from an incredibly intelligent lineage, I remind myself that if my ancestors could do it then so can I. My dad was valedictorian of his graduating class at his private school in Mexico, he was always a giant math and science fan. I remember the respect he held for our Aztec ancestors, always emphasizing their talent in math. I’d like to think this is where I was inspired to pursue science since my dad make me feel like it was a doable goal due to our lineage. I believe that my honor and respect of my ancestors is a huge factor on my academic performance confidence. If I didn’t have that kind of encouragement, my anxiety would have been too overwhelming for me to get out of my comfort zone and navigate through college."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,545,My community and family don’t really help me too much navigate through college too much. But what I guess what helps me get through the hard times in college is thinking how much money my parents are wasting for me to be able to be here. Failing means wasted money. I would have to take the class over again. And just giving up college for the whole year would be expensive for my parents and they would get really mad at me. So just the thought of failing classes isn’t an option (at least willingly and giving up). I have to try my hardest to pass. That’s what my parents always tell me when I talk about my classes and I’m worried about failing them.
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,581,"My family values have helped guide me through college by teaching me to be strong and push through each and every challenge that crosses my path. A lot of my family went to college but majored in things other than what I am studying. My family looks at the topics I cover in class and gets too overwhelmed. She tells me to keep pushing, but “she could never do” what I am doing. My family supports me, but they support from a distance. They just tell me to do my best. Because my family either did not go to college or studied something unrelated to what I am learning in college, they do not really understand it and kind of avoid talking about it. It is always “just do your best”, but I guess that’s some pretty solid support. My grandma always wanted me to go to college and I feel like I am doing this for her and I. She and my great grandpa always had a goal for me to become a doctor and like a rebellious kid, I said I never wanted to be one. After going to college for a few years, I realized how interested I was in the human body and its functions. They were the beginning point of my values and taught me to push myself as a child which carries me through life."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,712,If I am to be completely honest my family has not helped me make a path in the decision I chose to make when it comes to college. Well actually they don’t want me to do what I want to do most because it is “dangerous.” I guess the one thing I can say is that having to be able to find that backbone support from someone who believes in you is hard. I recently found that person my first semester of college and I decided myself to stay in my major and look into forensic science careers. Although my family may not think I can do it because the career I am looking into requires me to need to go to medical school and well so far the two older kids have basically not went and decided to switch their paths last minute.. well they think I will do the same. Which i do not find fair to let the actions of my older siblings be reflected onto what I want to do. Thanks to the person that has been supporting me.. they have been there to help lead me in my tough times and they don’t give up on me. So in the end I view that it doesn’t have to be family that helps mold you through your college path but rather just having someone as that backbone is all you need. In the end you’ll be doing what you love.
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,706,"The main values of my family that have helped me navigate through college are respect, work hard, try your best, and have good moral ethics. College is challenging and very stressful, since we are all trying to earn our degrees and graduate in four years. The work load, new independent adult lifestyle, and different school structure can be extremely overwhelming, especially for a first year college student, like myself. My parents have always told me to work hard and try my best in school. They tell me if I don't understand something, then ask for help and not asking for help means I didn't work hard enough. Although my family places a high importance on performing well in academics, they also emphasis the importance of respect and having good morals. In college, you meet new people all the time. Most of the time, you have to work with people who are not your close friends and it can be difficult. My parents taught me to treat everyone I know or meet with respect if I want to be respected in return and to be a person with good morals, which means being honest and knowing what is right and what is wrong. I feel that I am an honest, respectful, and hard working student and that college has been good so far for me, but who knows, it is only the second semester of my first year in college. Things could change."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,708,"The values of my community and my family have helped me navigate through college as they inspire me each and everyday. My community is full of loving, generous, genuine and successful people who I can definitely aspire to be like. The support I have received from my high school, church, and other places in my community is so amazing and inspiring. My community truly is one of a kind as its people roots for each other in every way possible and inspire the new generations to want to be something great in life. They always ask about how college is going and make sure to congratulate me in every victory, even one as small as an A on a quiz so it truly is amazing to me. My family's support on the other hand is incomparable as I truly feel loved and supported. Every single thing that I bring to their attention, good or bad, they always reassure me that everything will fall into place as long as I stay focused and determined on what I really want in life. They remind me that it is up to me to make something out of myself and I truly cannot explain how much their motivating words have helped me navigate through my first year of college so far and will continue to do so. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,710,"The values of my family and community have helped me navigate college by giving me a sense of direction. Since my childhood, my family has drilled into my head how important education is and how it is morally and ethically right to do good. These values have shaped me into becoming someone who strongly appreciates academics and treats everyone and everything with as much respect and kindness as I possibly can. I always try to do my best in school; my goal in life is to become a veterinarian, so I will absolutely need good grades in order to get into veterinary school. My favorite quote ""No matter what happens in life, be good to people. Being good to people is a wonderful legacy to leave behind"" is by Taylor Swift and is meaningful to me, because it encompasses the ideas of treating others kindly no matter how they treat you or what their/your situation in life is. Nothing bad can come from doing good."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,399,"I come from a low income family, where throughout my years I’ve seen how hard they’ve worked, specifically my mom, to be able to give me and my siblings a stabled life. Seeing her wake up every morning, drop us off with the babysitter, and then going to work, coming tired and exhausted, she would still be there for us by making sure we had finished our homeworks, and cooking for us every single day, no matter how tired she was. My mom has always worked in kitchens where she has to work with precautions because she can get burned. This has helped me navigate through college by pushing myself further, and not giving up. I want to succeed and give my family a better life, since they have taught me to value my education, and see how hard it is to be working at a minimum wage. In addition, all of my mom's hard work made me realize that education can make a big difference in someone’s life by having a stable job, earning enough money to live, without having to suffer."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,638,"Values are important and are the foundation of a person’s identity. Our own personal values guide us through our lives whether they be theological or societal or anything else. My biggest value is education and I treat it as an umbrella term. I do not just refer to an academic environment, but also real-life experience. To educate one’s self, or to learn a new topic, requires discipline and commitment. These attributes go hand-in-hand. I am a big believer that if one sows a true, hardy education, then they will reap the fruit of wisdom. Corny as that might sound, “knowledge is power” is my value. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,2,709,"The values of my family of origin have helped me tremendously in order to navigate through college. From the beginning my mom has always told me to put my education in front of everything. Although temptations and distractions do come up, I just have to remind myself that I’m attending college for a reason and this is all so I could have a great and successful future. I also have to learn how to fend for myself and be independent, which is another thing my mom would constantly remind me of before I moved out. That has definitely become an adjustment and one that I was still trying to get used to, but I’ve found that I do like being on my own for the most part. My family has also always taught me to be myself no matter what. It can be easy to lose yourself in some situations with certain people and I have learned that the hard way. But by now taking my family’s wise words and advice into more consideration, I’m beginning to like the way I am and the people I’ve surrounded myself with."
