2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,703,"After thinking about what I do I do when life gets hard, I realized that I do the same thing to get over it. Some things that I do in the moment is stress about everything. I feel like everything falls onto me at the worst possible times. The first thing that I do is keep it to myself. I am not really the person to talk about what I am going through unless it’s something I really need help with. Next is that I pray to God for help to get my mind off things. With that always come up with a plan to figure my things out. This mainly happens at night when I feel like I didn’t do anything during the day. One thing that does help is to ease my mind and rest so I can be ready to conquer thing the next day. Other things that I do is vent to my mom so she can help me and give me advice on what ever the thing is that I am going through.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,702,"I take a whole range of approaches to handling life when it gets hard. Sometimes I’ll kick it with my girlfriend because she always gets me in a good mood. Other times I call my boys and we make 5 packs of backwoods and 5ths of Hennessy disappear. Or maybe I’ll treat myself to my favorite torta spot down the street from my house (boos voni).All these methods have in common the theme that they are all things that make me happy or relaxed. Everyone needs some nice rest and relaxation in their lives. I think the reason we get stressed in life is because we’re spending too much time doing things that the world expects of us, and not enough time doing what we really want to do. Every now and then I’ll go take a walk in nature or something like that and it actually makes a big difference in the way I’m feeling if I’ve been stressed. Nature is very therapeutic. One day I’ll build a cabin in the woods, and that will be my little retreat when I get tired of the city world.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,698,"Life is interesting honestly. It has its ups and its downs for a majority of our lives we live in the down portion. So, what do I do when life get challenging…? I rely on my support system to distract me. My family is everything and I always go home every weekend in order to keep our connection strong and to stay in their lives. They truly are my everything because when I am down they help cheer me up and when I am happy they definitely know how to keep my mood that way. Another thing I do when life gets challenging is see all the possible ways I can help succeed in whatever situation I am in. Really evaluate every aspect of the situation. This can be by seeing how life got so hard in the first place and seeing how in the future I can avoid this struggle again. Also, understanding that it is okay to struggle because no one’s life is perfect and I think the sooner we realize it the easier life gets. Everything will end up okay and we will see the end of this tunnel and to continue to look for the positive side of things. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,338,"When life gets tough I try my best to think positively. During tough times, I also lean on the things that encourage my self-wellness and self-care. Things that I engage in self-care are; eating well, sleeping 8 hours a night, working-out and having quality time with myself. Some things that also make me feel better are going on a hike, watching a movie or my favorite show on netflix, and doing something new and exciting. Some other things that help foster my wellness are spending time with my support system; friends, partner and my great aunt. Additionally, one big outlet of support is the student organization that I have been a part of for the past 4 years; Clinica Martin Baro. I have grown close and meaningful relationships with many if not all of the volunteers. They have helped shape the woman that I am today and continue to be one of my greatest support systems. "

2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,704,"Reflection Journal #2 When life gets challenging, I isolate myself. I isolate myself from my friends. This gives me time to manage my time wisely and find ways to cope with my stress. I grew up seeing the women in my family undergo  tons of challenges, and I was fascinated how strong and powerful a woman could be. This encourages me not to give up so easily. Isolating myself makes me get my head right. When life is challenging, I listen to music often, to have other people avoid talking to me. When life gets challenging, I frequently have less energy, and push myself to be active. There are many ways to handle things when life gets challenging. Life is not easy, and everyone will go through challenges. Not to be religious, but I always thought that God would not give you these challenges if he did not believe you could overcome them. Things happen for a reason and eventually it will start to make sense the older we get."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,333,"I usually get help from my peers around me. I try to get help from them first because they can give me advice without judging me and they don't know my life so in depthly. I try to ask for help in school when I need it like tutoring, and when I don't get certain things. Also, I cannot go home and ask for help because I am a first generation college student and there is no one at home who could help me specially because I am a STEM major. So whatever has to do with school I usually have to ask and get it done in school because once I get home, if it has to do with homework or something I can't find on YouTube I cannot solve it. However, my family helps me a Lot by supporting my dreams and hopes. They help me with giving me encouraging words and telling me to move forward. Also, I have found that just taking a break helps me refocus on what I need in life and what is challenging me. However, I like to be challenged because it keeps me on my toes and always moving forward to something different."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,700,When life gets challenging I like to take a breath from everything that I am doing to calm my body down. I like to meditate and listen to calming music so that I can feel more calm and relaxed. I also like to go to the gym to workout because it helps me to physically relax my body at the same time getting physically stronger and and gain more self confidence that obviously makes me feel better about life and myself in general. Sometimes when life gets challenging I also like to cry it out and just lay by myself to let all the sadness and frustration out. I also like to see what is challenging and get other things out the way so that I can address whatever issues are really challenging. I like to eat so when life gets challenging I like to eat a small snack that makes me feel better at least for a little bit.
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,75,"When I face changes, I like to step away from the problem and try to do something that makes me happy. When I feel stressed from school, I take a break to dance and sing. I like to watch movies, and videos to relax my brain. I like to talk with my family and friends. I tend to stress eat a lot of snacks and junk foods. Therefore, I like to eat delicious food when I feel stressed. When life gets hard, I tend to keep it myself and I keep encouraging myself to achieve the hardship. I am a very hard worker but also, I am very easy to give up. I encourage myself to be a better self to achieve my goal and the challenge. I like to get help from my family and friends who had the same struggles. I also like to push me to solve the problem."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,701,"When life gets too challenging for me,  I am quick too react with intense emotion. I have  struggled with being someone who is extremely emotional, although once I’m over the intense emotion, I’m ready to face my challenges. I remind myself that I am capable, that i have made it this far in life and shouldn’t give up so soon. I remind myself that life is meant to be challenging. Without a challenge, life would have less meaning. I have faced many challenges so far in life, from being a Latina woman in the science community, to being held against the stigmas  behind self medicating with marijuana. Many people in the science community have doubted my capabilities due to being a woman and an avid smoker. I’ve been told that me being Latina is the true indicator of why I made it this far or if I make it to med school. It’s always been difficult to swallow what others may think of me based off of my skin or what I do on my spare time.There are a handful of people; colleagues, mentors, family, and friends, who remind me of what I am capable of. Many Latina female mentors in the science community, and colleagues of mine who I’ve seen accomplish their goals. These are the people who’s support and genuine thought on how to approach life when things get challenging, have been the reason for my dedication to pushing forward. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,699,"What I do when life gets challenging is I like to take a day to myself and reflect on my well being. Then I start to plan how I am going to get my thing together so I won't be as stressed anymore. I tend to write down which assignments are due first or what should get done as soon as possible then plan out the time and days that I could work on it. I have a support system of friends who I can ask for advice or even I doubt myself on what assignment is more important but they help get me back to the ground. I do let some of that stress out in some ways of tears, silence and music but life isn't life if there's no struggles or obstacles occurring. From these events, you are able to see what you are capable of and know your own strength as you are learning from them as well. These challenges are reminders for myself and I have to set them out on a calendar and ask for help when I really need it."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,697,"Life is always challenging for me… I have to balance everything in my life if not everything will collapse on me. Right now, I’m dealing with a lot of family issues as well as my own. My mental health is not the greatest but I’m striving to improve it day by day… so what do I do? I usually like to take a break from everything for maybe a few hours or just 1 day in general. I like to go exercise, paint, listen to music, and pretty much self care. I feel like that’s very important to me and it doesn’t matter what day of the week it is. I’ve done it on a school day and I’ve told my instructors about it and they get very supportive but some get upset.. can't really do anything about it… As long as I get the break I need, I will keep going even though life gets challenging."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,584,"When life gets challenging I begin to have a million thoughts running through my head. I then begin to freak out, and panic. However, over the years I've learned to deal with such afflictions. I first get something to eat and relax for about thirty minutes. Then, I start to make a list of what needs to be done, what I need to learn/overcome and then make a plan to accomplish the task. To accomplish the task I either communicate with my professor for clarification, use tutoring services, or contact a peer. Then when I have all the materials I need at my disposal I begin to work undisturbed until the task is complete. Should challenges still persist, then I go for a one on one session with a tutor or professor. Or I contact a SCI 240 professor for advice. Every semester I always try to have as many resources available, so that challenges become minor obstacles instead of problems. Thus reducing my level of stress/anxiety. I also talk with several other resources like my professor for physics to work out a plan if my original study plan is not working. For example, I was faced with the challenge of having my SCI 240 course not correlated with my instructors lesson plan. It was difficult, and currently I am working on a study plan with my SCI 240 facilitators to remedy any inconsistencies in my understanding of the material. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,705,When life gets hard I usually remind myself not to overreact and if that doesn't work I usually relieve stress by running or going to the gym. I have had it easy for a couple of years but when I was in my early twenties I had alot of stress and running helped me get through it. When school gets hard I usually try to do my best and not rush or stress over an assignment or test. I think getting sleep instead of staying up all night is usually better than stressing and staying up all night trying to do homework or study for a test. I found that being a mechanic was stressful when my coworkers were not being helpful or tried to mess with me since we had the same pay and I had a lot less experience but I rarely let it bother me and also found that running and exercising helped me get the job done with little stress. I dont work not and so school isn't usually hard for me but it is sometimes hard to focus on long lectures.
