2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,333,"I feel like in Sci we talked about the possibility of being in quarantine a couple of weeks ago and in this sci class we received the text that classes were cancelled. This was a very important topic to talk about as well because we were so uncertain of what was going to happen, we didn't think things were going to get this out of hand. I remember talking to a few of my professors who hadn't thought about a plan for the class just in case something like this did happen. I think it was very important and wise of the instructors to talk to us about the possibility, they even helped us install zoom which I didn't know how to use. Them doing that has helped me in my other courses because they're all via zoom. I know how to navigate through it because of them, since we had some time to download it into our devices during class. Another thing that I think was helpful to cover during class even though at the moment it may have seemed like we were ahead but little did we know it would help us right now, the phylogenetic trees and writing out the developed characteristics during time was so helpful in the exam because we had already done it and knew how to organize them helped me a lot. Going into the topics a bit further has also helped me like the algae knowing the pigments and how they came to be was helpful. I think with this class one thing i'm mostly thankful for is how in depth and how things are reexplained and broken down for us. The worksheets and the reviewing the lecture are so helpful. I don't know where all this knowledge about plants and algae will be useful but for now every time I see plants that I recognise I name them, that's kind of cool. I' super excited for this animal chapter. Although it is a bit more difficult to learn this way, the professors and sci instructors are putting in. effort to help as much as they can."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,697,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college because it serves as a reminder and motivation to do good in school. Their support towards my education is a big important part of how I am able to navigate through college also. If I didn't have what they have taught me or given me, I probably would of been struggling. Good family values like hard work, respect, compassion, responsibility, creativity, and etc... with a good support system is key to succeed in school and in future career(s). "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,703,"The values of my family helped me navigate through college in lots of ways. for starters, I'm grateful that my parents showed me how to work hard at a young age so I would know what it's like to earn something that you worked hard for. second I'm taking advantage where I'm in a position where I can actually go to college instead of working to live. My parents weren't able to go to college so seeing how they grew up and be where they now motivate me to earn a college degree. Lastly, my community also motivates me because where I live it's not the most developed in terms of work-wise so after college we plan to move from where we live and continue to move forward our lives. there are other values that helped me navigate to college but these are the main ones."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,699,"The values of my family, have helped in keeping a routine, encouraging practices and new hobbies to reduce stress or lack of actions. As my parents really value sleep, such as going to sleep early to keep that schedule set and exercise. It has not really helped so much now that I feel like I am drifting away, I messed up my sleeping schedule and I am over-eating due to stress from planning future semesters. However, I have still been able to get my work done even if its started last minute. Overall, I have been less self-critical which has helped me learn to accept certain things and move so I don't have to put so much weight into something that doesn't need my time or energy. I developed a better sense of priorities and I hope to keep this for the future. As well as my sleeping schedule because rest is important and I can have more time throughout the day to actually get stuff done."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,584,"The values of my community/family have helped navigate college by instilling within me the desire to first want a degree. They helped me realize the importance of hard work and utilizing the resources and opportunities that are available. It isn't enough to work hard, a person must be able to work smart by maintain good time management skills. Of which, I am not exactly the greatest. I still struggle with time management. But it is something that I am working on, and will continue to work on. Physics, Science, and Chemistry, I find these subjects to be a very labor intensive process. In order to do well, I have to put in the time to carefully understand the material. Currently I am working on doing just that. Other than teaching me the value of hard work, I fin that my family hasn’t helped me in navigating through college, because at the end of the day, college is both a social and solitary experience. Social in the sense we are communicating with professors and fellow peers to a certain extent, however it is very solitary in the sense that I’ve found necessary information isn’t really presented to students in the right way. Just last semester learned that we have certain services available to us students. This includes but is not limited to, the students association, carp/lac tutoring, a school provided therapist. All these resources are not widely shared, and I feel like college is more of getting to know your institution first and how everything works before any real academics can start. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,704,"Reflection #4 Currently, I am struggling with Organic Chemistry. Ever since this outbreak, I have been having difficulty studying for my classes at home. Online classes require more self-discipline. Organic chemistry is another whole language. I am trying to get used to how to visualize the organic molecules in 3D, once I can visualize this, I will start to understand more. Also, I need to study more on resonance structures and acid-base chemistry. I must memorize so much to fully understand organic chemistry, luckily, chemistry is my favorite subject!  I love learning about living things, such as my class Biology 240. Biology 240 showed me that there are worlds within worlds! Although there are interesting topics to learn, I do struggle with memorizing. Memorizing is important for Biology, especially if you are trying to pass the class! In the past, memorizing used to be easy. I need to watch some techniques to better my memorization skills. I have made flashcards, wrote out vocabulary and definitions, and taught a fellow colleague about specific processes to memorize better. These two topics are my main classes for this semester, and I do not want to fail. I would be disappointed in myself if I failed these classes due to the pandemic."

2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,702,"My upbringing and the people in my family had a huge impact on my academic career in general, because they always supported me in any way they could with my schoolwork. My mom was especially instrumental. She's an English professor at CCSF, and I can remember as a kid she would always bring us to the library. Me and my sister would get a fat stack of like 8-10 books and finish them all in a couple weeks. All that reading really helped to develop my creativity and language skills, and that has been proven to be extremely useful in academics and in my everyday life. My writing skills got me the scholarships which allow me to attend this school."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,698,"Through college, you really get to explore other people’s values and try to respect everyone. You also do not want to lose your own values. The values of my family have really helped me, preserver, through the hard times. They have a big motto of “everything happens for a reason and God has a plan for you.” I think this really helped when I was not able to get the courses I wanted and which in turn pushed me back a year. I was very upset and mad at the world but with those values and words of wisdom, I was able to really center myself and let things be. Now, this semester I got those specific courses and I have been acing all of the test with solid “A’s”, which is something I don’t think I would have been able to do if I had taken it this past semester. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,701,"I have learned a lot from from community and family. Both have served me great valuable lessons to learn in life and to get through college. The benefit of having both my community and family to help me navigate through college is that these shared experiences on how to avoid stress. In the stem community, many students experience high stress because of the constant reminder of ""competition"" or support competitiveness amongst students. This has been something I have struggled with, for I start to become doubtful of my capabilities in higher up stem courses. I never thought I would make it to organic chemistry, nor biochemistry. Because of certain faculty members in the STEM field, they gave me wonderful advice. They were understanding and gave me a sense of direction for pre med. As for family, my father is not supportive of my dream of becoming a psychiatrist. He doesnt believe that I am smart enough to accomplish my goals. My mother and sister have been supportive and believe that I can some day become that. Although they can not provide me with outside resources or lead me in the right direction for med school because they never have pursued it themselves. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,705,The only member in my direct family that has graduated from college is my sister and so I don't come from a very educated family. My family is also not very supportive of me going to college. My family hasn't told me to drop out but they always suggest that I keep working as a mechanic since the pay is decent or they bring up other job fields like becoming a firefight and tell me that school is hard. Sometimes I wish they were more supportive but I know that I am smart and that if I apply myself I can be successful in college. I haven't been doing great but I usually know what I need to study and just don't sit down and study what I end up missing on a test and so that gives me confidence that if I want a degree I can earn one. I think my friends are pretty supportive of me getting an education and I think they know me better than my family which makes me value their opinion more than my families. Although all my friends have dropped out of college I still try to support them as well.
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,338,"I am proud to come from a line of very strong and resilient family. My grandparents migrated from El Salvador and Honduras during the 60's. When my grandmother on my moms side migrated to this country she worked as a seamstress and was paid 0.35 cents an hour and did not speak any English; however, she managed to collect the little money she made and send her 2 daughters to private school in the city. With this leverage, my mom was able to be the first in our family to obtain higher levels of education and ultimately become a Doctor. However, my mother faced many challenges being first gen and growing up in poverty. She was also a single-mother in medical school with a one year old and it was extremely challenging for our family. With this in mind, my great aunt was my primary care giver for many years and I attribute the love and sacrifice of my entire family unit to be able to be in my current Master's program today. I think of the their challenges and my challenges collectively whenever I feel self doubt. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,75,"The values of my community and family have helped me throughout college due to the support they have provided for me since the first day I started freshman semester. I would say that community has been a lot more potent compared to my family aspect because being the first child to attend a college that isn’t community, it was and still is hard to make them understand the things I do since my two elder sisters never did anything like that, they were never active in extra curriculars so they were only used to a lifestyle of working, and going to school."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,700,"At the beginning it was definitely a huge transition I had to get used to. It was confusing and annoying keeping track of all the emails and assignments that the professors would assign but now I found a way to keep track of it all. Online classes have been interesting. I actually don't mind them because most of my professors are recording their lectures so I go over it during class time and then also go to the recordings in case I missed anything. I like how my professors have been very lenient with due dates especially at the beginning. Although I think they're getting to excited now and assigning so much stuff every week. As for self care, I wake up during my first morning class and have a green juice while I listen to the Zoom lecture and take notes. After my first class is over I take a nap until before my next class. When I wake up from my little nap I brush my teeth, wash my face, eat breakfast then I go on my next Zoom meeting and take notes. Right after that class I get a small snack and I do as much homework as I can and slowly start checking off the assignments I have to do for the week. I do that until there's 45 min. before my next class. I then eat lunch and go onto my third class (if I have my third class that day). Right after that class I do a bit more assignments if I have any and completely shut out school work for the rest of the day. BY the afternoon I work out, shower, eat dinner, then maybe if I'm feeling bougie ill use a facemask and call it a day."
