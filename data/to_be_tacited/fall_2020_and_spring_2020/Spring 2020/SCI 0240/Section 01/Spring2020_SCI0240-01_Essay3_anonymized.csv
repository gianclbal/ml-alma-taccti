2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,75,"The online classes are hard to concentrate and hard to follow along. It is hard because we cannot ask a question during the class because my teacher posts videos, not zoom class. One of my lab teachers does not post anything on his lecture on the ilearn. He doesn't reply to our email when we ask questions. Teachers giving more homework and exams became hard because we cannot ask questions during the exam."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,705,Overall I like having all my classes online but they're some downsides. It can be hard to keep up when you are not required to go to class. Even on some of the zoom meeting you can get away with not paying attention or even not being next to your computer. Also since some professors are not good with computers or also let themselves get behind it can make it hard to stay focused as well. For instance my Humanities teacher sometimes post her lecture videos hours past the class time or my math teacher once forgot to send a zoom link. I also don't like how some teachers communicate through ilearn and some communicate through our student email. Personally I am usually self motivated and so I think I will benefit from having online classes and being able to use notes on exams but I'm sure there will be times that I fall behind. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,338,"My online classes have been ok. At first, it took me a while to get used to how to navigate my classes online. I also feel my instructors felt the same. There was a lot of troubleshooting in the beginning. I am still having difficulties with understanding where exactly we are supposed to be up to in terms of content with all my classes but hopefully that gets cleared up. Additionally, since I have to take some responsibility and since I am not expected to wake up at 8:00 am anymore and things are done on my own time and I don’t have as much time to go over the lecture like I was used to."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,702,"First of all, this is a really good prompt. Shout-out to whoever made it.I've been having a very mixed experience with online classes, and it's definitely made me reflect and appreciate the in person classes that we usually have. It's definitely not the same, and even though it's easier to do well on exams and assignments, it's not as fulfilling as the real thing. It kind of feels like it's summer or something, like were not in school anymore but we are. I've keep forgetting what day it is and what assignments I have due. Just generally been really distracted. I've been trying to spend time with my family for self care, since our personal connections are the most valuable asset we'll ever have. Been focusing on my finances as well which is essential to my well being. Trying to ensure my family can escape this mess unharmed.I think I'll end up doing well this semester, which is reassuring because I need the grades to maintain my scholarships. At the end of the day, I know everything's gonna be OK. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,697,"Online classes have made a huge impact in my learning because I’m not used to doing online classes. I’m actually very terrible at it. Sometimes it’s easy for me to navigate through the material but sometimes it’s very hard. Something that is highly affecting me is that I’m a visual and one on one learner. Some of my teachers are not using zoom or are unable to show us all the material. That makes it very difficult. Also, since I’m at home, there are many distractions and I can’t focus entirely on my learning. My parents think I’m on vacation and I’m not lol. But online classes have helped my sleeping schedule. I’m able to rest more… so it’s not that bad haha."

2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,704,"Estrella Allen  Week 3 Reflection The difficulties that my Family has gone through motivates me to dream big. My ambition comes from them. They gave me ambition and made me dream high. I want to be a neuropsychiatrist. I grew up witnessing my grandmother and mother work hard for money and to support us. I know what hard work is because of them. If I had not experienced struggles in my childhood, my work ethic could have possibly been weak. I grew up not having male role models, and this made me believe that women are strong as ever. Give a woman a house, she will make it a home. The stress and struggles I witnessed ty family undergo encourages me to try not be weak and put in effort. I do get tired, and I need to focus on my health, but sometimes it makes me feel bad if I do give up. If I give up, I gave up on them. It is unacceptable to not give my all. It would be disrespectful to them for not giving my all to these opportunities given to me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,701,"Since online classes have started, it was very difficult to adjust to the new learning experience. It has been difficult for not only the students but professors as well. For example, professors adjusting to online exams, quizzes, and responding to many emails in regards to updates. Many professors were not prepared for something such as this, and as a response, they have been a bit lenient as far as due dates. This is only so if many students email with the same concern about a date being pushed due to some not having available/reliable internet/Wi-Fi. For example, when the school notified students that it was closing due to the pandemic, I was placed in emergency housing, without internet. I had the library as a resource although it also closed, making things more difficult for me in terms of school work. I now live in a place with somewhat reliable internet. In terms of well being, I oil paint. I also love to roller skate when the weather is nice. Its a great was to relieve stress and cabin fever. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,333,"My values of my family have helped me greatly because they have taught me how to be hardworking and always fight for what I want. Since I was little I have always liked a challenge and my parents, family and teachers knew that. I always knew that I would have to work a bit harder than most people because I was a woman of color and I wasn't from a rich family that could pay me school and private tutors. When I would. get home I couldn't get help from my parents on my homework because they couldn't. Thus, had to ask all my questions at school and finish most of my work at school. However, just because my parents couldn't help me physically they've always helped me emotionally and encouraged me to keep going. I hope that the values my parents have given me will help me in the future but as of now, because of that I want to help others and give back to my community and my people ."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,584,"The values of my community/family have helped navigate college by instilling within me the desire to first want a degree. They helped me realize the importance of hard work and utilizing the resources and opportunities that are available. It isn't enough to work hard, a person must be able to work smart by maintain good time management skills. Of which, I am not exactly the greatest. I still struggle with time management. But it is something that I am working on, and will continue to work on. Physics, Science, and Chemistry, I find these subjects to be a very labor intensive process. In order to do well, I have to put in the time to carefully understand the material. Currently I am working on doing just that. Other than teaching me the value of hard work, I fin that my family hasn’t helped me in navigating through college, because at the end of the day, college is both a social and solitary experience. Social in the sense we are communicating with professors and fellow peers to a certain extent, however it is very solitary in the sense that I’ve found necessary information isn’t really presented to students in the right way. Just last semester learned that we have certain services available to us students. This includes but is not limited to, the students association, carp/lac tutoring, a school provided therapist. All these resources are not widely shared, and I feel like college is more of getting to know your institution first and how everything works before any real academics can start. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,700,"At the beginning it was definitely a huge transition I had to get used to. It was confusing and annoying keeping track of all the emails and assignments that the professors would assign but now I found a way to keep track of it all. Online classes have been interesting. I actually don't mind them because most of my professors are recording their lectures so I go over it during class time and then also go to the recordings in case I missed anything. I like how my professors have been very lenient with due dates especially at the beginning. Although I think they're getting to excited now and assigning so much stuff every week. As for self care, I wake up during my first morning class and have a green juice while I listen to the Zoom lecture and take notes. After my first class is over I take a nap until before my next class. When I wake up from my little nap I brush my teeth, wash my face, eat breakfast then I go on my next Zoom meeting and take notes. Right after that class I get a small snack and I do as much homework as I can and slowly start checking off the assignments I have to do for the week. I do that until there's 45 min. before my next class. I then eat lunch and go onto my third class (if I have my third class that day). Right after that class I do a bit more assignments if I have any and completely shut out school work for the rest of the day. BY the afternoon I work out, shower, eat dinner, then maybe if I'm feeling bougie ill use a facemask and call it a day. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,703,Online classes have impacted my learning in many ways. To start off lots of things have changed because of all of this going on. I feel like I have been more free to do my work. I see this as a good and bad thing. Tho. It’s good because I have more time to focus on one material. But its also bad because I have been lazy on doing my work. Another thing I that I focus more time to one class rather than being rushed to my classes on campus. So yeah its good but I’m trying to figure a good work balance while being home. And for self care I’ve just been chillin at home and taking time to myself and not taking bad energy from people. I’ve also been overthinking/taking time to reflect on myself. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,698,"I never have learned my science classes online for the specific reason that it would be more difficult. I think switching to all online has been less scary than I thought. As long as I am able to understand professors zoom lectures and stay on top of things, it's pretty much the same. I do think it's annoying when I notice professors expecting more than what they usually do in class. For self-care I have been exercising on the days I do not have classes. Since it is starting to get sunnier I have been able to sit outside in the sun and meditate. This has really helped with my focus! I am concerned that with staying at home I will become depressed honestly. Staying at home isn't fun and I really am craving to go out. I do usually try to keep busy so that I would think about how bored or lonely I am so that helps."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,699,"I feel like it's not the same, I feel more pressure to learn the material more on my own than having it lectured to me in person. But what I am doing for self-care is sleeping early for the first time this school year as I don't have to work on my homework after work. I try to get ready early in the morning so I feel more productive and I have been trying to work out more as I now have a little time for that. I am able to do my work more early on and before deadlines now so that's a huge improvement from going to school physically. I just feel like in lab, I would learn less as we are just going to be based on presentations. It's more challenging on trying to balance more work load than the usual, especially on with 17 units. "
