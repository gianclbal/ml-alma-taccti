2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,338,"Currently obtaining my master's in cell and molecular biology and applying to MD/PhD programs is rooted in community advocacy. I am a 2nd generation Latinx college student that grew up in the Mission District of San Francisco. The Mission District has historically been immigrant and working class community that has faced a number of disparities. These disparities have many societal and structural injustices at its core and I want to continue to explore them on a cell and molecular level as a researcher but also provide patient care as a physician. With this in mind, this is the key to my career aspirations.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,700,"The reason why I want to go into my major is because I enjoy learning about the nature and science of things. I mean everything is so complex and we are unable  to fully understand why organisms do a certain thing a certain way. I love biology and my favorite thing about it is learning about the human body. I want to have a concentration in physiology because it means that I get to have a bigger focus on the human body and how it functions. I also want to go into that major because I want to be a physician assistant in the future and it requires a lot of scientific knowledge and I want to have an insight of what that may look like. I think science is involved in almost everything we do and it would be nice to actually understand why our body works the way it does. For example, I learned about how diabetes affects our body at a cellular level and I actually understand it now. My grandma has diabetes and I was able to explain to her why she needs to take care of herself and what happens if she doesn’t . I just think it's an amazing major. "

2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,704,"Reflection 5 My major is biochemistry. I have always been fascinated with biomolecules. Biochemistry is used all the time, such as medicine. The biological processes that a human has can be explained because of biochemistry. I also picked this major because I want to prepare myself for the MCAT and attend medicine school. The MCAT covers sections such as critical thinking, physical and chemical biological topics of the human system, etc.  Biochemistry touches these topics. Majoring in Biochemistry does not mean a person will do great on the MCAT, a person who is majoring in art can score high on the test. I just love biochemistry and I rather prepare for the MCAT with an awesome major. Biochemistry requires a lot of units, and is a bit difficult, but soon I will graduate and be proud of myself. Once I graduate, my goal is to live in Peru with my family and study the MCAT till I am fluent in Spanish!"
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,705,I want to go into Zoology to get into veterinarian medicine. I want to get into veterinarian medicine because I enjoy biology and have always enjoyed going out side finding and some time catching all sorts of animals. I don't think I am doing to bad especially with this semester bringing up our grades with access to our notes and slides on the tests. I do need to put more time into my studies and get the highest gpa I can get. Right now my hardest subject is calculus but I think I am starting to understand it. It is hard for me to focus because I know a lot of what pre-calculus is teaching will be forgotten. I tried skipping pre-calculus but I had no idea what the professor was talking about in calculus. I also want to get into medicine so that I can make a good living and not have to do hard manual labor. I have a lot of family members that are doing well but after even fifteen or twenty years of mechanic or factory work pro to management have a lot of body aches. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,701,"I am here because I care about my education and supporting my family back home. A majority of my immediate family have struggled with mental illness and ever since it has played a huge role in my life. Not only do I want to understand the reason; chemistry, biology, physiology, etc., behind these issues but provide adequate assistance with this knowledge in my future career. My goal is to peruse  pediatric psychiatrist as a private practice. I would hope to learn about mental illness and destigmatize those who are victims of stereotypes. An event that set this goal into action was my mother attempting to attempt suicide by over dosing on painkillers. I watched her spiral into a vicious cycle of depression and anxiety. If it weren’t for my older sister, my mother would have been admitted in the psychiatric ward for further assessment. There is nothing more I want to do but become a psychiatrist and help those in need of mental help. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,697,"When I started college, I decided that I wanted to focus on studying to become a physical therapist. I’ve had past experience with physical therapy. I played soccer throughout my four years of high school and I had some injuries and as a result, I needed therapy for my back. Because of those experiences, it triggered my interest and passion in the physical therapy career field. I want to be able to help people that have been injured through the use of sports or other physical activities. That's why I want to go into my major. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,698,"I like this question because very often we are always mindful on a day to day bases as to why we want to do the things we want to do. I want to go into Biology because science is cool. I think it is so interesting to learn about ourselves and how the world works around us. More directly talking about my major, which is Biology with a concentration in physiology. I thrive to help people. I want to be able to figure things out in my head and rule out options. The more I know about human anatomy the more I will be able to understand how our body works. I don't think there is a cooler major because why wouldn't you want to learn about how your body functions. Why would you want to learn scientifically about yourself? I think that point alone is a very interesting aspect when looking into my major. This major then will help me continue to go to school for Physician Assistant and hopefully become one so that I can help people. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,584,"The reason I wanted to go into my major was to gain a better understanding of what it is I was missing. I originally entered SFSU and finished my political science major and realized why not try a different major. In high school, I found myself to be traumatized by the field of science, and thought that anyone who did well was just naturally gifted, and that any amount of work I put in wasn't going to be enough. I remember my Junior Year of high school I was in AP Biology and I was studying harder than I've ever studied. Writing lab reports that I would give to my brother to check to see if it was done correct;y. because he was in college doing the same thing basically. He thought it was perfect, and every time I went to turn something in, I would never score higher than either a C or a D. And I was like, what is this. It basically killed my nascent love for the science very early. After that, I took an aptitude test and found a new love for dissecting mystery novels. It is then I was drawn towards the field of law. It was interesting,because a lot of what made up law was learning how to think, and how to dissect information which I genuinely loved. And to this day I still love that aspect of the field. Once I finished, I thought I would feel something, like a sense of accomplishment. And to some extent I did, but I also felt like my work was not done. That I was only halfway there. So I decided to take a step back to try and figure out what was going on. It is then I realized, yes I am an individual with an array of talents, and interests. But getting involved in political science didn't really give me what I wanted. In all honesty it felt like a glorified history major. A major hindsight, I really didn't care for. It was okay, but not what I was meant to do. The field of law still interests me, but my real love is people, and the desire to help through surgery. Because that was my original love when I was in high school. The reason I didn't major in a science class was because my first experience was traumatic, my brother and friends were always telling me horror stories about their experiences. In a lot of ways I felt like I was running away because I didn't want to fail.After taking a semester and this being my second semester, I understand the fear, but I don't let it get to me that much. Belief in self is one of the things I had to learn, because most of my life has been filled with anxiety and questioning myself to a very destructive degree. This major is a gateway to my overall goal. Medical School. And I just hope to god I can get there. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,75,"I choose Biology concentrated on Physiology because I want to go to a Medical school to become a dermatologist. I want to become a dermatologist because ever since I was young, I loved taking care of my skin and loved searching for new skincare products. During my puberty, I had very severe acne which caused a lot of acne scars. Because of puberty, I started to learn more about skin cares especially Korean skincare products. I started to learn skincare ingredients and techniques. I love giving skincare advice to my friends and my family. I like to read and watch articles about skincare methods, and skin-related diseases. Another reason why I want to become a dermatologist is that my mother had a skin-related disease and she was healed it takes to dermatologists. Skin cancer is dangerous and it caused because of not wearing sunscreen. I want to save many people and help them to leave happy, healthy, and beautiful. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,703,the major i want to go into is biology with the concentration of physiology. i want to go into this major is because i wan to become a doctor and to get into medical school you will need a bio or Chemistry major. biology is a topic that i am into and its interesting to me. i know this major and subject is hard and its going to take a lot of hard work to get this degree but i feel like i can be able to make it. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,702,"The reason I chose to go to college in general and to pursue natural resource management as my major is because I want to make a difference in the world, and I want my career and the time and effort I put into making money to be of benefit to my community and the people around me. I'm planning to specialize in Hydrology when I do my graduate degree, and the reason I chose that specialization is because I think water shortages are going to be one of the biggest problems we face both in the US and abroad. I initially was planning to focus on sustainable agriculture because I have a background in botany and hydroponic systems, but I realized that water management was more important as it's the precursor to being able to develop sustainable agricultural systems. My goal is to be able to support my family and buy my mom a house, but to not lose sight of the things I actually care about and become caught up in the materialistic rat race that the majority of people seem to spend most of their time pursuing. I think working outside in the field will be beneficial to my spiritual health as well, so that's one of the things I look forward to in my chosen field. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,333,"I want to go into my major because I want to represent my people in the STEM filed. I want to go Into the medical field and it has always has been difficult for me and my family to go to the doctor because in times before they didn't speak Spanish and I would go in and translate and if I wasn't there for them they just would go seek medical help even though they needed it. I really want to be that point person for my people, that when they see me in a hospital and that I can speak their language and they can communicate to me their needs and issues, that would be my biggest satisfaction. I want to be that person that I wished my family had and to help my little brothers, cousins and relatives to see my as an example that we can achieve whatever we want as long as we put our mind to it."
