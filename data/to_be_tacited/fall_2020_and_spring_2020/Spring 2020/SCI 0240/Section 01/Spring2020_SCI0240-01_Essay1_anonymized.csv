Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,697,"I took SCI Bio 230 like 2 semesters ago and it was literally great. I passed Bio 230 with a good grade and I want to do it again for Bio 240. So, pretty much the reason I am taking SCI Bio 240 is because it actually improves my learning and helps me understand the concepts of lecture and lab. My instructors have great teaching methods like kahoot, warm ups, worksheets, etc.… that help me remember and practice the material. Plus, it gives me an extra day to I guess “study” the material and ask questions if I have any. I’m not a great person that actually studies so, this class is literally perfect because we go over a lot without doing it all by myself or procrastinating. Another reason I am taking SCI Bio 240 is because it makes me feel good and comfortable. Literally all the students that are enrolled are in the same boat as me. We help and teach each other the material and that’s what I like about it. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,698,"I am here because I want to further my education. I want to be able to continue my passion for learning because I think that it is amazing to have a growth mindset. The ability to always learn more than what you did yesterday amazes me. I do believe knowledge is power and amazing things can be done with the right knowledge. I am here because I want to eventually get to a place where I can help people. I always visited Mexico and would see that when trying to access their form of a hospital or emergency room, it was always a struggle for families. I want to be able to do probono work for families in Mexico, while also being a PA in the US. That is why I am here, and why I want to learn what I can. I know my father didn’t get the opportunity to do so and now I want to be the one to help as much people as I can."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,699,"I am here for, I'm not exactly sure anymore. I feel this way when I have no idea what is going on in my life and I am just left with a bunch of unanswered questions. However, in the beginning of everything, my initial purpose is to follow my dreams. To do what I feel passionate about, no matter what it is, as long as I achieve my higher education. I am here to get my biology degree because I like science. Science that can help other people and prevent things such as cancer or other diseases. I want to my parents to be proud of me and know that their sacrifices didn't go to waste. I am here to set a good example for my siblings because I love them and I want the best for them. I want a better future for myself. To not struggle as much with other things like my parents because I know they also want my life to be like that. The things that my parents lacked when they were growing up, I was able to experience some of them but now I am on I'm on my way to know more. I want to know a lot of things. I want to be educated and know all of the informations, as much as my brain can handle."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,700,I am here this morning because I was very lucky to wake up and start another beautiful day. I have the opportunity to strive to become the best version of myself and to really understand what I could do to be successful. I am here to further expand my education and to get a degree so that I can move onto my life and live a good career. I am here because I have class and because i have a lot of other responsibilities to attend. I am here to study so that I could do well in all my classes and so that I can keep up with any work I have to finish. I am here to make my mother proud and also to be a great example to my siblings and my family in general. I want to make those people that be lived in me proud. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,701,"I am here because I care about my education and supporting my family  back home. A majority of my immediate family have struggled with mental  illness and ever since it has played a huge role in my life. Not only  do I want to understand the reason; chemistry, biology, physiology,  etc., behind these issues but provide adequate assistance with this knowledge in my future career. My goal is to  peruse  pediatric psychiatrist as a private practice. I would hope to  learn about mental illness and destigmatize those who are victims of  stereotypes. An event that set this goal into action was my mother  attempting to attempt suicide by over dosing on painkillers. I watched  her spiral into a vicious cycle of depression and anxiety. If it weren’t  for my older sister, my mother would have been admitted in the  psychiatric ward for further assessment. The reason for why my sister  took responsibility for the care taking of my mother, instead of my  father, was because my father was diagnosed with PTSD and was mentally  abusive.  As a Latino with traditional Latin beliefs, my mother being  mentally sick was a major scare for the family. For they felt remorse,  although didn’t understand that it took time for my mother to recover  mentally. They expected my mother to recover just as fast, or if not quicker than her  physical injuries. But the overdoes was more than just my father and my  mothers lack of desire to keep living.  The breaking point for my mother  was the death of my grandmother. My mother finally snapped and decided  that everything is for nothing. I took care of my mother and realized  how delicate her mind was. I was patient when she was responding slow,  for I knew she was experiencing dissociation. She would sleep in all  day, sometimes forget English and only German. It was as if my mother  had changed forever. I hope that being here, studying hard, going to  school, will allow my to someday provide better care for my mother and  father as well as others who struggle with mental illness. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,75,"The reason why I am here (SCI  240) is that I want to learn or understand the topics of BIOL 240 Lecture and Lab classes. I am taking biology classes because I am majoring in Biology in Physiology as a focus. After attending the San Francisco State University, I will transfer to Medical School because I want to become a dermatologist. I want to transfer to UCSF or the University of Washington as my graduate school. I want to study hard, get a good grade and get in the Medical School that I want to get in. However, most importantly, I want to understand the topics and use them in real life. In SCI 240 class, I want to improve my teamwork skills and communication skill. I want to be a better person than yesterday’s self and improve every day. I want to be a good person, a good student, a good daughter, and a good future doctor.   "
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,584,"Why Am I HereI am here to gain the skills I need to pass the Physics portion of the MCAT and enter Medical School. My goal is to become a surgeon, either Cardio or General Surgery. The reason I desire to go to Medical School is because I feel that it is what I meant to do. It is apart of my identity, and it allows me to connect with a piece the piece of humanity I thought I had once lost. In a lot of ways, I guess, my intentions for wanting to become a surgeon are a little selfish. I desire to help others, because in a way it helps me become a better person. To grow, to feel, to care, be apart of something that is far bigger than myself. Taking this course is a first step to understanding the intricacies of the world we live in, which will help me grow as an individual. I just hope I can pull it off. I also want to get a better educations, get a better job, preferably one with advancement opportunities. I also want a job that I love, and this is a first step in that particular direction. When I do apply for medical school, I also plan to earn an associate’s degree in surgical technology, so that even if I don’t get in, I’ll have something to fall back on, and add to my application for when I reapply."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,338,"I am currently enrolled in SCI 240 section because of my current and future career aspirations. I graduated from San Francisco State with a Bachelor's of Art in Psychology and I am currently in my Master’s program concentrating in Cell and Molecular Biology. With this in mind, I need a number of prerequisites and supplemental courses for my next career goal (obtaining an MD/PhD). I want to get a dual degree because I am constantly inspired to add to the breadth of knowledge in science and also being able to use what is discovered to directly improve patient care. Specifically, I want to ensure my research efforts are directed to improve health and access outcomes for marginalized groups. Most importantly, as part of an underrepresented community I want my patients to feel comfortable by having a provider that gives care that is culturally and linguistically sensitive. Since I did not obtain my undergraduate degree in a STEM I need to take all my prerequisites for medical school in my Master’s program. This includes Biology 240. I am taking this supplementary portion to solidify my knowledge I learn in class and to foster my overall understanding. All things considered, these are all the reasons I am here."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,702,"I’m here for a couple reasons. The first and most important reason is because I needed 1 more unit to make full time status for my scholarships after I dropped my internship class. I realized I don’t have enough time this semester to do an internship because I need to work a lot this semester, and I’m trying to get my cumulative gpa up past a 3.0 so I can get into a grad school program. I just added this class and I think it will help me succeed in my bio lecture and lab.The second reason is because I find biology pretty interesting as a subject, and I did well in my last bio class so i’m hoping this Sci course will help me do good in bio 240 as well. I’ve heard good things about these supplementary courses, so I’m hoping that I can get an A in bio with the help this class will provide me. It’s also pretty chill because it’s one day a week on a Monday, and Mondays are the day I allocate to handle most of my schoolwork so that worked out well for me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0240,SI,1,703,"Why am I here, I am here for a few reasons. The reason I choose to add this class was that I felt the need for extra help in biology 240. Last semester I took biology 230 and although it was my first semester in college I struggled a little bit. Looking back at last semester I could have tried harder to earn a better grader in that class but it didn’t happen. Now that I have completed my first semester and first biology class I now know what to expect for the future. Biology is interesting to me because there’s always something new I learn every lecture. So for this class, I decided to join is for that extra help to understand the material better. In the lecture, there is no homework or quizzes so that is a major part of the grade that is not going to be added because it is just based on the exams. Knowing myself I know I will need to pass those exams to get the grade I want in than class. The next reason I am here is due to the fact that this class is only one unit and I thought to my self why not to take it. With this one unit I now am taking fifteen units and that is perfect. Also, it’s at night so instead of wasting that time in doing nothing I now have something to do. So I hope this class will help me succeed in this semester and in my biology major. "
