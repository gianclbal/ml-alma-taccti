2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,80,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college because it  was those values that helped me get to where I am and those same values continue to help through college. My family has always told me that hard work would get me anywhere i wanted to go and I have taken that with me and used that to help me get here at SFSU and to continue to try and excel in college. My family values are very important to me as my family helped me get here and helped me become who I am, without them I would not be the same person. I use their values and teachings to help me succeed in my next chapter in life which is where I am now. I will always carry their values and teachings with me and I will continue to use them to inspire me and help me to succeed at whatever I am doing."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,76,"The values of my community or my family helped me navigate through college because my family has always told me how important it is to go to college and do what I love and become successful. They have always supported me and made sure I was confident in the college I chose to go to even if it wasn’t in the city and would be more financially difficult, but they say having a good education is the most important because it does benefit your future and life. I am not the first one to attend college, most of my cousins and sister all graduated from SF State which gives me the strength and confidence that I can do it too, despite all of the challenges that come along with it. I know I can always turn to them for advice because they have all been through it and know the process. Since I was a little kid I knew I was going to go to college because that is what I was constantly told and did go to a middle school and high school that would prepare me for what was expected and that it does get difficult at times and should be taken seriously. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,385,"The values of my community and family have helped me throughout college due to the support they have provided for me since the first day I started freshman semester. I would say that community has been a lot more potent compared to my family aspect because being the first child to attend a college that isn’t community, it was and still is hard to make them understand the things I do since my two elder sisters never did anything like that, they were never active in extracurriculars so they were only used to a lifestyle of working, going to school and going back home. My family has helped me become humble, self-motivated and also hard working. My family didn't really value college but I knew that I need college to better my life and my children's life later down the line. So the main thing my families values have help navigate me through college is by motivating my to do good in college and seek at better future. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,376,"My family has helped me a lot. They have shaped a big part of me and continue to support me through my college journey. Without them there wouldn't be a college for me. My family is big on getting your education to ensure better opportunities in the future. Both my parents finished college with masters degrees and have emphasized the importance of finishing college. My father spent a while in school and took about 10 years after high school to get his masters. It was a long journey for him but he stuck to it. Both my parents work really hard and so naturally it rubbed off on me. They never really stressed over the grades I received in college as long as I try my best. They've always told me to do my best and live with the results. It has been reassuring that even if I do fail or class or barely pass, my parents are understanding enough to tell me to try harder. There hasn't been a moment where I felt pressure from them to succeed, rather I do my best because I know they have done so much for me. My grandma has also been a huge influence on my college journey. She never went to college herself, but she told her kids to and they all got at least an AA from college. My grandma comes from little and only wants for me to finish college before I make any big decisions in my life. My family has always looked after me and has talk me the importance of sticking to something and doing your very best in making it happen. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,378,"My family values hard work and being persistent. I am the first in my family to attend a 4-year university and it did take a lot of hard work to get here. There have been so many obstacles that I have faced as an individual as well as with my family. I mean the situation that the world is in right now with the coronavirus is an obstacle in so many factors of my life and I am sure, with every single American college student. Having the classes go from in-person to online really threw me off my tracks. The week following this announcement made it difficult to stay on track with what was due and sticking with the schedule I had in place. So getting into a new groove did take some persistence and hard work and I do have my family to thank for that."
