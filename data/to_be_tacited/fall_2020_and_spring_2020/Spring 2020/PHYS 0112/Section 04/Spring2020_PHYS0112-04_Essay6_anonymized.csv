2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,76,"I want to go into the STEM field because I always wanted to do something, since I was a little kid, in the science field. My mom, most of my aunts, and my sister all work at UCSF and Kaiser which really inspires and motivates me even more to pursue my dream of being a Radiologist. When I first entered SFSU my major was Business, but I realized that I didn’t have an interest in that and it wouldn’t  make me happy if I kept it. I felt more pressured to choose a major before entering college than actually choosing what I wanted because I didn’t want to be undeclared. What made me want to become a Radiologist was my aunt. She told me all the steps I had to take in order to become one and what she did to be successful. She told me that City College of San Francisco is 1 of 3 schools, I believe, that has the 2 year program of Radiology that no other university provides. I know that being in the Science field is not easy and that it takes time and patience to pursue your dreams, but that’s with everything and anything as long as you put your heart and hard work into. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,376,"I'm not quite sure if Kinesiology is a discipline within STEM but I do know it is one of the sub sciences. The reason why I went into Kinesiology was because it interested me the most coming out of high school. I have always had a passion for what the body could do and how it moves ever since I was young. I grew up playing sports so naturally I was intrigued by how to make the body more efficient with its movements and the science behind how the body moved. Another reason why I chose this was because I could see myself in the future doing a job related to Kinesiology. Becoming a personal trainer, or strength and conditioning coach, or athletic trainer were all interests of mine and this field offered that. I want to choose a career I enjoy and also be able to help people which their fitness. I believe that being healthy can prevent future injuries, sickness, and even diseases. I think it is vitally important for individuals to keep healthy because it can potentially save massive amounts of money that would otherwise go to health bills or medical bills. All in all, encouraging people to live healthy lifestyles is hard to do, but its benefits are worth it."

I also enjoy helping out others because it makes me feel better about myself as well. As a young kid I always dream of becoming a doctor or just something in the medical field. I like how we get to work in a fast pace, communitive environment that guarantees a well-paying career. Another reason why I chose the stem field is because there are some many options to choose from. I don’t completely know what I’m going for in the stem field but I know its going to do with the medical field. The stem field is the only excited field, it’s the only field that motivates me to continue. Another reason why I chose the stem field was because Average starting compensation outpaces careers in other fields. Being in the stem field makes subjects like math and science fun which is another plus for me."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,383,"I'm an international student and my major is business management, so obviously my major is not a STEM major, so for me as an international student the, if my major is the STEM major, it will be good for me, cause when I graduate from school I can have more time to find a Job in the United States and When I found a job I will have more time to get H1B Visa. The regular major only have 1-year permission to stay in the United State, but STEM major has 3 years, so if my major become the STEM major it will be very helpful when I graduated from school."
