My question is “Can energy be destroyed and how is it used in physics?”. Energy in Physics is the capacity for doing work and there are different forms of energy such as Kinetic Energy, Gravitational Potential Energy, Thermal, Chemical, Nuclear and the list goes on. Based on the slides for Introduction To Energy, “Energy cannot be created or destroyed. Energy can be transferred or transformed, but the total amount always stays the same.” That is one of the most important physical laws and there is even an equation for it which is Ef-Ei and it stands for Ei as initial total energy and Ef is the final total energy. In class we went over some examples how energy is transformed such as when we lift an item (s) the energy that we use is from the food we eat which transforms into gravitational potential energy as we lift something.Or another example is when we burn gasoline or wood it is transformed into chemical energy."

It also gives us a better understanding of why exactly objects move the way the do. Another thing physics helps us with our everyday life with is describing forces that pushes down on us and as well as the force we put on the earth just be moving. As well as the energy that we give off as we are doing something. Examples can be stuff like walking, driving a car, or using our phones. I use physics in the morning when I am ironing my clothes, due to the iron creating heat its using Thermodynamics to heat up. Another example can be when I walk to class, I usually walk on cement which has a lot of Friction or traction which is used in physics. I also us physics when I’m writing with my ball point pen due to the ball rolling and the gravity force pushing the ink down. Whenever I hear music from my headphones it is because of physics due to the concepts of magnetics and sound waves help us head music out of our headphones."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,383,"I think this semester we learned a lot of things, such us velocity vs break time. This is a very normal phenomenon in our life. In the common day, e know when we drive our car fast and we have to stop we have used more time to break it, but we don't know the principle and application, but after this class, e learned why the car needs more time to stop, use the scientist way to explain our day life phenomenon is very interesting. Also after this class,l paid more attention to my drive speed and stay as far as away from the car before my car. Also,another interesting class is the balance class cause we all play the seesaw in our childhood and we still can see young people playing seesaw in the park, in my childhood, here is a question around me. Why I can hold up a person had lightweight than me. After this class, I knew the scientist way to explain why people can hold people to the seesaw. We see a lot of seesaw in our community I think we should explain why the seesaw can hold people up and is a good way to e children learn science. After all,  think our class experiment is very close to our life, although we before the experimental each class we know the result, but is good way to learn ""why""."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,376,"What I learned this semester that was most interesting to me was conservation of energy. Learning that energy can be conserved, makes a lot of sense with ordinary things in everyday life. Going to amusement parks as a kid and still now has always been a joy. I never really understood how the roller coaster could get going with out something pushing it throughout the course. Only at the initial start did the roller coaster gain its energy and this was being of the stored up potential energy. Roller coaster that started from the highest point always seemed faster than those that didn't and I couldn't understand why except by just knowing that it does. By learning that potential energy stored up converts into kinetic moving energy (KE=1/2mv2) I understood the reason why the roller coaster is faster because the increase in height increases PE and in doing so increase KE and its speed if all other variables remained the same. Also because this is not a friction less world, I've learned that some of that energy is lost but is still converted in different types of energies such as thermal energy. And this explains why objects get really got when rubbed against and why cars have tires that are rubber. Knowing these types of energies can help us maximize the amount of energy we want to conserve. Say my joints are hurting from running and this happens often. To ease the force on my knee I would want to find a surface that would provide more contact time on the ground, so that the force played back onto my joints from the surface wouldn't be as much. This principle relates to momentum with two things colliding, in this case my foot and the ground. P= change(mV)/change in time, which is known as impulse. The impulse of the ground force to my knees would be less on a sand surface than a concrete surface because my change in time would be longer on the sand. This would be less force on my knees allowing the running on sand to be a better option when exercising. These small formulas and laws make sense in everyday life and can help make life easier as well. "
