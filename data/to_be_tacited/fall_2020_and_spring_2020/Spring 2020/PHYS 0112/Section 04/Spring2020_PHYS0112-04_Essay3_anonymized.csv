2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,378,"What do I do when life gets challenging. Well, I cry because I find it as a good physical way to let it out. I allow myself to cry for a good 10-20 minutes straight, then think about why I am crying and how to stop feeling that way and make a plan. After that, I face the challenges life throws at me. I'm not sure if this method works for others but it works for me. As mentioned earlier, I make a plan after talking myself down. Usually, I make the plan in my head then talk it out with others such as my boyfriend or my best friend. I feel as if doing this, turning to others and getting their opinions, helps me find a better way to face these challenges."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,76,"When life gets challenging I take a minute to concentrate on myself and focus on what works best for me in order to continue what I do. Being a part time sales supervisor and going to school almost every day gets very stressful and challenging because I feel like I have no time to complete certain assignments and take time for myself since it does get very tiring. However, I start to think about how fortunate I am to have a job and receive great education that others do not have due to the circumstances that they may be in which makes me thankful for the opportunities I have. When life gets challenging I also turn to my family and friends for advice which is really helpful and makes me happy to know I have a great support system and people I can depend on no matter what. They give me hope because they tell me that anything is possible and I get can get through it with time and patience. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,383,"I think I didn't meet as much as challenges on my whole life if there has one I will say the academic.  I think the most challenge thing in my life, for now, was the school. The academic challenge was exit every semester. When I met the challenge I just stay more focus on the class and doing my regular homework. I remembered when I first enter university I choose an English class in this class we have to write a lot of essays and as an international student, this class was a huge challenge for me. At the beginning of a couple of essays I got very bad grades, but I didn't give it up, I just revise and revise my essay, at last, I finally overcome it. So I want to say when I met challenges I will give myself more time and patient to figure it out."

However, I don't let myself dwell on the negative and challenge for too long. I like to think and brainstorm possible solutions for the challenge. I also like to give myself plenty of time to try make the situation less challenging because if I don't, I think I will become overwhelmed again. I like to solve what I can first, and the stuff that is harder to approach on my own, I like to get help. I think it is more efficient to get help from others when I am facing a challenge because I will be able to get new insight on approaching the problem. I think it is also important to remind myself to not give up so quickly. Sometimes when things get challenging, I lose motivation to try, However, doing this will slow down the process. That’s why I think it is important to get help, give myself time, stay hopeful, and work hard to overcome the problem."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,385,"When life gets challenging, I like to stop what I’m doing and lay down on my bed to come up with a plan/ outline of what I want to do. Sometimes I have a stressful day at school, and I have piles of work that needs to be done, I always priorities task by due dates and by the length of the assignment. If I know a certain assignment will take longer to do, I always do that first so I can have more time to finish it than work on the easy/quick stuff. I also like to hear music to calm myself down and get my emotions on the right track. I’m a big believer that you can do whatever it is that you desire if you get your mind right and you put in the time/effort. So, when life doesn’t go my way, I try to calm myself down and get my mind right."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,376,"What do I do when life gets challenging. I first thing I do is ask myself how can I fix this or should I get out of this situation or challenge. Depending on the challenge I would decide whether or not it is benefit for me to take the challenge head on or if I should steer away from it. For the most part I always tend to take the challenge on. However, whenever something like this happens I find myself getting advice from people I trust and love. I think it is crucial to have people in your life that will give you good advice even if it is contrary to what you want to hear. Challenges can be seen and handled in many different ways and my way of handling something could be the wrong or more difficult way of handling it. I always seek counsel or advice knowing that my knowledge is limited. Challenges are a part of life and its how we humans grow and become mature. Through the process of these challenges, they will shape the person you are and for me has shaped my life in many ways. Sometimes I have strayed away from challenges I should have taken on but was to afraid to and it ending up biting me back in the long run. I can say that my life hasn't been overall challenging in the sense where every direction I turn I feel like its a struggle to get by. I can only say this because of the huge support system I have and the values my support system has. I was always taught that when life gets tough, the tough get going. So what do I do when challenges come. I recognize them, I embrace them, and then I attack them straight on. Side note: I also pray a bunch knowing that my greatest help comes from the Lord. =)"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,80,What I do when life gets challenging? I usually just tell myself that I will get through this period in my life and everything will be better later on. In order to relieve stress during that challenging time in my life I listen to music which seems to relieve my stress and gets me thinking better and calms me down and that is usually when I tell myself everything is going to be alright. I try not to over stress about and just try to live in the moment and get whatever I need to get done as it helps to clear my plate in terms of work which makes things less stressful and ultimately less challenging. That is what I usually do when things are challenging in my life and it seems to work most of the time as the challenging things in my life usually have to do with school work as things start to pile up and I have a lot of things to do in a short amount of time.
