2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,76,"I am here because I am a Biology major and this is one of the prerequisites for my major. I have taken a Physics class previously in high school, but looking back I didn’t really learn much and did not understand the full concept of what Physics actually was and the point of it.  I am here because I want to broaden my understanding of why certain things work the way they do when working out these problems and how they might relate to everyday life. I am also not the best in math, so after taking this class I want to accomplish my goals of doing good and be able to solve the problems without having any trouble and be confident in the work that I am doing. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,374,"I’m here in this class because I’m taking a physics lecture class and this is a course we take along with the other. I haven’t chosen a major but I’ve thought about going into biology or perhaps another kind of science so taking this class seemed like a good idea. I also think it’s important to take physics because what we learn is very valuable to the world around us. We see topics that we learn in class everyday, we always have real world examples. I am here at SFSU because I wanted to go to college. I think furthering your education if possible is a very important thing. College education brings forth lots of opportunities (or so I’ve heard) that have the ability to change your life. I come to school so that I can get a degree and get a good job to help support my family. I’m not sure whether this question meant why am I in this class or why am I in SFSU but I think the reasons for both can kind of mesh together, I’m going to school and taking this class so that I can graduate, get a job, and just be more well acquainted with the subject and concepts of physics. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,375,"Why am I here?I'm here to get my degree, although sometimes I feel as though I've hit a a wall. Between stressing about classes, money for rent, and trying to looking for a job I think I'm holding on. I just need to finish my classes as fast as possible I dont want to be a burden to my mom when I need money. I'm taking this class in order to complete my course requirments. I'm a biology major, and ill be taking the class that follows this one."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,376,"""Why am I here"". I am here because I want to have more opportunities later in life and to find out the best suitable career I want to pursue. College is feel is a big stepping stone for young people such as myself and I think it can get you through many doors that would otherwise be closed with a college degree. But more specifically, I came to SF State to finish up my BA degree and to play for the Men's basketball team here. The big reason why I chose to come here was also how close it was to home seeing that I only live 20 to 20  minutes away. I've been to many schools in my college journey and this is the place where I will get my BA and hopefully masters. This is all the superficial aspects of life, the american dream so to speak. However, I do believe there is a greater purpose to all things and the why is much deeper  than simply getting a degree, stable job, and nice family. I believe that humans have intrinsic value and that all are made in the image of God. Knowing this the why for me is to speak my truth where I go and to love people where I am at. I am a follower of Jesus so I do believe there are purpose for why I'm specifically at this school. Know do I know exactly, no. But knowing that God is with me throughout my academic journey and this thing called life is comforting. The why for me is always bigger than just the material and what looks good on my resume. The why is making the most of my opportunities where ever I am at because going to college is a blessing that I'm grateful for. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,377,"I am here because I want to get the education that is required to be able to become a doctor. I want to become a doctor because I really love to help people and also it would have pretty decent pay. I decided to take my education at San Francisco State University because I wanted to be more independent. Even though I hate going to school a lot I still force myself to go cause I want to be able to reach my career. I also want to really make my family happy with being able to become a doctor. I want to be able to pay my family back for all they have done for me so far.  Also by pushing myself through all this, when I have a family I could be a great example to my children. I really want to be able to look back at my life and say that I did the best I could."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,378,"I am here to succeed. I am here for my family and to help them succeed. It may be kind of indirect but it is to help them be happy. I am here to learn. As I always say to my friends, learning makes my brain get a little bit bigger from the knowledge. I am a kinesiology major so I am here to learn to help others. It's something that I have always felt was a part of me. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,379,"I believe I am here to make a difference in our world. I was put through emotional turmoil in the beginning stages of my life, bringing me to develop who i am as a person. Every person I’ve met before this point was meant to pass by me and give me some kind of influence so I can harbor the best self I can ever hold. Now, I’m at a point where the emotional growth is now tied with educational growth. I’ve put myself into a world of science and philosophy and I am able to understand how the two really depend on the other, and how they can reflect through me. All of the choices I’ve made is bringing me to a higher purpose that I know is waiting for me at the end. I still enjoy life, but I enjoy it walking forward towards any goal I put myself to. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,104,"Daniel Knapp  Why am I here?              Why am I here? Well, that depends if someone were to ask me why I was here in this class, physics 111 lab, I would say that I am here to learn about physics and that it is required for me to take this course for my major. However, speaking in more broad terms why am I here at this school, San Francisco state, well that is because I am trying to earn a degree in biology, and hopefully have a well-paying job in the future, as to why most people go to college. When going to even broader terms why am I here on earth, well one could say it was simply because my parents got together and from there I was born? However, I would say that I am here in this class, at this school, and on this earth due to change and my drive to achieve the goal that every human strives to attain which is living a healthy and happy life. If that was not the case I probably would not be sitting here in this class as I write about the topic simply asking, why am I here?"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,380,"I am here because this class is required for my major. I have found physics interesting before, but it is not my favorite subject. I want to expand my knowledge and learn more about the mechanics of physics and how things work in the world around me. I was supposed to take this class last semester, but I had a lot on my plate. Especially since it was my first semester here at SF state. I wanted to get comfortable before pushing myself with how much work I was able to handle. I want to utilize my communication skills in this class and work in groups for labs and projects. I have not had much experience with the subject of physics so I am hoping that this class will fulfill my expectations. I probably would not have taken this class if it was not required for my major, however I will do my best to stay active and engaged throughout this semester in the class."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,63,"I’m here at San Francisco State Universality because I want to earn a bachelor’s degree. The career field of physical therapy has interested me since before I got into this university so I decided to major in kinesiology to lead me to the right path. General physics is required for my major, but it is also required for physical therapy programs I want to apply to after I graduate. I know physics plays a role in kinesiology since it used in biomechanics. I hope this class will prepare for future interactions I have with physics, such as when I take general physics ii, biomechanics, and any classes I take in graduate school. Taking physics in high school made me gain interest in the subject because my teacher was very passionate and my classmates were all nice and helpful. I get the same feeling in my lecture and lab because some of the people there really try to work together and work through solutions since the class can be difficult at times"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,381,"I am here in this physics lab course because it is a part of the many other courses that I need the take according to the roadmap that I have decided to follow in order to graduate. It is not an easy roadmap, with many different chemistry and biology course that I have yet to enroll in. I am here in this 9:00am lab course because I was lucky enough to have gotten an add code from my lecture instructor which is allowing me to stay in the lab. Without the add code I would have been forced to drop both this lab and lecture because these to classes have to be co-enrolled from what I have read. In a broader sense, I am here because my future pretty much depends on it. I am a firm believer that you cannot go as far in life without an education because of how much more competitive people are becoming and that employers would rather go for someone that has a degree rather than someone who dropped out. I am also here for my parents who never got to finish college themselves. I am here to make them proud. To one day use my education to make a bunch of money and repay them everything they have done for me because they deserve it. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,80,"Why am I here, I am here because I want to become a doctor and go onto medical school. This class was a requirement in my major which is why I am here taking it. This is the only physics class I have to take in my major. I’m not that interested in physics but so far from being in this class physics does not seem to be too hard but also not easy. I am here to hopefully pass this class and come out with a good grade and complete the requirement in my major. I am here to get a degree to go on and become a doctor which is what I am studying for. I wouldn’t be here without my parents who sacrificed a lot for me to be here. I am part of the first generation in my family to go to college and hopefully get a degree and I am trying to make my parents proud but also learn things for myself and get a career that will give me financial stability and also a career where I will help tons of people. This is why I am here at the University and why I am here in this class. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,382,"The general physics laboratory is required as a complement to the general physics course, and also to fulfill a general education requirement. My aim in taking this course to reinforce what I learn in my general physics class through the physical application of theoretical concepts. I specifically chose this class during the time that it occurs because it was the only class that would fit in my current schedule. I took this class so I would not have to take a lab next semester if I passed, and it would be better to take a lab and a regular science class together rather than take the lab by itself because I might forget about the concepts learned in the regular science class and have difficulty in the lab by itself as a result. Last semester, I did not have the time in my schedule for a biology lab, so I had to take a lab for physics instead. Passing this class is important to me, I want to be be able to finish my general education requirements as fast as possible, so therefore, I have to take this class to be able to do so."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,105,"Giovanni Ramirez  PHYS 112  February 19th, 2020  Reflective Journal #1  Why am I Here?              Whenever I get asked why I am here, it is usually a pretty interesting question to answer. I am currently at San Francisco State University to further my education and pursue what I want to do in my adult career which is Biology. I have always had a fascination for Biology because it teaches you how things around you and in your body work together to create what we call life. However, If you were to ask me why I am in this particular physics course, the honest is reason is that because it is required for me to take if I want to earn my degree in Biology. Don’t get me wrong though, I have taken physics before in High School and earned a really good grade and actually felt like I enjoyed learning about the topic and the many ways that it relates to my every day life around me. I just probably would not take this course or any other physics course if it weren’t required."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,383,"Why am I here   	I want to talk about why I came to United State that will explain why I’m here. When I graduated middle school in China, my parents decided send me to The United State to finish My high school and university study. First Place I went was Arizona, at there I finished my High school, also at there I got the first car in my life. After I finish the High school I decided move to Bay Area to continue my college, I went to the DVC in pleasant hill, and right there I studied two years，then I transfer to the San Francisco State University. After I talk to the advisor he tell me if I need graduate in SFSU I should take a class satisfy with the SFSU general education then I can graduate, so I still have a Lab class didn’t take yet, so I choose the Physical lab class, so this explain why I’m here in this class. Also why I’m here is because ever decision  I made in my life that’s led me to here."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,384,"I am in college to earn my degree. But I am also here to better myself as a person. I think the purpose of college is to prepare students for “the real world” by helping students become more well rounded. I am in school to gain build a network, get experience, have fun, learn about a subject that I am passionate in, and be able to contribute that back to society when I graduate. I am taking physics 111 and 112 mostly to fulfill my general education requirement. However, I have already taken an equivalent to this class at my community college that I have transferred from. But it has been a long time since I have last taken that class, so I think that my physics foundation is not as strong. I would feel more comfortable redoing the sequence rather than just being confused in the next class. I also think that I am here to learn about problem solving. I think that problem solving goes beyond doing physics problems or math problems. I think it is about being able to think critically."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,4,385,"I am here because it is part of my prerequisite for my major and because I’ve never taken physics before so this would be something new for me. I’ve always been interested in learning or taking a physics class. I am also here because I heard you were a great teacher from some of my friends. I am here also because I enjoy learning about science and new theories and concepts. I’ve always wanted to learn about physics but none of my teachers in high-school made it interesting that’s why I never took it in high-school. I am also here because I needed a Tuesday and Thursday lab class, I don’t have space during my Monday, Wednesday or Friday session because my schedules already packed. I am also here because I just finished taking calculus 1 last semester and I wanted to take calculus first before I took physics so that way I wouldn’t be lost."
