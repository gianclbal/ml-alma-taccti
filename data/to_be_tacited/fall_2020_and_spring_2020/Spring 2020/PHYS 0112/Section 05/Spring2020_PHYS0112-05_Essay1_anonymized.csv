2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,56,"Aya AlazzehPhysics 112I am enrolled in Physics 111 and 112 because it is a required course for my major. I am a biology with a concentration in physiology, and I aspire to become a physician one day. This class to me is a step closer to my college degree, and one step closer to graduate school. I also am in this class to gain knowledge about Physics of course. As a future doctor I am required to take the MCAT which is the Medical entrance exam. Physics material is present on the exam, and so it is vital that I have an understanding of Physics. Overall I would say that I enjoy learning, and college is the time to indulge in any subject you please. I enjoy expanding my intellectual horizons, and it will only benefit me in the future. In conclusion, the more knowledge the better."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,386,Well according to my major I am supposed to be here. There are a lot of reasons I am here I am also interested in science and want to get up to being able to do some science in each area in order to be able to help other people. Although to this point it is really confusing and I do not thoroughly understand it I am hanging in here . Physics is an interesting yet so boring topic because of how much things overlap and you have to learn and memorize a lot of things I can just imagine that. The real reason though is that I have to take this for medical school as well so as of right now I guess I am all in. The only thing is  physics has so much concepts and I do not know how to take in so much information in so little time but I guess it is time to start figuring that out.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,387,"I am here at San Francisco State University because I want to get my Bachelors of Science in Biochemistry so that can get into medical school and become a anesthesiologist. I am here so that I can make my mom proud and be one of the first people in my family to complete college and get a degree; because making them happy android means a lot to me. I want to be able to show them that I can make it and maybe help them out in the future because they’ve helped me so much. Without their help I would not be at San Francisco State University or in my Physics 112 class. I am in Physics 112 so that I can continue to pursue my dream of becoming an anesthesiologist and learn more about physics and how it is present in my every day life so that I can use my new found knowledge and degree to help others by becoming a doctor. Being here in college and in physics is extremely important to me because without being here I wouldn’t be able to purse and execute my goals or make my family proud, being here makes me who I am."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,388,I am here because this is a prerequisite for biomechanics and major requirement for my major. I am a kinesiology major with an emphasis in exercise and movement sciences. I can see physics being beneficial to me in my major because kinesiologists analyze movement and with that you need to understand physics. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,389,"The reason why I am taking General Physics I Lab is because it is one of the requirements for my major. Before taking this class, I have not taken a physics class since my freshman year of high school, which was about 6 1/2 years ago. Even though I had some experience when it comes to physics, everything that I have been learning this semester is all new material for me. In the sense of why am I going to college, I would say that I feel like my purpose in life is to be in the medical field to help people. In order to have the degree to assist patients, I need to major in Biology and take the required courses, like physics, in order to master the subject. Having this degree is one of the major stepping stones in getting into medical school. But I know this class is essential for my learning because physics is implied in everyday life and necessary to understand applications, especially those in the medical field."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,390,"I am here in Physics Lab because it is part of the requirement as a Biology major here at SF State. I have never previously taken any physics course throughout high school and I find it essential to be in this class to have a better understanding in general and as a science major. I was brought to this class through major requirements, however, I initially chose Biology as my major because I have future plans to go into the medical field as my career. More specifically, I aspire to be a Physician Assistant and hope to get into a graduate program for that once I graduate from SF State. If that doesn’t work out, being a Biology major allows for a wide variety of career options such as a different career in the medical field, I could go into research, another option would be a CSI (crime scene investigator), dentistry, veterinary studies, etc. Not only does my major allow me a path to my dream job but also opens several pathways to many other backup plans, either way, this major will hopefully help me succeed in life. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,391,I am in this course because I need it for my major. I have never taken physics before mostly because I am intimidated by the math in it. I am not a math person. I took this class this semester because I need it and it was a good time for me to take it. If I didn't need physics for my major I don't think I would have ever taken this class of my own volition. I think the subject is interesting and understand some basics concepts. It is just that I don't really like hard sciences as much.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,392,"Amanda Friedman  Why am I here?              The main reason that I decided to enroll in this class is to fulfill a requirement for my Biology major. It is one of the three main classes that are prerequisites for other classes.  I intend to finish this physics class and continue on to the second semester physics to complete my requirements and move on to upper division courses within my major. By the end of this class, I hope to have a better understanding of what physics is and that it will help me when I take my MCAT and enter medical school in the next couple of years after I graduate with my four-year degree at San Francisco State. This class is meant to lay a foundation for the basics of physics and give some background for the future. This class is also along side a lecture, which has been able to help me better understand concepts by doing experiments.  I may not be here out of pure interest but I believe that this class is important to complete my education here."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,393,"I am here in this particularly coarse because it is a prerequisite for other classes and necessary to obtain my degree.   This is my second time attempting to complete physics ( the first attempt I withdrew within the first two weeks; the information was so dense and uninteresting).  This attempt is a little better where the instructor is not moving as fast or is she as boring.   However, she does not give foundation for what she’s explaining and assumes everyone is on her page.   To her defense she does ask if any has questions.... sometimes it’s hard to ask what you don’t know how to ask and even harder if you assume it’s only you that’s not understanding the material.  The lab component of physics has been helpful in a way where the instructor there is more approachable and willing to help...which I truly appreciate.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,394,"Jiayu Lu  PHY112     Physics exists in every day. I want to learn about how physics works in our daily lives, and how it affects our lives. I felt interesting in physics when I first drew a FBD to analyze a force system. I also found interested about how different force work. I learned that every object has gravitational force do to the earth. I also learned how the three types of Newton's Law work. For example, while a system’s net force is not equal to zero, it occurs acceleration by the Newton's 2nd Law. An important part in physics is that scientists have derived their theories into equations to show how physics work in life. Scientist have provided good ideas for us to create better future lives. So, I am here to learn more about physics.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,395,In my experiences I have always been fascinated by physics. However I never considered it as a major for me only a  hobby or side interest. For that reason I am taking physics because I enjoy studying the topic. I am a Business administration major and I am not required to take physics. However I did need a lab and a physical science for me GE's and I instantly thought of physics when I learned that. So far I have not had trouble in the class because it is all stuff that I learned in my high school physics class.  However I have enjoyed going to lab because I did not get a chance to do many labs in high school physics. Overall I think I am here because I enjoy studying physics and it covers two of my GE's but i am enjoying it.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,79,"If someone were to ask me “why are you here?”, I wouldn't know how to go about answering the question in a way that will explain all the reasons why I was placed on this earth. Although, I would like to believe that I was placed here to do something that will help my community grow and advance for the better. I'm attending SFSU in hopes to further educate myself to hopefully become a surgeon in the near future. I chose this path to not only secure my future but also to show that the minorities in this world are taking bigger steps forward into being seen as equals. Nonetheless, for the present I know I was placed here to be a sister, a daughter, and a friend to those who need my support. For right now I'm okay with knowing that those are some of the reasons why I am here. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,396,"I would say I'm here because this class is required by my major, but I failed this class twice before. I didn't fail because the class is hard. I failed twice because I have bad depression and PTSD. Taking this class and passing it is a goal for me so I prove to myself that I can get better. I'm from Iraq and I lived there until 2013. I come from an abusive family. Education is important to me. I love math and every subject that has math. Doing well in school helps me love myself more and more. I am here because I don't think there is anywhere else I want to be at the age of 22. I wish I was a lot ahead by this age but I won't let that bother me too much. I'm here so I can go higher and higher in my college career. Most of all I am here because this school is safe and I have a better opportunity than where I was born so I'll take advantage of that. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,94,"Chris Seng  Reflective Journal #1              I am here because as a STEM major I need a certain amount of units from the Calculus and Physics section in order to graduate. In order to progress and graduate with my BA in Marine Biology and Limnology, I have to take these courses. A very long amount of time has passed since I took a Physics course, I haven’t taken Physics since freshman year of high school. In order to get a fundamental knowledge on Physics, I must do well in these classes which will help my understanding of the Science world in a better way. Physics can be used in several different ways when it comes to Marine Biology. I believe in my case because I want to work with sharks, Physics will play a large part when it comes to the sharks ability to sense living things due to their electroreceptors."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,397,"I am here to meet the course requirements needed for my major. Physics is not an easy subject for me, but since it is necessary for my major, I plan to follow through with the course lecture and lab. Since I need to pass the lecture and lab, I am here to learn and apply these concepts to my major. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,398,"Knowledge is part of our lives.  Without them I won’t be able to do anything. I gain all knowledge through study.  The special knowledge that I gain at the university will help me later get an interesting job .. These are such necessary actions in our modern life, without which it is impossible to live in the modern world!  This knowledge, acquired through hard work on myself, guides and supports me all my life.  They help me acquire and analyze other information coming from the world around us. I believe that they will be useful to me in the future.  It is interesting to learn something new about your hobbies, your hobby.  In this case, study turns into an exciting game. Every day I learn something, talking to each other, reading, listening.  Information should be carefully selected, because not all of it may be useful.  I use the knowledge that we need at the moment.  In order to achieve a certain position in the future, to become a good specialist, you must study, otherwise your dreams will remain unfulfilled.  In this case, you give your place to a more experienced and knowledgeable person.  Of course, I want my dreams to come true.  This means that you need to study and study well in order to be a modern person."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,399,"I am here at Sf State to succeed and have a better future. I am a first generation student, and the oldest of my siblings. I want to be a role model for my siblings, so they can have someone to rely upon. Hearing my mom’s history, and seeing that she didn’t have the opportunity to go to college is what motivates me to be here where I am now. As a younger girl my mom had to work, and help out in the house, making it harder to finish her education. Now, she has to work really hard to be able to afford paying rent, and I see her struggles. I don’t want to go through the same struggles, especially knowing how expensive it is to live here, this is why I want to succeed and have a better future. In addition, in order to succeed and become my career I have to first get a bachelor in Biology, and I would get it by graduating from SFSU. Lastly, I am here to be able to help my family out, and support them economically."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,400,"I am here because this is a class that I need to take for my major, bio chemistry. I don’t particularly enjoy the assignments given due to how tedious they can be. The instructor is friendly which is a pro."
