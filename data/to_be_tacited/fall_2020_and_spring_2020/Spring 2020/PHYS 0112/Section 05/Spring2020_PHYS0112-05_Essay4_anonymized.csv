2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,386,"The values of my family is literally how I have lived my life, so the values my family has weigh really important for me. My culture is very full of value by that it means that I am full of values because of it. It allows one person to be actually very themselves if one actually thinks about it. Values help shape one person and help them get through life. The value that has helped me a lot in college is treat others how one wants to be treated. This is because just talking to people can open doors that one did not know were even there. This value and a lot of others allowed me to understand how and when it is good to get advantages and when hard working is all you need and sometimes you just got a to ask for help. This allowed me to get through these years a bit easier."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,79,"I come from a small agricultural town on the central coast called Santa Maria and the majority of us including myself are Hispanic. So growing up in a town full of minorities has shown me so much and has motivated me to go above and beyond. My parents started off as field workers so they taught me how to value hard work and dedication. Like most of the people living in Santa Maria I grew up in a low-income family and we learned to appreciate what we have because some people weren't as lucky as us. This taught me some really good values and when I started high school I worked endlessly to provide a better future for myself and my family. In the end, all of my hard work paid off because I was one of about twenty students who got the opportunity to go to a UC or CSU of a class of 1,500 graduating seniors. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,389,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college. They have supported my scholastic journey since I was just a little girl. They always pushed me to do good in school and made sure I had all the necessary support to help me strive on this educational voyage. Since my parents did not have a very successful schooling experience, they made sure I had the support I needed to succeed in college and they taught me to be a hard-working, independent individual. By learning the mindset of being a hard-worker, I always tried my best in school and made sure I worked hard for what I wanted to achieve. By learning how to be independent, I was able to be stable when I came to college and didn’t have to depend on others to keep me on top of my work. Receiving motivational phone calls or messages from my parents every week have definitely helped me succeed so far in college because at the end of the day, I want to make my family proud that I was able to achieve my academic goals."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,391,"I think both of my parents value college. I think my mother values it because it will make me a smarter more well rounded person and my father values it because it will set me up for success in my career. The influence of my parents (my dad especially) created a situation where I was going through college with the intent to get through it quickly so that I could move on to higher education and become a doctor or something of the like. But throughout my time here and because of the influence of the people that I've met, I have changed my outlook on college and therefore how I navigate. I want to take classes that I'm interested in even if I don't need to take them. I also want to take this time to think about what it is that I want."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,387,"The values of my family are to be hard working, kind , and giving. These values have helped me navigate through college because working hard is what college is about. You need to put the effort into all of the class work , projects and in class work when you are in college because with out putting effort you won’t be able to pass your classes or understand and obtain the information that is presented to you throughout the courses you’ll take in college.  The value of being kind and giving has also helped me navigate through college because by me being kind to others and giving it has really helped me make connections with some of my classmates and even faculty at SFSU. These connections really assist me when navigating through college because my classmates , friends and some of the SFSU faculty staff are a real support group for me when I need assistance with anything college related. My friends and classmates are able to help me when I struggle with classwork or studying specific materials as well as they help me find resources for me to get help for when they are not able to help me with a specific thing. The faculty member help me when I do not understand something in the class and also open doors and opportunities for me to excel and better myself. The value of giving also has helped me in the aspect of making connections while I am in college because it gives me a way to make conversation and associate myself with others more easily as it is sometimes hard for me to do as I am more introverted. Overall the values that I have learned from my family has really helped me navigate and get acclimated to the college life."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,394,"Jiayu LuPHYS 112When I was a Senior in high school, I has trouble on choosing a major for my college career. Most of my friends chose the major of computer engineer, but I knew that doesn't fit me because I was not interested and lack of knowledge about computer device. At that time, my mom recommend me to choose a nursing major, for she thought I could find a high paying job after I graduate from college. For me, I really dislike working in hospital or seeing blood, and I feel nervous when I go in a hospital. Although I wanted to stay with a same major with my friends, the two majors didn't seem to fit me. Then I chose Business Management for major and San Francisco State University for college. San Francisco State University is a pretty good college for the major of business. Now, I am a freshman in SFSU. The University has clean environment. All of my professors are nice and responsible for all their students. I can easily understand their lectures and do my work on time. Last, I have to thank for my good parents. They both respected the major and college that I chose, and they also help me pay a part of my tuition.            "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,393,"Reflective Journal 4""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""Needless to say and most like every other person, I have had some struggles; and being a black female, a single mother of eight...didn’t help!  Irregardless of that, I was raised to take pride in myself and always strive to do my very best...which is all anyone can ask of you.  With life’s knock-down’s, you get back up!  You can’t wallow in defeats and/or failures or mishaps!  No matter how hard or difficult...you get back up because nothing comes easy!  And that’s why I’m here today.  My path has not always been easy - upon initially starting college, within the first year I withdrew due to family issues.  Several years later, I returned…and that went well for a while, then I had to withdraw again due to family issues (my grandmother taking ill and having to care for her).  There were also times when I couldn’t afford to return to college because I had to work to care for my family; I had to make sacrifices to put my family first, to make sure my children had what they needed; making sure they had the best resources to obtain their goals (private schools, tutors, etc.).  Even with all of this, I never lost my passion or desire to complete my education...hence, my return to college.   My children are older and are reaching their academic goals (my son is attending Full Sail University in Florida and will graduate in November - BFA in game design; my daughter attends UCLA in Los Angeles - BA, mathematical engineer [wants to work at NASA]; my daughter will graduate University of Iowa, School of Law for her law degree; a daughter attending Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio for her doctoral degree in psychology; my other children not attending college all have good jobs and are caring for themselves).   It was important for me to let them see where they came from...from a mother who valued education but made sacrifices for them.  It was also important for me to share my ‘mistakes’; to let them know they don’t have to make the same!   I’m not proud of some of the decisions and choices I made; but I’ve dealt with them...and in that I hope they’ve learned, they can survive!  You can bounce back.  I’ve never been one not to lead by example; so I can’t raise them to see things through if I don’t!"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,56,"Aya AlazzehPHYS 112Reflective Journal #4	My parents both immigrated to the United States in order for their children to have access to the best education possible. I was raised with a potent understanding of hard work, respect, patience, humility, and most importantly education. My family has always stressed the importance of education. Also, as a Muslim, eduaction is glorified and we are encourgaed as Muslims to be lifelong learners. Education is the barrier between tolerance, respect, and understanding between all living organisms. My parents both attained degrees and had professional careers. My dad has a degree in engineering and my mom has a teaching degree. I also have a very large family, most of which are older than me. I am super thankful and lucky to have plenty of older siblings to look up to. My eldest sister is in Veterinary school at Cornell University, my eldest brother went to UCLA medical school and is now doing his residency at Stanford University, and I have an elder sister who is in physical therapy school at UCSF. My point is that growing up I always knew that I wanted to take school and my education seriously. I have never once taken my education or school for granted. I am so lucky to be able to go to college and have dreams. I can aspire to become whatever I want to become. Many people around the globe, especially women, are not given that chance. I am always grateful and take advantage of my opportunity.   "

2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,390,"The values of my community and family have helped me navigate through college by providing me with insight and experiences in order to help know where I want to go in life. From a young age, I've always been inspired by family members to know that after I finished school, I would go on to college. Once in college I would study a subject that would allow me to go into a career in the medical field, as I've always dreamed. Majority of my family have successful careers in the medical field such as nurses, doctors, surgeons, pharmacists, lab technicians, etc. I remember as a child I would sometimes visit family members at the medical centers and hospitals they worked at and I always loved the environment and hoped to one day be in their position. With that being said, I chose biology as my major knowing I would take classes that are vital to having a career in the medical field. Taking classes that allow me to understand the ways the world work as well as our bodies, as that is what I will be dealing with in my future career. All of this has allowed me to know exactly what I wanted to do in college from a young age, because those in my family inspired me to do so and helped me figure out my path. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,392,"Amanda Friedman                           How have the values of my community or my family helped me navigate through college? My family values education highly and required that I attend a four year university. This has changed my experience of college significantly. But by going away to college I was able to find and assess my own values for life and throughout college. Although grades are an important part of going to a university, making lasting relationships and having unique experiences are most valued for me. Being in the bay area community has made it easier to express myself and become my own person that is not influenced by my old community or family members. My learned values of being responsible and focusing on school have helped me a lot in passing all of my classes and finding out exactly what I want to do with my degree. College was a transition but having a family that are educators and have been to college for the most part, helped me know what to expect when starting college. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,399,"I come from a low income family, where throughout my years I’ve seen how hard they’ve worked, specifically my mom, to be able to give me and my siblings a stabled life. Seeing her wake up every morning, drop us off with the babysitter, and then going to work, coming tired and exhausted, she would still be there for us by making sure we had finished our homeworks, and cooking for us every single day, no matter how tired she was. My mom has always worked in kitchens where she has to work with precautions because she can get burned. This has helped me navigate through college by pushing myself further, and not giving up. I want to succeed and give my family a better life, since they have taught me to value my education, and see how hard it is to be working at a minimum wage. In addition, all of my mom's hard work made me realize that education can make a big difference in someone’s life by having a stable job, earning enough money to live, without having to suffer."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,94,"Chris Seng  920362674  5/17/2020  Reflective Essay #4              The values of my family continue to help steer me through college. Both of my parents came to the United States as immigrants trying to find a better life. My dad is a refugee camp survivor from the Khmer Rouge revolution in Cambodia. When he arrived in the United States in the 1980’s, he had very little and had to adjust to the different style of life here in the states. At 21 years old, my dad had to learn English as well as enroll in a community college in order to get an education and get a better life. So, from his values, I continue to push myself in school. If my father can create a successful life from nothing, then I must be able to do even better by having more opportunities than my father. I feel like there is a lot weighing on my shoulders due to this and I do not want to let my family down."
