2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,392,"Amanda Friedman   Physics Example              When thinking about different physics concepts, the image of a seesaw moving up and down due to differing weights is just one example of a real life situation. My question is, How is it possible to have the weight equally distributed when two people have a different mass? If there is one person that weighs more than the other, it is impossible to have the board balanced at equal distances. They must be leveled out at differing lengths from the axis of rotation for there to be equal torques. Have the person that weighs maybe 100 pounds farthest from the axis and the person that weighs more, 150 pounds, be closer to the axis of rotation to equally distribute the weigh/torque. Both of the people have equal energy exerted on the board and are able to balance out the board. "

I guess you can say most people don’t understand the gravity of the situation. Gravity plays such an important role in everyday life because it literally keeps us on Earth. If the force of gravity on Earth is 9.8 m/s^2, and Newton’s second law is that we get back the equal force we put in, then the Earth is putting back the 9.8m/s^2 . What is the gravity constant on the moon? How much force does the moon push back on you?"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,386,What I am using is potential energy which is something that is very important in cars because of this is how people are in car crashes or they are not when someone presses the break one is deaccelerating the thing is one must somehow guess how much force on the brake one must use so they do not cause a whole ass crash. THe thing is the more speed the more you have to break because there is more potential energy coming with the car hence why when one has a bigger car or when one has more velocity is usually when one of these car crashes become very fatal and In many ways physics is what helps everyone to survive. In many ways the kinetic energy and potential energy play a huge role in this and not just in this type of scenario but in almost everything one does when it comes to their normal lives and to me that is something that is way too crazy.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,391,Why is harder to roller skate on concrete than in a roller rink? In this class we learned that friction is caused by how rough or smooth a surface is (indicated by the friction constant). The floor in a roller rink is polished and smooth and therefore has a low friction constant whereas concrete is rough and has a higher friction constant. It is easier to skate in a roller rink because there is less friction to slow you down.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,394,"Question: A fish is 10 meters away from a shark. The fish swims 2 m/s to the right . The shark tries to catch the fish, and it accelerates 1m/s^2. When will the shark catch the fish? Answer: X(f)=10m + (2m/s)(t)              X(s)=0.5(1m/s^2)(t)^2When the shark catches the fish, they both are at the same position.               10m + (2m/s)(t) = 0.5(1m/s^2)(t)^2              t = 6.89 seconds The shark will catch the fish in 6.89 seconds "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,389,"A physics concept that pertains to me in my everyday life is the conservation of energy.  How does conservation of energy relate to me?  The conservation of energy relates to me because I am able to experience it when I am driving a car. Conservation of energy is involved in driving because there is kinetic energy when you increase acceleration, or velocity. Kinetic energy is associated with the motion of a rigid object and can be solved by using KE=1/2mv^2. When there is an increase in velocity, there is an increase in kinetic energy as well, that’s why it is dangerous to speed. For example, if the velocity was to increase by a factor of 3, the kinetic energy would increase by a factor of 9. That’s why car accidents that involve a speeding car are so fatal, and  that’s why everyone should follow the speed limit to prevent possible accidents or fatalities."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,56,"Aya AlazzehPHYS 112Reflective Journal #5	A physics concept that we as humans experience every day regardless of how we look, where we live, or anything other than the fact that we live on the Earth, is the force of gravity. Gravity is a constant value that does not change no matter where you are located on the Earth. During the semester we have learned how gravity affects a system. We also learned that the opposite force of gravity is known as Normal Force. Despite assumptions, the Normal Force is not also equal to the force of gravity. Gravity is used in many equations to solve for different values. Some of these values include solving for potential energy, weight force, and many others. If you were to throw a 5kg ball 3 meters above your hand, how could you calculate the gravitational potential energy. To solve for the gravitational potential energy you use the equation U=mgy. “U” represents the potential energy, “m” represents the mass, “g” represents gravity, and “y” represents the distance or position. The potential energy of the 5kg ball at 3 m would be equal to 5x9.8x3. The potential energy is 147J. "
