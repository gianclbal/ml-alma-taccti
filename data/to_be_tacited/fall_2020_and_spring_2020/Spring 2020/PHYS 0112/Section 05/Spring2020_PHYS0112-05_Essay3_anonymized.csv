2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,387,"When life gets challenging , I normally try to find solutions to help solve my problems or if it is a problem that doesn’t currently have a solution or is a “long term” problem then I try and do things to take my mind off of it or I try to find a solution to solve part of the problem that is making my life challenging. For example when school is getting challenging or stressing me out, I try to find the source of the stress which is normally not understanding a topic, not having enough time to study or do an assignment , or an upcoming exam. After I’ve determined the source I try to find a solution to the source of the problem, which would normally be to ask for help with a topic I do not understand, making a schedule so I can manage my time better and have time to do assignments and study , or study ahead of time for upcoming exams. When I have challenging things in my life , like family problems or just person problems I normally confide in someone I trust to have them just listen to me and occasionally give me advice on what I should do when I have a problem. Talking out my problems has been a very effective way of helping me through challenging times."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,393,"Reflective Journal 3‘What do I do when life gets challenging?’One thing I’ve learned in life about life...is that life IS unpredictable!  Sometimes no matter how you plan, something is bound to go wrong or just be out of your control.  It is during these times that I remember who I am and whose I am and draw from my relationship with Christ.  From my struggles and experiences, I’ve learned you have to stay rooted and grounded in the Word of God - because God’s Word gives you direction and peace; you have to stay prayed up - because there may be or will come a time when you can’t pray (and prayer allows for a closer relationship with God - you talking to Him and allowing Him to talk to you); and you must keep a song in your heart (to help yourself stay in peace).  What I’ve also learned and what helps me is you also have to KNOW that there will be times when you HAVE TO ENCOURAGE YOURSELF because family and friends won’t be there all the time!  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,396,"Most of the time I give up and stop trying. I get very depressed and sleep a lot. Not every problem is challenging to that point but it depends on how my mental health treatment is going. I'm assuming ""life gets challenging"" speaking of school, I'm trying to try and ask for help and reach out to my professors. force myself to stay up and do the work. I work long hours. I have to support my family, so work is a must for me like many other students. I mostly work 7 days a week, and when I have days off my body is very tired I can't do any work and speed the time sleeping and being lazy. The challenge is to do my work on time and don't let the work pile up, and I end up not doing it and failing the class. I just wish I had more time and worked less. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,94,"Chris Seng  920362674  5/17/2020  Reflective Essay #3              What I do when life gets challenging is listen to Disney music or watch youtube videos about Disneyland. On certain occasions, I am able to actually drive down to Anaheim and go to Disneyland for the day or so. Whenever I go to Disneyland, it’s like a mental refresh for me because I don’t have to worry about anything aside from how light my wallet can feel at the end of the day. It’s just something about the atmosphere that Disneyland creates with the music, the friendly people, the food, and the rides. It really takes you out of “Real Life” and puts you into a good mood, even if you have to wait a few minutes for the rides. If I can’t go to Disneyland, listening to the music from movies or Disneyland works too. It’s a very nostalgic feeling that helps me destress."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,56,"Aya AlazzehPHYS 112Reflective Journal #3	When life gets challenging I need to clear my mind for a little bit. Life can be overwhelming at times, but it is important to give yourself time to let go of all your worries and stresses. Meditation is a practice that I enjoy frequently. Daily meditation, baking, and riding my bike are all things I do when I feel overwhelmed. These hobbies or activities are enjoyable and relaxing to me. When I am super frustrated, mad, sad, excited, or stressed I turn to these hobbies or activities to clear my thoughts. When presented by a challenge it is vital to step back and assess the situation. What is the challenge, how can you overcome this challenge, when can you overcome this challenge. It is important to be honest and realistic in the expectations you set for yourself. Most of the time a major challenge will jot be overcome in a matter of minutes, hours, days, or sometimes even weeks. Each challenge is unique, and that is why it is important to step back and evaluate what your specific situation entises. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,399,"When life gets challenging I choose to overcome them by having my goals become my strength. For example right now with the situation of the corona virus happening it is hard for me to manage keeping up with online classes because it’s something that I’m not use too. I am a visual learner, but because of this situation I am learning to adapt myself with on line classes. Emailing my professors, watching extra videos etc. In addition, when life tempts to be challenging I don’t let it take over me. I see it from the positive site of it, and focus on what I can control from it. In addition, this has taught me to learn that there is no failure, but that is something we learn from. The situation of Covid-19 has gotten out of control, everyone is panicking, staying at home isolated from others, even families. Also, you want to purchase things in the store, and everything is running out, Leaving others in starvation, and not thinking world wide. There are other solutions to prevent yourself from getting the virus, such as staying healthy, watching hands every time you do something, etc. It’s crazy how a crisis like this has happened in a big country like California, and has been spread out though out the world."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,391,I am not one to back down from a challenge. I am also not one to give up. I have gone through many challenging times in my life but I try very hard to not let it get in the way of my life. If I am really struggling I ask for help. It is very important to me that I stay on track in school and in life in general. I like school and I think that helps me when I face challenges because it helps me be more motivated. I think that when school is the challenge I overhaul. If I am really struggling in a class I spend ever moment I can studying and I try my hardest to get 100% on all of my assignments. Usually for me the challenge is the test itself because I don't do well in a time crunch.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,390,"When life gets challenging, I tend to react immediately based off the emotions I feel at that moment. However, once that first emotional reaction is over with, I always take time to sit and reflect about the situation or the problems that I am facing. It's always a good way for me to deal with my challenges. I first analyze what the initial problem is and ask myself what did I do to get here, what happened to cause this problem, etc. Afterwards, I think about what I could have done differently to avoid that situation, however, I realize the current situation can't be changed as it has already happened, but I think about what I can do to avoid that problem in the future. I then think about what I can do to overcome that challenge, whether it's my own reflections or if I go to others around me for help or advice. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,392,"Amanda Friedman                                                                  What do I do when life gets challenging? What first comes to mind when I think of this question is the state the world is in right now. It has impacted everyone nationwide and life has been challenging for most of us for the past couple of months. Besides the fear of myself getting ill or a loved one, a lot has everyone worried. Having to move out of San Francisco a couple hours away and start online learning has been a huge transition, as well as loosing my source of income. Even though it has been challenging there are programs and a lot of professors supporting us by being flexible and making the rest of the semester as easy as possible. When life gets challenging in times like these, it is important to have a support system, whether it be a parent or a close friend to help you remember that this is only temporary. Getting outside and working on yourself is a start to get over the challenges we are facing. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,79,"When life gets challenging it can be hard for me to figure out how to solve those challenges. I usually get stressed and nervous in the beginning, but then I calm myself down so I can think logically about the situation. Usually, the way I stay calm is by going outside and exploring for a bit or taking a long nap. After those activities, my mind clears up and I find a solution to my problems. Some of those solutions usually require me to talk to other people because I find that when I speak to someone else about an issue they usually have some pretty good solutions and it's just good to say things out loud sometimes. I try to solve problems by myself first and typically it makes it more difficult for me to solve the problem so I've learned to ask for help, but the one thing that helps me the most is having a positive mindset."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,386,When life gets challenging there are a few things that I think of that I usually do. Like one of those is I try to step back and take a deep breath which of course sometimes is not so easy. The good thing is that when we do this we are able to recapacitate and do this everything does not seem as big as it once was and it feels like life is a little less challenging. I feel like this is actually very hard in the beginning but the good thing is once you learn how to do that then once the going gets tough one is able to use this and once this is used a lot it helps one understand that we have to look at our problems in different ways that way it allows someone to go through there life without the need of trying to do too much or do too little.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,389,"When life gets challenging, I tend to take a step back, breathe, and organize/ plan out my life for the week so I can bounce back and be the best person I could be. I feel like life is always a challenge because something new always pops up and tests me. I feel like these challenges are meant to be my motivation to keep pushing and working hard to achieve my goals. I feel like a lot of people give up when they are faced with a challenge, but not me. My parents always taught me that giving up is not an option. Even if I know the outcome will not come out the way I want it to, I still face the challenge because at the end of the day I tried and didn’t give up. With our current pandemic, I was very tempted to give up on this semester, but instead, I decided to make this semester my b***h and I am currently excelling in all my classes."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,394,"Jiayu LuPHYS 112     Because of the COV-19 virus, students are isolated at home and do online classes. For this physics lab class, it is impossible to work on the lab report without having the lab , for students require to use the materials in class to do the lab . I think there will be some labs for us to do individually at home. In my opinion, the challenging that I have to face are gathering the lab materials, complete the lab and write the lab report by myself. Before, I did labs with my group. I could ask help from my group mates and my lab professor immediately. Now, I have to figure out all the difficulties by myself. Although I can send email for my lab professor and ask for help, it takes time for me to wait for his answer unlike we can do face to face talk like before.           "
