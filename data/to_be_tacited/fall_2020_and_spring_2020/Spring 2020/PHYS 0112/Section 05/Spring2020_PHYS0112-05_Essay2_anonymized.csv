2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,386,There are a lot of resources that I have especially on campus because everyone is right there whether I choose to use them that is on me. I usually go to a tutor when I do not understand or I use study groups as well as TA's help a lot. THe thing with these resources is that sometimes it takes a while for one to actually start using them. To me all these resources are good but the one I use the most is youtube because when I do not understand form one teacher I go straight there because it might be easier for me ot capture how to do that specific thing in that specific point in time. It is something that everyone has at their disposal an it is a very good resource. Not a lot of people like ot use these resources and it usually just comes down to them being to lazy to even do it.

2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,394,"Jiayu LuPHYS 112     I think I need more information to answer this prompt question. In this physics lab class, my professor always does some information about the topic about the lab that we do at the date. The university provides good materials for students to do the lab experiment. We always do the lab experiment in a group. During the lab, students require to answer the problems from the worksheet as the lab report. After we finish the lab reports, the professor will grade them.     "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,399,"I have many different types of resources, specifically that can help me navigate through college. I have the SFSU library, EOP tutoring, Metro, the advisor department, and CARP. Specifically, I can go to the library to receive help in researching. EOP is beneficial because whenever I have questions about classes I have to take or even more information about anything they are always there to help you out. In addition, METRO and the advisor department are also very helpful, because I can go to them for the same reasons as EOP or even more. In case one isn’t available for you the other one is. METRO and CAARP are beneficial because when I’m stuck for a class they are there to provide mentors, and make sure you are understanding the material. Lastly, I have my professor as a resource, they are there to help me understand the concepts, and even provide other examples to help me better understand the material we are learning. We are very lucky to have many different options for resources, therefore we should take advantage of them. They are very useful and beneficial. They help us answer all our thoughts that we have. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,389,"I feel that I have several resources available for me to succeed in this course and others at San Francisco State. One of the main resources I have are my teachers. My teachers are available through different platforms, like email or zoom call, if I have any questions or confusion on the course material or if I simply need advice. They also have office hours and sometimes study sessions available as well where I can also get clarification or guidance on any unanswered questions when we had in-person learning. Besides teachers, I also have other available tutoring on campus, like CARP (Campus Academic Resource Program) and TASC (Tutoring and Academic Support Center). These programs are pretty much student tutors that assist on a range on subjects. There are also workshops that are correlating with particular science classes offered at state that help break down the material more to make it easier to succeed in the course. Finally, the last source I have is the internet and the textbooks that go along with the course."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,56,"Aya AlazzehPHYS 112 Reflective Journal #2	I am very blessed to have many resources at my disposal. I have emotional resources, education resources, support resources, and many others. A major resource that I have is my friends, family, and mentor. I have many people I can confront with a variety and diversity of issues. I have friends to confide in, parents to guide me, and mentors to inspire me. I have a wide variety of resources at San Francisco State University alone. The entire staff of teachers, police, students, and clubs are all valuable resources on campus for any and all students. We have the tutoring center, supplemental instruction classes, group x classes, personal trainers, and many many more. I have resources pertaining to my mental health, physical health, my academia, and others. In particular as I am taking many chemistry classes due to my major, the chemistry department actually has the CCLEAR room. The CCLEAR is devoted to chemistry students and is where all the chemistry teachers hold their office hours. Students in chemistry can go to the room and ask for help from a teacher, form study groups with the other students in the room, or just have a quiet place to study or work on homework. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,79,"As a college student we get a ton of free resources. Some of those being academic resources and some being financial resources. All over campus, I have seen all sorts of help on any topic you can think of. Some of the on-campus resources I have taken advantage of are EOP, CARP, and counseling. EOP so far has been my best resource in college because they provided me with my own academic counselor to help me with situations and they have also given me an EOP grant to help pay some tuition costs. I used CARP very often during my freshman and sophomore year of college because I needed a lot of help with some of my courses and the tutors really helped me understand certain concepts better. Lastly, I have gone to counseling on campus and the people are really nice and they try to help as much as possible. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,391,I think that I have plenty of good resources available to me. For most of my hard science classes I can take a sci class. There is also the code help center and all of my teachers of multiple office hours that I can attend. There are a lot of advisors on campus too and they are always willing to help. I don't utilize my resources as much as I should. If I am struggling i will go to office hours because i think it helps a lot in understanding something better. I also use advisement to helpe sign up of for classes and things of the like. I have never signed up for a sci class (I probably should). I think I have plenty of resources available to me and that I should utilize them more.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,392,"Amanda Friedman                                                                           What resources do I have?There are many ways that the phrase of what resources I have can be contrived. I have access to internet at all times for school and a laptop that I've had since high school. There were a lot of resources on campus before the Pandemic began but I have since then moved back home, where I am provided adequate resources for school and living. Having the library to quietly study and focus was a great resource, as it was easier for me to focus there. After transitioning to online learning, I am finding that professors are sending a lot more resources and emails than before. They are often available to chat when I have a question or need help on some work. Although my resources may be in a different format, they are still there for me and other students to access. There are also a lot of free sites right now like Rosetta Stone, which is free for three months as well as other free textbooks online. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,94,"Chris Seng  Reflective Journal #2              When it comes to what resources I have, I have many at my disposal. There are various ways in which I could help assist myself should I find myself in a difficult academic spot. I can always reach out to the first line of assistance which would be friends or classmates. Classmates can help assist me if I miss a day of teaching and can catch up on notes. We could also help each other when it comes to learning if one person understands a topic but another does not. Teaching each other is also a good way to reinforce what we have learned. The second line of assistance would be emailing the professor specific questions in which I could get a better understanding in which I can answer more properly on tests. Just simply having two different types of assistance can be very beneficial when it comes to my learning, but there are many more resources I can fall back on."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,5,390,"When it comes to this class or school in general, I have access to multiple resources. The school provides the library, computer, and internet. I also have my own devices to use at home such as a laptop, desktop computer, and tablet to get assignments, homework, and labs turned in for all classes. I also have access to internet to allow me to get emails and updates for classes and school, access my homework for classes, as well as iLearn pages to keep up to date with classes. "
