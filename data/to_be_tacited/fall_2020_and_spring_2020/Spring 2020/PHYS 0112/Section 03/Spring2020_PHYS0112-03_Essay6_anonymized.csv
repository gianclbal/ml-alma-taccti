2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,364,"This semester has been reaal rough, for reasons that everyone already knows. This new online learning setting has really gotten to me and made it difficult for me to learn. Not only for myself but my peers. My wellbeing is only scratched by all of this, as I try to stay strong through all of these hardships that we are all currently going through. With the ongoing pandemic and this new way of learning through online, I have really been falling behind in my work for all of my classes. This really has gotten me down but I still try to stand tall above it all, I will figure out a way to bounce back no matter the cost. With that being said I do not have any serious concerns for my well-being only for my educational needs. I feel like this new way of learning will really put a dent in my ability to learn. I have been diagnosed with ADHD and I have a really hard time trying to focus on not only schoolwork, but a lot of things in my everyday life. I have learned how to hone in my learning skills throughout the years but this new type of schoolwork will be a whole new obstacle to overcome, as I can focus a lot better if classes were held in person."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,365,"Maximo Nunez For me the change to online classes impacted me by making me change my daily schedule. Before the change to online classes I would use a lot of time just getting to campus, but after the change I had a bit more time and I think that it made me lose my sense of keeping to a schedule in order to get all my work. I still haven’t haven’t fully adjusted to all online classes because I still have a hard time trying to make a schedule when you have no reference on what time it is besides a clock and not when you get back from class. What I have done to try and make a sort of schedule for myself is to make coffee and then for a while I try to get some work done, such as working on homework or trying to make some progress on an essay. I also have had some trouble keeping track of what day it is now so I have to look at the calendar on my phone or laptop so that I know when things are due and try my best not to miss the deadline"

2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,367,"Overall, online classes and being unable to attend my school physically was detrimental to my mental health. From lack of motivation and energy to decline of my mentality with limit ways to hold on to them, it was very hard for me to adjust to the new schedule which just kept on getting extended over and over again. However, form this experience, I learned that everyone, professors, students, administrators, were human and we were going through this experience together. We were all new and unfamiliar with the new system and many professors were accepting and understanding of what challenges this occasion has brought to everyone. I felt like while I was struggling, the fact that I felt that many others were struggling just as I was made me feel like I wasn’t as alone. Online classes basically unleashed my somewhat contained sleep schedule and I was unable to find force myself to go to bed at the same time as I wasn’t getting as many activities done in a day to get rid of my energy. To solve some challenges brought to my mental health, I decided that spending time on what I love doing such as playing games to destress and creating a calendar to manage my schedule was helpful."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,368,"Ingrid Ortega  PHYS 112.03  May 10, 2020  221 Words  Reflective Journal #6   It has taken me a while to get used to online classes, being back home has made that  adjustment harder. Not just because I was used to my routine of going to class and the library and  studying, but also because I was able to be more independent and have my own sense of  freedom, while I was in SF. Now it kind of feels like I am back in high school, except I donÕt  leave my house. Classes have become a lot harder for me too, at least to catch up in or to  understand. Sometimes it can be overwhelming, and it can feel like IÕm not learning anything or  grasping the information as well as I would in a classroom setting. The class that has become  especially hard are my chemistry lab because apart from the calculations we should be doing the  actual lab, and it can be hard to understand the calculations without the visual aspect of it. When  it comes to self-care, I havenÕt really done as much as I should. I paint with my mom sometimes,  read and watch movies when I have the time. I try to use the weekends as my self-care days  where I can relax a little, and spend time with my family doing other stuff other than school  work."

2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,371,"“Describe how online classes have impacted your learning and what you are doing for self-care. What concerns do you have for your learning and your well-being?”  Online classes have impacted my learning and many different ways. In the past I have taken online courses, but some courses are not meant to be online. For example, my chemistry class and my physics class are very challenging to do online. Before this pandemic I could go to my physics class and ask my professors in person about any questions I had. I could also ask my peers around me. Now the way now I ask my questions are through zoom meetings and emailing my professors. Some professors seem to get frustrated when students don’t grasp on to the subject very fast especially during the fast-paced meetings. My chemistry class is also very challenging. My professor from my chemistry class has repeatedly mentioned and emails that he seems frustrated because of the 100+ emails sent to him every day. This makes me feel guilty when I send him an email asking for help on a question. I do make group chats with a student from each class. This helps my learning because we can learn ask each other questions which reduces emails being sent to my professors. As for my well-being, it is very hard to adjust to being quarantined. I’m used to always being on campus or hanging out with friends. Now I have moved back home and cannot do this. Even when you go outside people look at you strange, especially if you are wearing a mask. In conclusion, this pandemic has affected my learning strategies and the environment surrounding me."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,118,"The switch to online classes was smooth and quick compared to some schools, but some classes being online made it harder to learn because of the connection issues. I had some classes where the professor would disconnect at least once during the zoom meeting and another professor teaching with a pixelated video and bad lighting. Another con is the fact that my schedule got jumbled up and time was an issue, so it was hard to get all the work done. I have been going on runs when I have time to get myself out my house and not just go out for work or groceries. Other than that, I have just been listening to music when I do homework or call up a friend or friends just to see them and ask how they are doing. I am just concerned that my work schedule will change next year and learning from home will be harder since I missed going to class. It is a bit straining to do work at home and getting the motivation to complete, especially since I have mental health problems, will be rough. Hopefully, I can get through the next semester and that I will not be as stressed."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,372,"I have online class since the first semester of my college life. I always prefer to have online class other than being in class physically. Taking online class helps me to focus better since I totally have control of my time to decide how I to use it. In this case, I can take my time to do my own notes. Online class is very productive to me than physical class.  I use the Nintendo gaming product, Switch to do my daily workout at home to maintain my health. During this time, I have more time to read more books to maintain my mental health. Do not even mention that I have more time on my documentary films.  During more time at home, I have to more time to learn about cooking which also can help me to save money under this uncertainty time. Cooking at home also reduces the risk of getting coronavirus by interrupting with people.  There are so many advantages to do things online. Online class gives me more freedom to learn the material and do my own research of the learning. Life is still full of uncertainties, but we are taking control with our own life."
