2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,358,"How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?"" Well in my family we take education as all my family have gone to college so it’s expected that I do well as I have also examples of products of success in my family so I can see what hard work really pays off as, so when I’m navigating through college or classes I know what I want out of my experiences and what I should want to expect from myself so if I believe I’m not performing to my ability I will basically call myself out and try to get myself together so I can achieve my goals successfully just as I had seen my family do as well. It also motivates me to keep going as well because as long as I know it’s going to pay off and be worth it I. The end I can push through any hardships I come across."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,350,"My values that navigated me through college by giving me an open mind and being more extroverted. To be honest, I learned a lot of how to grow up while studying in San Francisco. In Middle school and High school, I was a sheltered boy and I didn't leave the house except for school and some kind of shopping. I didn't really hang out with friends after school or sometimes on the weekend too because I had Chinese school.It wasn't until when I started college that I was more free to do what I wanted. I can be more free, but that means that I am more responsible for myself and my actions but I'm able to explore what morals or what values I want to. So in a way, my values come from myself as opposed to my families or my community. In a sense, the friends that surround me are my community.How they help me through college is simple. This freedom gave me the wheel to my life and it's up to me to complete the course. I make every decision and plan out my work schedule so I don't overburden myself and give myself enough room for me to breathe. At the same time, for my social life, I learned to opne up and make friends to open up my mind to other's perspectives. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,355,My values of my family have helped me navigate through college because they have always emphasized the importance of school. Both of parents were not able to attend college and really pushed me and my brother to do so. I was the only one who is attending college like all of my cousins did not attend college so I was the first in the family to go to a University. I tried my best in high school so I could get accepted to colleges and all through the college has had its ups and downs my family is always supporting me. The values that my parents have instilled in me is the responsibility and a bettering for my future. I know that going to school and doing well is a step towards a brighter future. I aspire to work with animals whether that is being a veterinarian or researching in veterinary science in a Biotech lab.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,362,"I grew up with parents that engrave in my brain that anything you want to do, you can do it. With good values, and my Dad, would always say that if he could leave me anything in life was my education. School was very important, extremely important in my family. Right now I am perusing a second degree in Veterinary. I have a degree in Business and an MBA. The same values I grew up with and the importance of education is what I am teaching my son. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,357,"Reflective Journaling #4How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?	-The values of my family have helped me in many ways through my journey through college, three values that I use a lot, and that have helped me are perseverance, quality over quantity, and lastly being independent. When it comes to difficult tasks or a difficult class my parents always taught persevere because in the end, it is worth it because of what you learn along the way. The second value is quality over quantity, when it comes to a homework assignment I try to give it my all each time instead of giving half-answers or meeting the minimum requirements of a homework assignment. Lastly, my parents taught me to always be independent and not to rely on others because when you're independent you have the ability to control the way you live, and it even allows you to be more creative. Overall, these three values have helped so much through my journey to college in a way they have made it easier.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,352,"My community is very complex in that feminism isn’t a thing. I am Hispanic, so sexist roles are expected of me frequently. I have a drive that not many Latinx have for school as only 5% of doctors in the United States are Latinx/Hispanic. I aspire to become not only a doctor, but a surgeon. I dedicate myself to working hard and I am blessed enough to have parents that support me although they may not understand what I am doing at times. My mother used to get mad at me that she had to drive me out an hour and a half to my Science Olympiad competitions, but when I won those metals she was proud. It takes an extra step to explain to those in my community why I am on the path I chose, but when they find out that it is to help those in medical need in third world countries like that in Nicaragua, they understand. My family is from there and we go every summer, there are a lot of doctors there but they lack training and education. I want to be able to change that."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,348,"I have come from a family who all mostly dropped out of school. My dad, was the only one who graduated from a college, but it was a local college. My brother, who is special needs was not able to have a chance like I have, and this motivates me. He motivates me to want to do everything in life because he is not able to do any of it, I live this dream for him, I am going through medical school for him because of what we had went through to get him medical care. I have not wanted anyone to go through this, which is why I want to make a difference.  My dad motivated me to leave my hometown and my family because, yes, he graduated from a community but was not able to leave and live  the college life. Even though It was hard to leave my family, knowing that no one in my family had the opportunity to do this motivates me. They motivate me to do my best and the support me through it all. Seeing my grandma who had came from mexico and was not able to get a high school education has really taught me to value education the fullest because not everyone can do this. I am so thankful for my roots and my family, that I will be pushing to become the second college graduate in my family. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,347,"Some of my family's main values are hard work and happiness. I've always been taught to work hard at school and give it my all, and because of that value I have always loved school. However, my parents have also taught me to do what will make me happy and fulfilled. Whatever path, major, etc that may be, I will always go after it full on. This has impacted my college experience because it has allowed me to feel comfortable trying new topics, classes, clubs, or interests."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,96,"The values of my community have helped me navigate through college because of the hard work I've seen them put into their work. It's made me realize that if you put in the effort to your work, then all will turn out good. However that does not mean there will always be a reward as life does not seem to work like that. My family has helped me tremendously as they have used a lot of examples on me if I don't go to college. They made me realize the more opportunities I have and how much easier life can be. Specifically my parents who have high expectations have made me proud to realize the hard work they had to go thorough in order to send me off to college. To also pay for my college and any essentials I need such as pencils and books.They are people I value and without them I don't know if I would have had any inspiration to continue through hardships. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,346,"The values of my family that have made me navigate through college are values that I believe every student should have. Those values are patience and hardworking. My father came to this country from Mexico with nothing to his name. As he began to work he knew that he needed to save up some money in order to buy a car. Even though he at times may have wanted to go out he knew he needed to wait and not spend his money on unnecessary things. Eventually he got it. Later on he saved to an apartment, then a house and a new car. All of this while being patient at his work as the promotions eventually started to come for him. He is now one of the head supervisors of his vineyard management company and a very respected leader.During the beginning of his career my father worked at both a construction company and the vineyard at the same time. When I grew was a child he stayed with the vineyard management company and it stuck with me how much he worked. At times he would not even make at for dinner. When he did finally get home he looked incredibly tired yet, he never complained. These are the values I take with me everywhere I go."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,344,"My dad is a full-time Uber driver, while my mom was unemployed for two years. With a family of six living in San Francisco's high cost of living, we struggled a ton financially. Seeing how much my family struggled financially is part of the reason why I feel both obligated and motivated to finish higher education. The value of education is something that my parents have always emphasized, and so I am really determined to obtain my degree. While I have my family in the back of my mind, I would say my primary support system comes from my close friends as they are the reason I have been able to push through obstacles throughout my college experience. I struggled a lot in finding a path I thought I would be happy pursuing, and felt really lost and unmotivated for the first 1.5 years of college. My friends, however, are always pushing me to improve and push through. Even though I was doing well academically, I honestly felt like dropping out at one point. However, I'm really glad I didn't and I owe a huge thanks to my friends for that, as they help me not lose sight of my goals and abilities. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,353,"I can honestly say without a doubt that my family has done its very best to sacrifice the little they have to get me and my sister in a far better position in life than they ever could. I have always been given nothing but support and motivation from my family and it has helped me not be afraid to go out of my comfort zone and try to excel in things I never thought I could do. I know I grew up in a low income community and whenever I mention where I grew up peoples eyes might light up or say ""you don't seem like you grew up there."" The location has some effect on how we grow up but the people we choose to be around is what makes the biggest difference. The values of the community and people I was around were phenomenal and I have a strong tie to them to this day. If it wasn't for the people I have experienced life with then I do not think I would be a college student and future physical therapist. Not many people in my community have gone to college or experienced education higher than middle or high school so it was not easy navigating college. However, I have always been blessed with opportunities and was able to take part of an Upward Bound program which assists teens who are aiming for college and higher education. Being in the program helped me network, build myself, and become ready for college. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,107,"The values of my community or my family helped me navigate through college by some what setting goals/expectations. I feel like everyone has expectations, to graduate in 4 years, get a job right after college, and etc. Society has put these expectations on students and i feel like it puts a bit of pressure on people. Especially if you dont meet those expectations you feel bad about yourself. I didnt go straight to a uc or csu system right after highschool, i’m not graduating “on time”, and I sometimes feel like I suck as a person. Cause its like why can’t I do the same thing as everyone else, like am i just slow or dumb? Either way I have realized that everyone moves at their own pace and it’s okay to take your time, just as long as you’re trying. With that mindset I feel it will help me alot finishing up my last year at sf state and I’d be happier."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,349,"Both my parents never been to college and they struggle a lot as a child, living in poverty and having to work at a very young age. They were very hard working individuals who worked a lot growing up until now. Seeing how hard they work motivate me to continue to keep pushing myself and navigate through college. Like many of us, college isn’t easy and There were many challenges and obstacles in the way and that didn’t stop me from attending college and continue my education. Seeing how hard they work make me realize that I can do that as well. Although there were some bumps along the road I still manage to go pass through it. Both of my parents work hard to provide a living for us as a Family so I want to provide what I can to hopefully have them be more relax in the future. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,112,"I would say the values of my military community have helped me the most through life and college especially. The hard work, the maturity and the determination I learned in the Marine Corps have transitioned very well to my educational career and helped motivated me many times to do the very best work I can when it comes to my school work."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,356,"My families values have helped me a great deal in my journey through college. The first thing is the work ethic they instilled in me... when assignments are piling up and tests are around the corner I work even harder knowing that this is the moment that will define it all.... I use my mother and father as motivation. I think about how they are working long hours to put me through school and if I don't work just as hard I would be letting them down. My parents also instilled integrity in me so I'm not inclined to cheat or take the easy way to secure the A in the class. Due to my family I have a strong support system as well so whenever i feel frustrated, overwhelmed, or stressed I give them a call and they bring my back to peace. The character judgment instilled in me also helped me stay away from bad influences and make beneficial relationships. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,363,"The most prominent family values I feel that have gotten me through college are being true to myself, not letting myself feel small, and to be hardworking. I feel that having the ability, to be honest with myself about who I am and what I know I'm capable of has helped me in my college career in times where I've had to work together with people and most especially when to accept that I cannot do things all on my own whether that' be schoolwork or personally related. Also, making myself feel heard or present in a new environment has always been a bit difficult for me but my family has always encouraged me to speak out because I'm smarter than I choose to tell myself and I'm much more valuable than I lead myself on to be. Lastly, I don't think I'd be where I am if I wasn't instilled with the persistence of being a hardworking individual, I grew up having a single mother for nearly 10 years and in that time I saw that drive in a person that means so much to me and have always held it in my heart when I struggle that pushing through tough times will eventually lead me the good at the end. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,360,"The values of my community/family helped me navigate through college by helping me understand the importance of working hard and making connections as that will help you later on in life. My family also stressed the importance of being diligent and to strive for bigger things even if it may seem difficult. By working hard and putting yourself in the right position and surrounding yourself the right people, it will help you work towards and achieve the goals I have set in mind. Overall, I appreciate my upbringing along with my family and community I was surrounded by as it has shaped me into the person I am today and their advice and values will stick with me as I continue on to my future endeavors."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,354,"I've learned a lot of family values while being at home with them. Communication, honesty, patience, leadership. I've taken all of these skills with me to get through college plus learning learning more when I got here. Communication is an important one because I realized I can't go around without asking questions or speaking up on things or else I won't ever learn or get help. Patience is another important one because this school life does take some time to get where I want in life and I can't try to rush the process. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,351,"Throughout  my life, the values of my value have clearly helped me navigate through college -- especially the academic experience. One of the things my dad constantly told me as a child was to ""do it once and to do it right"". Now, though this phrase has many different ways of interpretation, the one he told me to focus on was the fact that whenever you do something make sure to give it your 100% effort. Why commit to doing something if you are not going to give it all you got? Instead you could be doing something proactive with your time. Many times also, if you are not doing it to the best of your ability you will end up having to revisit it later and it will just be a clear waste of time. In college this was very impactful for me. If I wanted to study, the best way was to go to the library or my room and sit and focus on my work. Instead of being in a friendly group and talking about other things -- that would just waste time. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,345,"My parents are both immigrants from Mexico. I always find motivation and inspiration from them. I am originally from Orange county which is over 400 miles away and a big struggle has been being very far away from home. Sometimes I do get home sick and start to feel more sad than usual, but then I remind myself that my mom was also only 18 when she moved from Mexico to the US and she was unable to go visit her parents. I am lucky enough to be able to still go visit them and spend time with them, when she was not able to go back to visit them for a few years. Also, just hearing about how they came here with nothing and now are putting me through college and still enjoying their lives is very inspirational. They have helped me get motivated every time I begin to feel lost. They have also tried to teach me to ask for help when needed and to go figure things out and not be so shy or scared to ask questions. Although I have been doing a better job at it, I still do feel uncomfortable asking for help, or don’t like to ask for help because growing up I have always felt I had to prove myself because of all the stereotypes on Latinas. I did not want to show any weaknesses since I was already the minority. But I am learning to be more open and to ask fro help especially since I am the first in my family to ever go to college. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,92,"It's kind of rough to think about this one because every since I graduated high school, 2014, I haven't really opened up or allowed myself to rely on other people for help. College has been a rollercoaster, I didn't figure out what I wanted to do until a year ago, and I'm still unsure if it's really what I want to do. My dad has added pressure that I have to graduate or I will not be successful in life and have many regrets. My mom has told me to follow my dreams, which I appreciate, she has added the value of freedom for me while I have navigated college and I appreciate that. As well as my sister, she knew what she wanted to do since she was young and graduated quickly, but she's never compared her experience to mine and told me to take my time and I will figure it out. I appreciate my mom and sister a lot for helping me navigate college, even though I haven't really done much but stumble through it."
