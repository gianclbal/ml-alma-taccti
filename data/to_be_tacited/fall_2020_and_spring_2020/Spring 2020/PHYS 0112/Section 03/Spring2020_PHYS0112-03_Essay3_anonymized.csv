2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,348,"When life gets challenging, I really try to take a step back and take a moment to get myself back together whether it is getting up and walking around for a few moments or just taking that time to take a couple of deep breaths. If it is more major I really like to take a day to my selfs, maybe go to the beach with my friends and have a day where I just focus on myself. I also really like going to my back yard and playing with my dogs, but then again that is when my problems are really big. But like I was saying previously for school things i really need to just sit back and relax and just give my brain a 20 minute break to really just get everthing together. It is important to give your brain a 20 minute break, it is better for your self and to retrain more information. When you over work yourself you tend to not retain anything"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,355,"When life gets hard I always try to remember to breathe. I didn’t realize till I got older how much breathing exercises really relax and recenter someone. I struggle with an anxiety disorder and I know how difficult life can get and how it feels to feel defeated. I think the best thing that someone can do is to find a strong support system to uplift them through hard times. Of course, you yourself should be strong but it is not a bad thing to have support and love from others. I can say that coming into my fourth year of college as a Biology major and I have definitely had my fair share of hard days. If there is anything that I have learned from moving out and being in college is that life is not going to go as planned. There will be hundreds if not thousands of hard days but you can get through it. There will be a day I will look back and feel proud of how I have overcome so many challenges. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,362,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?""I take a deep breath and say to myself ""I got this"", I think on the many times I had a plan or something I wanted to do in life, it seem so far, but I have accomplish many of my goals in life, goals that seem so far away. Now, as things get challenge, not only in my daily life, but in college, and with covid. I just remind myself of the many things that seem impossible and I had done them any way. I just take one step at a time, one lab at a time, one class at a time. Eventually, I will complete them. Taking every challenge slowly and working towards the goal one step at a time is important to not feel overwhelm and maybe quit. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,350,"What I do when life gets challenging is that I figure out the main problem and find a solution. As long as I have a solution, I know that no challenge is too much for me. For me, if there's something I need to do, It helps to do it one step at a time. Overtime, eventually you'd have completed half of the problem and with more effort put into the problem, eventually you'd have completed everything. The most important thing is to take that first step to do something and everything after that, the task becomes easier to complete.When I come up to a blocade, I take my time with it. I take my time learning and completing the task and however long it will take for me to learn these things and complete these tasks isn't important, but doing it right matters more. If it will take a long time, then it will take a long time. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,358,What I do when I’m faced with something that challenges me is that I take a step back for a second and take a deep breath and kind of regroup because I know if i let the little or anything challenging really get to me that I will never truly be able to bounce back and I will fall into to a slump worse than before and that’s not a scenario that I want so I know may best course is to take a moment and with a calm rational mind decide what’s really challenging me and how it’s getting at my weaknesses so that I can strengthen myself in a way and can make me better equipped to tackle the challenge head on. Because I know if you let life get you down you will go down so I chose to not my challenges rule my life I rule them.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,346,"When life gets challenging I have two reactions. On the positive side I will accept the challenges coming forth and make a great effort to deal with them as best as I can. However, in contrast when I take negative approach I become very frustrated and destructive. During those situations my frustration fills me with rage because things that I want to be able to handle seem to get out of my control. In order to calm down and regroup my family comes in. Most of these times the women in my life, particularly my mother or sister help me bring my emotions and find solutions that on my own I may have not been able to. Also, stopping everything and taking a moment to exercise helps me clear my head to then return to what was making life challenging. From there I can either confront my challenges head on or from a new angle thanks to the revitalization the exercise gave me."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,112,When I face challenges in my life especially in my school work I try to think of what I want to achieve in life and why I want to achieve it. I try to calm my mind and focus on one task at a time until whatever is challenging me is beaten or understood.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,363,"When life gets challenging I tend to feel a bit stressed but try and not to let it overwhelm me. In my opinion, it's better for me to let out and feel upfront about my stress than repress it. In order for it not to consume me, I try and relieve stress with activities I like to do like art, baking, or just even talking about it with a friend or family member. Usually, after this, I have a clear enough head to make decisions and plan stuff out as to face the challenge or challenges ahead and eventually get over them even if it was with a bit of struggle. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,353,"When life becomes challenging and there are many obstacles it easy to have a sense of hopelessness and feel as though giving up is the best option but thats just not the case. I feel as though when I am faced with a challenge, it is my upmost responsibility to muster up all the strength and motivation in me to keep trying and not give up. I know that there will be days that things become to difficult to understand but i know that I have a variety of resources to help me when I need it the most. I deep down know that this course has been the most challenging part of my college education but I am trying my very best to get it done and move on to my next challenge. This class will only make me much more stronger and I respect the fact that it is a challenging course because when I take other courses I will know that if I passed physics I can pass other tough courses as well."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,352,"My life gets challenging a lot of the time, but what really relaxes me when I sit down to play piano. I haven’t been able to play for about a month now as my life is a constant “on the go” kind of roller coaster. I simply haven’t got the chance to sit down until it’s 11 PM and of course it’s too late to practice that late unless I want to wake up the neighbors. I love to read in my free time too. When I was in San Francisco I would always go to the beach with my friend and read while she did her nails. We did that every week on Sundays after church we would meet up there. Sometimes we would go to the one on Ocean Ave or if it was a particularly nice day we would bring food from the dining hall and go to the one on Crissy Fields. I haven’t gotten a chance to relax lately because of how challenging my life has become, but I know that I will be successful in the end for working as hard as I do."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,347,"This is a very broad question, because I feel like depending on the challenge, my response changes accordingly. However, the first thing that I do is evaluate my situation and challenge. I have found that over the years I have learned to take a moment and process what is happening around me. This way I can form my thoughts and actions and will be prepared to take on whatever life has to throw at me. From there, it's all about persistence, resilience, and hard work to get me through a challenge and be stronger because of it."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,96,"When life gets challenging I just sit there and daze off. I think about every little problem I have. After I'm done feeling so overwhelmed and stressed, I then try to think about solutions to them. Whether they'll work or not, every possibility, I just hope for the best. I also really like talking to my friends about how my life sucks at the moment but only to about three of them because I'm private about these things. When life gets challenging, there's always a thought that goes, ""well we made it this far, so we can keep going while this is happening like last time."" It's always a comforting thought but it's also always easier said than done. Every time something challenging happens to me, it pushes me out of my comfort zone, little by little and I like it because I want to keep changing and improving. It pushes me to be brave."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,345,"ore recently I have not been able to handle situations when they get challenging. I have been feeling a bit depressed and more tired and just sometimes shutdown. But more recently I have been finding more ways to help my mental health and myself. I started dedicating more time to me. I started doing 40 minute workouts every day and even started drinking tea. I am not a big fan of tea but my mom always tells me that it helps with feeling better and its good for your body. I also mainly drink it for its caffeine, it has helped me with starting to wake up earlier and be more productive as oppose to sleeping in and just feeling bad for myself. I started asking more for help when needed and that is something I have struggled with a lot. I am finally figuring out how to deal with tough situations, and making sure to take breaks when needed. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,356,"When life gets challenging a lot of ideas come into my mind, but what usually works best for me is to take a step away from the problem and assess it. After stepping away from the situation and giving myself the time, I can see the challenge from a new perspective. Another crucial thing that keeps me going in challenging phases of my life is positivity. Having a positive outlook does wonders, the power of the mind and belief is huge.. case and point are placebos. It might sound cliche but I do think that you should never think the words ""I can't"".... think about all the people around the world making the impossible possible every day, they are human beings just like you, we are able to a lot if we apply ourselves and direct our energy effectively. Since I have a strong support system I am able to utilize it to talk to people and ask for opinions... this usually helps me alot. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,357,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?""When life gets challenging at times it may seem like you are trapped and feel helpless, but for me when my life gets challenging I can always turn to music to release some stress or go for a run or exercise in general. I honestly feel that there are so many things people can do when life gets challenging, some may choose to do them others may just face there challenges head on. This can either be good or bad, it’s good because it will allow you to become stronger as a person, and bad because it can be overwhelming which can just make the situation worse. No one really knows what happens until the challenge is faced, other help things people can do when life gets challenging is to talk to someone about it, that person may have a solution for the challenge or can help you come up with one."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,349,"When life gets challenging, people just think of giving up because it is too difficult to accomplish. Or what an optimistic person would think is that they will try again until they get it right. It is not easy to keep trying because eventually you will be bothered by your action or whatever you put your mind to. It comes a lot with confidence level too, with higher confidence you tend to have a positive mindset. You know you will be able to accomplish you goals in life. You are positive that one day you will achieve this and although there might be obstacles and challenges along the way, it is possible to achieve this. A lot of this comes from your heart and I believe many times a lot of people may start facing fear and doubts but life still goes on. I do think it is important to try to accomplish instead of bringing yourself down and telling yourself you can't do it or you are not capable of doing it. At the end of the day you will never know what you are capable of doing if you do not try. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,360,"When life gets challenging, I can sometimes tend to avoid it which is not the ideal thing to do. However, this varies on the circumstance. When it comes to challenges in school and academics, I take it head-on and look or go for help when needed. When it comes to personal life challenges I will try to make it better right away if I can help it. Obviously, there are certain circumstances and situations that occur where it is out of my hands and I can not fix the situation. So in those circumstances, I am super good at accepting bad situations or failures. However, from all there's situation regardless if its mendable or not, It allows me to learn and grow as a person, and makes me wiser from it."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,351,"When life gets challenging there are many avenues to which I turn. The first is meditation. Making my mind clear and just focusing on the simpler aspects of life calms me down and makes me appreciate all of which I have. Being able to have a clear mind also let me revisit the problem which I am having to see if I am making any stupid mistakes or if I am actually not learning the concept. After doing so, I revisit my lecture notes as well as email the professor to see where I am loosing my chain in thought. If the problem isn't academically related, then I usually call my friends and parents to get some advice on the situation that I am in. My closest friends never judge me and I am able to speak with them without hesitation. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,92,"When life gets challenging. . .I'm really not sure what I do. Of course I want to have the fairytale answer that I am brave, confronting whatever challenge is thrown at me but that is rarely the case. Realistically I think that I crack under pressure. When challenges start rising up around me I'll feel motivated that I can conquer them but I easily get overwhelmed and end up getting depressed. For example, with the pandemic, at first I was really doing my best to confront the situation, stay healthy and stay social, but then I just nose-dived into being overwhelmed with how different life became and the thought of adjusting to the new change in lifestyle. I mean, I'll total overcome the challenge at some point, I just taking longer than others because I'm not sure how to skip the phase where I just give up for a while."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,354,"When life gets challenging, there are times when I get so utterly frustrated that I don't want to do anything any more. I try to take a break from whatever it is that is making me feel overwhelmed. I try to breathe and relax and really take my time. I've been learning to take things one step at a time rather than trying to finish and do everything at once because that is when I start to get overwhelmed. If I focus on completing one thing at a time, it's a lot better for me. Next thing I know I've completed all that I need to do and I'm all okay. In conclusion, I take my time and take one step at a time when life gets challenging. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,107,"What I do when life gets challenging is not only try my best to take a break and clear my head but also plan out what I should do next or what I should do to help make the situation better. I feel like personally I just do better when I plan things out but at the same time planning things out really puts stress on me because I worry alot about the future and not really about what is in front of me/the present. One thing I definitely have to change or work on about my mindset is that I shouldn’t focus too much on the future and set such high expectations/goals for myself. I’ve noticed my smaller accomplishments are often ignored and I should really take the time to celebrate those. Setting such high expectations/goals will only hurt me in the end and it will be my fault, no one elses."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,344,"When life gets challenging, I try my best to take time to allow myself to process my emotions and relax the best I can. When I feel overwhelmed/stressed, I usually try to distract my mind. I typically will try to go on long walks, listen to music, journal, text a friend, or simply step away and take a break from everything. Often times I get really stressed out when I have multiple things to do within such little time. When this happens, I try to write out everything I need to complete in order of their due dates. In doing so, I allow myself to just focus on one thing at a time instead of thinking of every single thing I have to do. Another thing that I've been trying to practice is saying no. For instance, if I have a lot of assignments and my friends suggest to go out, I try to say no so that I can prioritize my work. I also occasionally will use meditation apps. Lastly, I like to workout/play basketball (although this unfortunately isn't possible right now)."
