2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,358,"What resources do I have to support me? I believe the resources I have to support me are, myself and my friends, but I believe my biggest supporter is myself because If I don’t believe in myself I can’t be motivated by anything else because I’m the end I should be doing things because I want to do it for myself not for others, because then at the point I will people pleaser and living for others isn’t a road anyone should take you should want to do things for myself, so with that being said I support myself in a way I know what motivates and my weaknesses better than anyone else so when I feel like something isn’t right with me or if I could doing better I then seek out help like guidance from friends to ground myself,so that I can get back on track."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,92,"The resources that I have to support me is my best friend, my mom, and my sister. . .but I feel the most important resource I have that supports me is my spirituality, namely the Universe. I rely on the Universe a lot to not feel alone, overwhelmed, or useless. I enjoy meditating and trying to be mindful of myself and the Universe and I feel like it adds a level of support that I really need to get through college. On a more ""physical"" support sense I rely on the benefits my parents give me for them being veterans, without these benefits I wouldn't be able to afford college."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,344,"I have a variety of resources to support me. My laptop, for instance, has been essential in my success for transitioning to remote instruction. Being able to use other resources for my education such as Khan Academy has also been useful when I don't understand a concept. In terms of support for my mental and/or emotional health, I am fortunate enough to be provided access to therapy through campus resources. My friends have also been an essential part of my life, for they motivate me and also help me find resources to support my overall well-being. Lastly, if it wasn't for my family, I wouldn't have a safe space for me to be able to go to every night, so I am extremely grateful to be provided a home and access to food. Overall, I think I have a lot of supportive resources that can help me get through any obstacles that come my way. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,96,"The resources I have to support me are my friends and family as well as classmates. Although some classmates won't be contacting me after this class, I still have their support because we are just a bunch of college students who are just trying to get through our degrees. They help me out with resources I need and even try to assist me themselves. Having friends meaning having connections as well as their friends and they are all so encouraging. My family has always been supportive even when they tease but I just see it as a motivation to shut them all up so when I do accomplish it, I can rub it in their faces because deadass I ain't playing games, I'm trying to get this degree. Also honestly I'm my biggest support like no cap, I be grinding for them good grades as well as working to get some dough to support myself. As long as you got yourself, you're good."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,112,"The resources I have to support me are obviously my family. They are my biggest supports and my source of motivation to keep working hard when I get discouraged. Another source of support I have i the school itself, there are resources for every student whether that be help with difficult subject I'm learning or just a person to talk to."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,351,"Throughout my life, I have been fortunate enough to have the support of both my family and friends. Having a good relationship with both groups are what allowed me to become the man I am today. They have pushed me to greater boundaries and have always caught me when I fall. Whether that is academic support or social support, my friends and family are two major groups who I know will always stand with me by my side. For instance, during the end of my freshman year I ended the semester with very low grades. Although I did not understand it at that time, my parents talked me through the entire process and showed me that it was crucial for me to pick up my slack during the remaining years of high school in terms of academics. It was their push that really allowed me to pick up and rebound off of my freshman year of high school. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,354,"I have a lot of resources that support me in my life. To start off, my parents are important resources because they help me with everything and provide me with the guidance I need to succeed and be where I am today. My school has resources, different buildings and different people that help with getting the education I am getting now. My professors are important resources as well because they are the ones giving me my education as well as providing other help in succeeding as well. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,346,"In my life I am blessed to have many resources at my disposal. This is not to say that I am rich or have made many connections with important people. Rather, when I put my life into perspective with people across the country and the world I realize that I have the good fortune of having several resources. Here in Napa where I live my sister lives in a non profit organization that is meant to help the community members of low income. At school I have several professors that are willing to help me grow as a professional beyond giving me a grade at the end of the semester. As a retired firefighter I have a great relationship with the local fire department and police department (both county sheriffs and city police). Apart from the resources that are personal to me, in my city there are several CVSs to obtain medication and restaurants to get something to eat. Everyday I thank God for all of these resources and the ones that I am forgetting of."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,357,"What sources do I have that support me? I can honestly say that I have a decent amount of sources that support me for example my parents when it comes to school-related things they support me 100% and sometimes even give me advice on what I should do. Another source of support that I have is my boyfriend, he is currently about to graduate in the fall, so he has also supported me throughout my college journey and life, when it comes to college it gives me advice on what classes to take and how to balance out my classes when it comes to exams he also helps me study. The third source that supports me believe it or not is music, I feel that music has given so much support because whenever I fell happy stressed or sad I can go to music and it helps, also I tend to listen to music when doing school-related work. Lastly, that last source that I believe has helped me have been the library resources and most important office hours, there I can go ask professors when I'm having trouble with homework or a topic learned in class. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,360,"I think I have plenty of resources to support me when I look for it or need help. You just have to look for it. FOr example friends and family are always a good place to start if that is an option. If not, there are always plenty of resources to look from at your school. I believe it is important to make connections with people as you can refer to them when you need support or anything specifically. I enjoy meeting people and creating meaningful connections with them as meaningful connections are often there to support you. Overall, it is important to know that if you look hard enough there will always be resources open and willing to support you."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,362,"The most important resource I find is the recording lectures, I can go over on topics I am confused, then I can look at my notes, if I am not able to go on the live zoom meeting I can go to the recordings and see what is happening, is a great way to keep up with class. Also the material in ilearn, the on line book, youTube is such a great tool, there are many videos on one subject so if is confusing in one way I can go to another video that may explain it better. Even thought there are many resources to help us, the recorder lectures I think are the most important ones, specially under a pandemic."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,363,"Some of the resources I'd say I have for this class would include, our recorded lectures, the textbook, land simulations, and videos, or other helpful resources I can find on the internet. I rewatch lecture videos to recap or when I forget how to solve a problem on the homework and find that along with the book and lab simulations they really help to help me figure out homework problems when I get stuck. When some problems of topics are giving me too much difficultly is when I turn to the internet to see if I can find things like videos that will go through a similar problem step by step. Another resource of support is peers from class, the first day we shared contact information and I feel that when I get stuck I can ask some of them to help me out as well."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,352,"In terms of financial resources I don’t have many. My parents are struggling to make ends meet since their hours have been cut short due to the pandemic, so I decided to get a job to pay for my tuition and give the rest to them to help for food and bills. It’s been really tough working to come home and do school work, but i know that in the end it will all be worth it. Of course I’ll have those two weeks to finally relax a little before school starts again! I have emotional resources as my close friends support me and help me through tough times. A few of them will even come by to spend the night for a study all nighter, this way we can make sure we don’t fall asleep and we get our stuff done. We take a movie break around 3 AM to chill and then get back to work. It’s really fun and I am so happy to be blessed with friends like these."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,355,"I know that I have multiple resources to support me on campus and off. I have free tutoring at SFSU and I also have Chegg that has tutoring that I can utilize to better my understanding of subjects. Another resource is definitely my peers making friends in classes really helps as we can work together to understand topics that don’t make sense at first. I really believe that I passed Chem 115 because of my bond with my lab partner and our ability to study to together. Having a group or at least a partner is really useful in any school setting. I am really shy and I have learned that I need to push myself out there to make friends in class to help me. Teamwork in some situations does help. Also, my professors are another resource as I can contact them with questions to better support my learning."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,348,"Resources I have to support me.. Now this is hard, I come from a family who doe snot really have much college advice as they have not gone, yes my family are my supporters, but they are all super busy. I believe the biggest resource I have is myself and the internet, whether it is me looking up how to get help on something or me going to sfsu and sending out emails for extra help. Since I had entered college it has been a learning process, I have talked to multiple counselors to make sure I have gotten everything done so far. I think another big resource would be my sorority, since there are members who are older they have more experience, I know I can ask them if needed. I believe just really reaching out to whom is needed is my biggest support. It is not always easy but I manage to stay on top of things."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,107,"The resources that I have to support me when it comes to school are the professor and other resources offered by the school itself. I definitely feel like I need to utilize these tools more and take advantage of it while I can. But when it comes to personal life, I don't really have that many people to support me. I’ve been feeling completely overwhelmed lately with just a lot of stuff and sometimes i feel alone but i do have my best friend and she’s been through it all with me. I’ve found myself completely anxious about the future and the courses i'm taking and overall just over thinking which i shouldn’t because i know it makes it worse for myself. I should remember to focus on the present to work towards my future, not just focus on the future and ignore what's right in front of me. Just thinking about support in general makes me wish i had more but It’s okay because i'm used to it at this point."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,356,"Very vague question... but it honestly depends on what I need support for. If I need educational support I have the library, the internet, classmates, professors, peers, and tutors to help me better understand the concepts. Fellow students and I usually create study groups in order to fill gaps in our understanding. If I need emotional support I turn to my friends and family. If they're far from campus I just facetime them and talk through my feelings or frustrations.... sometimes they just listen to me get things off my chest and other times they give helpful advice to guide me through my situation. In terms of health, I have a workout buddy which helps out a lot because we motivate each other to get to the gym even when one of us might not feel like going. For most personal things my support system is friends and family.... when we get to career or education i tend to use the internet or peers more. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,347,"I have many resources available to help me succeed. Although I don't attend SFSU full-time, my full-time school provides a lot of resources that help students do their best. These include academic and personal tools that are always available and free to use. Some examples are peer-to-peer tutoring, teacher office hours, and counseling and mental health services. On a smaller scale, I also use some other tools to help me do my best, such as a paper planner that keep me organized. There are also some other small scale resources that are available to students such as class slides posted online, teacher availability, and opportunities to work with peers."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,345,"""what resources do I have to support me?"" I feel as though I have many resources I don’t know I actually have. As far as resources to help support my every day I know I can always count on my roommates for help. Since they also are the first in their families to go to college, we are all learning new things and new resources and sharing them with one another. Over the years I have also learned that professors like to help and they are a great resource to have as well. I also know there are many other resources on campus that are available to me. A lot of the resources I know about are because I saw them tabling outside, or caught fliers with information. I know I also have all my fellow classmates as resources as well. I know I have more than enough resources to help support me"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,353,"In the summer I am not aware of many resources available to students but usually during the year I could go to the library, and other locations on campus for tutoring or peer assistance. Online this summer I know we have office hours available to us by our professor and if we cannot make office hours we can email and possibly schedule a meeting outside of office hours. We also have our group mates contacts which we were assigned in the beginning of the summer semester. I have also taken it upon myself to go online and watch videos on youtube or physics websites to further understand the topics we are discussing in class. It can be complicated and time consuming but I would rather get more practice and watch similar problems being done so that I can understand what I am doing and if i am doing anything wrong. I tend to work a lot as a physical therapist aide/trainer so I haven't been able to be on live zoom sessions or office hours so I tend to cram a lot of my work into my day off on wednesday's and weekends. It had been said that of we need help or extension to make it be known to the professor ahead of time. That understanding has helped me personally during this hard time."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,349,"There are many resources in school that I have helped support me, through education wise there are metro and eop advisors that helped me with many of my class schedule arrangements to getting into a class also for registration issues. My family and live in low income neighborhoods which may be a financial burden when it comes to textbook loans etc. recently I found out that there were an book loan site on campus which really helped me a lot and helped save so money off textbooks. And when I found out that there were these group pages on Facebook it also help relieve some stress because I know that textbooks are expensive and can add up. Also, knowing that advisors and professors are always there for me helps me relieve some academic stress because i can always reach out to them when I have any concerns academically or personally. "
