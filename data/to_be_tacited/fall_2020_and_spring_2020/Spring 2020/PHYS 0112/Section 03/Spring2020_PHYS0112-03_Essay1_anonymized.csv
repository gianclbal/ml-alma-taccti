Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,344,"When I initially think of ""Why am I here?"" I initially think it is just to fulfill a major requirement. While that is true, I also think it's important for me to recognize that this class will not only fulfill a requirement on paper, but also allow me to draw connections to my other science and math courses. I personally have never really liked physics, probably because it is more math than a lot of my of my other science courses on top of the fact that it is (in my opinion) a more abstract/difficult course. However, I think it will help me be able to have a deeper understanding and meaning of the universe, and the basic tasks that I do on a daily basis. This course will help me develop critical thinking skills, and give me a different perspective on life. I know I will be challenged, but I am determined to try my best to succeed."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,112,"I am here today in this physics lecture and lab class because of my goal to obtain a B.A. in General Biology and go to medical school. Like you stated in I believe the first lecture class I am part of the class who took this class because it was a requirement to move on to further upper division classes. This does not mean Im not interested in Physics, in fact besides biology physics is a close second on my top interest in school."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,107,Why am I here? I'm here cause my parents brought me here. Which I want to eventually repay them for everything they've done for me. They want me to have a better life than they did in which I appreciate them so much. This is why I want to be able to get a good stable job to be able to support my family since they're getting old. My dad is 70 and he's still doing hard labor to earn a living. So I'm here taking physics to finish my requirements in order to graduate. After graduating I'd like to go to dental school and eventually open up my own practice. School has always been hard for me but i'm determined to do well even though it's taking me a bit longer than everyone else. I heard that the average years it takes to graduate undergrad is 5 years now and i should really stop comparing myself to other people.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,345,"Why am I here? Reflecting back its crazy to think that I am living in San Francisco and going to school at SF State. As a kid I never would have pictured myself here today. I am over 400 miles away from what I used to call home, away from all my family. But I am here for an education to kick start my career. My parents have sacrificed so much to get me to where I am today. Therefore, my education and gradutating college, is not only my goal and dream, but it is also theirs. I must continue to work hard to finally reach my goal, and to begin my career helping people. This is something I must complete before moving forwards with it. I have learned so much these past few years in college and have grown as a person. I am here to also show to my family, friends, and other Latinx women that it is possible to do this and to pursue a career in a STEM major. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,346,"The reason I am here has several layers. If someone would have asked me if I would want to take physics in the summer at the beginning of the year I would have said absolutely not. However, with the difficulties the world is currently facing I have decided that taking this class is the best decision right now. By taking this class I am taking care of a pre requisite for medical school. Also, in taking this class I am preparing myself for my biomechanics class next semester. Though general physics is not required for my major (Kinesiology) many of my classmates who have already taken biomechanics have stated that doing this class has made that class that much easier. Though I would much rather have a vacation type of summer that is currently not possible. For that reason it is that I felt the need to instead take advantage of my time."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,347,"There are a lot of factors that have influenced where I am today. Academically, I've always been driven by whatever my passion is. Knowing that I want to be a doctor and help as many people as possible has led me to many incredible opportunities and learning moments. Although I may not know exactly what type of doctor I want to be, I want to gain as much knowledge so that I can excel in whichever type of professional environment I end up in. My biggest source of influence has come from my family and the people I surround myself with. I strongly believe that you should surround yourself with people who will make you the best version of yourself (as a student, friend, person, etc.)."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,96,"I'm here to help people, whether it means medically or emotionally, I just want to help. I realized that I actually really love helping others because I care a lot and sometimes I don't even realize that I am. Speaking as a doctor, I'm here to heal them and make sure I do everything I can to save their life. Speaking as myself without any occupation of any sort, I just want to love others and make them feel like they're worth a lot. Other than that, I don't really know why else I'm here. I think I just have it figured out that I'm here to be become a doctor and help those that are injured and to make the best possible recovery and I'm here to make sure my friends and family are loved and I show it. I don't really like thinking about that question but I'm happy and I love the people in my life right now."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,92,"Why am I here?I believe I am here today because I have a passion for knowledge and unanswered questions. Growing up I lived in an abusive environment with my dad and with school being bullied a lot, it caused me to become extremely depressed but the thing that kept me going and away from harming myself was the desire to know more about the world and the universe. In a sense it makes me anxious, but mainly excited, to know that there are questions out there that can never be answered, but it doesn't hurt to ask and adventure to find possible answers. The mysteries of the universe are what I want to discover. I feel like everyone talks about how everything is figured out nowadays, we can't philosophize like the ancient Greek and Roman societies, but I feel different. We're at a place where there is so much to discover outside of our planet! This is why I feel like I am here, whether that be just in this physics class to learn a bit more, or on a grander scheme of life as a whole. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,348,"The reason I am here is because of my brother marky. My brother is special needs and he is undisagnosable, he cannot walk nor talk and  when he was little we would take him to the doctors and a lot of people did not want to help us because he was a liability. It was really hard to find medical care for him and he often needed it. The very few doctors who had helped him and still do help him inspired me as well, they would always tell me they wouldnt chose naother way.  He has pushed me to want to become a doctor and help as many people as I possibly can. He has inspired me to leave and go to college and major in bio so I can fully understand his condition. I do everything for him and I cannot wait to finish and show him I did it.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,349,"Like many of us, we are taking this class to fulfill our major requirements. That is just part of the reason why I am here. I feel like physics is constantly changing and evolving which is pretty cool in my opinion. Scientists are always inventing new things and physics are able to help us to realize what things are done. But I also want to learn to recognize methods in solving issues. I also want to get a general knowledge of physics. Physics can help provide deeper levels of a subject and can be beneficial in daily life scenarios which can improve your problem solving skills. I also feel having a good understanding of knowledge and concepts. Understanding the concepts helps with comparing it to real life situations. It is also very fascinating to see how physics in today's world is affecting our lives today and what is happening in the future that can possibly benefit us. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,350,"You know, sometimes I ask that question a lot. I wonder why I'm here all the time. What is my purpose? I've heard a lot of answers, but the one that stood out to me was leaving a legacy.What kind of thing do you want people to remeber you as? It didn't matter if it was a world wide change or just making a difference in your community, as long as you were making a significant change to your community, that's what mattered the most.Deep down, the everyone wants the same thing: To live a happy and carefree world without having to worry about anything. I think that kind of answer is the best outcome any wants. Unfortunately, the world we live in is flawed, and everyone we encounter is flawed. It's within our DNA to be scared as a defense mechanism. People only fear things because they don't understand it. If everyone came together, learned about each other and have an open mind, the world would be in a better place.I, myself can't do much as a person at the moment, but my goal in life is to be in a position, where I can make a change and be an example to others. Whether it would be in research or as a head of company. That's the kind of legacy I want to be remembered as and a future I want to leave for the children of tomorrow."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,351,"Growing up in a family of physicians, becoming a doctor was very expected of me. In high school, my extra-curricular activities revolved around science research and entering college, even my major was based on the fact that my future was set in becoming a doctor. Being on the pre-med path right now, I can honestly say that this was meant for me. I always excelled in the life sciences and their connection to the real world always seemed to grasp my attention. From the scientific process to concepts that are so applicable in our world today, science was my perfect niche. Though the requirements for being pre-med are simply a year of physics, a year of chem, and a year of bio, I realized that in college I want to delve deeper into these classes and not just do the minimum requirements. This is one of the reasons why I am taking the Intro Physics class this summer. By finishing up this pre-req in the summer, I will have an extra spot in my coursework during my time at CMC to take advanced Physics and upper division science courses. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,352,"The reason I am here is because I want to be able to help others in the future. I want to be a cardiothoracic surgeon. Only five percent of doctors are Hispanic and I intend to be a part of that five percent. My brother didn’t go to college and my parents didn’t either as they are immigrants from Nicaragua. They were so excited during my orientation, more excited than me. My dad wouldn't let go of the cheap backpacks they gave us with the school logo on it. I am a double major in Latina/o Studies and Biology with a concentration in physiology. This class is a requirement for my Biology major, but I am actually very excited to learn about physics and how it applies to the real world and myself. I only took one physics course in middle school and I had to make a car that would move with a balloon, but I don’t remember if it actually worked or not."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,353,I am here for my third time and am motivated and confident in passing this course as well as actually understanding the subject. I come to this class not as a past failure but as someone with experience and understanding of what to expect. I feel that I am ahead of the game because I know what this course holds however I will go above and beyond to finish this summer semester strong. I am motivated to becoming a physical therapist and this class has been a huge barrier but nonetheless I will overcome it. Although this is a science class it also involves a lot of math and that has never really been my strongest subject. I am aware of my weaknesses and as a fifth year student I have learned that not speaking up when you need help can be your ultimate downfall in any class. If I struggle I will gladly ask for assistance because it will make the biggest difference. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,354,"Here today, I am taking this summer course which is only one step of the millions that I've took that is on my way to pursuing my career in the medical field. On this journey, I had to make many decisions that would best benefit me and my life. My mom has been the biggest influence in helping me make my decisions. She has guided me throughout my life in wanting me to be successful. In order to pursue my career in the medical field, I have to first get my degree in biology, which is where I am at right now. With this pandemic going on, it has influenced me to push myself to continue what I am doing because I have a lot of time on my hands to get things done. The BLM movement going on right now as well, has made a huge influence because I am striving to be successful to help the people around me. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,355,I am here because I decided that I did not want to become a nurse. I grew up with my parents always influencing me that I should be in the medical field. My favorite toy growing up was a doctor's kit of toys for children but as I have grown older I realized that my calling was not to work with people in the medical field. I spent my first two years of college getting prepped to go to nursing school and I had a realization I did not want to do that. It was such a struggle for me to realize who I was and where I wanted to be. I decided I needed to change my major and changed it to general biology. I realized my passion throughout my whole life has stemmed from my love for animals. If there is something that I love more than anything besides my friends and family it is animals. I am finally following a path that I believe I am meant to be on and the journey has been rough but I know in the end it will all be worth it to work in a field I am passionate about. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,356,"The reason I signed up for this class was that it is a prerequisite for my major that I have to complete prior to graduation. Although that is one of the reasons, Im also genuinely interested in Physics because it plays such a huge role in our daily lives and having a deeper understanding of that intrigues me. I look forward to learning concepts and theories that many scientists revolutionized the world. I also feel that physics is a very practical subject; by that, I mean that it can be applied to day to day life and utilized to your advantage whereas calculus not so much. I'm here to study hard and retain knowledge which will hopefully translate to an A in the class. My goal is to work hard and grasp an understanding of the topics taught so that I have a good foundation for when I take the next physics course needed. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,357,"Why am I here?My family has been my main influence. I mean seeing the struggles we all went through is something I wanted to change for my children in the future I wanted to be better. I lived in Mexico for almost half my life and I know how bad the situation over there is, you can’t really succeed and when the opportunity to move to the USA  and have a better life came up it was something I couldn’t say no to. I always knew I wanted to be a doctor but seeing how bad the system is in Mexico and how my family over there was dying because of Doctors who didn’t know what to do is when I really wanted to become one because I wanted to be the change I want to be able to help save lives and not end lives. I then chose to go to college in San Francisco because it was a city I always loved ever since the first time I went I fell in love and it’s a place where I wanted to learn more. I’m here because I want a better future."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,358,"I believe that I am here because I’m a biochemistry major and this class is one of my requirements and I believe that this class will help me and give me the tools  and a different perspective of things as I go on further into my studies in the chemical aspect. Because even though it doesn’t seems like it I do see some connections between chemistry and physics sometimes such as thermodynamics and vectors also I believe that I’m here to give me more options of the path I might want to take as I go further in my studies such as a chemical engineering path or bioengineering and having these basic tools will help me have some footing in the subject of I decide that’s what I’m going to do, also this class is important as in the stem field it’s used quite commonly as it can be so easily applied to the real and everyday life, so it also provides me with the basis of things I would need to apply to problems and that’s why I believe I am here."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,359,"Reflective Journal #1 ""Why am I here?""        I am here simply because it will propel me to where I would like to go. Goals are not easily acquired things, especially when that goal is becoming a healthcare professional. It takes a lot of hard work. I am here however not solely by my own merit but my family's as well. I am only able to be ""here"" because of them. It sounds cliché but it really is the truth. It isn't just due to the fact that they're helping me financially, which of course I am exponentially grateful for, but its more than that. They taught me the value of hard work and perseverance, that not everything comes easily-- that failing is inevitable but you can always try again. That is the reason as to ""why I am here""... because honestly, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,360,"Why am I here? I am here because I need to take a lot of science courses to get to the career that I want. I want to learn as much as possible, so I can succeed in the more specified courses that I will take later on in my academic career. I am trying to go towards the medical field later, whether it be a Physicians Assistant, Physician, or a more specific doctor, I need to take these classes in order to head in that direction. Typically I would say academics do not come easy to me, but when I work hard and stay on top of things, I find that I do extremely well. Going off of that, when I do well in certain courses, I find more interest in that subject and want to continue doing well in that area. This is the case with science for me. Although I have not taken physics yet due to taking other courses like kinesiology and human anatomy in high school, I want to do well and learn as much as possible. This way, I can stay motivated on my track towards my possible career choice. So overall all, I am here to learn as much as possible that way i can succeed and continue on my path towards my future endeavors. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,361,"Angelina NguyenAndrew SturnerPhysics 112June 24, 2020Reflective Journaling #1I never actually took a liking to physics because I always found it to be quite difficult to understand and I had trouble grasping some concepts. I took AP Physics in high school and my teacher was cool, but could not really teach well. Also, I had no interest in learning the material because I never thought I would come across it again. Three years later and here I am. I initially entered college with a business major. After about a year and a half into my college journey, I found something I was interested in and passionate about, skincare. I changed my major to biochem and of course one of the pre requisites is Physics. Because it is required, I actually pay attention in class and am interested in learning about physical interactions that we can and can’t see. I hope that learning these concepts will help me in my career later. Any knowledge that subtly relates to my passion interests me so I am glad that I am here."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,362,"Why am I here? I studied Business, I am a Veteran from Army, but something was missing, I wanted to fulfill one of my dreams, so I am pursuing a Veterinarian degree. Physics is a requirement, but aside from being a pre-req.... I have found physics fascinating, I have always like to know how things work, but when it begins getting too complicated I stop.  I remember my physics class in high school was very interesting and I recall learning a few things. A few years have gone by, but as we advanced in our class my memory is beginning to remember some formulas, I remember I loved geometry... Interesting how much physics we use every day and we don't even think about."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,363,"I'm here not only because it's a requirement, but a bit because small things have gotten in my way in my previous three years of college that have prevented me from taking it sooner. With major changes and not knowing where I land in the firsts year and feeling like I had to play catch up the following two and even in my last year. My determination to graduate on time, applying to veterinary school, and found love for science has me driven to taking these types of classes."
