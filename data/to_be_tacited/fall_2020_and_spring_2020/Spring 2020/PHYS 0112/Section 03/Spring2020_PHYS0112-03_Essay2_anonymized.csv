2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,352,"My goals for this summer session are to further educate myself and get ahead in my lower division requirements. This class is helping me reach my goals in terms of graduation and thought. With this class under my belt, I can move onto the Physics 121/122 and get my lower divisions done by next semester. I could then start my upper division courses a semester early. I really enjoy this class because it is actually teaching me something that is applicable to me and my life. I don’t like going to my calculus class because the teacher is unmotivated, monotone, and doesn’t want to be there just as much as the rest of the class. He doesn’t make it interesting and he doesn’t make it understandable. In other words, he couldn’t care less. However, this class is teaching me why things work the way they do. My professor is motivated to be here and invested in helping us in any way he can. This is by far my favorite class this summer session and I hope to be taught this way in my next physics class."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,96,My goals are to know how to learn the material and how to study for exams. I have a hard time understanding material. I can easily memorize everything but that doesn't mean I know what it means. That's something I truly want to work on. This class will help me achieve those goals because I will go over the material after class and try watching other youtube videos if I still don't understand it. I feel like just because I'm taking two classes during this summer that it should be doable and I already have been doing it at work as well. My goals are also trying to find different study methods that work for me. I have a hard time concentrating because I get distracted so easily. My overral goals are to just get better on everything I'm currently doing. I don't ever want to stay in one place if I can keep moving forward.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,350,"My goal right now is to complete college with two degrees. I'm doing this to find a good job that will get me to places I want to go, allow me to do the things that make me happy. This course, besides being a required class for my major, allows me to know the world more, know how the world works and use it to my advantage. Physics run the world and if you know how the world runs, you can work the world into your favor."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,107,"I currently have short term goals and long term goals. As of now my short term goal is to graduate undergrad and hopefully getting into dental school. I know the path that I’ve chosen is a long a difficult route but im not going to give up even if there are bumps in the road. How this class is going to help me achieve my goals is by completing this course, I’m moving towards earning my degree. I have one more year at sf state and I’m so close to earning my degree. By taking this course, I’m motivated to do well and keep myself on track. I understand sometimes things don’t go the way you want it to go but there’s always going to be a plan b. Taking this course especially is very difficult online since physics has always been a hard subject for me. But I’m more than determined to do well and keep myself on track while being organized (in which is helping me complete everything on time and keep myself disciplined)."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,112,"I would say that I have one main goal in life and other smaller goals. My one my goal that I set for myself at this point in my life is to achieve a M.D. in Orthopedic Surgery with a specialty in Sports Medicine. This class is helping me to achieve that by full filling a educational requirement set by the school so that I can move for in my degree plan. One of my smaller goals is to basically increase my understanding an knowledge in any capacity about the world of science, since the overall subject of science is very interesting to me. This class is helping me to achieve this smaller goal by educating me in a scientific field that previously I had little knowledge about. This class is increasing my understanding of Physics and is expanding my educational interests."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,348,"My main goal in life is to become a pediatric surgeon. I have always wanted to help people since I was about 11 and I have never give this up since. The reason for this is because of my brother, he is my biggest inspiration and can never get the medical attention he really needs. Many people, yes including myself have to take this class as requirement for biology majors and many of us do not take it to serious. However what they do not really know is that in medicine you need to understand physics because for one physics is in everyday life whether we pay attention to it or not. Physics really applies to x-ray technicians and cardiologists, but it is important for all good doctors to understand. When in physics we really need to understand the frequencies and wavelengths which can get a bit confusing. We need to pay attention to pressures and like i said revolves around everything. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,349,"My goals in general is to be doing what I enjoy doing and not having any regrets in life, and currently my goals is to acquire a kinesiology degree. For my goals in this class, I am hoping to have a better and deeper understanding in physics. This class is helping me achieve these goals by relating to real life scenarios so we can easily understand the fundamentals of the universe and how the universe interacts amongst another. I would say this will be beneficial in my future and also in my other major requirements. This class also provide me knowledge so I can put one object to another and also draw picture and put it into a bigger picture so that will helps me expand my learning in the long run, and this class is also allowing me to brainstorm and think about events and problems we may encounter in every day lives. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,351,"Originally, the main reason I took this course was to fulfill my pre-medical requirements. Taking Physics over the summer would allow me to take other courses over my fall semester which were not focused in on the sciences. As I only have taken Physics before in high school during my freshmen year, I had forgotten most of the information I had learned and wasn't really excited about taking this course. However, from our first class, I really enjoyed the topics and how our professor explained to us all of the concepts. My goals in this class really changed from just doing grind work and doing the minimum possible to achieve that A to actually wanting to understand all of the concepts and achieve clarity on all the stuff we have learned. I see myself now even emailing my professor countless questions as I really want to do my best to understand and learn as much possible. Taking this course I am not only challenged but also excited to learn about some of the future concepts."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,347,"My general goal is to be prepared to take the MCAT or the DAT so that I can continue my education and be on the path to graduate school. More specific to this class though, my goal is to learn as much as possible about physics and have a better relationship with the topic overall. Considering how bad my first experience with physics was (because of my old teacher), I want to learn how to not only understand it but to also enjoy it. This class is specifically helping me with that goal by being a ""reset"" button for my physics past. I am starting with a blank slate and trying to fill it up with as much knowledge as possible."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,346,"My goal is to pass this physics class and acquire the knowledge necessary to be successful in biomechanics next semester. Last semester I was told that is would be a good idea to do physics prior to taking biomechanics. The reason for that is because a basics understanding of physics would help smoothen my experience with biomechanics. Also, physics is a pre requisite for medical school so that is why I am taking it. My hope is to have a good grade to be the best candidate possible. Normally in medical schools admissions officials want to see candidates have stellar science grades. Honestly, I have never been great at any science but I love medicine. Previously I was an EMT and I loved that job but now I want to do more. Emergency medicine is what I would like to specialize in. I am glad I am taking physics during this time."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,344,"My goals include excelling in all my courses, completing my undergraduate degree, as well as earning my Master's in Public Health. Specifically, my goal is to provide access to and improve health resources (especially for vulnerable populations). I am really interested in potentially teaching (and improving) health education to high schoolers, going into Epidemiology, or working for the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) organization. This class is part of the process that will allow me to achieve such goals. I have a very limited understanding of Physics, for I did not receive an adequate Physics education prior to enrolling in this course. So, this time around, I will be able to receive a valuable and effective Physics education. By taking this course and fully engaging with its material, I am allowing myself to learn a whole new subject that I haven't been properly exposed to before. In doing so, I am challenging myself both personally and academically (especially since I knew I would struggle with the material in this class), This class is allowing me to expand my knowledge and make sense of the world around me. As a Biology major, I think it's imperative that I have at least a basic understanding of the other sciences, for they are all interconnected. As I prepare to take upper division courses, and eventually graduate school courses, I think being pushed to challenge my mind is something that is really valuable and will absolutely help me in the future (not just in my academic life). I initially thought required courses like Physics, Calculus, Chemistry had nothing to do with what I wanted to do in life, but exposing myself to different (and challenging!) material is crucial to have a better understanding and appreciation as I immerse myself into the science world. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,357,"Reflective Journaling #2My goals in life are to become a pediatrician and help people who can’t afford medical attention in other countries and also to pass the MCAT. In order to become a pediatrician, I have to go to medical school and in order to get into medical school, I need specific science classes like physics and to pass the MCAT. This class is a requirement for my major and to get into medical school since they do requirer science classes prior to applying. Also, the MCAT is a test of all sciences I should’ve learned over my last four years of college and one of those sciences is physics. I think physics is helping me achieve my goals because physics shows you how to do a lot of things that doctors might need in the future, for example, to look at MRI, PET scans, etc and I think that learning about all this physics is going to help me study to pass my MCAT in the future."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,356,"My goal is to build my understanding of physics so that I have a solid foundation when I move onto the next physics course. Topics in science build upon each other so if I have a solid understanding of the concepts taught in this class I will be able to tie topics together and have a more complete understanding. This class is helping me by providing me with notes which I will keep organized so that I can come back to them for clarification as I move onto the next physics class. This class will help get me thinking like a physicist and approach problems in a logical manner. Furthermore, this class will provide me with the opportunity to practice the concepts through homework assignments so I can assess my understanding of topics. Obviously, in an ideal scenario, I would've wanted classes to take place in person because I get a lot more out of it, but we have to work with what we have. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,358,"My goal is to get my bachelors degree in Biochemistry and also my goals in this class are to be successful, learn all the important concepts in physics and in the end come out of this with being prepared to go on to the next physics series. I believe how this class can help me achieve these goals is teaching me the tools I need to be successful with physics and also become a more well-rounded biochemist which will help me when I take on harder problems which might require a physicist perspective. That’s another reason this class can help me is that it helps me to gain the skills to think like a physicist, which will help me be successful in my learning, as I get to acquire the skills which most in my field my not get to have and them at gives me an edge when I’m ready to get into the career field."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,360,"My goals in life are to learn as much as possible and succeed in school so I can move on to a stable career that I like. However, that career is a physician, so it will be a long and difficult road ahead with lots of sciences. This class is helping me achieve that goal as understanding the basics and foundation of sciences such as biology, chemistry, and this class (physics) will allow me to move further into more specific courses later in sciences. These are all very much needed to go to medical school and to have just general knowledge so I can just be a well informed and knowledgeable person later in life. This class will allow me to have a better grasp of how things work in the world as I am a very curious person and always want to answer the questions of how and why."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,355,My goals are to succeed in school and have a plan ready for when I graduate. I plan on graduating next Spring Semester and I know that I need to do well in all my classes leading up till then. This class is helping me achieve those goals because I am requiring my prerequisites for Physics 121 and 122 which I will be taking this coming fall semester. I am nervous as I am nearing the end of my undergraduate in Biology and I know that these classes will not be easy but I can do it. This class is giving me the knowledge I need to succeed in Physics 121 and 122 along with knowledge for my chemistry courses. I took chem 115 last semester and my professor referenced a lot of info to Physics. It is truly remarkable how much these subjects correspond with one another to enhance your learning of each. I will admit that learning physics in this sped-up environment is challenging but I know I can succeed. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,363,"One of my goals is to earn a good grade in this class along with a good foundation of physics to be able to move on and be successful in physics 2 this fall. This focusing and keeping up with work in this class will allow me to be successful in this class. Another one of my goals is graduating on schedule and this class is helping me lighten my course work making sure I can take any other necessary requirements in my last two semesters if needed. Another goal I have is fulfilling my veterinary school prerequisites, and this class allows me to check off half of the physics portion and will hopefully let me have a better understanding of how to approach problems in upcoming science."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,92,"What are my goals?Regarding this class, my main goal is to pass of course, but also to try and enjoy it to the best of my ability because I am very curious about the mechanics of physics and this universe, I'm just not good at math. Overall I want to become a scientific journalist and to make a career out of documenting new discoveries and scientific breakthroughs. I lean towards Astronomy because that is what I have been interested in my whole life, but for now I am focused on learning the language and basics of physics. This class is easily helping me achieve those goals because it's teaching all of these basics and understandings. I'm a bit nervous that I might be misunderstanding or just not cut out for physics because it is so heavily math based, so I am just doing my best to understand the philosophical ideas of physics before you add the math into it so that I can convey these concepts someday in my writing, assuming my readers will be looking for an explanation of the science and not necessarily the entire math of how _______ was discovered. I hope that makes sense. I'm still trying to put my goals together, but for now this is the overarching theme."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,354,"I have set a lot of goals in life for myself, whether they are long term or short term goals. My main goals is to finish to the end, no matter what is in the way. Don't give up. I'll be at the end when I have reached my success and happiness. Stop procrastinating is another main goal, which is probably one of my hardest because I tend to do so most of the time, but not as bad as I have been before. Another goal of mine is to stay active, I enjoy working out, playing sports, and always doing things because I enjoy it and it keeps me busy and out of trouble. This class, plus the other summer classes I'm taking really helps me with all the goals I said in many ways. I'm taking these classes to be ahead and get them out the way and while being at home, I have a lot of time to do that plus it keeps me busy and I can work on not procrastinating."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,345,"I have a lot of goals in life, some bigger than others but as of now, my primary goal is to graduate college. I know I have struggled but I know I can push myself to get through it. My short time goal is to pass all my classes and get my GPA higher. I have been trying to not procrastinate as much and turning in assignments. This class is not only expanding my knowledge it is also helping me with making connections in the real world. I am currently enrolled in this class because it is a requirement in my major, however I find it necessary for everyone to learn a little bit of physics. I am very curious as to know how things work and have found this class to be very interesting. I am continuing to push myself to complete this course with a passing high grade."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,3,362,"I have short and long term goals. My short term goals was to be in a face to face class in college. Enjoy the life of a campus and complete my pre-requirements to go into Veterinary School. Obviously, this didn't happened as plan. I still have the same short term goal but in a different environment. I am taking Physics as a pre-requirement and it is amazing how interesting it is and how much we have physic concepts in our daily life. It has also helped me waking up my mind again and thinking, analyzing more. I Another short term goal is to keep my spirit up, the whole pandemic, and the time it is taking can drag you down. It is good to be in school right now with everything that is going on in the world, because it keeps your mind occupy. My long term goal, well is to apply for Veterinary School by Spring 2021. I am planning to go to Granada, but it may be on line as well... "
