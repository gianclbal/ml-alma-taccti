2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,62,"My goals are to excel in my academic work and receive high marks in my classes. This class is helping me achieve these goals by responding to all my emails, recording lectures, and being very flexible. I am currently taking 12 units, which includes organic chemistry I + lab. I have three classes that overlap in zoom sessions, so I alternate between the courses that record their lectures in attending the live lectures. Knowing that one of my very important lecture courses are being recorded makes it easier for me to keep up with the course and take notes on the lecture later that day when I do not have another zoom session. It relieves a lot of stress I had going into the summer semester. I really like mastering physics, which helps A LOT in achieving my goals because it has a textbook page linked to go to when I am stuck. Also, this class is helping my goals by keeping me productive and working. I am trying to procrastinate less and less and get into the habit of studying without distractions for when I am studying for my MCAT next summer. I need to instill keep up these good study habits and this class is helping me do so. Also, I want to emphasize that having a kind and encouraging professor helps a lot. It doesn't feel like the professor is against the class (making things impossible, which has been the case in the past) so THANK YOU!!! "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,316,"My current educational/career goal is to finish my undergraduate degree in Biology with a minor in business and then work a little bit before applying to PA school. I am honestly taking this class because it is a requirement for my major.  Although the class itself does not have a direct connection to my goals, it is still relevant. For example, forces being applied to the body during trauma accidents, fluids and viscosity of blood, and studying EKGs. However, I think I will gain valuable skills from taking this class. Some of these skills include; critical thinking, problem solving, persistence and clarifying confusions. Gaining and improving those skills are not only going to be useful for my educational/career goals, but in everyday life as well. We constantly are faced with difficult situations where we need to think critically and analyze the situation in order to make important decisions."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,317,"My long term goal is to become a physical therapist in san francisco. I am almost positive that I want to live and work in san francisco in the future. I really hope I am able to buy a house in the city but before I can buy my house, I would like to provide for my parents first. My older sister and I always talk about how after college when we are employed, first thing we're going to do is get mom and dad their own house! They really deserve it and I just want my parents to live comfortably after years of working hard providing for my sister and me. For now, my goal is to graduate with a degree in kinesiology and go to UCSF for graduate school for physical therapy. This class is a prerequisite for the major so pretty much without this class, I wouldn't be able to get into the kinesiology major, then I wouldn't be able to get into PT graduate school, and I won't be able to become a PT. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,318,"Educationally, my goal is to get my degree in kinesiology. With my degree, I hope to either continue with my education in grad school or medical school. This class will be able to provide me the need to understand physics and the concepts it holds. Before this class, I did not have a lot of knowledge of physics; it has been years since I had taken a physics course back in high school, so anything I learned back then is practically gone. The class so far has taught me about forces and the motions they can move in. It has been interesting learning about the things that practically happen in our everyday lives. However, I have had some difficulties with remembering equations, but its helping to improve my memory on being able to recall the equations in I need to. This class will help me with reaching the goal that I have set."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,319,"My goals for this class are to leave it with a strong foundational background in order to go into physics 2, when I tell myself that I want to get an A in this class, what that means for me is that this class will help strengthen my math skills and my knowledge for how the world works. In general, my goals for college are to graduate with strong grades and leave with a lot more knowledge than I came into, I really want to go to nursing school after so I hope to leave college with those prerequisites. This class is helping me to archive those goals because it will give me a strong foundation to go into physics 2 and it will hopefully strengthen my math and comprehension skills. Math is a subject that i struggle with so all of the classes that I take that involve math I always try my hardest at so I can really take a lot from the class."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,320,"My goals are to gain a better math skills, improving my studying habits, as well as being able to finish school within my emphasis of study. The Earth Sciences department is a great department, but very small and upperclassman classes for Ocean, Weather, and Climate are becoming seemingly harder to come by. While I've always loved physical science, I don't have a strong background in math (and this is my first ever physics class). This tends to give a very strong impostor syndrome; and that when I don't understand something, I find it tends to be hard to articulate what I don't understand or find it hard to pinpoint why I might be confused about a topic/concept being taught in a math-heavy course. I do hope to start attending tutoring through the school or office hours."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,321,"My current goal is to take as many classes as I can without overloading myself so that I can graduate by Spring 2021. I want graduate as soon as possible because I took too long to decide what I wanted to do that resulted in me having to attend college for five years. It isn't bad because four years is so unrealistic if you consider that everyone will want to change what they want to do last minute. Even if people knew what they wanted to do since they were younger, they would still have lots of other things that will interest them throughout the years. This class is helping me achieve my current goal because it is is helping me knock out a core requirement that I didn't know I had to take. If I knew I had to take physics, I would have taken it in community college so that I didn't have to worry about it. It didn't say anything on the transfer requirement so I didn't even bother taking physics, chemistry, or even any government or history classes. I think that they should let all students know without having  to talk to a counselor because not everyone has the time to talk to a counselor."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,61,My goals for this lab is to understand the basics of physics and learn about something i may have heard of before or something new .  I also wish to understand the material already covered better so that i can be successful in this course . I also want to understand the lab so i can write a thoughtful response to it .   My goal is to always be present in both lecture and lab so that i can learn to the best of my ability .  I feel like being online and present helps me achieve my goal of understanding this material . i think it is good practice for what i might except courses to be like in the fall.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,322,"My goals are to achieve an environmental sciences degree, and if I’m lucky to get accepted, pursue graduate school. This class will help me achieve these goals by giving me the opportunity to engage in constructive learning of what I believe is a concrete foundation of what I’ll need not only in graduate school, but also in the specific sphere of job orientation I should decide later on. I say later on, because I’m still a tad uncertain of what field I’d like to see myself in; I’ve been unable to get in touch with advisors ever since the shutdown began back in March, and this is especially inconvenient because based on what I’ve heard, the environmental sciences field is still a very “new” field of work, which risks that whatever I might try to focus on learning now in niche topics might be outdated by the time I graduate. But regarding this class, however, I had friends that studied it in high school, so the way I see it, I’m making up for lost time and can see it’s something I need."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,323,"In 2018, as a BECA major here at SFSU, I did not feel that I was pursuing something that I truly cared for a loved. During the semester, in order to satisfy the upper division GE requirements, I decided to enroll in a couple of environmental science based courses. I have always been interested in the state of our planet, along with non-human lives that are ubiquitous around us, these courses flung the door wide open for me to pursue a new major, Environmental Science. This decision came with added time at SFSU due to the various pre-req for the major including Physics, but I deemed that it was more than worth it. This class is one of the barrier that I have to overcome, but I'm not here to just coast through the course, but rather hone in new skills that will aid me in my academic and perhaps professional career."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,324,"My current goal is to first remain sane during this 4 month quarantine we've been in. I've been struggling to stay motivated during this entire process which is crucial being that I am in four summer classes and still have work I need to get done. Staying motivated seems like such a general goal but in this pandemic it's a very challenging one. This class can help me achieve this goal by keeping me in tune with the world. Although, in lockdown, I'm still a student first and remembering why I'm here as a student is crucial to not interfere with the wavering thought process that quarantine can put you in. My goal is to go to physical therapy school in Southern California once I get my undergrad. I am so close to obtaining my undergrad but fear that if I don't chase after this primary goal of staying motivated, I could be set back due to bad grades due to this pandemics affect on my mental state at times. However, yes my main goal is to stay motivated and go to PT school. Passing this class would enable me to reach the requirements to get my undergrad and further my education. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,325,"I typically divide my goals into two basic categories: short-term goals and long-term goals. The short term goals are usually school related deadlines, work tasks, and even personal goals within my hobbies. My long term goal is a more involved idea. My biggest goal for life in general is broken down into 3 categories family, profession, and environment. I am very fortunate to come from a solid family, and it is part of my goal in life to further extend that foundation to others around me. Another goal of mine is to join the health care field. I originally wanted to become a nurse. However, my last semester of community college I had the opportunity to volunteer at Shriners Hospital for Children (Sacramento,CA) in the Surgery unit. This experience inspired me to change my goal to becoming a doctor that specializes in some area of surgery. Lastly, I am a huge advocate for sustainable sourcing of food and deterring poor environmental choices from local/state/federal government. I come from an ocean-loving background so I believe that humans are not above the ecosystem, and my goal is to try to protect as much as possible for the future generation. In conclusion my big life goals are to become a doctor so I can try to inspire others similarly to how I was inspired, to continue to carry and share healthy family values, and to help protect our environment when it is threatened. Although this class is a requirement, I am thankfully for the opportunity to merge calculus with physics to create a more wholesome understanding of graph-related concepts. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,326,"There are many goals that I have that I wish to achieve. One of the major goals that I have is to graduate from college. Both of my parents graduated college and my brothers are also in college, so I just want to be a part of that group in my family that went to college and finished with a degree. Another goal that I have is to get into a sports related job field with my degree in Kinesiology. It has always been a goal of mine to be in a sports related job and this class can help me get there. Finally, a personal goal of mine is to be a great student athlete. I am a baseball player for another school (CCSF) but i also go to school at SF State, so my schedule can get very busy at times. However, all I can control is that I get good grades and I perform well on the field.This class can not only help me with graduating and getting a good job, but this class can also expand my knowledge so that I can succeed in my future job as well. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,327,"My goal is becoming a PA in the future. Also, I would like to bring what I learn from school to apply to everyday life. This class is one of many classes I have to take to achieve my goal. I am majoring in Kinesiology, and this class is required to graduate B.S in Kinesiology. In addition, I hope this class can teach me useful tips and knowledge that I can explain what happens in everyday life. Now, I am studying about 2D motion, and this is good to apply to estimate about a range of jumping cliff and its height. It is very exciting to see the application of physic in everyday and recognize that I have learned this knowledge. Another example, If I push a fridge on the floor, I just need help the first push to overcome the friction and after that I can do it by myself. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,115,"My goals in life are to become a surgeon, to continue growing throughout my entire life, and to continue to be a good friend/sister/daughter/significant other.  This class will set me up to take physics 2, which will both fulfill requirements for medical school and help me to prepare for the mcat. I have also noticed that our focus on analysis of problems may become applicable to other areas of life.  Learning strategized analysis may help me to continue to grow and learn throughout life.  I feel often times I see people past 40 stuck in their ways, ideals or beliefs without wanting to hear all sides of a situation but I have never understood why or how that is beneficial.  I hope I can works to avoid becoming like that through the use of analysis skills! And I am hoping this will also help me to stay a good person!"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,328,My goals for this class is to earn credit for the physics class and also learn more in-depth physics content. It has been a long time since I took a physics class and it wasn't a very hard physics class so I honestly do not know a lot so this is really helping me learn more. This class is helping me achieve these goals because it is helping me learn more about physics and also since it is a summer class it is helping me earn more units which will help me graduate early which is sweet. I also really appreciate the set up of this class that we are still able to work and do other things as long as we are accountable so in that way this class is really helping me remain financially stable in this time period.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,111,"My current goal is finishing up all my required classes for my major. I'm majoring in pre-biochemistry but before it becomes my official major I have to do a set of required classes. For example, physics is one of the required classes for my major. I have been trying to keep up with my major's roadmap so I finish my requirements. Another goal is graduating in four years because I was told that often science majors often graduate in 5-6ish years because of all these pre-reqs and required classes. This class is helping me reach both goals because rather than doing general physics 1 in the fall, I'm getting a head start and doing it this summer. So this physics class is helping me achieve my goal. I still have a couple of required classes left but this summer physics class is helping me get a head start especially for my prereqs. I'm also on track in graduating in four years too!"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,329,"My goals are to not be a procrastinator and to really focus on the core part of the material instead of lightly skimming or going through each lesson.  I feel like some of the courses I have taken in the past I have learned how to do something or learn how to write the answers to questions but never really know why is this the answer.  I don't ever go deep into the lesson and realize why the steps that I do and why the work that I do is important and how it is really useful.  Basically, it is to look at the big picture of my assignments and lessons to know the reason and importance of what I am learning.  This class can help me achieve these goals because there are many questions that are popped in, like the lab, that asks how is this lesson or work related to my everyday life.  I feel this is a great example of implementing my everyday life and real life examples into the lesson or work that I do to get a sense of why I am learning this topic or subject."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,330,"My main goal (and this has been my goal for seven years) is to become a psychiatrist and medically, as well as therapeutically, help families who are going through what my family went through (without help from professionals). As I stated, I want to medically help people who are suffering mental diseases. My father is a recovering alcoholic, and with each relapse, I get more driven to stay on my path and make sure to learn as much as I can about alcoholism. It deeply shook the relationship I have with him. This class, although it doesn't directly relate to my goal, does allow me to apply abstract thought into an actualization. I'm also a firm believer in the notion that absolutely everything (especially in science classes) connects with each other. So, with that in mind, I'm sure that with this solid 1st step into the physics world, I'm able to not only actualize abstract thought (in the physics class), but also actualize my goals in life. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,331,"My goals are to pass this class and move on to physics two, hopefully if the corona-virus hasn't killed us all or the economy crashing yet, but all Seriousness and jokes to the side my other goal would be also trying to be more prepared for exams that are coming up in the near future, and my last goal is to overall finish my last year in college strong and earn my degree in kinesiology that I been working towards for the past six years. this class is helping me achieve my goals because what this class is one of my requirements to get my degree and it's helped me understand concepts that I wasn't able to learn in high school such forces and newton's laws and it has also help me understand why physics has always applied in my daily life without me evening knowing it until this day."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,332,My goals are to pass all of my classes with at least B's or A's so that I can graduate with honors and reach my long time goal of reaching/ getting accepted to a DPT program. This class is very challenging but I enjoy a challenging class regardless of its difficulty or amount of work. I've never really taken an actual summer class that challenging so this is very new to me especially since I'm taking 11 units this summer. So all of these classes are really challenging me but I'm giving it my best and reaching high. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,333,My goals are to finish my undergrad and be able to move on to medical school. Its been a long time since I have felt this sort of challenge in school because math has always been a difficult subject for me I've always left it for last to try to leave the hardest for last. I think It may have been a bad idea but still I'm here. This class is also helping me achieve this goal because this is a pre req for me to be able to graduate and for medical school. I think this class has made me think deeply about what's around me and how it works. It also is giving me understanding on why we stand on the ground and why maybe some peoples bones wear out after sometime. This class has cleared up my understanding for a lot of things that I had overall questions for.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,334,My goals are to learn how the world works around me. This class is helping me achieve the sgoal by teaching the physical means in which the world functions. We learn the laws that define our world and universe and make sense of what is happening around us and why it is happening. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,335,"I have a few different goals. My first goal is to be successful when I become a Speech Language Pathologist. I want to be the best SLP I can be for my clients and I know the hard work and dedication that is needed to accomplish this goal. My second goal is to better control my blood sugar levels. I have been type1 diabetic since I was two and a half years old and I need to monitor it better some days because I let my stress and other activities become my first priority when in reality, my diabetes always comes first. This class can help me with these goals because I know the hard work and dedication that is needed to do well in this class and I am putting in a ton of hours to make sure I am successful."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,101,"Since I’m a kinesiology major, I hope that this class gives me the foundational knowledge I need for my career. Physics is a required class for biomechanics, which uses both biology and physics together. I also haven’t took physics in a while so I hope that I can relearn the concepts with this class. When I took conceptual physics a few semesters ago, I didn’t do too well so I thought it would be the same for this class. However, there are a lot of resources that can help me succeed in this class, like tutoring and additional help from Andrew. This class also is collaborative, which I appreciate because working with peers makes me feel more secure in a class. I think I can reach my goals in this class as long as I put a lot of effort and reach out for help when I need it the most. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,336,"My goals for this class are to have a better understanding of physics that I can apply to biomechanics.  I would like to feel more comfortable in my intuition for ""the way things work,"" especially as I apply those concepts to the human body.  Rather than try to memorize information, I'd like to be able to reason through problems and have a better foundation of understanding to solve problems.  In the future I hope to work with people in strength and conditioning, and I'd like to help them make improvements in their particular sport or type of exercise.  I think physics will also help with this in terms of problem solving.  It will be my job to consider all of the variables from the individual I'm working with, and know what I need to add, subtract, or modify in order to help them best.  Problem solving in physics asks us to look past the numerical values given, and consider what else we know, and I think this is a skill that is very tranferrable.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,337,"For this week's reflective journaling, I want to say that my goals are that to pass this class with a B or higher. I really want to fix my school habits such as sleeping early so that I could do my work earlier. I also would like to be able to attend class more often because I believe that will help me understand the concepts better. So far, I am not very happy with my performance for this class. I did not know that I needed to do every single questions in the packets so I skipped the sample and challenge questions. By skipping those parts, I scored really low for those packets. I hope to be able to do better on the upcoming packets because that will help my grades a lot. Hopefully I am able to go back and do those again if you let me. I think I am doing pretty well in the actual lecture class but I did miss a homework which I am planning to finish for partial grade. My next goal is to be able to finish all my homework on time."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,60,"My goals currently at the moment vary depending on the time frame I have in mind. Right now my current goal is to get a good grade in all of my summer classes, I already finished a summer class so only three more classes to go. Another more short term goal I have right now is to prioritize my mental health because this has been the most stressful summer I have ever had because of not only the course load but also with this pandemic impacting me greatly since I’m stuck at home with more people than I’d like and I can’t see my partner very often so the prioritization of my mental health is so important to me right now but still very difficult. A long term goal is med school which is why I’m taking this class, because it is a requirement for my major but also because it is a requirement for most med schools."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,338,"My goals are to apply to medical school in the next 2 years and apply to specifically MD/PhD programs. I chose this careers path because I have a  passion for research and but I am equally passionate about providing health care as a provider. I want to focus on the underpinnings of disease that are rooted in the oppression and disparities faced by marginalized groups. With that, I am currently taking this course in my Master's program to be able to be able to apply to medical school as physics I & II is one of the requirements for medical school. As a side note, I love astrology and learning about the basics can give me the leverage to understanding some of my favorite space movies and shows (ie. the cosmos).   "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,339,"My goal from this class is to primarily know what is physics how to approach problems that has to do with physics. Second is It is a class that I need to take for my major. Honestly, I never liked physics and it because of the instructors I had in the pass, but now that Is changing and I am liking this class, because what is most important is the organization of it and the explanation of the material is not complicated as what I thought it would be. On the. other hand, this class is helping me learn how to approach physics situations and not just homework or in class problems but real life situations and problems. With that been said I think that physics is a very interesting class, it is not easy but I feel like we all should learn and know about it. lastly, I want to thank you for the opportunity to talk about this. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,340,My goal is to graduate college in 4 years. Hopefully go to grad school or medical school or any school or path I choose to take after. I hope to figure out my concentration in my major soon so I can achieve graduating on time. This class will help me get to my goal because it is a requirement to get into other classes. Im a little behind in credits so taking this course in the summer will really help me get back on track. Taking this course can also help me determine if I may want to change my major to chemistry. I enjoy chemistry and doing some research chem and physics go together. So my though is if I enjoy this class and get it like I get chemistry I could Maybe have in mind to change my major. Over all I this class will help me decide what I want to continue in college. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,341,"""What are my goals? How is this class helping me achieve these goals?""My goals, finally after serving for 21 years in the Navy, are to buy a house, finish my degree, being my Masters/PhD to achieve my major end goal of becoming a college professor. I truly love and enjoy anything to do with the Universe and Galaxy, and that love and desire helped me decide to change my major to Astrophysics. Initially my degree was International Politics, which after serving for so long, decided that I really don’t like the degree choice and made the change upon retiring earlier this year. I feel that in order for you to be successful and do justice to your degree and professorship, that one must love and be passionate about what they are sharing and passing on to eager-to-learn students. I believe this class is a huge stepping-stone in reaching that goal with taking my first physics class ever and using math that I have not used for over 20 years, haha. I feel that delving into the material, I’ll be quite knowledgeable and proficient in the ins and outs of physics. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,342,"I have various goals, many are goals i hope to achieve within a year, others are goals i hope to achieve within a lifetime. Some of the goals i hope to achieve within the year are graduating with my bachelors degree. Get accepted to a PhD program, or begin working, and eat healthier/ workout more often. My long term goals are to have a family, a steady career, and leave something that can push humanity forward, or help in some way before i go. This class is helping me because it will allow me to graduate to get a job that will hopefully be beneficial to us as a species, while allowing me to have a steady career with income, so that i can take care of my family. (both current and future)Another thing this class does is help me become a problem solver. This type of class is not just memorizing information and regurgitating it, it requires me to think about the problem, and find a way to find the required answer. This involves alot of thinking and the ability to look at things from different perspectives which i believe will be important everywhere i go."
