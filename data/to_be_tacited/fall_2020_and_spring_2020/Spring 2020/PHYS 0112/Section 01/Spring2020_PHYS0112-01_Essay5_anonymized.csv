2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,331,"I really don’t have any resources other than myself, I do know that there are a lot of resources to support students at San Francisco State University, however even when we were all in class before Covid-19 I personally never used any of them other than CClear for my chemistry homework and after a while maybe a year later it stop benefiting me because every time I would go there I wouldn’t get as much help I got the year before. But as I stated above “I really don’t have any resources other than myself” because I mostly rely on myself to get things done in my life weather if it is financially or going through school I can get it done, however I can honestly say that there are really only two people that I can count on if I do need help with anything in my life if can’t handle it myself."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,60,"The resources I have are my family, technology, and my professors. My family is a resource I have because they help me financially and me in all my endeavors. Technology has always been a big resource but especially now during this pandemic. If it weren’t for technology not only would I have trouble passing classes I would probably not even be able to take any classes since we currently can’t meet in person. Technology has also served as a resource in the form of supplementary learning because if we’re being honest online classes are not the same as in person and though I have great professors that do the best that they can sometimes further explanation of certain topics is needed, this is when technology comes in. As I previously mentioned I have great professors that have become an important resource now more than ever. The reason I say that professors serve as a resource now more than ever is because they’re a big help during a time that help is needed the most with online classes and the learning curve that comes with it."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,335,"My family supports me in more ways than one because they pay for my education and teach me to be the best person I can be. My boyfriend supports me because he tells me I can do whatever I put my mind too. This is very helpful for me because I am extremely hard on myself and always trying my hardest to better myself. This is a struggle for me at times because I become frustrated when I do not feel that I am doing my best work. I am happy with how far I have come in my education and where my career path is going to take me. It has been a journey and I cannot wait to see what the future has in store for me, I know it will be amazing! "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,324,"The resources that I have to support me on campus is my faculty advisor. She has looked at my degree progress report and has helped steer me in the right direction. She confirmed how many units I have left till I'm done with undergrad. Furthermore, she provided me with email resources to a few professors so that I could add a class. Another resource I have to support me is my financial aid. Although I do only get loans. Without my loans however, I wouldn't be able to attend San Francisco State University. The loans are helping me pay for my tuition and my housing. My last resource I'd say I have to help support me is my family. They are the biggest support system to keep me motivated to finish my undergrad and possible go to grad school."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,321,"The resources that I know that I can count on are my professors, friends, and google. Actually google isn't really that helpful because it gives you so many things and you still have to pick which one to pick but its still good. I could say that my parents are also my resources but I'd rather not ask them one question about something I'm planning and get lectured about something completely irrelevant. Also, youtube is sometimes helpful because of the videos that I can watch that explains some things from lecture that I don't understand. When I was still in community college, I used to watch so much youtube videos to help me understand some subjects because I know that if I had a person explain it to me, I will just doze off and nothing will stay in my mind. I like to have visuals that will help me understand. That is why I remember images more than what people say to me. People sometimes get mad at me for forgetting something they told me and I'm like I don't know what it looks like. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,336,"Family and friends are my biggest support system.  My husband is always willing to have a conversation about something that I'm struggling with or something that's on my mind.  Sometimes it helps to have another perspective on the things that are on my mind.  My parents have also always been willing to listen.  I remember them staying up late with me when I was in middle school and I'd be so frustrated over something and they'd talk to me as long as I needed them.  Friends are my other source of support.  None of my closest friends live nearby, so the time that I have either on the phone, or with rare visits is so special.  One positive thing that has actually come from the pandemic is a lot of zoom time with the friends that mean the most to me.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,61,"I have many resources that can support me in many different ways .  One resource i have is my parents , they always encourage me in staying motivated in my studies in college.  They also give me advice about future life events like finding a job and paying rent . This is especially true in todays world of uncertainty .  When i am on campus i have my instructions to provide me with guidance and mentorship. I also have resources like the library to provide me with a space to study in between classes . I also have my peers to form study groups with . I also have materials like textbooks , online websites , instructional videos and other sources of information i can use to get clarification on may different topics and subjects .  I also have my major advisors to provide me with guidance on with courses i should take and how to get access to them. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,332,"Ever since going to college, the only resource I ever really had come from my family's support and the hard work I put it myself, and over the years I've come to see that these are the only two important resources a person really needs. Other people aren't as lucky and blessed to have their family so I'm always grateful that I have this source of resource that I can always look to me or reach out to me if any unfortunate things come my way. Of course, I'd say most of the resources come from myself as that's just how I am. I'm the type of person to provide for myself without aid and go through these unfortunate things as a learning process."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,317,"The first thing that comes to mind when I think about what resources I have is that my family and peers are my biggest resources. I know that my parents have and always be there for me physically, emotionally but also financially, which pushes me even harder to achieve my goals so one day I can repay them for everything they've done and sacrificed for me. My peers are also a great support system that I find very important to me. It's nice to know that there are others who understand the struggles a college student goes through and it's nice when we can all be there for each other and help out in any way we can. There's always going to be something new I can learn from my friends and classmates that I can't learn from my parents. These two resources support me in different but very important ways."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,330,"In all honesty, I have quite a bit of resources to support me in life, school and pretty much everything else. Which means that I should have no excuses. Some of the resources I have to support me are my laptop, wifi (sometimes unsteady), parents who aren't struggling financially and who have their own way of showing me they care, my little brother who looks up to me (putting me in the position of a Role Model), and my motivation to do better. My grandma brought the whole family here to the United States. She was the one who had the balls to take that huge risk, and everyone respects her completely for it. My dad was raised in the brick homes in Sunnydale, rough place, and he was able to get out of it. Now it's my turn to bring this immigrant family up another level, in the Medical field."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,325,"I feel that I have been truly lucky. My family raised me and my brother to be independent, compassionate, and when the opportunity to help another arises, we have learned to take it. Due to this, I believe that I have a strong foundation of what it means to be resourceful. Sometimes in life, it becomes hard to see clearly due to stress. When these times hit, we truly see where our resources come from. In school, I sometimes get stressed and my family and study buddies ALWAYS come through for me. Whether it's my parents giving me a life lecture to help motivate me, a fellow student that extends a hand to help me understand a confusing topic, or even a professor going out of their way to help me succeed, I cannot help but realized that these are all resources that help me regain my focus on what is important. It is illogical to think that there are ""self-made"" folks out there. EVERYONE needs help from time to time and their support network can help them do that. I have been truly lucky to have reality checks from my family, incredibly loyal friends who help me when in need, and professors who emphasize connecting to their students. Even in chaotic times, there is always order. Even when stressed, there are those who will pull you up. This unwavering support network has allowed me to be where I am today. For that, I am forever appreciative of those around me. I hope that I am just as helpful to them, as they are to me. With so much uncertainty in our current global situation, it is often challenging to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Stress, ego, corruption, and hate seem to overpower everything else. However, with the right people, kindness, love, and integrity prevail. I am reminded of these qualities constantly because I am lucky to have these strong people in my life. My resources are people. These people make my support system strong, and for that I am truly thankful. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,323,"These days, resources are ubiquitous with information at our finger tips, advises good or bad can be found on the internet and therapy can be conducted via online video platform. The best resource I have are my supportive family and friends. I have made a couple of changes during my time at SFSU and unfortunately in many cases, students are not able to actually explore for their passion. I for one am grateful to have such a wonderful supporting casts that want me to find something that I love and feel passionate about. Life is simply not about making as much money as possible or being ""successful"" in the societal sense. Life for me is about finding something that I would be proud about when I am reflecting on my life. Life for me is about doing something that not only benefits myself but also benefits my surroundings. My family and friends have helped me opened this vision and I cannot be happier to call them my most important resources in my life."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,320,"Despite typically feeling the need to suffer in silence and ""not bother others"" when I am struggling, I tend to rely on my mom a bit for help in my STEM general education classes school-wise, as she as well went through a STEM major in college as well as being the only parent to complete a college degree. If I cannot get help from her for whatever reason, I tend to then go to classmates and friends from my major or major-specific courses I've had with people in the past and ask for help through them. Because my department is rather small, there are the occasional times where I can ask a professor for help on homework from a different class and they will give their understanding of the topic to then help me better understand the material as well. As I am pretty shy and not really outgoing, I do tend to gravitate towards people I am familiar with, and tend to forgo talking to the professor of the class I'm having issues with or seek help through the tutoring offered by the university, especially if it's a topic that is math based; however, I do want to work on this as a not-so-great past with math classes does not necessarily mean that current ones will follow in the same manner."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,62,"I am grateful to have many resources available to support me. First, I have my professors to support me academically when I find myself struggling on an assignment or a topic. I am grateful to have many professors that are very responsive to emails and make sure that I get al the help I need on a problem. Second, I have the support of my family when it comes to emotional and financial support. I have always had my siblings and parents to lean on in every form of the word and am blessed to have them help me during difficult times. My friends are also a strong emotional support system for me, and I am grateful to have them always there for me when I need the help. Also, I receive a lot of financial support from my parents, as I currently live at home with them. This is one of the best support systems that I have, as it relieves a lot of stress for me and aids me in being able to complete all of my academic work. Writing this, I realize that I have so many amazing support systems that I cannot take for granted."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,341,"The resources I have to support me are my family, close friends, spouse and a few past professors.  It is nice to have a strong, patient, understanding, and caring group of people that are there for personal and professional support at a moment's notice.  I found it quite surprising and rewarding that educational professionals are just as compassionate and understanding as family, as long as you show effort and provide extensive communications in respect to issues whether personal or professional.  Those instances where support was provided by amazing professors, it is very heart-warming and is exactly how I want to be there for students in the future when I become a college professor.  Thank you for everything and understanding this semester Professor Andrew !!"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,115,"I feel that through out my time in college, I have collected a number of resources to help support me through difficult times.  When school becomes difficult, I often times will contact a friend for support, my significant other, or teachers I feel comfortable with.  I feel going online has made it harder for me to build relationships with teachers strong enough to the point where I feel comfortable contacting them one-on-one. hen personal difficulties arise I mostly lean on my significant other or my mother, sometimes my friends but it is not often I feel comfortable speaking about my difficulties with others."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,316,"I am really grateful for the resources I have to support me, whether they are for mental health or for educational reasons. I think it is important that we inform people of the resources they have available to them, because it is not always known. One of the most important resources I use is the internet. As long as you are careful, there are a lot of great resources with great information on any topic. I use the internet everyday to research things I want more information on. Additionally, I use youtube quite often in my studies when faced with a difficult or complex topic. I often find it helpful learning a topic with another viewpoint or description. Sometimes you have to be exposed to a complex topic several times before you can really digest it. So, having these extra resources that are free and easily accessible are really valuable to me."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,337,"During school, I usually have the resources of the school's library and friends. However, now that the pandemic is still current, I do not have many resources that can help me except for the professors that I have. I really do appreciate all the help that you've given me throughout this summer course. It was really difficult for me to transition to summer school and you've made it really easy with your support and understanding. Other resources that are supporting me through this online class are my laptop and iPad. It has been really easy to take notes and listen to lectures with these technologies. I am forever grateful that these technologies exist because if it weren't for them I don't think I would be able to sit through long lectures. I just want to say thank you for teaching this course. It has been really interesting although physics is a really difficult topic to understand and comprehend. You made it really easy to follow through even with the online format. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,319,"The resources I have to support me are my loving family, myself, and the internet. My family is one of my biggest support systems although sometimes they can be unreliable when I can not rely on them I always know I can rely on myself and that sense of security is what makes me feel so confident, knowing that I will never let myself down because I am in control of my own actions. The internet is a resource that is always there for me literally whenever I am unsure of something, the internet has so much knowledge that is at the tips of our fingers. I find myself all the time googling things I am unsure of or don't know, I count on google daily. Additionally, I also count on books to widen the resource that is myself, reading helps me gain knowledge so I can of better use to myself."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,328,The resources that I have to support me are my family and friends due to quarantine I cannot see a lot of people so most of the time I have to rely on my family that is home at the time which is typically my mom so she is may main support system with school and other things. I mostly like to have sole control over my schooling so I only really talk to her about things after the fact rather than working through issues with her because I feel responsible for my education so I prefer to have full control over it. So my support system is usually used to convince me that I made the right decision or did well on a test or quiz.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,101,"I know that I have a resources to support me, whether its emotional, academic, advising, school-related, etc. support. I feel that sometimes I don't use them to my advantage because I don't really know how to approach those resources or they don't give the support I need back. For example, I emailed my advisor for academic help, but she didn't respond back so I had to email her again. That doesn't happen for every resource though. I know I have a lot of emotional resources I can use to my advantage (suicide hotline, contacting my therapist, etc.). Or, sometimes I would feel too embarrassed or shy. Ultimately, I know I need to utilize my resources more because I won't have them forever. Example is that my advisor is only with me during my undergrad years. I need to stop being shy or embarrassed because it will do more help than harm."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,111,"What resources do I have to support me? The first accessible resource I have is my sister. Whenever I have a question, I’m confused, stuck, or having trouble with anything I ask my sister first. Especially during this time, the global pandemic has made it very difficult for me to reach out and get resources to support me. For that reason, my sister has been very helpful in supporting me. The second resource I have is my EOP program. Even though classes and the school have switched to remote instruction, EOP has been consistently checking up and providing resources to help support people who are in EOP, like me. The last time they helped support me was this Q&A series. This Q&A series had a zoom meeting about dentistry and helped give us insight about dental school while providing resources such as programs, clubs, and etc. As for right now, these are my only two resources I have to support me."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,333,"My Family is one of the resources I have that support me. Not only because I am the first to attend a college but also a 4-year university. I have always received emotional support from them, and although they cannot help me with academic support they're always there to support me in everything I do. My friends as well, my two friends lol who are always encouraging me to always do my best and give my all in everything I do. They also hold me accountable for school as they're always checking on me, they know what classes I'm taking and if they can help me they always will, and even if they can't, they will look for resources to help me out. My community also supports me, as I am part of Richmond Promise team which is a scholarship specific to Richmond students. They have been a big support as not only did I receive a scholarship from them but they also supported me academically/emotionally through college these four years. They do workshops and help us still navigate through college."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,318,"The main resource that I have to support me is my family. They are always there for me whenever I need them; I can count on them if I am ever in need of talking with someone. Throughout my difficult journey for education, I had a difficult time deciding what to do with school and if it was not for them, I would have been stuck in a place that I was a little miserable at. They helped me decide with a decision that was difficult for me to make because I felt like I would be disappointing them, but they fully supported me. I could not be more thankful for all they have done for me and I hope that, in the future, I can repay them for what they have done. At this moment, if I did not have their support than I would not be where I am in life. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,329,"The resources that I have to support me are my family, friends, and school(campus resources for different things such as tutoring, mental health, etc., professors, and environmental resources).  They all help and support me in different ways such as my family helps me in all aspects of my life(mentally, physically, financially, etc.), my friends help me socially and mentally, and my school helps me mentally.  All around me, there is so much support and helps me find my path in life to grow into the person that I want to be, and I find it very helpful and grateful to have everyone in my life.  Without these people that have helped mold and shape me, who knows where I would be today."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,340,"Some resources that support me is surely the internet. Social media keeps me pretty updated with the trending news or information I need for school. Following the sf state accounts like their health care and stuff like that. The website its self is a big help because you can look up anything you need too about the school. Anytime I need information about the university I always check the website first. Another resources can be my metals and professors, if I can't find information Id be sure to ask my friend if they may know extra information or my professor due the fact they work there and may know useful information as well. Another good resource is the library, if you don't understand a material there are books who may explain situations better than even professors. These are the resources that I have used to support me in my college journey."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,338,"I feel I am an extremely blessed person when it comes to support. I have a lot of support from my friends and family. Although, they may not be able to help me academically or financially with resources they are there to support me in other ways and for that I am forever grateful. It is difficult to navigate the sciences and I do have mentors to help me move through these waters. Also, I am a fully funded student by the university and without their support I would not have been able to go to school without working (which I have never been able to do before). For the first time, I have not needed to work 2 jobs to try and support myself. With that, I am very lucky to have that as a resources as well. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,339,"The resources that I have been using and supported me a lot are the our class book, and also khan academy I do learn better by watching videos explaining some of the concepts because visualizing what we learn in class is much easier to learn. I am also glad I took the lecture along with the lab because what we do in lecture make lab much easier to do. On the other hand, the recorded lectures are the best tool for the class, even before the pandemic when I used to attend classes I used to recored the lectures because listening to the lecture few more times make the class much easier and also give chance to take good notes. With that been said I am thankful for the recorded lectures.  Another way that helped me keep up with the material was group work, working with other classmates through zoom was also very helpful. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,327,"I am very proud of my parents, cousins, and friends who are always beside me when I need them. I am currently working full-time in the hospital as a front desk. And I am very stressed of how to complete work and school perfectly. Therefore, they are always there to support my decision and guide me in my career pathway. For example, when I am confused about what programs I should apply to after a bachelor degree in Kinesiology. I always listen to the advices and suggestion from my cousins. Furthermore, SFSU also provides advisor and many career workshop. Once, my instructor also extended the due date for me because he understood our circumstances. My friends is always ready to take me out for some fresh air when I need them. My parents always listen to my stories and give my some advice about everything. The best resource I have are the presence of my parents, relatives, and friends beside me. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,334,"I have many resources that support me. I have my family that I can go to for advice, I have my advisors, my professors, my peers. etc. The point is that I have many resources at my disposal that can help me at nearly any time. Whether it be school, personal, and/or career related I have the necessary resources around me to succeed."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,326,"There are plenty of resources that I have access to to help support me in whatever I am doing. One of the main resources that I have access to is the internet. We live in a world where technology has become a major part of our lives and the internet is a major part of that technology. If I don't understand something, the internet has many websites and videos to help explain and eventually help me figure out what ever I don't understand. Another resource is the people that are around me, like classmates and even friends and family members. They might know things that you don't know, so it's always good to get information from another perspective. "
