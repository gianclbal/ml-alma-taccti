2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,295,"I am here at San Francisco State University because I want to not only get a degree, but also want to expand my knowledge on how the world works. I want to go into holistic health as a career path because it is so interesting to me how we can improve our health and sometimes even reverse illness by simply changing our lifestyle. I am also here in college because I wanted to prove to them that I can be successful and complete college. A lot of my family members did not go to college, and they were counting on me to accomplish what they did not. I wanted to be that person for them so I moved out of my hometown and moved to a different city. I am the first one in my family to move out of my hometown so it has been a huge accomplishment being able to do so. That is why I am here in college at San Francisco State University. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,296,"I am in physics not only because it is required for my major, but for me to better understand how things work on the world. I am interested to know exactly why things work the way they do. So far, we are learning about velocity and distance and the forces acting in certain objects. It is interesting to me to learn about the mechanics of how objects move or why objects remain at rest. I have heard that physics is like another math class and I want to understand what kind of math is involved and how difficult or challenging it may be. I am in physics to also take physics 222 to help with my knowledge for my major. I am here to learn what I can since I have never taken a physics class before. I want to understand the different forces acting on objects. I also want to see how physics relates to my everyday life and apply it. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,102,I am currently enrolled in physics 112 Laboratroy because it is a degree requirement for my major. It is a prerequisite for the next physics class I need. I am working towards a bachalore of arts degree in biology so that I can go to dental school and become a dentist. My plan taking this class is just another stepping stone on my journey to hopefully get in dental school and become a dentist. I chose to come to San Francisco State University because my friend attended school here and recommended me to try it. My more immediate goal is to pass with this class hopefully with an A so I can take the next step in my academic journey. In order for me to do well in this class I need to first show up and listen attentively and complete all asignments on time. I also must reveiw the assigments in order to understand the material and it will help me in passing my Physics lecture course. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,297,"Why am I here? This is such an open ended question. It can have many different contexts that it can be used in. As for me, when I hear that question, I automatically think of a particular place in my life. I am going to turn 21 in 4 days. I work as a physical therapist aide. It is my first semester in my major as a third year. I believe everything I have been through and accomplished has led me to this exact place in my life. Although I know I am barely scratching the surface of my full potential in life and wherever it is that I may end up is still unknown. What I do know is that this class, this job, this school, this major are all stepping stones to where I am supposed to end up and that is why I am here. I am here to work towards my goals and for myself, for my future self, for  my family and for my future family."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,298,"I am in physics 112 because it is one of the requirements to stay enrolled in physics 111. I have to take these courses because it’s a requirement for all biology majors. I have never taken a physics course so this has all been pretty new to me. I am taking these courses in order to graduate and receive a college degree. I am here because I want to be the first one of my family to graduate from college and make them proud. I sometimes have to force myself to get to school but I do it in order to fulfill this goal. I am here with a full schedule because I hope to be able to get a good job and be happy after I graduate college. I want to be able to help and support my family, do the same for them what they have always done for me. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,299,"Why am I here? I am here because I am lucky enough to have the opportunity to attend a school in a nice city that’s not too far from home. I have come to be interested in math, science, and even business. I ended up choosing bio as my major in hopes of gaining a better understanding of the world around me. I also hope to attend medical school and become a doctor. I feel that going through that amount of schooling and gaining all that knowledge will make me pretty satisfied, and I will be able to lead a happy life with the career opportunities that follow. I am in this specific class to help my understanding of physics, because I find physics interesting. So far I am confident in my ability, and am keeping up with the class.   It seems cool and I am glad to be a part of it. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,300,"I am in college because I want to gain more education and provide for my family in the future. I have been told that I am expected to go to college and accomplish all these great things. I am here because I am expected to be here. I am in this class only because I am required to take physics. I do not enjoy physics and often question why I am here. I do not feel smart enough for this class especially when my teachers expect me to know this information automatically, which discourages me even more. Lately I have been questioning why I am where I am and I can't seem to find an answer. Not being able to grasp the information in this class has discouraged me and makes me question why I am in school. I guess I cannot answer this question because I have been very doubtful lately and do not know where I am headed in the future. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,301,"I have decided to take this course due to the fact that both my major and graduate programs that I want to get into require this course. I believe that through this course I can learn a lot that can be applied to my major and help me succeed in that aspect. Although the class has been proving to be a little difficult, I believe that with enough time I will excel in this class. I have heard from previous students that this class that this is a class that is to not be taken lightly. The sci class will be a great help this semester as I learn more about physics. I will also seek help from my peers as they may know more about certain topics than I do and try to spend as much time as possible learning from them. Hopefully this will be a great semester and I do well. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,302,"Honestly I am here just for the credits i need to get into my major. I am pre-kin and need to take physics in order to finish off my pre-requisites and make sure I do get accepted by the Kinesiology Association. But if I could think of another reason as to why I am here in a Kinesiology Lab taking the lecture as well, spending 4 days a week learning physics, it would be to understand how things in this world work and they interact with each other. Give reasons as to why this works and this doesn't, what is possible in our universe. Physics happens to us all the time and to know how it works would be beneficial in solving a problem when Im older or now. But regardless, I need the credits to pass and continue my path in college and in life while also gaining new knowledge that would otherwise help in everyday."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,303,"I am here to excel in school and make my parents and myself proud by demonstrating that I am able to obtain a higher education and work at my dream job as a clinical lab scientist. Another reason why I am here is to set an example for my younger brother and teach him how to be a responsible and hard working person. I am here to enjoy life as well and learn as much as I can inside and outside of school. I am here to learn from my peers and teachers to gain wisdom and a positive outlook in life. I feel like I am also here to teach others my own beliefs and what I think of current issues. I believe that everyone in the world can learn by giving attention to the ideas, cultures, and opinions of others because it can be a valuable contribution to one’s way of thinking. Finally, I am here to love, laugh, and share life with those who uplift me and contribute to my happiness."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,304,"I am here in this physics lab class because it is part of my prerequisites for my major, biology with a focus on physiology. Physics can provide me with a basic understanding in how things work and move. What I'm planning to learn in this class is how things move and to be able to apply it to the real world, a.k.a., driving a car or a plane flying. Also after this class, I will be to read and understand the graph of motion, velocity, and acceleration and now what they mean. As well as, vectors and their importance to the world of physics. I feel like knowing all this information can be beneficial to the real world and my future career in medicine. It can give me a wider understanding of atoms in a molecular level once we get to it and how I can alter them for the benefit of others. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,305,"I’m here because I have a love for Astronomy and space. I’ve always been enamored by the stars as a kid. It sounds strange but the reason I even became interested in space was because of rocks and minerals. When I was younger, I was told to pick out a book to read from the library. I had never been to the library nor had I ever been able to pick something that I wanted to read. There were so many books to choose from that I just couldn’t bring myself to pick one. So, I asked the librarian what I should read. As a joke, she told me to go read some of the books about rocks, minerals, and gemstones and that was exactly what I did! I ended up reading all the books they had on rocks and I didn’t know what to read next. So I did the same thing and asked the librarian for a suggestion. I told how I really liked the books about rocks and how I already read all of them. After thinking for awhile, she told me to read the books on planets because they were, “kind of similar.” Listening to her instructions, I began to read about Jupiter,  Mars, and Saturn. I became extremely fascinated in the sizes of these planets and what they were made of. Ever since then really I have been interested in space. So if I had to answer the question, I would say I’m here largely in part because of that librarian."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,66,"The question of why am I here is a question that I myself is still seeking the answer to. I have never liked physics, or the concept that represents physics, however, I do know that as a biologist I have to understand physics and the concept that comes from learning physics. As I learn more about physics I realize that I understand more about the world around me and that because of this I understand concepts that I didn't understand before. For example the meaning of gravity and how that affects our daily life. I see that with different eyes, and I understand what it means to see gravity in action. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,306,I am here because I need to take physics as a GE class and potentially use the skills I learn in this class for future classes. So far I am enjoying this lab and learning new things about physics that I never knew before. It’s interesting that there are so many things I do in everyday life that relates to physics and I never realized these little things until now. Physics in general is a fascinating topic and answers many questions about us and our planet and I feel like most of our questions can be answered because of physics. I am looking forward to see what else I can learn from this class from here on out.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,307,"I know my purpose for being here, and hopefully I fulfill it while I am. I am a student in university for a reason, that reason being to be able to succeed in my future career and lifestyle. I will definitely fulfill my schooling requirements so hopefully I can be the best I can be in my career. I want to be in the medical field for animal care, and that is also for a good reason. I want to make a positive difference in my community and help many families. I am here in this class to travel my path to that point in my life. I know I am in this class for a couple of reasons, one being that it is a requirement for me to move on with my major and overall my field of study, so I can be who I was meant to be. I will try my hardest to be the best I can be while I’m here. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,308,"Why am I here? I am here because I am a general biology major at San Francisco State and this is one of my requirements for my major. I am a General Biology major because I want to go to dental school and become an orthodontist. I used to struggle with Physics in high school and understanding it. It is important for me to understand the concepts of Physics, which will help in other parts of life as well. It is good for me to know about physics and other sciences to help me in my path to my future career. Becoming an orthodontist is a very major part in my future and understanding sciences will help me lead to that path. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,309,"I am here so that I can learn about physics. My primary goal is to understand how the universe works and function. I also taking this class because I want to go into graduate school which is a requirement for this class. Physics is an interesting concept that I often overlook due to the equations and complex idea behind it. I want to learn more about the everyday and basic things we do that has to do with physics. Examples such as how far, long and etc something is. The reason for me being in the class is to understand the different mechanics of the world and learn from it. The reason being of physics is know how the world functions and works. In conclusion, I am here to learn more about physics , how to apply it in my everyday life and understand why the world works the way it is."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,310,I am here because I’m trying to graduate with a degree in Kinesiology. I’m taking this class because it is one of my pre-requisites. I also chose this physics class over the other ones because I heard this would look better when I apply for graduate school. I want to go to physical therapy school. Also I need these units so that I’m on pace to graduate in four years. I’m at San Francisco State because it is close to home and I heard they work closely with UCSF for graduate school and I thought that would be good if I wanted to get into UCSF after graduating. Also I knew a couple people who were attending this school already and that swayed me to come here. I also just wanted to attend a 4 year college right away and San Francisco State was one of my options higher on my list
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,311,"Why am I here?  Because this is a physics class, and it is related to some common sense in my life, and it has some connection with mathematics.  I learned some basic physics knowledge through the first two lessons, and through experiments I learned the relationship between the direction of speed and distance.  And I want to learn more now, so I'm here.  Why am I here?  Because it has something to do with mathematics.  I love math and love to explore it, and physics also helps me learn math, so I am here.  Why am I here?  Because it interests me.  Physics has an appeal to me, and I want to be able to understand it and explore it like learning mathematics. And I think physics will bring me happiness, let me connect with some situations of life from some details, so that I can also use physics knowledge when dealing with emergency situations in the future."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,312,"I am here to learn how physics works, how motion and forces correlate to our daily lives. This is my first time ever taking physics, which is pretty scary to me but very interesting at the same time. In high school, we were not offered a physics class. I come from a low income neighborhood that does not offer the best education. Taking classes that I have never taken before in highschool frightens me. I'm Taking this class for my biology major, so I can move on to my next classes and graduate SFSU. I am here to learn physics, to understand the concept of physics and to eventually teach others who do not understand physics. My main goal out of this class is to understand the material well and succeed in this class. I am aiming to earn an A in this class and move on to the next classes knowing physics."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,313,"I am here because there are so many things to accomplish, yet there is so little time. I am here to be the best or at least a better version of me. My purpose is to get the most out of life. I truly believe that I am meant to be a successful individual. The good thing is that everyone has their own definition of success, but mine will be reliant upon whether or not I can go above and beyond the goals that I have set for myself. I go to school because I only see one career path for myself. My purpose is to be a doctor and help change lives, whether I am getting the recognition for it or not. I am in this class because it is a requirement for my major. Obviously it can help me further my education in the field of science and help prepare me for future courses. Even though I don't understand some of the concepts, I do like physics. I just need a physics book for dummies."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,54,"I am taking physics and physics lab because I really interested in learning how physics works and How the dynamic of physics. I am having fun learning about motion and how velocity and acceleration all work in the real world. I am in this class because I want to learn why things happen and how motion. I want to challenge myself and help my imagination with concepts like relativity and string theory, which can lead to great discoveries, like computers and lasers, that lead to technologies which change our lives, since we live in Silicon Valley.I heard that physics is very important because you learn how healing joints, to curing cancer, to developing sustainable energy solutions are shown in physics. Never took physics so I’m excited to even take physics lab because I am a hands on learner which allows me to focus on what’s important and how I can challenge myself. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,314,"Sometimes when things in life don't go as planned, I always have to reflect on why I'm even here in the first place. I ask myself what am I doing to create a better future for myself but not forgetting to live life in the moment. I've been told I can do anything I put my mind to but how am I supposed to figure out my true purpose if I can do ""everything""? It then narrows down to the things that I find joy in participating in and how I utilize my God given gifts. I'm a person of many talents and skills, which is why I believe I was placed here on this universe for multiple purposes. When I was younger, my mother was diagnosed with a brain tumor and it took months of convincing her to finally get surgery to remove the tumor. After experiencing those years of watching her suffer, I've developed a love for the medical field and knew I wanted to be apart of changing the lives of others through medicine. Also, I've been granted the gift of imagination which allows me to write mini books, poems, and short stories, along with a long list of other talents. I truly believe my huge personality, when combined with my career interests and natural talents, were placed here to spread love throughout those I cross paths with in life. I'm here to share smiles and be a light in the midst of someone's darkness, while assisting in prolonging long and healthy lives."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,315,"I am currently taking Physics 112 for many reasons. My main reason for taking this class is to prepare myself for my future studies and eventually my future career goals. After receiving my bachelor’s degree I hope to continue on to medical school, where I will eventually become a doctor. Physics will be very helpful in real-life situations that I may come across in the medical field. The physics lab specifically is showing me isolated scenarios and allowing me to analyze them so that I can fully understand them when I come across them in real life. An example of me using this once I become a doctor is if my patient was in a car accident. If I understand the mechanics of the physics behind a car accident, I will be able to better assist my patients and help them to the best of my ability. I am excited to continue with this lab and continue to notice these physics concepts throughout my day to day life."
