2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,320,"My family has always taught me to work hard on school, and with college now, they depend on me to be self sustainable and responsible for my own. This also leads to me having a lot of accountability for times that I don't do so well in balancing myself. While there's times that my parents will remind me to balance one component that they feel I might be neglecting relatively recent to them bringing it up, it does feel hard at times to take that advice as I know they mean well; but find it hard to be able to apply an idea to my own schedule due to how hectic it is generally to make sure I'm getting work hours and all my schoolwork done in time, while taking into account my commute time.For me its very easy to become overwhelmed by my responsibilities and things occurring both in and outside of school. A lot of my work ethic takes after my mom's hard working personality to provide for my family, but she as well deals with struggling to balance and Of course with COVID-19 now, I don't have to deal with work or commuting, however I do struggle a bit more with financial displacement, my mental health, and also general health as well as a result. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,61,"My family has always encouraged me to pursue my dreams and goals . My parents told me you can do anything you have your mind to . My family also thought me that college has many pathways and my first plan might not always work . This has proven to be true , i originally wanted to become a nurse and quickly learned that the nursing career is not for me . I ultimately chose to become a biology major , biology is my passion and is something that drives me threw my studies. I would like to purse a career in the health care industry or biotech . I also have found that my will and motivation to be successful in my classes i take has be a driving force during my time at SFSU. It is a combination of many things like family , my community , myself and the people i met who help me and guide my threw my college journey."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,338,"I am a second generation Mission District Native. My families ethnic origin is from El Salvador and Honduras. With that, these two identities and cultural experiences has played a significant role on how I navigate college. I grew up in a low-income, immigrant community by growing up in the mission. I learned how to work hard and be determined to go after my dreams but to also remember where I come from and never forget about my community. With this in mind, I want to go into research that looks at the ""science"" of health equity. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,316,"I feel very grateful for the community/environment I grew up in, because I feel like it instilled many values that I still hold to this day. Additionally, several of these values have helped navigate me through college. One of those values is hard work. My parents are immigrants, and so they have worked extremely hard throughout their lives in order to be successful. For me, I know that there are some classes that require work, and I have to put in the time and be disciplined in order to be successful. Another value is determination. As previously mentioned there are going to be subjects and topics that are going to be difficult to grasp in not only science but all my classes in university. Thus being determined to understand is super important, and I find myself doing so by going to office hours, asking questions and joining study groups. Lastly, I think it is important to value yourself, and know that a grade on one test does not define you, or your academic success. When things like that happen, it is important to recognize what went wrong, and what I learned, and future actions from preventing it from happening again."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,101,"Since I'm the first generation college student in my family, I've had a lot of high expectations especially from my parents. However, I honestly think it's difficult and a tough place to be in when you have such high hopes from everyone, but you don't even know what you want to do. My parents can't give me any advice or tips to persevere through college so I feel sometimes lost because it feels like I'm alone. However, I turn that feeling of helplessness into something positive. I found that there are many first-gen college students who feel the same as me, so I'm not alone. There are many resources on campus that I can use to my advantage, like counseling or SOAR TRIO. I depend on my advisors and I know it's okay to ask for help from professors. Even though I felt scared and lost in the beginning, I used that feeling to turn it into something positive. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,323,"The best family value that has helped me navigate through college is resiliency. There have been many circumstances in my life where resiliency was required, and over the course of years, it has become engraved within me. There are a number of occasions at SFSU where giving up, or taking the easy way out was the best option. During my earlier semesters, I would do just that, trying to get through the courses without actually learning but rather memorizing to earn credits. The problem with this approach is that as a student paying thousands of dollars to get this education, I was not receiving anything of value. Going through the motions as if I am working on the assembly line should not be the goal of being at an university but rather the struggling, critically thinking and learning, should be of upmost importance. Over the four years here at SFSU, I have learned to utilize that resiliency, and figure out that I rather learn than memorize. My grade does not mean anything if I do not take anything away from the curriculum."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,330,"I come from a family of immigrants. They definitely had to struggle in order to get to where they are today. My grandma, and my dad and his siblings, were born in a poor, very poor ranch in Mexico. Now they're living in one of the richest cities in the world, San Francisco. I like to think about that from time to time. Because, it takes some real dedication and courage to bring a whole family to a better future and promises (out there in the ranch, if someone's dying, hospitals refuse to send ambulances). My mom came to the United States from Managua, Nicaragua. She did have a little money but just enough to live in a semi-decent neighborhood in the city, while my dad was living in the projects. What they instilled into me though, is that, in order to raise yourself up in socio-economic status, you need to first excel in your education. And that's what I've been doing."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,333,"I think my families values really has helped me navigate through college. I am a first generation college student and my parents came to the United States to look for a better future for themselves, they have worked very hard here for years for sometimes very low pay. When I was like 10 my dad opened his own construction company and things started to get better for us financially but we would rearly see my dad. Then my mom did a nursing program and we didn't see her either. But I think that in all I saw in both of them very hard workers, who didn't give up. I think those are the values they have really tried to show me. College was very hard for me at the beginning because I didn't know what I was doing, and I went home and sometimes was frustrated because of things I didn't understand or because I got lost. However, my parents would uplift me and tell me I was smart, and hardworking and I deserved to be there. I think these are the things that have kept me going."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,325,"Growing up I was fortunate to come from a strong family and accepting community. From my family I learned that being compassionate, disciplined, and flexible are some of the essential qualities  in any aspect of life. Compassion allows us to put aside our own ego, listen, and understand one another with the intent of appreciating our differences. Through discipline, we fight against short term gratification because we know that if we get things done, we will set our selfs up for success. In addition, flexibility allows us to have a clear conscious when life throws us unexpected curve balls. Knowing how to adapt by being flexible reduces stress and as a byproduct teaches us how to be resourceful with our time. These values learned from my family and community have helped me stay focused on my mission in school, while maintaining who I am. After all, we should never forget where we came from. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,337,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college greatly by teaching me the importance of education and work ethics. Without education, it would be very difficult to get far in life because you need knowledge in order to do well. My family migrated to the U.S. when I was only 6 years old in order to help me and my sister have a successful life. It was quite difficult for my parents to achieve education in Vietnam so they knew how it is like to grow up there. They didn't want what happened to them to happen to my sister and me. My parents have been through a lot to get our family here and all they ask of my sister and me is to stay in school and do well. This is why I am determined to live the best life possible so that my parents can will at ease and proud."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,60,"I’m a first generation college student so my family has really tried to help me navigate my way through college but there’s only so much they can do at times since they don’t fully understand college but I really do appreciate their effort. It's my family’s effort that has really helped me, not because they solve every problem but because I know they care which means so much to me. As I try to navigate my way through, I feel like I just keep running into problem after problem but knowing that I have my family always there for me and wanting to make them proud is what really motivates me and gets me to keep going. My mom and my nieces have really helped me the most. My mom sends me school supplies and groceries whenever she can and she’s just always there. My nieces don’t realize how much they help since they’re toddlers but I try so hard in my education so that when they grow up they can have a woman to look up to and finally have a woman in the family that not only went to college but is a doctor."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,328,I think that the values of my family have helped me navigate through college by encouraging me to do my best while also not burning myself out because my family tends to go pretty hard core at things and then we get really tired so after a while we have all came to the idea that it is better to take it easy a little more. So I think that has really helped me find a balance between working really hard and relaxing or taking a mental health day so that I can do better in the long run. I also think that my parents high expectations of me has put enough pressure to push me in the right direction but also not too much pressure to the point of downfall for my mental health. I think just giving me the space and comfortability to find a balance has really helped me navigate college.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,332,"Being a first-generation Latino, both my parents have always emphasized the importance of attending college in order to pursue a career that I'd love. After both of my older brothers graduated, one from a CSU and the other from a Private, I knew then that reaching these goals of attending college and graduating was realistic and attainable to those who set their minds and who were willing to dedicate the time and commit for an extra 4 plus years after high school. While my family has always emphasized the importance of college, my community as a whole has always brushed college to the side. Many of the younger generation in my community, unfortunately, don't go to college and instead get involved with the gangs already present or get low-wage jobs. Not to say that people who don't go to college aren't as successful as time and time has proven that people without a college degree have a very identical amount of chances to be successful. For me, however, going to college and seeing my brothers graduate meant that it was not only possible but by going to college I was able to fulfill my long-desired goal of enhancing my education and knowledge of the world and in a particular subject I most cared about. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,321,I am an immigrant like my parents so everything in America is different. The communities are different so we had to adapt to many customs and traditions. The one thing that stayed with my parents are their high expectations that I need to have good grades in order to get a good job and be happy in the future. My parents attended college in the US and they still think that everything is still the same as it was back then in the early 1980s. They do not realize that subjects became harder and more things are getting introduced each year. I wish I could say that they helped me navigate through college by encourage me and helping me out when I need it but I can't. All I have to push me through is to be able to live up to their expectations even a little bit. It is funny because they had those high standards up until recently when they realized that I wasn't happy with the way I'm living my school life so they started to let me choose the path that I want to walk to find my own way to the world. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,318,"My family has helped me immensely with navigation through college. My college journey has not been an easy one, but I have found the right path that will help me reach my goal. My parents and brother have been there for me when I have struggled and I am grateful for that. When I got here in January, my brother was very helpful in that transition; he invited me to live with him while I got situated here and figured out what I was going to do. My parents have helped with ensuring that I felt comfortable here and I was doing well in school. They have been helpful with looking out for me and it has been very useful to know that they are just a phone call away. I could not think of how difficult it would have been for me if I did not have their help during these difficult times. If I did not have them, my short time here in the bay area would have ended in March and I would have not found a job that has helped me career-wise."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,326,"The values of my family and community have really helped me navigate through college. I realized that college is a difficult thing to adjust to, especially when you are traveling to a new place that you have have never lived before. However, my family and my community have helped make it a smooth transition. One value that is very important to me is the saying ""family comes first "". This is a value of mine because I don't get to see my family that much when I am away, since I am from southern California. I always try to make an effort to talk to my parents, brothers, friends, etc. just so that I can keep in touch. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,340,"Having an older sister I've always looked up to her In my academic goals and always went to her for guidance. I believe this helped me navigate through college in a way where if I was unsure on applications fast how to enroll in classes she would try to help mw in ways she can since we didn't go to the same college there were times she couldn't help me because she simply didn't know how my college did certain things. When my sister couldn't help I would try to research and figure it out on my own but that wasn't always enough. Ive never really liked asking for help because I would always get anxious I like to do things on my own but I learned asking for help will always benefit me. Therefore networking through my college experience has helped me navigate through college, getting help from others. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,343,"The value of my family and community help me much with navigating through college. Within my family, my brothers and cousins help me pick and choose classes to go to. Well only for the general ed section. My major was up to me. It took me a while to figure out what major I wanted to be. My parents always try your hardest and they don't care if I passed or failed, all that mattered was that you tried your best. If you fail, so be it, keep trying till you get it or move on, as long as you're happy, they told me. I took this to heart and tried a bunch of majors before being the major I chose now. At first I thought about kinesiology, did that for a year. Did an internship and found out I didn't like it as much as I thought. Then I did sociology, didn't really like that either. Then finally environmental science. That one stuck to me. I enjoy being out in the field doing research and hiking. I don't mind doing the grunt work or research. It was perfect."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,335,"My family have always taught me that hard work pays off and I knew I wanted to be a Speech Language Pathologist which requires a master's degree so I knew I needed to go to college. I pursued my dream and I graduated college in May so I am applying for grad school this fall. I am so excited and proud of myself for as far as I have come since going to college and pursuing my career. My boyfriend has also helped me navigate through college because he pushes me everyday to be the best version of myself that I can be. He has so much faith in me and he knows that I can do whatever I put my mind too. This has been an amazing journey and I cannot wait to see where I go in the future and the new friends that I am going to make in graduate school, it will be amazing! "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,62,"The values of my family has helped me navigate through college by constantly encouraging me to go and even strive for a higher education than college. My family are immigrants and are constantly emphasizing the importance of education and how it will aid me in living a comfortable life in the future. Based off their financial struggles, they want me to not have to worry about that when I am older. Also, my parents have always talked about college like it was a necessity, ever since I was younger. I never even thought about not going. Now I am not saying that everyone must go to college to live a comfortable life (financially), but having a degree and higher education makes it easier to find a job that will keep me financially stable. Additionally, my family has been super supportive of me during college, especially financially. I live at home, and they make sure that I have everything I need in order to be successful in my education. I am blessed to be able to live at home with my parents and have them support me financially, not a lot of people have this luxury. i am forever blessed to have parents that are financially able to support me and my college funds. It is such a luxury that makes it that much easier for me to complete my academic work at the best of my abilities. I cannot emphasize how much of a luxury this is. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,115,"My family has always pushed me to work my hardest and to produce the best work possible.  I struggled with this a lot before college and didnt  want to go because I didnt believe I would do well, but my parents suggested I give it a try because they believed in me.  I ended up loving college and was successful in my classes! I believe this was because every time I was struggling I remembered how much my parents believed in me to do well and to be successful.  They always told me I was strong, and this belief carried over into my school work.  I am so lucky to have had their support, values, and love throughout college."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,336,"My family has been really supportive, and that has had the biggest effect on me.  They always encourage me to work through things even when they are difficult, and sometimes it just helps a lot to have someone on your team, no matter what.  They have also always stressed the importance of education, and I think that has shaped how I prioritize and how I view my college experience.  My husband is also really helpful because he likes to find solutions.  When I'm struggling with something or in a situation I don't know how to navigate, he helps get me to think about where to go for help or what questions to ask.  This helps when I get overwhelmed because I can find it hard to shift my focus from being stressed about a problem to creatively thinking about a solution.  Objective opinions are really helpful for me.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,329,"My values of my family and origin help me navigate through college by basic living ways.  Helping me with how to think for myself, how to cook, take care of myself, manners, and how to do things on my own."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,334,"My values that my community and family have taught me are not only helping me navigate through college, but through life as well. They have taught me things like responsibility, owning up to my mistakes, and learning from them. These are lessons that I used everyday to not only better myself, but also create a better environment for me and my peers to grow."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,319,"The values of my family help me navigate college because both of my parents are extremely supportive. Although my mother was more prominent in my life when I was younger, she still always supported what I did and in her own way, she pushed me in the right direction in life. My father is extremely supportive as well and always pushes me to do my best and I feel like anything I would want to do with my life they would support me with what I chose. Additionally, I feel like if I was not doing anything productive with my life my family would push me to do something because they wouldn't want me doing anything unproductive. My sister has a huge role in helping me navigate college and be successful, she is older than me and has always been a role model and a person that I look up to. My sister graduated college over a year ago and her graduating and knowing the ropes of college has helped and inspired me a lot. Lastly, my grandmother never went to college so me attending college is something that always made her so proud and it will always motivate me to do my best. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,317,"Ever since I was in middle and high school, I've always known that when I grew up I wanted to have a job where I would make a positive impact on my community. I grew up in San Francisco and I loved my city and my neighborhood more than anything. I loved my beach, the people and the overall aura of the tight knit community. I knew I wanted to work in the healthcare field because I wanted to provide help and service to my community and the people because they've always been there for me since I was a child. So I guess my biggest motivator to help me get through college is not only parents but also the idea of how many lives I can positively impact in the community that continues to raise and nurture me. Whenever things get challenging in school, I am constantly reminded by the future influence I can make and how I owe my parents and the community everything that I am today. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,324,"The values of my family have helped me navigate through college by them valueing hard-work. My family has always told me to work hard and give my full effort in anything I do. Specifically in terms of my degree they constatntly remind me to look at the bigger picture/the end result. This has helped me reflect as to why Im here everytime I get discouraged. Secondly, they value persistance. If I don't understand something or cant seem to find the right answer to something they encourage me to keep trying. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,111,"The values of my family and community have helped me navigate through college. Since I can remember my parents and my Latinx communities have always told me the saying “pongas las pilas”. Pongas las pilas has been a saying many Latinx parents say to their children. This saying means to keep working hard and stay on track. Normally my parents say this saying to me to remind me to keep the focus on my studies. Every time I feel like giving up or if I feel like I failed, I always try to remember the saying “pongas las pilas”. I know I will have to work harder to succeed for the next opportunity. This saying helps me continue to work hard and continue to try my best and do better. This value has helped me navigate through college. College isn’t easy but I know as long as I have the support/values of my parents and Latinx community, it will help push me to become a better student. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,327,"I am so proud of my parents who never force me to do something I do not like. They really respect what I do and what I want to be in the future. I am majoring in Kinesiology, and their friends always tell them why don't your son become a software engineer because we live in Silicon Valley, and this job is really hot. They always say no, let me be who I am. Beside that, I have my cousin who always help to guide me in the college. At the beginning, I want to become a Physical Therapist, but my cousin gave me an advice about becoming a Physician Assistant which requires the same courses. I have done research about it, and I really like to become a PA now. I am thankful to have my parents and all cousins who guide me through college. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,339,"I moved from Morocco to the USA 6 years ago, it was super hard for me to adapt to everything here especially I came from a country where everything is 100% different. But honestly the community I am in and my family supposed me so much . college  was a huge challenge for me I did not know what to study or what to be in the future unit I met my Microbiology instructor who made me love and feel myself during and studying the subject. Until today I will say that everyday I go through teach me something new, something about me, people around me , and most importantly what I want to be and study. I know I might have made some wrong choices but I did learn so much from them. On the other hand, if it was not for my family I would have been lost and not knowing what to do, that is one of the reasons why I am doing my best to go forward and make them proud of me, even though sometimes I feel like I can not do it no more due to life struggles. I have a great hope in everything so I am hopeful to make it to the end, "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,331,"The values that was taught to me by my family translated over to my college career by being discipline throughout the years I been in college I could never figure out how a lot of college student would always go out and party every weekend with friends and I personally never understood that because students would have full time units and work part time jobs and at the same time, and pass all their classes. I just never understood it if I was to try the same thing  I would fail all my classes, I just  couldn’t never do it so I was just always said to myself just study and keep working and it’ll pay off, and eventually I got to see some of those students fail classes while I I just moved on to the next level, but in the end it made me even more discipline and smarter."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,341,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""I believe that values instilled both within your family unit and within your community are key to not only your successes but how you and future generations will function in this ever-changing world.  While I can honestly say that as I was growing up, I was raised by very good parents and my grandmother, of whom I look up to and respect up to this day.  While my mother is still a great and loving supporter that always has great advice in any situation in life and so did my grandmother before she passed away almost four years ago, I find myself still reflecting on the places that I was fortunate to grow up.  When I was young, my family moved around a bit to keep up with the ever-changing job market to ensure adequate means of survival and a better life for me, which I have been blessed enough to have never gone without, learned the value of earning what you want, and being frugal when it comes to necessities versus wants. I have had an awesome life thus far and have no complaints whatsoever.  I have lived in numerous states in the “South” before taking the oath to support and defend my country.  I have seen most of the world and truly enjoyed my job for almost 21 years.  With recently retiring at the beginning of this year, I continuously count my blessings each and every day that I have financial security that allows me to now focus on bettering myself educationally, socially and spiritually without the worry of maintaining any form of employment.  My most ambitious and dedicated goal is to complete my bachelor’s degree, start and complete a master’s degree and have the privilege and honor to teach in a college setting as a professor.  I feel that my exposure to different cultures, communities and especially my upbringing and the strong values of respect, love, honor, and genuine compassion were all pivotal in me achieving where I am today."
