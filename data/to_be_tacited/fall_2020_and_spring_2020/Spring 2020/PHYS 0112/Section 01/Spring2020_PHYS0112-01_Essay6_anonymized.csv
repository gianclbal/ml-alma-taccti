2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,304,"I always knew I wanted to go into STEM. I've always loved bio and any science-related class. What I didn't know was how hard this could actually be. The original reason why I picked STEM was that I wanted to become a Registered Nurse. I always knew I wanted to be in the medical field. Then I started working for my dentist and realized that I could be more than just a nurse (not that there's anything wrong with being a nurse). I changed my major and started to pursue dentistry. Becoming a dentist is a dream of mine and I will always aim for it. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), there's a lot of work that needs to go into this career choice. Taking multiple STEM classes at a time is hard to juggle, but I'm managing through it. I have to push and push to be able to get into dental school and really start learning about the things I'm truly passionate about."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,297,"Reflective journal #6So my major is Kinesiology and that is understanding the way the body moves. A big part of that is being able to calculate forces that can be placed on the body. Stem majors go hand in hand with Kinesiology concepts. I ultimately want to do Kinesiology because I want to be able to help people understand their bodies and to guide them in ways they can take care of themselves. There are also plenty of alternatives in which you can exercise the body and I truly think that is amazing. There is still plenty left to be discovered about disease and recovery and the process to strengthen and heal your body. Many times people are lost and do not know what do to, so being a person that someone can come to will give me personal gratification. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,295,"I have wanted to be in the STEM field my entire life without really knowing it. When I was younger, I was a pretty creative child. I was always drawing or painting or creating new clothing with whatever I found in the house. I used to say that I wanted to be a fashion designer or an artist when I grew up. However, even when I was younger, the human body always fascinated me. I would always ask my mother what type of foods I could eat to heal something in my body and I would always look up injuries that were magically fixed by doctors. I have also always loved working with others. I was constantly wanting to help people whether they were sad or physically hurt. Helping people was always my passion, so I knew I wanted to help people for as long as I can remember. Therefore, even though I was a creative kid, I knew that I wanted to go into the medical field to help people."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,298,I want to go into the STEM field because after graduating from SFSU I would like a career that is related to the environment. I'm not sure exactly what I would like to do though. I have always been drawn to the outdoors and hope that I'll be able to do some type of outdoor research. I am interested in sustainability and and how it ties to the well being of a community. Having a healthy and sustainable environment is crucial especially when living in a major city such as San Francisco. Having a toxic or polluted environment is detrimental to public health. Being able to help come up with different ways to keep our environment safe would be an ideal career for me. I want to emphasize in social equity because I feel that everyone deserves a healthy environment despite their social and economic background. I would like to give back to my community in this way. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,296,"The reason why I want to go into the STEM field is to work in the medical field. Ever since high school I have always been fascinated with biology and how to human body works. To be specific I am interested in physiology. I find it interesting how our body has adapted to heal on its own when we get injured and if the injury is too lethal, how it is science that has developed medication and technology to help us heal. In the future I would want to work with children and possibly become a pediatric physical therapist. I want to be in the STEM field to help assist others in recovering from an injury and help them get back to their normal life. We are humans, and I want to know what my body is capable of and how it does what it does to heal and grow and change over time. I want to know as much about me and the rest of society as possible because we are all similar yet different in many ways. I am excited to learn about what new scientific technology will be made to help us live our best lives especially since  the COVID pandemic began. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,307,"Ever since I was a kid, I've always known that I wanted grow up and help others with my job. I have always loved science and have been pretty good at math for the most part. I considered a science career such as an environmental specialist, but I've always leaned toward a medical career whenever I did my research. I wanted to be a nurse in high school, but now I know that I want to be a veterinarian. This means that I am part of the STEM field and will be studying taking many science courses throughout my college experience. I wanted to be in the STEM field since I know it is a challenge and will help my community when I finally do get the job I want. Overall, the STEM field is an interesting one because there is so much diversity when it comes to the careers everyone wants. It is also great to be involved in this field because I think that there are so many dependable jobs that won't go out of business. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,314,"Growing up, I didn’t always know what I wanted to do with my life after college, but then it hit me. I was always great working with my hands and mechanically inclined. I loved to take things apart and put them back together and still to this day, I haven’t changed. I take serious interests in problem solving, which is one of my strong suits. I believe I should exalt all options before asking for help. Once I’ve gotten to a point where I am out of ideas, options, and hypotheses, I reach out for assistance. I don’t reach out for answers, but if anyone else has approached the problem a different way and were their results helpful or hurtful to the project or experiment. Being in the STEM field allows room for trial and error. It gives me the opportunity to learn along the way, science teaches me something new each and everyday. I want to go into the stem field to change lives, change the way people think and approach certain situations, and to improve the quality of the environment. I find much joy in science."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,310,"I want to be in the STEM field because of my experience with it during my whole life. The STEM world has been around me my whole life. My mom was a nurse before, I was constantly doing sports. Also I know that no matter what happens to the world the STEM field will still be needed. This area of careers allows me to always be able to help people, whether I choose to be a nurse, doctor, or pharmacist. Another reason why I want to be in the STEM field is because of an internship I did in high school. This internship allowed me to shadow a career that I wanted to do in the future, the career I got to shadow was a physical therapist. This was perfect because that is what I want to be after I graduate. During this internship I got see a lot of different aspects of the job. Some things I got to see for example were how the patients felt about the physical therapists, the team needed to help the physical therapist, and the effect that career has on the physical therapists. Every aspect I saw had a lot of positives, and I got to witness it first hand and that's why I want to go into the STEM field.   "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,300,"I want to go into the STEM field because I am very passionate about helping the physical well being of others. I like to know that I am helping someone, and in the STEM field I will be doing just that. I enjoy learning about the human body, why it does what it does, and understanding how to help others. More specifically, I want to be an athletic trainer. this has been something that I have always been passionate about, and have even been a student athletic trainer throughout high school. There was very a specific reason why I wanted to specifically be a STEM major, I just knew I wanted to help others recover from injuries or prevent injuries, and I love to be around sports. I want to be in this field because of my passions and enjoyments that I have found through life. There are many other things I am interested in that are not in the STEM field, but I love knowing that I have served some purpose in someones road to recovery or performing well. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,313,"I want to go into the stem field because I love math and science. I have always wanted to do something in the medical field since I was around five years old. The field of science has always interested me in the first place. Everything about biology especially is something that I love learning about. I find it interesting that there are so many processes involved in the body and with nature. I love learning about all of the new scientific concepts and hearing about the advances in technology. The STEM field is an industry that is constantly growing and I know that there will always be a need for jobs like this, which makes me love the possibility of working in it even more. I like math to an extent, but if I had the choice I would definitely have stopped at statistics. Calculus is definitely a class that needs a majority of my attention to get through it."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,308,"Why do I want to go into stem field? I do not want to go into the STEM field because I want to become a scientist. The reason I want to going to the stem field is because I want to become an orthodontist. I started to become interested in becoming an orthodontist around middle school to high school. My brother and friends have all had braces. If you’ve noticed a lot of people before they have their braces are more shy and introverted because they are not confident in themselves because of their smile. Once their braces come off, most people will become more extroverted and will be more confident in themselves. I want to be able to help change things like in a positive way even if it’s something as small as a smile. STEM is the pathway I need to take in order to achieve that dream. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,54,I want to be in the stem field because I truly enjoy science and I truly enjoy having science in my everyday life. In the future I want to eventually be able to get my bachelors in science degree and become a veterinarian. I strive to be these things because there's not a lot of women in the stem field and there's not a lot of women of color in the stem field so I think it's time for women of color to shine especially now. I think it's amazing that a professor is a woman of color and honestly I look up to her because she explains so much to me and I know she had some challenges she faced in the past but I feel like I see her as one of my role models. I also strive to be in the stem field because I want to  show kids in low-income families and people who are and Hispanics that it's okay to choose a really hard major if you put your all to it you can achieve it.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,315,"I have many reasons as to why I want to go into the STEM field. The main reason is that I want to help people. I hope to someday be able to get my undergraduate degree, and then go on to receive a doctorate in medicine. Being a doctor would allow me to constantly be able to help and heal people from all different backgrounds. I find this extremely interesting and hope to pursue this dream someday. Even if becoming a doctor doesn’t necessarily work out as planned, getting a degree in the STEM field would allow me for so many greater opportunities in the future. I also think it would be super interesting to get involved in research positions after my undergraduate degree. I have always been interested in research and would find that to be an extremely interesting and rewarding career path. Overall, I hope to use my degree in the STEM field to benefit others."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,66,"I have been asked so many times why I decided to go into the stem field. And in realty till this day I am not quite sure how to answer that question. I am trying to come with an answer that is not only because I thought it was interesting. Ever since I was little I could remember playing being the doctor and trying to understand the human body. And as I grew up I realized that I loved biology and I loved the thrill it gave me to understand how the mind and body worked. It was interesting and that is why I decided to join the STEM field. Because I not only liked it, I loved it."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,102,"My main reason for going into the stem field is that my career goals are to go to dental school and become a dentist. STEM courses are necessary in order to build a foundation so I can use it to understand more advanced material that is covered in dental school. I also have an interest in STEM courses because they excite me and I am interested in the material. My favorite subjects are biology and math, I really enjoy solving math problems because I look at it like a puzzle and when I solve them it is very satisfying. I enjoy biology because I really like animals and I like to learn about them, and I find them very fascinating. I like to learn how animals behave and their physical attributes I also have an interest in learning about the human body. The topic that interests me the most about humans in nutrition and how different nutrients affect the human body. I also enjoy biology class because I like working with animals and observing them and seeing how they react to different environments. I chose to go into the stem field as a biology major because I want to go to dental school and many of the prerequisites overlap with my major."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,309,"The main reason why I want to do into the STEM field because it is an important field that relates to our everyday life. Science is an important concept that governs our everyday life and without that knowledge, our civilizations/society would not be the way it is. Technology helped shape our world and put humans on top that counteracted animals, diseases and natural disasters. Our ability to adapt and figure out problems and succeed is greater than ever imagined. Humans built numerous advantages that enhanced our way of living so that we can live a more rich and profuse life. The STEM field is a respected field that people aspire and admire to be in. hey are the people who continue to push forward our world. The world is consistently changing and evolving each year in technology and for health. Finally, the STEM is the field for people to go in order to make a massive influence in our daily life."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,299,"As of right now, my interest in the stem field sprouts from my curiosity in medicine. My plan right now is to go to medical school in hopes of becoming a doctor. I know that it is a long hard journey but I think I would rather do this process, than sit at an office desk job. Besides, I feel like the medical field is much more wholesome in terms of places you get to go, and the people you get to meet. You get to do many experiments, learn to look at the world in a different way. You are taught to notice the details when you are taught science, and it applies to all things in your life. You also get to travel. My only concern is that I will definitely be missing out on some things on this career path. I just have to decide whether it is all going to be worth it in the end. For right now, it feels like it will be."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,301,"I would like to go into the STEM field because I find the sciences extremely intriguing about how humanity has figured out so much about the occurrences in our universe and how humanity also has so much more to figure out still. Physics allows for a better understanding of the world around us as it pertains to mathematics and this connection has truly captivated me. Out of all the possible majors that I could have chosen, STEM was the one that I had chosen because I appreciated how they were each connected to each other in some manner. I specifically enjoy taking care of people and aiding them in the restoration of their health, which is why I am pursuing a career in the Chiropractic field. The Chiropractic field is something that would allow me to be active at a certain capacity, while helping people get back to their proper health. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,303,"I want to go into the STEM field because I want to represent more Latina women in STEM careers. I know that Latinos and women are a minority group in STEM careers, so if I pursue one, I can close the gap and motivate other young Latinas to take on a degree in STEM. I also want to go into this field because I am passionate about science and health, and have been so since high school when I took my chemistry and physiology classes at San Leandro High School. These classes sparked my interest in the STEM field and that is why I am currently pursuing a career as a clinical lab scientist at SF State. I also want to pursue a STEM career because most of the jobs pay well, which I think is important if I want to be economically stable and be able to support my family."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,305,"I wanted to get into the STEM field for Astrophysics. Math and science are the two subjects that I feel most comfortable with and I've always had a love for space. I never really discovered how interesting I thought astronomy was until I took Introduction to Astronomy last semester. Every day I went into class always asking questions and learning about so many aspects of the universe that I found to be intriguing. Taking that class truly inspired me to switch my major to Astrophysics where I hope to pursue at least a master's degree. Talking to my astronomy professor, my girlfriend, and upperclassmen who were already in the major really helped me to decide that majoring in Astrophysics is totally something that I can accomplish. I also believe in myself and I believe that I can continue in this major solely because I have a lot of passion for math, physics, and astronomy."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,312,"I have always gotten ask this question, ""Why do you want to go into the STEM field?"". I have always had a passion for the medical field since I was 7 years old. My Family has always had health problems since I was a young age, at the age of 12, my mother got diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis and I constantly thought about her health. I was in 7th grade waking up at 3am in the morning to give her a massage because her bones ached. My mother has always been my role model since I was a child. I was raised by a single mother and that changed my mentality so much. I always worry about taking care of my mother and making sure she was feeling okay with her bones. That's when i decided to go into the STEM field, I always worried about taking care of my mother and finding a cure for Rheumatoid Arthritis. "
