2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,336,"When life gets challenging I like to be by the water.  For me, this means walking to the beach (I'm glad I live close enough to walk!) and spending time listening to the waves, or walking along the beach.  Being outside helps me feel like my frustrations are smaller, and I've always found the sound of waves particularly meditative.  Physical activity also helps me deal with stress.  I like to hike, do yoga, take a ballet class, or go for a run, so I can shift my focus to the activity I'm doing rather than my stressors.  I also love the post-exercise endorphins-even if I wasn't intensely working out, I always feel better after moving my body.  Sometimes I feel like I don't have time for these things, but I'm working on being better about making time.  If I make time and walk away from my stressors, I tend to look at them more clearly when I come back to my tasks later.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,326,"There are a lot of things that I do when life gets challenging, especially in the world today with the pandemic and issue of racial equality. One thing that I like to do is do something that I enjoy. This helps me get me get my mind off of anything that is going through my head and just lets me enjoy myself. Whether it's playing video games, watching a movie or other things, having ""me"" time is a good way to combat the challenges of life. Another thing that I like to do, especially if I have bee quarantined most of the day, is to simply go outside and enjoy the outdoors. Things like going to a park to walk or playing in the backyard just let me get away from all the things, like homework, that I would usually be doing inside the house. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,341,"""What do I do when life gets challenging?""Whenever life gets challenging, no matter what it actually is, I first take a step back to evaluate the situation.  I look at what the ""real"" problem(s) are and what are potential remedies to correct those issues.  I always try to approach any problem with a very open mind and open heart (when required) to gauge the whole situation to figure out what is truly wrong, what are some ways to fix the problem and the affects my decision will make on the situation or others involved.  I always try to look for a win-win resolution, while sometimes those options are not always possible; some people can or will never be happy with anything that is done or that isn't done by or for them directly.  I always try ensuring to make the best decision based on all data obtained or already known, to make a very educated decision; while that is easy for simple situations, it is definitely more challenging when you throw in the dynamics of another person, group of people or a loved-one.  So all you can do is make the smartest decision with your mind, with minimal use of what your heart says, sometimes the heart doesn't have the ability to evaluate all aspects for a true and honest decision."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,325,"I've noticed that life is very similar to a sine graph. Sometime your on top, and sometimes you are below the x-axis. This being said I try to understand that when I have a good day, I try to appreciate it as much as I can. On the other hand when life gets challenging I try to think of it as a temporary state. When things get really tough, I try to detach from my situation. This is often difficult because when I am struggling I tend to get emotionally volatile. With an increase in anxiety and stress, I sometimes become locked into a distressed mindset. To combat this, detaching from emotion allows me to view my situation through a different perspective. I know that if I can push through it, I will see growth in one form or another. Detach, recalibrate, fix attitude, and execute, are my general steps to handling a challenging situation. I refrain from saying, ""Why me?"" and rather take ownership of all aspects of my life and say, ""What can I do."" After all there are no problems, there are only solutions."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,330,"When life gets challenging for me, sometimes I just get in my car and drive. No destination. No obligations. I just drive. Luckily, I live in San Francisco, so my favorite places to go are either Embarcadero (at night), Golden Gate Park (in the day), or pretty much any of the touristy spots (like Twin Peaks). If I was going through Embarcadero then I wouldn't get off of my car. But to be honest, I think just driving around, getting yourself lost (especially at night time) is a little more fun and freeing. I think it's freeing because you choose if you want to make a left, make a right, or go straight. I do suggest doing this at night though, that way traffic wouldn't stress you out. I'm lucky to have a car that's awesome on miles. Another thing I'd do if I'm stressed out is just lay on my bed, close my eyes, and just let it all out. Usually during this time of letting it all out, I get the urge to write poems, and that also lets me de-stress (I'm able to take all my pains and sorrows out of my head and put it on paper)."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,321,"Honestly, when life gets challenging, I just like to take a moment to relax so that my mind and body could rest before I try to tackle the challenge again. Just because something is challenging doesn't mean that it is impossible to do. It is a challenge for a reason. It doesn't matter how many tries it takes to finish the challenge. It is more important that a person is able to finish the challenge and grow from it. I'm saying this because a lot of parents these days expects their children to finish challenges or get over obstacles in their lives quickly like it is easy. They do not realize that life is different now. Elders need to understand that things change overtime so they need to change the way they think because it is preventing them from moving forward and is hindering others from moving forward as well. How can parents tell their children to ""get over it"" when they can't even get over their own outdated way of thinking. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,324,"When life gets challenging I'm often tempted to sleep. However, in the light of picking up better habits I will often make to-do lists to organize all the things I need to get done. I also might reflect on why I'm doing what I'm doing in order to keep the motives high in times where I might be feeling low. Also reflecting on how far I've come and knowing that if I can overcome the obstacles of my past I can overcome the obstacles in my future."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,111,"What do I do when life gets challenging? Normally, I first stress out when my life gets challenging. I can’t help but start to get stressed out, feel anxious, and overthink a lot. I hate stressing out but it’s a normal reaction I get when I feel like my life is getting challenging, but once I stop feeling stressed out, I try to calm myself and think positively. I always try to tell myself that “I got this”. Some challenges I have in my life can be from school assignments or life problems. When I do have challenges, I try to think of a solution to solve my challenge/problem. I think problem-solving is helpful when I feel my life is getting challenging. Another thing I do is talking to someone about my challenges. I normally rant to my sister, my parents, my best friend, or my cousins. I normally feel better after I talk to someone."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,340,"When life gets challenging I do feel quite overwhelmed because there is so much stress and pressure on me. I do feel down sometimes because im getting the feeling of possibly being defeted.  I can be hard on myself sometimes but I remember that being so hard on myself will not help this situation. When I feel life getting challenging I like to try to distress myself with going for a run, walk, or a trip with my friends to let the stress go for a little while. After I will seek for help if I can't figure something out on my own because there is nothing wrong with seeking help. I try to keep a positive mindset as well because without one it can be harder to over come the challenge I am going through in life at the moment. Having a good mindset going into situation is key to have a better outcome."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,60,"I want to say that I work even harder and that I don’t let anything get me down when life gets challenging but that is not always the case. When something is challenging, I do eventually pick myself back up and work harder but not right away because sometimes life just really sucks and it gets really hard so sometimes I just need a minute to process everything and get in the right mindset to work. I am a little ashamed to admit that I do let challenges get to me sometimes but I don’t think that’s right, I think we as people should be allowed and feel as if it's okay to not have it all together right away. Though I don’t have it all together right away, I will say that I do eventually get it together and work really hard despite the immense amount of stress I may feel. I do wanna say though that I am a naturally very anxious and stressed out person so though I may get very anxious I very rarely let that get in the way."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,316,"Life is full of wonderful things, but unfortunately there are also downs that we experience and must go through, as it is a part of life. By no means am I perfect, but at this point in my life I feel as though I have figured out a formula to ease my mind when life gets challenging. The first thing I do is identify the problem. Then I honestly think through whether or not I can fix the problem. If it is something I cannot fix, then I have to remind myself to relax, what is done is done, and I have to move forward. Moving forward can be extremely difficult in some situations, but it is crucial to getting into a better place overall. On the other hand, if there is something I can do about the problem then I list out the different possible outcomes/solutions. The important thing is to take every challenge in life as a lesson in order to learn and grow as a person, which we continue to do throughout the rest of our lives. Furthermore, some activities I like to do when life gets challenging is working out at the gym. I can release all my built up stress, and I always leave with a clearer head."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,333,"When life gets challenging I usually find other ways to overcome the challenge before asking for help because I like challenges. I think im the type of person who always tries first before going to ask anyone else for help. I usually will try to stress myself out before I bother anyone else. But I know when to stop burning myself out and ask for help. Help from my friends who I think might know the solution to the problem or challenge and usually by that time I might have already solved the challenge, but if don't then I will go ask a professor or someone with the most experience. But, nevertheless I think I love a challenge, having a challenge once in a while is exciting. Specially, right now that we are kinda still in quarantine its cool to have a challenge to keep me entertained, like this class is a challengeeeee. But I have worked through it and it has taught me a lot about the outside world and about myself."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,328,A lot of the time when life gets challenging I shut down my emotions completely and just keep working on whatever needs to be done in order to distract myself from whatever is going on. However this tends to make things build up over time which leads to having panic attacks and moments of high emotions because I have been emotionally shut down so much. In a lot of ways I feel like my coping mechanism is both helpful in the moment and destructive in the long term because I am bottling up a lot to get through things and then exploding once they are over. I am trying to work through this with more open communication with the people around me and myself conscience to help myself through tough moments.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,317,"When life gets challenging, I always feel like the first step of getting better starts from within you. The way you interpret these challenges internally and keeping a positive mentality makes a huge difference. I remember in the past, every time it seems that life hates me, I wouldn't know how to deal with it and would also break down crying, ranting to people about it and blaming things. At the moment it was the best was to cope with the challenges of life but overtime, a feeling of guilt would build up and make me feel worse.Learning how to change my mindset has helped me mentally with dealing with the challenges of life. Theres no such thing as failure, everything can be a learning opportunity. Take these ""failures"" and learn how you can improve next time. I've also learned to be grateful of everything. I'm grateful to live life, I'm grateful for my friends and family and the roof over my head! Be grateful for the challenges you face because thats life and everyone has their own rough patches. So whenever life gets challenging, I make sure I'm in a positive mindset first to take on that challenge. Listening to good music is a great place to start with keeping a positive mindset. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,337,"When life gets challenging I tend to exclude myself from everybody and try to focus on the problem or issue that I am facing. I find it difficult to surround myself with other people when I am facing problems because I tend to focus on the wrong things. For me, when I am alone and in my own space, it is easier to solve whatever problems I am presented with. I come up with solutions and/or answers faster and more effective. However, when I am around people or distractions then I won’t be able to focus on the problems. I would take a longer time to solve the issues too. These are the reasons why I believe that I do better when I am left alone or exclude myself from distractions when life gets challenging. I do believe that sometimes it is better to ask for help from others when I know I need the support from those individuals. It’s not always best to try to do everything yourself. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,318,"Whenever I feel challenged in life, I trying to do things that will bring me joy. Now, that can be a lot of ways. In the past, I used running as a mechanism to overcome some challenges; it would help me calm down and escape for a while. However, I do not always use the most active methods. I usually tend to just relax and watch videos that I enjoy. By do this, helps me enjoy the things that I like and I do not have to worry about the things that are stressing me out. At times, when I cannot do any of this, in order to avoid my challenges, I tend to take the challenges head on; I do not like the challenges to linger and if I can overcome them, then I can continue with my life. Sometimes, challenges are difficult to deal with, but it is important that a person focuses their strength on themselves first, then the challenges."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,332,"When life gets challenging sometimes its okay to take a sep or two back and use that moment to stop what you are doing and rest your mind. I remember being really stressed out one-time as I was trying to balance 18 units and two jobs. At the time I didn't really do anything and just let myself stress out to the point of exhaustion and unfortunately failure. That became a learning experience for me, however, as in a way the unfortunate experience woke me up and brought me to the realization that we got to take care of ourselves. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,343,"For the most part when life gets challenging, I do these three things. Workout, listen to music.. When I workout there's really nothing to think about. I usually work out alone, unless I need a spotter. It helps clear my mind. It's just me, the weights and music. I get into like this trance like state. The only thoughts in my mind is how much more reps and sets I should do. What's the smartest way to workout for the day. If I need to switch up my routine to confuse my muscles for maximum growth. I have absolutely no thoughts about the outside world, other than working out. With this Covid stuff happening, I built my home gym. I hardly have time to use it because of this course and work. I still try to keep up. Before covid hit, I maxed bench at 235lbs. I have not gain or decreased in strength since then. I really don't listen to music much unless I'm working out. Working out makes me happy even if I'm not stressing on anything."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,62,"When life gets challenging, I take a step back and stop looking at all the negative aspects of my life. I try to look at all of the positivity and blessings that I have, no matter how small they seem in the moment. These past few months have been very dark, difficult, and almost unbearable at times. At the darkest times, I couldn't find any blessings in my life, but the only blessing I would find is prayer. Praying, especially at the worst of times, is the only thing that gives me clarity, peace of mind, and eases some of my anxieties. Thankfully, those negative aspects of my life have been looking better, but there are some difficult times and I always find myself counting my blessings and praying. Also, looking forward is something that I do during difficult times. Especially during this pandemic, when isolating yourself from people you love and constantly watching the horror movie that is the news, looking forward and planning stuff for me in the future makes me feel better and helps me get through a challenge. I would call me friends and make ""post-covid"" traveling plans, and that would always make me feel better. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,320,"When life gets challenging, I tend to not know how or when the right time to ask for help, leading me fall into the suffer-in-silence category. Typically, especially with academics, if I don't understand something I get mentally stuck on that one thing until I am able to either find a solution for it or work around what I don't know in hopes I can figure the rest out and piece together the puzzle pieces. With this, I tend to have built up stress a lot, until it gets to the point where I have to make myself accountable for monitoring it instead of ignoring it through either obsessing over a problem at hand or procrastinating while being fully aware of not wanting to procrastinate. Typically my self care mode involves lots of calm, happy music. I admittedly enjoy singing along with songs and it helps me stay focused on work without getting overwhelmed by the material. As well, I make sure to monitor that I'm consistently taking the medications I have for my mental health, checking on my many houseplants, making sure I am eating actual meals, checking in with myself mentally and physically (as with stress for me comes almost week-long migraines a lot of sitting, and I've gotten blood clots from this exact thing before), getting myself out of the house whether that be to go long boarding or walking to the grocery store. I want to work on getting better about asking for help, and knowing where my mental boundary lays stress and workload-wise, but it can be difficult to pick up on things before they get out of hand. Through this I also remind myself to forgive myself for not being the perfect person I wish I was, we're all only human anyways. I hope whoever reads this as well accepts themselves faults and all, and knows that they are just as important as anyone else. :)- I had written a journal response during class but hadn't realized it wasn't submitted. So sorry this was late!"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,334,"What I do when life gets challenging? I usually try to keep things positive and push through. A lot of things in life become stressful and difficult and it is necessary to realize that you can't grow and move forward if you don't face adversity. Sometimes, I like to take a step back and see what the problem is and how i can deal with it with my current skills. If i can do it by myself, I'm not afraid to ask for help from my peers, teachers, and family if I need it."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,335,"When life gets challenging I often sit and wonder why it is challenging. What am i doing wrong? How much stress have I had in a week? One of my favorite things to do when life gets challenging is go to the beach and walk around. I take in the smells of the ocean, I like to bury my toes in the sand and talk to people as well. I will take one of my family members with me sometimes but other times I like to be by myself and jam out to my favorite music. This helps me every single time. It resets my frustration meter and helps to put things into perspective. It is always nice to be refreshed and realize that life is too short to hold onto things I cannot control everyday. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,115,"When I find myself struggling or feeling challenged by a class, I will take time to review all of my notes and rewrite what I feel I am struggling most with.  I will then review this paper over time until I feel comfortable with the information.  Now when things in life get challenging, I try to find time for myself to do things I enjoy! This usually means making plans with my boyfriend, watching TV, drawing, etc.  Often times I also find it comforting to talk it out with my mom or my boyfriend."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,329,"When life gets challenging, I usually go out for a run with my dog.  I feel like running gets my mind off of any negativity or anything related to my problems that day.  It helps me physically and mentally feel better because I am more focused on my breathing and surroundings.  Whenever I do any task, not just running, it makes me think of only the thing that I am doing in the moment, but running is the thing that I enjoy the most because it makes me feel better about myself during and after my run."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,331,"As I described to some of my classmates the things I do when life get challenging is that I don’t give up, as I experience through my life I have seen a lot of people go through challenging times weather their dealing with Illnesses, having financial problems, or depression and the one thing I notice they all had in common was they all either gave up, or could not meet up to the challenge. But however as regarding me I’m more like a machine I do give up I keep going like a machine and I don’t give up I just keep pushing and moving forward because I know it’s something at the end of the challenging time that I would be going through that there is something that is going to benefit me in the long run, to help me or either my friends and family along the way."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,327,"The path to our destination is not always straight. My path is not straight does not mean I lost. We have to go through these challenges to be successful in live or achieve our goal. Every time I have to face with challenge, I try to think positively and look at positivity to put effort to go over them. The challenge is just a small step in life that I have to step over. Challenge will give me a lesson that I can learn and turns me to how I am now. Therefore, respecting a challenge and learn to overcome it instead of choosing giving up on challenge. For example, as doing Physic homework, sometimes I feel disappointed myself because I could not solve some problems quickly. It might take me longer than other students. However, I might remember those approach because I stay in a problem longer than others. I try to look at the positivity to put attempt on doing something. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,323,"What do I do when life gets challenging? There are times when so many challenges pile on to me at once that I began to feel hopeless. I will tell myself to grind through every single day. I tell myself to keep on pushing because eventually this challenge will be overcome so I need to face the challenge rather than to hide from them, and trust that those challenges will create a callus that would better prepare me for the next challenge. There are also the physical challenges. The physical challenge could be as simple as commuting to SFSU throughout the semester (back in the good ole' days) from my residence in Oakland. There are days when I simply could not do it and other days when I had to drag myself out of the bed to make the 90 minute commute. There were days when I wanted to stop going to school and there were days when I was so exhausted from work and school that the mile walk to the BART station seemed physically impossible. Despite some adversity I have faced, I am still here, and I am still grinding."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,338,"When time gets tough, I look inward for strength. I remind myself of my past struggles and if I over came those obstacles then I can overcome anything. I do have my moments of being human and have my ""break throughs"" but I acknowledge that I am human and it is ok not to be ok at times. All that matters is that I get through it. I also know that I can pull on my support system if I need additional support. I am really lucky to have that. I know that not everyone has support and so I am extremely fortunate for those special people in my life. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,319,"When life gets challenging I rely on my family a lot, my sister and my dad are always people I can count on to be there for me when I am going through a hard time. In my of 2020, my grandmother just passed away so these last few months have been really trying on everyone in my family, from extended to immediate. I found that although when I am going through a hard time I may be inclined to not talk to a lot of my friends about it because I typically don't like expressing my personal business with everyone, that I did find comfort in spending time with my friends as well, and that when you express what is going on in your life it allows people to be there for you. Along with the comfort of my friends in challenging times, I always rely on my family because they are the ones that no matter what love me so although my dad may be unemotional, he is still a comfort source for me."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,61,"When life gets challenging i always got with the flow . Every situation is unique and requires a thoughtful response and solution . Not all reactions are suitable for a certain situation . Sometimes that situtation can be a conflict , life change due to a major life descion or every something that is not entirely in my control . For example COVID-19 . This situation has thought me that sometimes things happen despite everything we try to try prevent . In the end , life must go on even if i have to make changes to the normal routein .  For exmaple  attending online classes instead of going to campus like the normal . "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,101,"Personally for me, I get really stressed out when life gets challenging. Sometimes I vent to my therapist, family, or friends, but sometimes I feel like it's more appropriate to keep it to myself because I don't want to bother them with my own concerns and struggles. There are even times when I feel like talking to someone won't make me feel ""satisfied"" if that makes sense. I want to feel fulfilled after talking to someone, like I know that someone is actually listening to me. I just realized, now that I'm writing, I distract myself when things get challenging in my life. I would watch YouTube videos or read a book, which keeps my mind away from anxious thinking. I feel like it's very helpful that way so that my mind won't get darker and darker. Other than that, when I have to confront my problems, I have to make a plan eventually."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,1,339,"First thing I do when life gets challenging is think about all of what I achieved so far in my life, because that it self make me feel positive and have positive thoughts even though I know that thinking like that won't do me any good for whatever I am in, but It will keep me going otherwise I will feel like I can not do it and I start feeling depressed. Now life is very hard on me on general I am going through a difficult time, family, work, and school at the same time is very hard to deal with, and it gets me off truck with my classes some times which make me feel very stressed, but at the end of the day there is nothing I can do but thinking of keeping up with everything. In this life nothing is easy chewing on a piece of bread also take you some work to do, we are in this life set to challenges and tests, we tend to fail and win some challenges . Which makes me always think that we are not perfect and we will somehow make it to a certain location. "
