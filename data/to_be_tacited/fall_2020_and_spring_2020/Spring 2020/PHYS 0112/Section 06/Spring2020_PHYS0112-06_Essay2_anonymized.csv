2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,401,"So, the resources I have are to attend instructors' office hours, schedule tutoring, use library, and computer center. However, now because of the virus, I am not sure how tutoring is being managed. However, I never really liked the idea to schedule an appt to sit with one tutor because then I feel like I have to sit there constantly asking questions and feel unsure when someone's looking over my shoulder. I enjoy the Chemistry dept. tutoring, where I sign in and ask whatever tutors that are available to answer whatever question I have, I work on it by myself and go back for more help if needed. Also, now that library and computer areas are closed, I no longer have the resource of a quiet space and have to figure it out at home in an environment where I live with others and I have to find time for quietness and a place for it. Beyond, those things I’m not sure what other resources I have. I feel like counselors are sometimes helpful in figuring out what classes I have left and how soon I will be done, but in reality, information from classmates is a lot more helpful than what counselors have to recommend. I am looking to join/ help get started the Preveterinary Society where I can I have the resource on how to build up my portfolio and experience in the Veterinary field.   "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,402,"I have many resources to use. School wise, I have my laptop, books, my professors, videos, the library, study groups, peers, etc. Support system wise, which is very important to me, I have my parents, my friends, my siblings, my cousins, my grandparents, and also my peers. I have so many people and other resources to help me achieve my goal in life. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,403,"The resources that I have in this class is my lab instructor, my lecture teacher who also happens to be the lab coordinator. I also have my classmates who can help me when I am confused about problems. Most of all I have tutors outside of class that can help me understand a confusing topic. I think it's important to know all the resources that you have in order to be successful in a class because it allows you to ask questions and dive deeper into a topic. But it is also important to have a support system at home because in college you don't just take one physics class, you have more classes and they could be a lot more stressful. In my case I am also taking Biology 240 and there is a lot that goes into that class therefore most of my attention is focused into that class. My support system (friends/fam) allows me to stay stress free and make sure that I get to all the classes and homework on time. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,404,"I am fortunate to have many resources at my disposal. I live fairly close to the school which means I can use the library whenever I need to. They provide computers, printers, and places where I am able to focus on my studies in times where it may be hard to focus at my house. Some other resources I have available include the free Muni transportation. This is very helpful because I am able to use it as needed. I use it to get to school, I use it to get to work, and I use it to get around the city. This free Muni included with tuition allows me to save money and use it in other areas in my life. At home, my roommates and I have wi-fi. The gym at State is also very useful because I love to workout and it is important to stay in shape."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,86,"What Resources Do I Have?I have the advice and experiences of professors, advisors, and people that I meet that have experienced college longer than I have. I also have technology, which I feel is hugely taken for granted even by me. Not everybody has this resource so if you do, it's so important to utilize that and be appreciative of that. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,405,"I know I have a lot of resources I can go on campus when school is normally in session. I have the health center, gym, gator groceries, and counseling services at the student health center to take care of myself both physically and mentally. I have my professors, the library, academic advisors (both major and GE), and tutoring to go to if I need help academically. I have the campus police and CARE escort as an option if I feel unsafe on campus. Let's not forget the various offices scattered around campus too to help me with other school stuff, such as grades and finances. I cannot forget family and some friends being one of my main resource for support as well when I'm having a hard time or need something essential (like food). I don't use all of the resources, and I sometimes feel bad for not using them since they don't apply to me at all or all the time, but it is comforting to know that I have them on hand in case I need to use them one day. I remember first starting college here at SFSU and not knowing who to help me, where to go for something, or much of the resources on campus. I have to say, it took a while to learn what's on campus through professors or me poking around, but it wasn't bad as I expected. I thought I had to learn as much of the resources as I could on campus during my first year, but it turns out I didn't have to and that learning what's on campus is just an accumulation of knowledge over time. It is okay if I don't know a resource now, I'll eventually find out about it if I do. Also, it was comforting to learn that many people going to SFSU don't even know all the resources at school and weren't bothered by it. That helped me panic less as a freshman over time along with getting more comfortable on campus, knowing I can live with out a resource if need be."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,406,"I have a lot of resources in my life. At first glance, I feel like I have none; however, I have a lot. To start, my family cannot financially support me and my college career. I do have an amazing mother that has and will single-handily emotionally support me and my siblings. Another resource that I have is my friends. This is, honestly, one my biggest resources that I have. They will always be there for me emotionally, especially because we shared common experiences of education. They can also help me with academic stuff, as I am a first-generation student and my family is no help when it comes to academics, unfortunately. Another big resource for me is the university. On campus, I have access to medicine, tutoring, printing, electronic renting, textbook rentals, and even food. All of these things have come in handy when navigating this whole schooling thing. I have so many advantages because of these resources."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,407,"Erika Ono-Kerns PHYS 112 Prompt 2 I feel grateful for the resources I have to learn physics. At school, I know  a few students that share my professor that I can ask questions of, and I  have friends from high school that love to help when I have questions.  My family is full of physics experts. My dad is an actual genius who  taught math and computer science at MIT. My mom uses dynamics in  computer graphics and creates computer models as well, and my sister is  an engineer. Unfortunately, those genes were not passed on, but I can ask  them questions now in quarantine. Online resources have always been  helpful for trickier topics, and I have used Khan Academy since middle  school for extra practice. I am really grateful for the labs, as it makes my  understanding of the topics more concrete, after getting to see how the  physics works, instead of just solving the equations. This semester,  CARP and LAC dissolved to create TASC, but I am still confused about  how to use that resource with online learning."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0112,--,6,408,"Victoria Agundez   ID: 917104518  Phys: 112   April 6, 2020  Reflective Journal Essay #2 “What resources do I have?”              Some of the resources I have are family support. Not everyone is blessed enough to have the support of their family. I still have resources to communicate with advisors on campus if I ever have questions about anything. Thankfully I have a Laptop as a resource to complete and to continue my education for the rest of this semester. I myself am a resource to have the ability to seek help when needed. To not be afraid to ask questions or go find help when I need it. I still have access to the tutoring center virtually as a resource. Thankfully I’m apart of SOAR Trio, so I have the program as a resource. I have my faculty advisor as a resource. To seek help within the program if needed. I think motivation is considered a resource. Even though I’m struggling with it right now through the current situation of Covid-19, I still am motivated to try and continue my education under the circumstances."
