2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,651,The reason why I chose to go into Computer Engineering is that sophomore year of high school I began to take coding classes. I would say that I fun when I understood what I was doing. From here I learned how to build computers and I thought it was really fun so I have just followed my passion and will continue to do so. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,652,"I am majoring in Mathematics with an emphasis in Teaching and I want to go into my major because I would like to become a high school math teacher. In high school, I have always loved tutoring my peers in my math classes and I enjoyed teaching people some of the math concepts. I think that there are not enough teachers in public schools, especially in the math department that actually try and teach concepts to the students. In my high school, most of the math teachers there did not really teach the material well enough for people to learn and master mathematical techniques. This reason alone encourages me to work and learn how to become an efficient and a reliable math teacher. I feel as if every individual must know the basics in life so that they can be able to do daily things like calculate discounts and whatnot. I do want to become a high school math teacher but lately I've been thinking of possibly becoming a math professor at a community college or something. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,650,"""Why do I want to go into my major?""There are a few reasons why I want to go into my major (Astrophysics). One of the reasons that I chose to go into this major is because my ultimate dream is to work for NASA. This well-known agency is amazing in the works that they do. Their projects have been beneficial to the U.S. and they continue to improve their skills for better outcomes on their experiments. I have also had the opportunity to discuss with a former Astronaut from NASA, Ellen Ochoa, who was the first Hispanic woman to go into space. She went into detail about the projects that she conducted while she worked at NASA and she also described the staff/facility and said she it was the best choice she's ever made. Another reason that I would like to go into this major is because it is mainly dominated by men. I would like to be one of the few women to make a change in the diversity within the STEM field. Hopefully one day I will be able to advise younger women that the STEM field is also open to women and not only men. Young girls often find themselves steering away from STEM majors because they feel intimidated by the competitiveness from the males. It would be nice to see a greater increase of women pursuing a career related to STEM."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,445,I want to go into my major because I can make a lot of money with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and support my family and pay back my parents for everything they've done for me. I also want to go into Mechanical Engineering because I like cars and want to be able to work with cars in my future. i can make a lot of money and support my family and also get the car that I want and be able to modify and make it the way that I like it. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,647,"I want to go to my major because the game developing is my whole purpose. At first, I cannot find my purpose and when I took computer science in high school, I discovered that being a game developer can make you a lot of money and will lead you to be more successful. Game developing is part of computer science and I should get to learn the basics first if I want to get to know how to develop a game quicker. There’s a class in the computer science major where I can take to learn how to develop a game, but it is an upper division course which will require a lot of pre-requisites in order for me to stay in that class. I heard that upper division classes have very high standards because you need to pass a certain amount of class in order to attend to it, otherwise, you will be dropped from it at the beginning of the class."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,655,"I always enjoyed looking up at the night sky and wondering if there is anything that goes beyond our comprehension. When i was in middle school and high school. I will learn about space and the beauty of it. All the different colors and the mystery that it brings to our attention, drives me to want more and more. I want to know more of the unknown. This is why I decided to major in astronomy. Little did I know it will be difficult, but I know it will be worth it at the end when I am looking for the next mystery in space. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,648,"I want to go into my major to proceed in the path of working in the aerospace industry. I have been mechanically inclines all my life, and a major such as engineering helps me understand the physics and math of what’s going on. I wanted to also go into this major to challenge myself and to prove to myself that I have what it takes to become an engineer. The engineering industry is also a much needed industry, and there will always be work and room to grow"
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,653,"Before entering college I was very excited to become an engineer, since I was little I was fascinated on how houses were built. My father works in construction and there were times when I was little and he would take me to see the house they were building. There were times where I would see the entire process through the end, and there were times when I would see just the beginning and the end. I would only go with him during the weekends when there was no one at the construction site, he would go to keep the place clean, and also when it would rain he would check to see if everything was still in tact. Since then I was very fascinated by it. Now that I have started taking classes for civil engineering, I'm not really liking them. So far out of the classes that I've taken I have only enjoyed one and that's materials, other then that I don't like the other classes. There are times when I want to switch major, but then yet again it is already kind of late since I'm about to go into my fourth year. Before all of this math use to be one of my favorite subjects, but now I don't know since it's very complicated. To be honest if I were to switch my major, I don't know what I would switch it too. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,440,I want to be able to do incorporate things from my major to real life scenarios that not include my future job etc....
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,570,"My major that I'm currently working towards is microbiology. See ever  since I was five years old I knew I wanted to become a doctor one day  and that is still my dream. As I grew up my love for science intensified  but I still didn't knew what types of branches the basic biology,  chemistry, and physics could offer until I got into high school. It was  there that I began to love biology out of the other two main sciences.  It was also in AP Bio I learned that there were multiple branches that  dealt with the body internal systems thus rerouting me towards learning  about microbiology. Which makes sense because I want to know what  exactly is happening at the microscopic levels of many different  organisms in the animal kingdom but specifically humans. So therefore I  also still want to expand my knowledge of microbiology to studying  virology or epidemiology since its another sub branch of micro."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,649,"My major was something very hard to choose. Specially, because I did not know what I was passionate about. I was good at everything I did, but I was never passionate about anything. I felt I was a robot just working to succeed. So, following that idea of success. I decided to go into science fields, because they are the most well paid jobs here in the United States. Physics is something easy to understand for me. I know that the Biomedical area is so good, so I am planning to study a BS in Physics be part of as many labs as I can and then apply to a PhD program or to Med School and study Medical Physics which is needed in every hospital, to control all the machinery like x rays and stuff like that. After I get into a program I think of doing my residency at a hospital and then work in any hospital. I know this is a hard path to follow, but I am a person that is always looking forward to improve and be the best version of myself. This is really an idea of success that comes along with effort. You do not need passion to be successful. I am just ok with what I do. Nothing really fills my life."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,446,I want to go into my major because Physics is my passion. I realized at a young age that I love learning about how the universe works. Learning about the world I lived in gave me a satisfaction I could not find anywhere else. Science answered questions like why does the earth spin? Why do objects fall? What is friction? Why do we exist? And one that I could never answer even until this day is... Where does our universe come from? This is an answer that physics is still trying answer. My curiosity about the mechanics of our universe has drawn me to physics and is a big reason why i am pursuing it in college. I also googled how much a physicist makes in a year and they're side by side with computer scientists salary wise which is only more reason to pursue the major. I know it will be hard but I can do this!!!
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,654,"Currently I am a biochemistry major and a big part of being in this major is attributed to the fact that i intend to attend medical school after finishing my undergraduate degree. A big reason for choosing this major is because it allows me to meet all the prerequisites to enter medical school without having to take courses outside of my major which would result in an elongation in the time period that I would spend as an undergraduate. Another reasons I decided on this major was because of my interest in chemistry and how things in the universe work at the most basic levels. Originally I had declared as a biology major but once realizing that biochemistry would allow me to explore more a subjected i desired i switched despite this major providing a few extra roadblocks when it comes to required course in comparison to a biology degree. Lastly i picked this major for job security, despite wanting to go to medical school only 40% of all applicants get in, so in the case that I am not able to peruse my true career passion I will still hold a degree that gives me a plethora of options within the scientific community to find employment while allowing me to work in a field and subject that i am interested in and passionate about. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,439,"I want to go into my major because in high school I didn't know what I wanted to do, and I took a gap year in order to figure that out, and I talked to my family to see why they chose their majors, and particularly interesting to me was my cousin's input about computer science. He told me that he really enjoyed computer science and that it made him happy so I tried taking an online course. I learned a lot of things and it made me very interested and excited when I understood what was going on in my online course. I was somewhat intimidated when I first came to SFSU because I figured it would be very hard to learn computer science, since I didn't have much previous experience. However, once I came into class and started learning I felt at home and I enjoyed understanding what was going on. I hope to one day get a job with Google or a company like that and though it gets hard sometimes with this major, I am going to keep trying. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,559,"I want to go into my major (biochemistry) because I want to later on become a pharmacist. I want to also learn how cancer is formed and maybe even do trials of finding cures for it. I know it won’t be easy but I’m tired of cancer hurting my family members. I also want to be able to give back to my family when I worked a couple years in that field. I want change and biochemistry will get me there and pharmacy school after. As I’m starting off with basic classes like chem 115, it was easy but now being online I’m struggling. Calculus was a struggle but with the help of sci class and tutoring it has been getting easy. I know the best way to understand math is to practice. After conquering these classes I’ll be ready for the rest of my journey in classes. Hopefully being back at SF state so I can learn the way I want to."
