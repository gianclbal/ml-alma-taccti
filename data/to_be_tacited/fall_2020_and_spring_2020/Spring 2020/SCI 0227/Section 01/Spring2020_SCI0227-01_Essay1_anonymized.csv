Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,646,"Why am I here?     For many years that question resonated in my head. I found myself always looking for the reason, or purpose, of my being. My curiosity led me to some harsh experiences, lonely places and some exciting adventures. My need to find that answer has also help me to find myself and taught me to accept not just me, but others for who they are. I’ve never really put my finger on why I’m here, I just don’t ask myself to go looking for an answer anymore. I’ll know when the epiphany hits me. I just hope it leaves me standing.  As for SFSU, honestly, I’m completing something I began in 1991 back in Ohio. I want to be the first in my family to graduate college. I began my scholastic journey at the Ohio State University as a CIS major. The equivalent of being in the Computer Science program here at San Francisco State University.   Yet it’s more than just the degree and being the first. I want my daughters to see a better me. To know that I never quit and that I pushed through some very hard times in life and eventually segued from working a job to enjoying a career. Giving up is never an option.  San Francisco is a different story altogether. I love this city. I’m in love with its beauty, geography, the diverse social scene and people that label SF as ‘home’ too. Although, I’ve familiarized myself with those aspects, vicariously, through the eyes and experiences of others. The San Francisco, I know first hand are the places they don’t put on the post cards. It’s when I found myself in these questionable venues and around unpredictable groups, that I’d usually ask myself my purpose or “why am I here.” Yet, life’s distractions never yielded an answer. At least not a correct one.  So I continue on, primarily because I realize my potential. My worth. And quitting isn’t an option. If my purpose is never revealed, I had a good time trying to connect with reason. It doesn’t render my journey through life empty or unfulfilled. I believe it means my purpose is to large to settle for mundane or what others expect of me. I’m patient, and make time to smell the roses."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,647,"The reason why I am literally in this college is because I want to earn my degree so I could get a better job. Most jobs require a specific college degree in order for them to hire you to work for them. I figured that if I were to graduate from college and get my degree, it will increase my chance for me qualifying for a high paying job. The reason why I choose to enroll in the SCI class was because you actually get a unit towards graduation. I needed that unit because I am currently behind due to me passing only 11 units last semester. The other reason why I chose to enroll in this class is because I do have trouble in math sometimes. I make small mistakes and I did not even know it until my work was graded. I know this class is okay to make mistakes because the people around me here are very understanding and they will support you whenever you are in need. This class also have people helping each other and I am proud to be part of it. With the help of this class, people will not struggle as much as they do in their regular math class and it will definitely save some grief. This class also helps us prepare upcoming math exam and also go over homework problems that we have trouble so we can earn the most point possible. This sums up the reason why am I here in this community and how it affects us."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,648,"The reason that I am here is to further my understanding of the concepts in Calculus 2. I think that I decided to add this class so I could ask questions and also practice problems relating to calculus 2. 6 years ago when I took calculus 2, in which I got a F, and I said I didn't want to become an engineer. Fast forward 6 years later, having obtained many certificates and my commercial pilots license, I decided to finish my mechanical engineering degree. This meant I have to pass calculus 2. I plan to put 20+ hours a week towards calculus two, with this supplemental class to give myself a steady foundation. I think Calculus 2 is a challenge that I will overcome, and having this class will help."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,649,"Why am I here? I am here because I want to improve my calculus 2 skills and I want to get better grades and the only way to do it is by actually coming to this class. I am here to help others, to share my knowledge and learn from others as well. I am here to solve problems. I am here because I want to do my best to graduate in four years. I am here to make new friends, and just enjoy the beauty of math. :) Roberto Ramirez."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,650,Alexa MaldonadoSCI 227 2/17/20Reflective Journal #1- Why am I here?I am in this course to earn a decent grade in Calc II. I need the extra support because I hardly remember anything from Calculus I  since I took it during the summer. Last semester I took a SCI course (SCI- PHYS 220) and being in the SCI class really did help me with my grade in the actual lecture. I hope I am able to earn a higher grade in the MATH 227 course with the help of this supplemental instruction course. I am here at SF State because I want to work towards earning my degree in Astrophysics and pursue a career in the STEM field. I want to be able to live my life stress from any financial obligations/barriers.
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,570,"Sydney Gonzalez-DeSantiagoFeb. 17, 2020Why am I here as in this class, in this college, in this part of California or in the broadest statement of all, why am I here on Earth? Honestly I can rant about any of the above choices that I mentioned but I think your question relates to either why am I taking this supplementary course or why I’m at this school. To be fair I’m taking this supplementary course because I suck at math, more specifically I suck at Calculus. I can do algebra and what not but when it comes to calculus it just gets really difficult. Plus the professor I have doesn’t really teach very well and his accent doesn’t help either. All he does is go over many examples without actually explaining all that well. So the reason I’m in this course is to help me pass the main course."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,440,I am here in order to advance in my calc 2 and understand what is happening. I rather ask for help than to figure it out myself. This class help me in math 227. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,651,The reason why I’m taking this tutoring course for Calculus 2 is because I felt as though my foundation for Calculus 1 may not be as strong as I need it do be. The last time I took a SCI course was about a year ago and it was for CSC220. I was able to pass the class with a high B. I believe that because I took a SCI course before and received a good grade it will happen again this year
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,652,"I am taking this class because I want to get the extra help and support while trying to learn new concepts in Calculus 2. I am a math major but I do struggle with trig stuff and other concepts which means that I have to work harder to keep up with my calc class. I thought that this class can really help me hone in my math skills. When Andrew came to my class to offer this class to everyone, I thought that this would be the perfect opportunity for me to get the extra help that I knew that I am going to need. My math professors have all told me that Calculus 2 is a lot harder than Calculus 1 so I want to make sure that I am not falling behind. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,653,"I am here because I wan to pass Calculus because if I don't then I am not going to be able to move further in my career. I need to pass math in order to get into other engineering corses. I'm also here because I want to understand calculus better. It's been a while since I've taken calc, but I am going to try my best. Im here because I still confuse on when to use derivatives and when to use antiderivatives. This is something I have struggled with. There are times where I switch them up and get the problem completely wrong. Also I want to learn more methods of doing the problem because I know there are multiple ways of doing a math problem. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,654,I am here because I want to take advantage of the extra support that is available for math 227. I took a year break between between calculus one and calculus two. Having heard form other students that calculus two is the hardest of the three calculus courses I feel more comfortable taking the course knowing that i can come to this class and practice the skills and concepts we learn in lecture. Also since my homework is due on Tuesdays I am able to clear up some confusion that I had over the weekend and can revise questions on my homework that I didn’t understand at first. Overall I am taking the sci course to give me the extra support I feel I needs to succeed in math 227.
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,439,"I am here because I want to do good in school and get a job in computer science. Part of my major requires me to finish math classes, and I wanted to get help with that because classes can be challenging and hard to understand sometimes, and it’s helpful to have assistance from classes like this in order to feel more confident about my math skills and learn more. Also, it’s nice to have classmates that are also in a similar position to me and also want to do good in math class because they help inspire me to keep going and trying harder. It used to be hard for me to ask for help because I would think that I’m supposed to figure out everything by myself, but taking classes like this one helps show me that, help can be a very wonderful thing, and can help me achieve things and grow with others. All in all, I’m here so that I can try my best in school and get through my major!"
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,445,I am here in this support class for Calculus 2 because I feel like I am struggling a little bit and I feel like I can do better if I just have more practice and more help from people who know how to do it. So far the extra support classes I have gone to have helped me understand what's being taught a little bit more. I want to be able to pass my Calculus 2 class and continue on to Calculus 3. These are classes that I need for my major and I do not want to retake them again. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,655,"For three years I have been struggling to find my way and my purpose in this school. I wanted to study space and it's mystery characteristics. Many obstacles came up that made me rethink my values. Obstacles that felt impossible took over my life and made me go off course. I felt discouraged when I couldn't pass my math class. I wanted to give up when I failed a second time. I thought everything was lost. But somehow I regain my courage and my cofidence, so I went to take math again with determination in passing it. So why am I here? I am here to support my new found determation so it can grow and finally overcome my obstcle. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,559,I am here in this class because I want to make sure I succeed and get a better than a passing grade. In the first two weeks I thought online calculus two would be easy to learn on my own. I was wrong when he made his video lectures he made them overly explained. Then when I would get to the homework I was lost and got discourage so I didn’t turn in the homework. But then I found out about this sci class and the first day I learned more than what he had taught. I am here because I know I can understand with a little extra help. Asking questions is the main way to succeed and practicing math problems makes you succeed.
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,446,"The reason I decided to join this is because I figured that it would be helpful throughout the semester because, even though I am a physics major, I kind of suck at math (lol.) I really believe that this class will help me improve my skills and maybe even help me understand the new concepts more concretely. I also want to make new connections with students and maybe form study groups with them so we can work collaboratively to aide each other as we are on the same college journey together. I also just thought it'd be fun to be in a smaller classroom setting where I can get some additional practice!"
