2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,445,"When life gets challenging, I like to try and relax and think things over like what are my possible outcomes out of doing something and the outcomes of doing something else. I also like to go work out at the gym or play basketball, both help me relieve stress and focus on myself. I don't really do anything else just working out to feel better or trying to relax and rethink stuff before actually doing it. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,655,"When life gets challenging, I honestly  want to give up but I know deep down I won’t allow myself to do that.

2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,570,"Sydney GonzalezMarch 9, 2020What do I do when life seems to get challenging? Well to be honest I kinda have two different routes I could take. One I could face the challenge head on and see what happens or two I could forget about the challenge a little more and live a little carefree of said challenge. It all just depends on my state of mindset of that specific challenge. If I were to face it head on then there are a couple of steps I would take action in. Whether the challenge deals with school or with my own personal life. Now if I ignore the challenge or difficulty. I would hid away in my bubble let it be the library where no one can reach me via phone call or txts, only in insta they can reach me or ft on my computer. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,650,"When I find life getting challenging, I tend to remind myself: why am I here (in college), who I am doing this for (me and my family), and what my future holds. I try my best to have a positive outlook on life and look at the bigger picture. If something seems challenging I try to think of it as something minor and that I will be facing bigger obstacles in the future. Another thing that I do when life gets challenging is refer to the people who look up to me and think about how I wouldn't want them to see me struggling or upset. I have a lot of younger cousins who look up to me and I want to set the right example of when life gets tough, to keep on going and don't give up."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,653,"For me when life gets challenging I sometimes want to give up and not complete what ever it is. There I are times where I actually completely give up on it and don’t complete it. There are also times when I think in the future and how if I complete it right is then I can also do anything later on. Also when I do want to give up on it I talk to friends and ask them for advice of what they think of the situation and what can be done to help me out. I also for last resort I like talking to my parents to see what they think about it. When I think about giving up this is my thought process. I’ve reached this far in life and not many people have the same luck that I’ve had, so I need to try to do my best and not give up, at least try. Also I think of the people that might be disappointed in me if I don’t keep trying to do my best. I try not to disappoint people but sometimes it is difficult. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,652,"Whenever I am faced with a dilemma regarding school, I like to try down what is exactly going on. I try to make a list of all the assignments that I have to do and try to prioritize which assignments needs to be done. I then try to make sure that I have a  solid hour or two to start this process so that I can at least get something done.  	In real life in general, whenever I feel my anxiety come up or if there are issues arising, I try to take a deep breath and try to focus on one thing so that I can get something done. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,440,What I do when life gets challenging is the question. It depends on the situation. Once common situation will be getting caught up in homework. What I do I tackle one homework at the time and then continue on the other homework’s. Another challenging thing will time management. This goes day by day just because everyday is a different day and different obstacles. I challenge everyday by doing all my task and once all my task are done I chill. Another way I challenge myself to do better is not to stress about the situation this is very important just because stress lead to more things. Stressing takes an effect on the way you live day by that day. I try not to stress in the long run. I rather take it slow because if I rush things this will lead to more problems. An example of a problem will be getting things wrong. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,649,"When life gets challenging I face it. I am the kind of person that loves taking challenges, risks, and fail to gain more experience. I also, look for help, advice, mentors and basically look what they did to learn and put it in practice. I believe that nothing is easy, but if I never try then I will never succeed. This is basic in life. Growing, becoming better, everything is possible with effort. Because it will require a lot of work to have good results. I always need to put myself first. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,648,"When I get introduced to something challenging, I first try to find the easiest way to solve the problem. If that doesn’t work I then see what do I have to change or do to over overcome the challenge. Calc 2 is a prime example of a challenge. I study about 12+ hours a week to allow me to understand what is being taught and to also prepare me for the midterm and final exam. I hope what I am doing is preparing me adequately. I this calc 2 is more of a mental challenge than a physical challenge, which uses sheer brain power and thinking abilities versus physical strength "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,651,"When life gets challenging I look to my family and friends because I know I have a strong support system that will always be there for me. Other ways I find to get through challenging times are to play video games, watch some Netflix of youtube. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,446,"I am going to be honest, when life gets challenging, I am not very good at composing myself and facing the situation head on. Initially, depending on the situation that I am confronted with, I cry or get upset. I usually beat myself up or let myself drown in emotions that are probably useless in the long run. Then, I try testing the waters with different solutions that could possibly help me overcome the problem, some aren't well planned out and frankly quite dumb. When a solution does not work, I resort to looking for help from other people that are probably better left out of my problems. By the time that I have digested the hardship in my life at the moment and come up with a fool proof solution, the obstacle has already dissolved itself with time or the situation/problem has become irrelevant. Oops. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,439,"When life gets challenging, I like to take a step back and address my thoughts. Often for me it’s easy to get overwhelmed with life, and it’s easy to ignore all of the issues that are bothering me, but when it gets too challenging, I like to just take a moment alone and just let my thoughts come to me and try to reason through my issues. Talking to a loved one helps me get my feet back on the ground if I am overwhelmed as well. Sometimes the right words from someone can help me realize something that I had not taken into account. Sometimes some self care is nice too, like some meditation or just some quiet time with a book or a movie, helps me remember who I am and that everything is okay. Reminding myself that I need to be patient and that everything will be alright also soothes all of the thoughts that circle around my head whenever life gets challenging. All in all, taking a step back and addressing my thoughts and doing some self care helps me when life gets challenging."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,646,"When faced with life’s challenges…                 Now, I’m all grown up. A mature, responsible middle-aged man with people dependent on me at work as well as the home front. How I’d like to deal with life’s challenges are far cry from what happens when reality sets in. One thing for certain, I no longer hide from them through alcohol and/or illegal narcotics.  I no longer have that ‘fuck it’ attitude that stems from being in a haze or under the influence.  It took me some really hard lessons to get to the point that I’m functioning at today. As with all lessons, some are soon forgotten (if registered at all), others returned to ‘memories edge’ when the timing calls for them and select few resonate, always there, waiting to be referenced. Hard knocks have taught me running, hiding or trying to point blame elsewhere isn’t the route.              Today, at worst when handling life’s difficulties, I procrastinate. That’s usually when there are a few issues on my plate. Putting things off usually means ‘handling issues in a certain order.’ Sometimes I may be wrong about the order of that flow, or what’s really significant. Yet, regardless, I eventually face the challenges offered. I’ve discovered, some of life’s greatest rewards are on the other side of fear.              Sometimes there just isn’t enough of me to go around. I not ever run intentionally. I’ve been forgetful or just deemed some challenges as menial or not worth the effort. For the most part, my solution is to take life challenges head on. Literally. I think about my alternatives, solutions and time frame. With my mental calculations, and sometimes a friend or two, I set out to change my challenges into life experiences. Doesn’t always work out according to my calculations. I don’t always succeed, but I never fail.    "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,559,To be honest I tend to give up when life gets challenging. Which is horrible. The reason why is I don’t talk to people about it I just bottle things up. I know I shouldn’t do that because people can motivate me to keep going. I just hate to be a bother and put my baggage on other people. As of right now I feel like I’m slowly overcoming my “giving up” stage. I been pushing myself to get help when classes get hard such as tutoring and the side classes. I know my friends and family are here and 
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,647,"There are some times in life where things do get challenging for sure. When I am in a case like this, I have to remain calm and not panic since doing so will reduce the chance for you to get through it and you want to get through it. I always have to remind myself that I will get through this when things are getting really tough out there. If things are starting to become too overwhelming for me, I could choose to take some time off and then come back later whenever things are ready. Sometimes, doing that just is not enough. I could also try talking this out about it to a trusted adult because I know that they are there to help you whenever you are in need. With the help of the trusted adults, you will get through this eventually. Challenges in life can happen anywhere and it could be anything as well, such as if you are working at a job or when you are at school struggling. It is always important remain calm whenever you are in critical situation and that way, you will be able to solve your problems quickly. In conclusion, what I would do when life gets challenging is that I could take some time off to be myself and do whatever I need to do and if that does not work, then I could go talk to a trusted adult or a counselor and they will help you on whatever problems I may have. We live in a world full of obstacles and challenges."
