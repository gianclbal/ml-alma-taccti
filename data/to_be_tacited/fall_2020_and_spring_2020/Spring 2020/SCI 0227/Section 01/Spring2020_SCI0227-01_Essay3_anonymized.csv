2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,445,"I think there were many values of my community and family that helped me navigate through college. For example, my middle school was more of a college preparatory where they wanted to teach us and get us more ready for high school and college. I was also in a summer program that had the same focus of trying to teach us more than normal schools. For my family, they didn’t really finish college so my brother and I are kind of the first ones that are going to finish college. My brother attends UC Merced and is about to graduate this semester while I’m on my second year so I also have my brother to guide me through college whenever I ask for help."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,646,"How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?        My greatest influence from my family has been, hands down (or rather ‘hands together’ for applause) is my significant other, Claudia. She has been my moral support, financial aid (she helps with my rent, so I don’t need two jobs.  Allowing me time needed for attending class and studying) and at times the audience I need to bounce ideas or my written essays off of. She does this because she realizes graduating is important to me, not because anything I’m studying is sure to benefit her in the long run.  So, in essence, I guess the greatest values that have contributed to my character, in regard to my navigating through college are perseverance, patience, empathy and support. I’ll be 50 years old  in a few short months. Let’s face it, expecting a career to change the course of my life at this juncture is a bit far-fetched. Yet, finishing what I started back in 1991, in hopes of making some career changes because of a CS diploma is paramount.  Everyday I struggle mentally and often doubt myself and my ability to keep up academically with all the younger generation of classmates. I’m working on that. But for now, I remind myself, graduation isn’t tomorrow, class is. Show up for that.  Stay committed and exercise patience, eventually, graduation will be tomorrow."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,647,"The value of the community and my family that helped me navigate through college is extremely valuable. The reason for that is because they gave me all the support that I needed whenever I am in trouble. I have to admit that being in college, especially the first day of being on the campus ground is an extremely scary adventure. I am a sophomore that has started to enroll here to SF State over a year ago and it is clearly obvious that I cannot make it on my own as I am still not familiar with most parts of the school. It is cleared that I need a lot of help and thankfully, the community has all the support they can give whenever I need help. As for my family, they asked me how I was doing whenever I got back home from the first day of class. They were worried about me and wondered if I like it or not. Yes, I do feel lonely sometimes knowing that I do not get to see my friends from my childhood anymore like perhaps from elementary, middle, and high school. It is sad to say that ever since we graduated high school, we went through our separate ways since the colleges they went to is in a different city than mine. Because of this, the college community is always there for me whenever I needed them, even if I didn’t get to see my friends again."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,559,"My family has supported me but just was scared that I was going to be far away from them. Although throughout college I’ve learned so much particularly from failing a class my first year. I was scared to inform my family but I didn’t want to hide it and fell guilty either. I eventually told them and they were understanding. They told me to not worry, I can make it up and the next semester. They told me to get help when I need it. Like for instance ask about tutoring opportunities and talk to my professors. Honestly has been such a big help in the last year. They are constantly motivating me to keep going and stop giving up when school or life gets hard. Because this will all pay off, only if I put 100% in everything I do. I’m so grateful for them never giving up on me. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,649,"Since I was a child, my family was always telling me to pursue higher education as all my uncles and aunts including my mom attended college after high school. So, it is really motivating for me to see this role models encouraged me to study more and more. In terms of community, I was always near people who were interested in continuing study. I believe that the social economic background I come from is mostly of people who did study, so it was easy to determine myself to study more and more. In terms of help, I tend to be very independent, so I do not really expect others to help me. On the other hands, I love helping others, I am always interested in becoming better by working very hard so that I can make my family proud. I believe that everyone is different and this is the way I work, but I enjoy seeing and studying role models."

2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,651,"Within the Latino, community family is very important. No matter what we will always have each other at the end of the day. I know that if I ever need them they'll be there for me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,439,"My family has always wanted me to go to college, and so they have encouraged me to do so which helped me go to school. I learned that I have to try to do my best, even if it’s hard or even if I make a mistake or fail, I should keep going and keep trying in school - which has really helped me, because before I would always be self critical but I realized that that just discourages me from trying harder in school. In these troubling times, my parents encourage me to keep going with school and trying my hardest in my classes, and this helps me navigate through college. My family has always encouraged me to be curious and try to find what’s interesting to me, and that helped me choose my major of computer science. I’ve also always admired my hard working classmates and strived to do better in school because of them. All in all, all of these people helped me navigate through college."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,570,"So coming from a Hispanic background, my parents have always pushed me to strive better than what they did during their adolescent and young adulthood life. Especially since my grandparents tried to provide a better life for their kids when coming to the states and then returning back to their homeland. My parents tried to provide me with possibilities that could better improve my overall educational career. Throughout my whole life they've tried their best to get me where I'm at, even though it's not where I wanted to be but I can make the best of college and still strive to get into a good med school. So in conclusion my parents have always been a good guide in navigating me towards college."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,648,"I think my family most affected how I navigate my way through college by their support. Having my Father, Mother and Sister as engineers, I find that I always have them to use as a resource, especially in Math. They also know the ins and outs of the engineering program. I am blessed to have them as my support team. I do also recognize my community around me, all eager to lend me a hand and help me understand whats happening in college, Academically and socially"
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,650,"Alexa MaldonadoSCI 2274/6/20""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""The values of my community has helped me navigate through college by reminding of where I came from and who am I doing this for: to make the Latinos in my community proud. Where I live, Salinas, Ca, it is mainly populated by Hispanic immigrants who didn't even attend or finish high school. Many of those adults bring their children here to have a better future filled with more opportunities. The values of my family has helped me navigate through college by staying humble and grounded. They are many students who leave for college and forget about their roots/family and tend to be someone they are not. Often times they portray themselves with a false identity. I always make sure to remain in contact with people from back home."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,652,"From my values of my family, it has helped me navigate through college because even though I may be going through tough times, I know that I will always have my family there to help me. I try to do things on my own because I am an adult now but lately due to the corona virus, it has been stressing times for everyone and I love the fact that I am with my family right now instead of being on my own in my dorm. I try to be there for my family and I know that they will be there for me whenever I need their help or guidance. I am also apart of the Guardian Scholars Program at school which they have definitely have helped me so much already during my first year on campus. They help me with whatever I need and they try their best to help accommodate me. They also send me some helpful resources for whatever I may need or advocate for me whenever I need extra assistance. Without the help from my family and GSP, I would have been a complete mess. lol"
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,654,Being that my father is a physician he believes in higher education and has been my main supporter throughout my academic career through the highs and lows and this has greatly motivated me to make my father proud and is the main reason why I apply myself as much as possible to school. Additionally being from a household of two immigrant parents I have learned to always value hard work in order to achieve my goals and get what i desire. Lastly my parents have also made humility a big part of my values which has allowed me to never become arrogant even if im doing well in school which allows me to succeed even more.  
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,446,"As long as I can remember, my parents have always placed education as a high priority for me. ""In life, people can take away your money, your job, your material successes; however, no one can take away your knowledge, and that, Milita, can set you free."" My mom's words have always echoed in my head and remained etched into my brain. Ever since I was a child they instilled the values of education, service, and compassion in me. I always knew that I wanted to pursue my higher education in a field that would enable me to help my community as well as contribute to the new age of discovery in the scientific realm. I figured that working in the medical field would be the most appropriate job for me. However, after working as a Certified Nurse Assistant for a year in a Nursing Facility and Acute Care Center, I realized that it was not what I wanted to do for a living. My mother encouraged me to be curious for a variety of topics in hopes that I would figure out what my passion truly was. In that junction of my life, I discovered the beauty of physics. My infatuation for this subject only escalated with time, up until my college application period. Currently, I am enrolled at San Francisco State in hopes of one day earning my Bachelors of Science in Physics with a minor in mathematics. :)"
