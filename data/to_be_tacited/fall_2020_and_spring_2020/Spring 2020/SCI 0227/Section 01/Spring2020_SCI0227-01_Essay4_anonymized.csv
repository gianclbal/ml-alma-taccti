2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,647,"Percentage growth on the geometric series. From my previous class, we used geometric series to determine the exponential growth of the the population percentage. That is how it is used in real life as the growth is growing exponentially, the more population there is, the more it will grow. We also calculated the error in that case to see how much the value is off by the nearest whole number in value which is the number."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,445,"The question that I came up with is “How can finding the area under a curve be applied to real life?”. Finding the area under a curve can be applied to be real life in many ways. For example, since I want to become a mechanical engineer after I graduate, engineers need to do a lot of calculations and graphing while doing their research. An example of how area under a curve can be used is when you’re pumping water in or out of a tank where you are pumping in water in a certain amount of time and within that certain amount of time you can see how much the tank has increased and you’re basically finding the area under a curve. This can be applied to real life where a person goes and fills up a fish tank with water and they want to calculate how fast water is pumping into the tank."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,446,"How can integrals help one understand physical concepts, and furthermore, help a person in their everyday life? In Calculus II students learned very basic engineering and physical applications of calculus. In one particular lesson, students covered how to calculate for work using a value of force and a distance ( sometimes even the angle of inclination can be used.) This can be useful to calculate how much work must be done for an object of a certain mass to move over a period. This can help people in the real world especially scientists and engineers who need to build big structures and need to calculate the amount of work needed to be done. This can help them choose appropriate equipment to move certain heavy objects. In addition, using this integral will help someone understand why it takes the same amount of work to do two trips to pick up groceries from the car as if it would take to carry all the groceries in one trip. This is impressive because on would think it takes more work carry everything in one go, but since it is only one trip the work is the same as a lighter load in two trips. Constantly, I find myself amazed at how calculus and physics are woven into the intricacies of our real life. I would love to continue exploring how the concepts I am learning in Calculus II are applied to me as well as society in general."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,654,Learning about integrals to me seems to be very important in the broader world. i can see this type of mathematics being used in fields of science such as chemistry and physics in order to find certain important values. This can be seen in the field of physics especially because it space is a major part of interest in the field and due to the infinite possibilities as well as immense size of the universe being able to use the concept of infinity mathematically and apply it to find the areas and distances in space is very important for a greater understanding of what is out there.
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,649,"Healthcare is one of the biggest issues in the United States. In college students, this can be a problematic because it is so expensive and most of them find it hard to afford. Also, there is a lack of guidance that provides enough information on how to access a good quality health program. It is necessary to make sure all students know about wellness centers available in every university as well as health program and counselors that can guide students with their necessities. This essay is looking forward to providing information about all the programs available, and the connection of healthcare and academic performance. According to the journal Inside Higher Ed, “As of twenty sixteen, 1, 680, 855 college students do not have health care. College students should have access to a healthcare program in which they can receive adequate decent medical attention for a low cost. This is very important because students need to know which programs are available for them so that they can be guaranteed with health stability. This will support students in their education journey by helping them with stress about college assignments, work, money, and the future. As a result of that stress, they develop several physical and mental illnesses. This is why it is very important that students can have access to a good health care coverage so that they can finish their college education without burnout or illness.              Each year, college students face a critical test that they probably do not hear about in any classroom: having the right health insurance to cover the costs of ailments and emergencies that may arise while they’re in school."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,650,"Referring back to my notes from my math 227 lecture, a concept that was covered in class in the past few weeks that might be applicable to people’s lives was infinite series. I saw this topic relatable to our everyday lives because it can be resemble to the stocks in/decreasing or even the population in/decreasing, perhaps business occupations (seeing the influx of customers or employees). This topic can also be used to the benefit of today's society by connecting it to the census or coronavirus. Obviously by the name itself, ""infinite"" series, one can make the inference that these calculations will continue on and so fourth. This can be used to determine how many people exist in this world today (census 2020). Relating it to the circumstances that we are currently in, it can be used to determine how many people worldwide have been infected, survived this pandemic as well as have passed away."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,655,"In my LABR class we discussed about the pandemic affecting people's jobs and when will everything go back to normal? We talked about how this is not an easy question to answer since this pandemic keeps escalating. People lost their jobs and now are looking for other ways for income. Jobs have paused but the bills keep pilling up, which is unfair in my opinion. We have the option to enroll in unemployment and receive money for the loss of their job. People can also apply to places that are open such as groceries store. Their is no solid answer when will all this calm down and get our life back, but their are help to support us. Only thing we can do is wait."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,570,"So my question might seem board and kinda something that a lot of students have felt, but it's a true thought and there is a reason as to why I must ask this question. Why do we have to learn calculus? Yes it is board but listen, or read, for a quick second. See this question relates as to the whole concept of how most concepts we learn in the class can be used in the real world without even knowing it. For starters, the definition I found as to why calculus is important is because it is the branch of mathematics that is used to study  any phenomena involving change. Change is a relative concept that can  involve any pair of dimensions, time, force, mass, length, temperature and so on. See the purpose of studying calculus is simply to introduce our minds to the scientific method of analysis. In class we have to assist and analyze how to set up and solve the problem through different methods that are taught such as exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, hyperbolic, inverse hyperbolic, geometric series and so on you get the point. See all these methods at the time do not seem useful besides having to complete them for the major or as prerequisite but the truth is, calculus is used more than we ever thought. Some examples that we see that calculus is a needed material are in the following but not limited to: science or STEM field, geography, computer engineering, photography, artificial intelligence, robots, computer games, movies, network visualization, etc.  We live in a time where calculus is made to gold, which currently is  responsible for billions of profit in many industries. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,440,I think the whole concept of calculus apply to engineer or stem major just because most of stem major are math heavy courses. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,648,"We can use sequences and series to calculate how a ball that is bouncing slowly looses its height as it goes towards to zero. this is one example of how the use of functions, integrals, series and sequences are used to numerically calculate to calculate exponential growth or decay. Another use could be to volume of an solid shape. These skill sets are important for other uses in chemistry, physics, and other scientific disciplines. As in turn these can have astronomical affects in saving peoples lives or creating our future."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,653,"One subject/topic that we have gone over this semester and can be useful in the real life world maybe WORK. Work can be used in both math and physics. Many people that are focusing on these areas can practice the use of work. Work is said to be a force acting through distance. To me work is how much energy/power is required to move something across a certain distance. This subject is not my strongest, but it was the first thing that came up to my mind. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,439,"How can the use of antiderivatives help us better understand Physics?For my question, I decided to use: “How can the use of antiderivatives help us better understand physics?” In this past semester, I felt everything come together with calculus and physics and I finally understood the direct applications of mathematics and that made me feel very excited. Since I have been taking physics in parallel with calculus 2, that also really helped me see the connection between calculus and physics, since we would use calculus to solve physics problems! To answer my question, the first and most interesting thing I learned was that the antiderivative of the acceleration equation as a function of time is the velocity, and the antiderivative of the velocity equation as a function of time is the position! This helped me solve many physics problems over the course of my classes. This information is applicable to physicist’s lives, and helps physicist’s solve problems, which can be used in many ways to benefit society. For example, physics furthers new technology development, and allows us to discover new scientific discoveries. Physics extends our knowledge about the way things work and the universe, and this is done with the help of calculus and antiderivatives. An example problem for physics with calculus could be: given an acceleration equation as a function of time: a(t) = 30t, find the acceleration, velocity, and position, at the time t = 5 seconds. So in order to do this problem, I would first take the antiderivative of the acceleration, giving me: 15t^2, which is the velocity equation with respect to time. Next, I would take the antiderivative of the velocity, in order to get the position equation with respect to time: 5t^3. Plugging in the time of 5 seconds into each equation would get me: p(5) = 625, v(5) = 375, and a(5) = 150."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,1,559,"A concept from the past few lectures that I had many questions on was integration by substitution. This lesson was very hard to understand. One of the questions I had was how do I know what to choose for u  and what is your du? Basically you choose which one is the easiest to integrate for your u. Then your du is the derivative of your u. Then it will be easier to solve after finding what the u and du values are. When you got your anti derivative you plug back your u value into your final equation and that’s for indefinite. If you have a definite equation you do the same for the first and then you have 2 options plug your bounds into your u equation to get new bounds or.. You can stick to the same values but you have to make sure you change your u value into your problem first then solve for the bounds. I looked up integration by substitution real life applications because I didn’t know of any. The answer I got was electrical engineering and they use this to “calculate the exact length of power cable needed to connect two substations, because they are miles away.” Which I thought was pretty cool they they used integration I had no idea."
