2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,661,"Online classes have heavily impacted my learning. I’m not a very motivated person so online classes have decrease my motivation even more. It has been very hard to even join a zoom class. Days go by and I forget I have a ton of homework, it’s been a stressful time. I have been working out everyday to keep myself sane and to relief stress. I have been engulfing in a lot of movies and video games but they just cut into my procrastination of doing homework assignments. I feel secure about my well-being I’m at home with my family and staying healthy and fit but I have only been having problems with my academics, hopefully I can pull through and pass all my classes. The class I’m most worried about is my programming class since I was already having trouble before online classes, so I’m just hoping I can understand to concepts and be able to pass the class."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,659,"Why am I here.. I am here to get wicked good at math and stuff. I want to get so good at math that it becomes an autopilot situation. I want to do this so that I can get intoxicated and still be able to get my work done. I know this isn’t very practical but it’s a skill I desire. I may also try and get a math minor, I heard its pretty easy when you take the CS coursework. I also wanted to take other concepts classes and the math concepts was my last choice. I would have much preferred to be in one for physics or data structure but my schedule overlapped with their times. Calculus comes pretty quickly to me especially compared to physics. Physics is mother fucking hard as shit. Why are there so many equations for us to memorize.. and the WebAssign is bullshit."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,320,"I don't have the best history with taking online courses, and struggled with online Calculus II last semester. Between not having the in-class/person experience, I wasn't able to follow the material well enough to understand and connect important ideas throughout the semester.  With planning on taking in-person Calculus II, I 'm having to get myself re-situated into a format that worked well for me to learn in the same way I do in a classroom while making sure I'm still learning the current material. With this, and struggling to keep a routine, I started setting a bedtime that I would try to follow as closely as I could. That, as well as making sure I'm actually eating and getting up to stretch and move around and staying hydrated, has helped me slowly set a routine that made me stress less and sleep more while feeling like I'm learning still.            "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,428,"Alexander Chen  4/8/20  SCI 0227  Reflective Journaling Essay #3                  Online classes have severely impacted to the college life that I have gotten used to. Some concerns that I have about my learning is how my professors are communicating with us and what assignments are going to change. Also, I have concerns about how we are going to do testing with classes being online. Once we started online classes, I feel like I started to struggle on staying on task with my classes. I have more time to myself without having to walk around campus, I can just turn on the computer and I am in class. I need to get of the habitat doing things last minute. I feel online classes made me less intensive with my classes and homework with the temptation of my computer in front of me. I am doing self-care by exercising and playing on my Nintendo switch."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,644,"I think the online classes have been detrimental to my learning. I really appreciated the one-on-one teaching that regular school provided. I feel myself forgetting some assignments to the last minute, some teachers are not doing well with the new format, and I feel like I am overall not learning as much. Right now, I'm wondering if I am going to get more out of shape than I already am so I have been running outside a bit. Besides that, I am not worried about my mental well being, which is pretty rock solid. I have been trying to set up more of a schedule, being more of a hardass with my family in saying what I can and cannot do, and just trying to limit my time with everything so I can properly do schoolwork and keep enjoying myself."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,656,"Online classes have been pretty good so far.  I have adjusted pretty well for most classes except for my physics lab.  Usually, I have an equation in mind, and I can clarify with my teammates to see if I’m correct.  However, now I use an equation and hope and pray that it is the right one.  For self-care, I walk my dogs twice a day and I make sure to relax at night by watching at least a couple of episodes of The Golden Girls a day.  My favorite Golden Girl is Dorothy, but I also like Sophia.  Anyway, some concerns that I have for learning are doing labs by myself and trying to do group work for my Gateway to Engineering class.  That class involves building a robot together and since we cannot gather, it’s difficult to get something out of that class.  Other than that, everything has been fine."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,657,"Online classes have affected my learning because I took a few online classes a long time ago and it was hard for me to focus while taking them. I felt when I was taking them I was prioritizing my in-class lectures more because I could ask a professor questions face to face and meet them in office hours, in person.  During the semester, before this happened, I was attending my chem professor’s office hours every day he offered them, but now I find it hard to ask him a question in his zoom office hours since we haven’t had an assignment until this week.  I attended an hour of his third office hour on zoom this Monday, and this was the first time going to his, in about three weeks.  This was a very weird situation to me because when school shut down all of the teachers were trying to help the students find some sort of order in the classrooms as they were, and I felt a little lost waiting for answers.  Luckily some sort of structure has been brought back to my classes and ways of learning but I am worried about how quizzes/tests will go for my chem lecture. "
