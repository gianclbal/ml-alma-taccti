Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,656,"I am here because I want to get a degree and have a well paying job. I want to be a computer engineer (though I haven’t officially switched my major yet) because I want to work with embedded systems but mostly in software. I am here to take advantage of the free resources on campus such as tutoring and the career center. I want to make the most out of my college experience and not have it all consist of classes - that’s not fun. As for this class, I’m here to get all the extra help I can get, especially in Calc 2. Otherwise, I’m just here to do my best and make the most of my time here in college. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,657,"I am taking ScI 227 because  I found out about taking sci classes during my second semester of freshman year during a biology course.  I realized by taking the sci class I was able to get more help on understanding the concepts outside of the classroom and office hours.  I hope that in taking this class I will be able to understand the material I may be too timid to ask about in the classroom.   I'm Somewhat confident in my skills in Mathematics currently, but I hope that by the end of the semester I will gain more confidence and not be afraid to ask questions and make errors.  The reason why I am taking Math 227 in general is because of completing the requirements for my major and hopefully one day in the future, be accepted into a medical school.  I hope to become of some profession in the medical field, but I’m not entirely sure of what I want to be yet, I have most interest in being a dermatologist. This is the last math class I will have to take to fulfill my degree requirements, but I hope to gain a better understanding of the material as it may help me at some point later in life."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,658,"I am here because I was referred to this class by an advisor at orientation that this class would help me better understand my calculus II class I am taking in the spring semester 2020. The advisors emphasized that they highly recommend we take this supplemental class if our schedules allow us to add it. The advisors encouraged us by letting us know that these classes have been proven to help students get a better grade in class. I stayed in this class because I notice a difference it has made in my confidence in my calculus homework, lectures, quizzes, and seminars. The extra time spent practicing, asking questions, in a more chill environment helps a lot. The class is also based on what we cover in lecture so it gives us extra time to process what we covered and develop our questions."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,659,"Why am I here.. I am here to get wicked good at math and stuff. I want to get so good at math that it becomes an autopilot situation. I want to do this so that I can get intoxicated and still be able to get my work done. I know this isn’t very practical but it’s a skill I desire. I may also try and get a math minor, I heard its pretty easy when you take the CS coursework. I also wanted to take other concepts classes and the math concepts was my last choice. I would have much preferred to be in one for physics or data structure but my schedule overlapped with their times. Calculus comes pretty quickly to me especially compared to physics. Physics is mother fucking hard as shit. Why are there so many equations for us to memorize.. and the WebAssign is bullshit."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,428,Alexander Chen  2/19/2020  SCI 227  Why am I here?                 I am here at San Francisco State University to receive an education and to major in Mechanical Engineering. I am here to become a successful person and learn to the best my ability as much as I can from SFSU. At SFSU I hope explore San Francisco during my downtime. The reason I chose to major in Mechanical Engineering is because I hear that engineers get quite a nice amount for their payroll and I also think that learning about the building process of the many mechanical devices we use in our daily lives is interesting. I am taking this SCI course to get more practice and a better understanding of Calculus 2. Calculus 2 is a required course to major in Mechanical Engineering and failing Calculus 2  will severely impact my college road map. In this class I hope to gain the hands-on lab skills for the physics laws and material. My understanding of calculus isn’t that good and I hope to understand calculus better and its use in application through this class.
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,660,"Hi my name is Landrew Wilford, I'm a STEM major or more specifically i’m a mechanical engineering major. I’ve taken a calculus course before in my sophomore year of High School and received a B, but in all honesty I have no idea how I got that grade. My knowledge on the subject of calculus other than the basics is kind of abysmal and my knowledge when it comes to electricity and magnetism is pretty bad. I’m willing to work hard for this grade and do whatever is necessary to do well. Though i'm not going to lie, i’ve been a little embarrassed to seek help in the past I know without extra help I most likely will not pass this class. So I'll do my best to come on time and be present for whatever activity you’ll have instore for the class and I'll bring my willingness to learn, a good attitude, and hopeful enough knowledge and understanding on a topic to help someone else who might need assistance. I'll also try my best to be more willing to participate and raise my hand more to help move the lesson along, but I will say I am kind of shy, so please be patient with me."
