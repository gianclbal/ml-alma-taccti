2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,657,"What I do when life gets challenging is either talk on the phone with family, or go out with friends to get food or walk around somewhere to try to remove myself from the situation at hand for a little bit and focus on something else.  I notice that when I step back from what is currently causing me trouble, and get back to it later I am able to complete the task more successfully and better understand what I am doing.  I tend to get stressed out easier than most of my friends/peers do, so I have had to come up with different methods to relieve my stress.  I’ve found that talking about things with others, rather than keeping my worries to myself helps relieve stress I have.  I also go running when I feel stressed out to clear my mind, and in a way relax.  I try to stay as positive as I can when life gets challenging, although it is very difficult to do so.  I make sure to remind myself that although my life might be challenging at the moment, as time goes by I will be able to overcome the challenges I face and be happier.          "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,428,"Alexander Chen  PHYS 222     Journal Entry #3     When life gets challenging for me, I like to destress myself before I get back to my struggles. Sometimes, I like to clean my room and get everything organized and tidy. This helps get the feeling that I am not messy, and I am organized. Even though I am not directly facing anything that is giving me trouble, I feel accomplished that I finished a task for the day. Another way I destress myself is by playing video games. I know this method is counterproductive, but it helps relieves me by having some fun instead of doing work. After I had my break, I come back to task that I was struggling with refreshed. When I know a big task is coming up, I try do things bit by bit, so I do not end up stressing over a big pile of work in a short period of time."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,659,"Why am I here.. I am here to get wicked good at math and stuff. I want to get so good at math that it becomes an autopilot situation. I want to do this so that I can get intoxicated and still be able to get my work done. I know this isn’t very practical but it’s a skill I desire. I may also try and get a math minor, I heard its pretty easy when you take the CS coursework. I also wanted to take other concepts classes and the math concepts was my last choice. I would have much preferred to be in one for physics or data structure but my schedule overlapped with their times. Calculus comes pretty quickly to me especially compared to physics. Physics is mother fucking hard as shit. Why are there so many equations for us to memorize.. and the WebAssign is bullshit."
