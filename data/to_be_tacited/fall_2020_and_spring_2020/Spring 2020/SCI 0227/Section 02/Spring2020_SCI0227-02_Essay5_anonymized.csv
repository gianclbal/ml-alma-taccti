2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,320,"I want to go into my major because as I grew up, I grew into a passion for the Earth, especially the ocean and delta. I grew up down the street from a Delta waterfront in the East Bay, and my Senior Project in high school was cleaning up and installing a garbage can in the parking lot of the waterfront. Throughout primary school, I figured I would go into college to major in Biology for Marine Biology. As I got into college, I lost the confidence I had that I would be able to do the work needed to get into such an impacted major successfully, so I decided to go to the next best thing after working with marine life; working with their environment and learning about it's function and history. As well, with the impending climate change, learning about the mechanics of the intertwined Earth systems involved in it, I have found a passion for wanting to work with an organization that focuses on anthropogenic impacts on environments, especially ocean, as well as the Earth's climate. As well, with the encouragement from all the professors and instructors I've had so far, I am hopeful that I can actually pursue a career of research in the field that I enjoy, despite it not being exactly what I had previously planned to go in for."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,661,"I want to do computer engineering simply because I love computers. I have wanted to become and engineer since I was in sixth grade. I however did not know I would be a computer engineer until senior year if high school. Throughout high school I grew to love and approached computers. Their hardware and software, building my own computer during my freshman year of high school. That’s the first time I thought about majoring in computer engineering. Multiple times I thought I could have done something else in engineering like aerospace or mechanical but I just loved computer hardware to much. I love the way a computer works and function at both in a hardware and software level. It’s fascinating to me how people have made a literal rock have an ability to think and function faster and more precise that a human being. When I graduate I want to work in a field where I work with hardware more but I wanted to have the knowledge to be able to program."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,428,"Alexander Chen5/6/2020SCI 227I honestly didn’t really know what to study in college and my parents suggested engineering to me. I hate doing communication and liberal arts, so I definitely wanted to do something that is in the STEM field. I thought that engineering would be interesting with applying math and physics to the real world. Another factor was that engineering is a somewhat stable career that paid fairly well. The reason why I did not want to do electrical or computer engineering because I know that they are going be more demanding. Mechanical engineering is also quite demanding with having the greatest required units for the major so I might turn to civil engineering. Now I am not entirely sure if i want to continue to pursue an engineering major with the major demanding so much commitment and being super difficult in general. I was never to great in math and physics in high school. Only time will time if I want to go into my major"
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,644,"I want to go to my major because I like thinking and solving problems, building stuff, and watching stuff solve other problems or do tasks. I loved it when I built legos to ""crush aliens"" or fly through space. I loved it when my dad remodeled the bathroom. The thing I like getting into the most is computers. So, when I was choosing a major, I saw computer programming as a good choice for a mix of my interests. And while I don't think I will be in this vein forever, I do think that I will grow in this vein and get a greater idea of what I want to do."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,657,"The reason why I chose a STEM related major is because I have been interested in the medical field since I was very young.  Thirty-four years ago, when my mother was 16, she was involved in a car accident and was paralyzed from the waist down.  Growing up I always found joy in helping my mother with whatever she needed, although I did not have to do very much for her because she is very strong and independent.  Going to her doctors appointments with her, and visiting her when she was in the hospital many times exposed me to the medical field at at a very young age.  Watching the nurses and doctors work made me interested in making my career focused around helping people.  I plan to attend medical school after receiving my bachelor in Biology, and become a dermatologist.  But a part of me is also interested in going into spinal research.  I hope when I become a doctor that I can help people to live long and healthy lives like the doctors that have helped my mother.  I believe that all of those involved in STEM are extremely important, great discoveries have been made by previous STEM majors. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,656,"I want to go into my major because I love math and science.  Other subjects such as English, history and art have not been interesting to me and I am not very good at business.  Usually, my math and science classes were some of my favorites along with choir in high school.  The same goes for college.  I enjoy my math and science classes and I also love singing in choir (at least I did last semester).  I enjoy doing labs and applying what I learned in lecture to something that is memorable, and it is good to know that knowledge can be applicable in “real life.”  I know that technology can and will go very far in the future and I want to be a part of its growth in the years to come.  I actually pay attention in my math, science, and engineering courses unlike my other classes – lately I have been doing other homework during my non math and science classes since classes have been moving online.  I have been completing a lot of my assignments on time because of this."
