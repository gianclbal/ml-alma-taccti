2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,661,"In the beginning of the year I was having trouble with integrals and derivatives, literally the basics of calculus. I would forget what was an integration or what a derivative was. I always felt like I needed to refresh on something I had done since high school. I would just keep practicing and doing the work. I have always had a problem with the basic stuff in most subjects in physics or in programming. But once the integration and the derivatives become as automatic as addition and subtraction. My question would be how would knowing how to do integration by parts help society as a whole. In a world were integration by parts or any sort of integration can be done in literal microseconds on a computer why does man still need to know how to do it. I like to believe it is because in the work filed as an engineer I would need to know these skills but honestly I think its because the education system is archaic. However, when it comes to calculus in college I need to know how to be able to pass my classes and be able to acquire my bachelors in computer engineering."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,644,"Why does the concept of series and thus infinite series exist? If we are talking about practical applications, what can these be used for?So while these concepts feel far fetched, the application has some relevancy in science today, like radioactive decay or the descent speed of a falling object. When using the series, you, make a summation of every data point in the graph, by making the number of points infinite, you can figure out points in which the graph's slope reaches zero or if the graph increases or decreases indefinitely. For example, if we put the rate of descent into an infinite series, we can determine when they will hit terminal velocity and at what time. we can also figure out how some practices, such as finances, can be sustainable or not. With series and the infinite series tests, we can figure out the math without plugging in all of the numbers to fill out a chart."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,657,"This week in lecture we have been going over Taylor Polynomials.  Taylor polynomials are explained by f as a function, such that the n-th derivative of f(x) is defined at x=a, then the n-th Taylor Polynomial for f with a center at a.  An example of this question is Finding the Taylor Polynomial P1-P4 for the function f(x)=cos6x when a=0.  In order to solve this equation we must first recognize our function and plug a into our x, this results in 1. Next we take the 1st,2nd, and 3rd derivative of this function, and plug the value of a into x.  The value of the first derivative was found to be 0, the second derivative was found to be -36, and the third derivative was found to be 0.  After determining the derivatives and values we will plug all of this into our equation P4(x)=1+f(x)/1!(x-a)+f(x)/2!(x-a)^2+f(x)/3!(x-a)^3. Thus P4-1-36x^2, in approximating this because the function is cos6x, and we are left with cos(0.06) the value of x can be approximated as 0.01.  I think this type of problem can benefit people in society by allowing people to calculate the value of an entire function at every point, if the values of the function and its derivative are known for a single point. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,428,"Alexander Chen  4/22/20  SCI 227  Reflection Essay #4                 Most of my classes are math and science based while having only one class of oral communication. In my oral communication class, it is relevant to my life because communication is used constantly and of course used to communicate with other people. In the class I learn some fundamental points on how to properly construct a speech and to properly execute the speech. For my math and science classes, I am taking chemistry, physics, calculus, and beginner classes for engineering.  These classes is not that relevant to society, my community, and everyday life. But later on, if I continue to pursue mechanical engineering, I can give back to society and my community. All these classes are part of the road map for the mechanical engineering major. The things I learn in chemistry is used to learn to basic principle of chemical safety and this relates to my major because I will need understand how batteries function when working with electricity.  The things that I learned in calculus can be used for applications like mortgages and interest. For my engineering classes, they would not be that useful as I am only learning the basics and introduction of engineering and learning how to use AutoCAD."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,656,"Well, I can only see Calculus 2 and physics being useful for a complicated subject such as science and engineering.  I have declared my major as computer engineering, so calculus and physics are big parts of what I am studying in order to become a computer engineer.  As an engineering major, I am required to take two years of physics and three years of calculus, so they are integral to my future career as an engineer.  Derivatives are very useful when calculating position, velocity, and acceleration and integrals are useful for calculating work.  Overall, my current classes, Calculus 2 and Physics 1, as well as Calculus 1 from the previous semester will be useful for me because these subjects are all essential to my choice of major.  As an engineer, it is important to understand calculus and physics because one has to make sure their calculations are correct before going forward with their project for their company or for their own leisure.  If they do not, they will risk things going wrong and the blame would be on them since they were careless in calculating.  This is why it is important to have a strong background in math and science in order to be an engineer."
2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,659,"Why am I here.. I am here to get wicked good at math and stuff. I want to get so good at math that it becomes an autopilot situation. I want to do this so that I can get intoxicated and still be able to get my work done. I know this isn’t very practical but it’s a skill I desire. I may also try and get a math minor, I heard its pretty easy when you take the CS coursework. I also wanted to take other concepts classes and the math concepts was my last choice. I would have much preferred to be in one for physics or data structure but my schedule overlapped with their times. Calculus comes pretty quickly to me especially compared to physics. Physics is mother fucking hard as shit. Why are there so many equations for us to memorize.. and the WebAssign is bullshit.I know this isn’t very practical but it’s a skill I desire.

2020,Spring,SCI 0227,SI,2,320,"I struggled with coming up with a question for this journal, but I landed in the area of answering the question of how Calculus II would be used in work in my field of interest? My major is in Earth Sciences, focusing on Ocean, Weather, and Climate and I have an interest in going into environmental/ecological work through Physical Oceanography. This has a lot of modeling of data calculated using Calculus already, but I can as well see the use of Calculus II in predictions of future models for past climate predictions, future climate and weather forecasts. In Oceanography, the main area I've seen Calculus used is in Chemical Oceanography, when looking at water makeup. My best guess would be in studying wave propagation, which makes me think El Nino/La Nina events hold a lot of work for researchers doing long term data analysis on ENSO occurrences. Beyond that, I am not completely sure as I've mostly taken weather classes, ironically. However, this information would not only inform the researchers of patterns of the topic being researched, but as well give insight to predictability for the future planet overall. This not only benefits the researchers in continuing to make new discoveries and prove/disprove inaccuracies, but also informs the public for decisions made in anything from legislation to how one goes about their personal life. "
