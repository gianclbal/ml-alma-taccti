2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,289,"Hector Flores Journal 2 	The question I looked at and wanted to know more about was “Which quantities are constant while a ball is falling?” The quantities that are constant while a ball is falling are acceleration and net force. The acceleration of the ball is constant because as the ball is falling, the acceleration keeps going rising at 10m/s until it hits the ground. The net force is the same as well because of the force acting on the ball as its in free fall. One time I was on a tall building and I had a ball in my hand that I wanted to let go and see what it would do. The next moment I let it go and wondered if it got faster going down the building or stayed the same in speed. It is important to understand the physics behind falling objects because you can determine how fast an object is going and how its weight can affect the net force. If there are two balls with one heavier than the other the smaller ball will go up farther can come down slower, but the bigger ball will go up lower and fall down faster because of its weight."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,283,"How can understanding the direction of forces help me understand what muscles are being activated during certain movements?When any force is present, it is traveling in a certain direction: it's vector. We know that the force has a certain quantitative value, that we measure in Newtons. When weightlifting, weights travel in a vector, or a particular direction. A force must back that weight. Applying at least the same number of newtons of force than the weight of the object is required to move the object upward. For example, a bench press of 100 kilograms will weigh 1000 Newtons. One must apply 1001 Newtons to that barbell in order to move it (wouldn't go to fast with 1N net force). The direction the force is applied will determine what muscles I use. If I need to adduct my arms while laying supine to apply force in an upward direction, I know that I am using my pectoralis major.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,291,"Honestly not a lot of concepts taught in class really stick with me throughout my daily life. The only ones that I think about on a daily basis are speed, acceleration, change in direction, and momentum. Everyday when I'm driving I like to think about the change in acceleration when I step on the brakes or when I step on the acceleration pedal. Sometimes when I'm watching sports I like to think about how fast the ball is traveling or how it will look when different forces collide with each other. And example would be like the time in highschool where I was watching the homecoming game. I watched as one of the opposing players running towards the finish line but all of a sudden a player on our team stopped in his way, and braced himself for impact. The result was the opposing player flying backwards. Seeing this made me think of why the opposing player flew backwards when our player was pretty much in a standstill stance. We ended up winning that game. Other times I like to think about what would happen if I accidentally hit someone walking across the street while I'm driving at 70mph. I like to think about the physical injuries that it would cause and the different types of injuries and what it would look like at different speeds. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,294,"In the previous classes, we discussed or investigated motion. In specific, we talked about straight-line or linear motion. I wonder how the human body can stay in a  linear motion and with a constant speed without being disrupted by any other unknown force. In class we looked over Newton's first law of motion. It states that an object that does not experience any net force will move in a straight line with a constant velocity. For example, the 100-meter race in the olympics is a race that only requires runners to run in a straight line for a certain distance. The mass of someone may play a factor in how fast they may be able to go. However, this is not a force that will disrupt their line of motion. This concept of linear motion applies my life because I am a kinesiology major. It is notable to understand the basic physics of running as I will be getting into personal training and or strength and conditioning. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,292,"What happens to kinetic energy during an elastic and inelastic collision?   In inelastic collisions much energy is lost during the collision. However, during elastic collisions much of the energy is conserved, often transferred over from one object to the other. For example, if a car was to collide into a solid brick wall, the car would likely come to a complete halt, resulting in no energy. How this translates over to real life is that if im going to crash don’t crash into a brick wall."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,287,"A question I have is what are some real world examples of elastic and I elastic collisions and also what’s is the significance of learning about these collisions. After looking at my class notes, An elastic collision is a collision that where there is no loss of kinetic energy and the momentum is conserved. An in elastic collision is a collision that part of the Kinetic energy in the collision is changed into some energy as a result of the collision. One example of an elastic collision is when you throw a blunt ball toward the ball and it bounces back. The ball bounces back and the momentum stays the same."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,288,"How is kinetic energy different from momentum?   In the class we explored how kinetic energy is different from momentum and by doing an experiment tried to visualize how they are similar and how they’re different. Kinetic energy is the measurement of the free movement of mass that can do work while momentum is quantitative measurement of mass – movement volume. Energy is the mass movement that can do work. It is the free movement of mass that can do the work. Also, an important difference is that momentum is a vector quantity - it has a direction in space, and momenta combine like forces do. Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity - it has no direction in space, and kinetic energies combine like ""regular numbers."" Also I found out that a system can have zero momentum but non-zero kinetic energy Momentums a vector quantity, and kinetic energy is a scalar quantity. ... The momentum of the system is conserved. But each now has kinetic energy, a non-zero amount."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,286,A question that I have regarding past lectures was something that was covered last week. I am having trouble understanding how to calculate the acceleration of an object. I know that it Is common for an object in motion to have an acceleration of about 10. I am unsure when this changes or when that even applies. Something I learned was the connection that velocity has with time but again I am also having trouble with these contents or terms. I know that acceleration at one point can be constant. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,290,"How is knowing how to convert factors in mass volume and density important? Well, there are many ways to measure these dimensions based on how large the sample is. These measurements are not always used in labs and hospitals. They are frequently used in everyday life by people perhaps not science oriented. The prime example is cooking. Maybe the recipe is for a much larger crowed than you will be serving. Knowing how to convert these large factors (amount of ingredients) will be very useful to cutting the recipe down to size. Now a days we are heavily reliant on technology to do the math for us, but it is not unlikely you may one day be in a situation where you do not have access to these conveniences and you need to know this information. It’s not incredibly hard to learn how to convert because it’s all based on the same syllables. If one can manage to memorized just a handful of syllables, they can make certain situation much easier and quickly deal with them even without aid of technology or internet.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,282,"How hard would it be to record and analyze an in elastic collision and capture all heat and sound created, as well as anything else created by the collision? And was there anything else created by the collision other than sound and heat? I’m sure people have done it before but there must be a million little variables to observe and tweak. One other question I’ve had for awhile is: is the universe random? I feel like it can’t be because of how I understand physics functioning, but I honestly have no idea. I feel that everything is predetermined and I don’t think there’s anyway in my mind it couldn’t be. But there’s got to be a smallest reaction that’s causing a domino like reaction. If we observed down to the smallest collision, could we see it? If everything collides the same way every time, could we predict the future? Or is it impossible to record data at that size? This is something I’ve always thought about, but maybe this class could teach me once and for all?"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,285,"I do not attend lecture so I will be commenting on a subject that my class went over in lab. Last week we talked about momentum and kinetic energy. We used that topic to talk about two different kinds of collisions. There was inelastic collisions which meant that the cart/objects would stick together after they collided. Then we also measured momentum and Kinetic Energy in elastic collisions. These collisions occurred when the two objects collided they would bounce off of each other, they had the rubber bands attached. I can use this in my real life because as a hobby I like to play pool. Relating elastic collisions to my real life would be like the pool table balls that bounce off each other to create a new game every time we play. "
