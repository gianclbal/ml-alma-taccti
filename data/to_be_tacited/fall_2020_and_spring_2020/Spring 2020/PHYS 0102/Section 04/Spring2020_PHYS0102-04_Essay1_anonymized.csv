2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,282,"Because I'm writing this much later than originally assigned, I'm gonna write about why I went to SFSU.I went to SFSU because I really wanted to live in SF. I was mainly looking at 2 colleges, Moorpark Community College, and SFSU. Moopark is the community college in my city, Thousand Oaks, and its a really nice community college, but I ended up choosing SFSU because it was that chance for me to finally live in SF. The best part is that I didn't need to find a place or live in the dorms, because my Grandma lives in SF. I got my own basement apartment, and it's pretty great. SFSU also had an Industrial Design program which I was interested iin, but now I'm working to get into the college of Engineering. I'm looking forward to getting to take classes for subject I'm interested in. This class was really interesting for me too because I really love physics."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,283,"Why are we here? To enjoy. To live. To experience. We are here to learn, become smarter, and reproduce. After reproduction, we teach our offsprings what we learned from our experience. It gives them the best chance of success, thus allowing them to enjoy life more. While we are here, we try to make the world the best place it can possibly be. That is because during the uncomfortable passing of time here in life, we wonder. We ponder the idea of existence after our death, as it is something mysterious that we often fear. Theorizing what happens afterwards, many hypothesize that we return to this planet again after death. Almost like rebirth of some sort. To make the world a better place, we give ourselves a better world to exist in a future life. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,284,"Im taking the physics lab because im also enrolled in the physics lecture on MWF. I'm also taking it because in high school i took pre-ap physics and i really enjoyed it but it was kind of difficult for me as well. I like learning and attempting new things, which is what physics is to me at least. Im also here to see if i enjoy being a stem major or if im just in my major because i think it will give me a lot of skills that i can use to go and get a well paying job. I hope to aquire some learning skills that i can use in my life and studies as i finish school at san francisco state university. Hopefully finishing the course will allow me to be more open in science courses and be excited to learn some new things. Im also here to meet new people in my major and build some bonds and studies groups so we can excel together."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,285,I am here today in class because I want to finish all my pre-requisites before taking all my higher ups. Also I am here because I didn’t take the lab when I took the lecture at my community college in Southern California.  Also because for labs you have to be here physically otherwise I wouldn’t get to go over the material. Another thing is that if I didn’t come tonight I would not have received my participation credit for today and gotten a lower grade in the class that could have been avoided. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,286,"Why am I here?When I think about why I'm here, I think about my goals. I aspire to get into Kinesiology as my major and this physics class is a prerequisite for it. When I think about it in a bigger picture, I think about why I'm at state and I'm ultimately at state to expand my knowledge and to be something bigger than I was when I first stepped foot in college. I aspire to fulfill the goals I have set for myself and being at state gives me direction towards my aspirations. I am very willing to sacrifice a lot of time to contribute to something bigger."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,287,"I am here to get a degree, network, and build skills for the outside world. I am here to meet friends who are in the same journey and to meet friends who will help me down the work. I am also here to build experience in the work force as well as building experience for my resume. I am also here to get away from my family ad community and figure out what I want to do in life and also figure out who I really am. I am also here to have fun in this beautiful city and make memories that I can tell my kids in the future. I am here so I can walk across at&t park and experience graduating there. This is why I am here and I look forward to meeting all these goals and It has been a blessing to be where I am now."

2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,289,"Hector Flores Why am I here? I am taking this course because it is a part of my requirement for kinesiology. Taking physics so far has taught me the importance of all the mechanics used in real world appliances. So far, I have taken chemistry and heard about physics but, I never thought I would take it until I saw it was a part of my requirements for graduating in my major. My physics lab has been difficult to participate in because I have not taken a physics class before and therefore, have no prior knowledge to any of the formulas used in the class. Although the physics class is not so bad to understand, the lab is difficult to do because we apply our knowledge from the class into the experiments we do in the lab. It’s also hard to keep up with my lab partners because they have prior knowledge of taking the course before but, I’ve committed to putting in the extra effort to understand more about the labs by reading the summaries and reviewing them after to see what I’ve learned."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,290,"I am not here for any particular reason. I just happened on existing. I don’t look for why I exist but what can I do with it. I will eventually create my own reason for existing. My reason will come from what I strive for through life. The thoughts that woke me up in the morning and put me to sleep at night. Right now in the moment, my reason is to thrive in society. I will establish myself so that I can live in harmony with the world around me with out worries of money, housing and loneliness. To live in harmony is to be at peace with what is out of my control and to contribute to the things that bring myself and other joy. My reason for existing is all my own creation and is subject to change, especially at such a young age. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,291,I am here because I need to fulfill a GE requirement. If I do not do this then I will not be in upper division standing which will then prevent me from entering into my major. I am here because it is one of my pre-major requirements. I have already worked way too hard and put in too much effort to be rejected.I am here also to learn and make observations that I usually never would outside of a controlled environment. I am here to explore a part of science that I have never experienced before. I am here so I can graduate and make my parents proud and never have to listen to them nag at me. This is really a philosophical question you're asking here. I am here because I choose to be the better person rather than staying at home and being a useless member of society. Ultimately I am here so I can have a better future. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,292,"Chris Carter Physics 102 2/20/20 Nguyen, Donald   Why Am I Here?  When thinking about why am I here, I don’t really have an answer. Between working full-time and school full-time, I haven’t had much time to think about life. I currently am just trying to get by and pass my classes and take care of my mental health. I don’t have much of a social life and, don’t get to go out much, and quite honestly haven’t made many friends since moving here a year ago. I do my best to try and do things that I enjoy to ease the stressors of every day life, but in reality, I don’t have much free time do so. So, why am I here? I don’t know. Not saying it in a depressed or sad way either. One day, I would like to have a family and a job that supports us all comfortably. Until then though, it just seems like its going to be a struggle and trying to find a balance between it all. I’ll continue to do my best to try and find sometime to enjoy myself in the mean time."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,293,"Why am I here...I am here because I am fascinated with the human body and how it functions and moves. The interconnected aspect of the body that moves as a unit is deeply fascinating to me. The only way to learn and understand this is to first get the underlying themes and concepts that revolve around movement... Physics. I am a person that gets most of his learning from a visual stand point. I like to hold and test ideas that we are learning in class in hopes to boost and fully grasp my understanding of the subject. Furthermore, conceptual physics has always been something I enjoyed because it helps frame a sense of grounding to rest upon when thinking about my place in the universe. To have this kind of basic understanding of physics helps me realize the importance of my life in this present moment, I am in a crucible of knowledge that I can soak in and construct a new found appreciation of the world I am in. That is why I am here.But also I am here cause its a pre req for Biomechanics"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,294,"I believe I am here to learn about the world around me. I feel that the world of science called to me a couple of years back. I actually hated science in high school, but later became intrigued as I got into college. I guess you could call that ""kinetic energy"" haha. I am happy about what I am doing, and the path that I am currently on. Although it is challenging, I know that it will help shape my mindset and help shape my individualism. I also believe that I am here to create new relationships with those who also have the same interests as me. "
