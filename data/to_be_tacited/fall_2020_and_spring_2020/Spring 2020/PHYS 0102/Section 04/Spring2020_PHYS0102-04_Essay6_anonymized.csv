2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,294,"The reason I want to go into my major is because I want to help people reach their goals in fitness and or be able to do the things they used to do before getting injured. I switched majors from sociology to kinesiology when I was in community college because I suffered from an injury and basically got no help. I was actually never really into science, and as I stumbled across a seminar talking about the human body, I immediately knew I wanted to study that. Also, I have always been into sports all of my life. I played soccer, baseball, basketball, and one year of football. I have friends who also joined this major and they were also an influence for me. There are plenty of things that a person can do with a kinesiology degree which is incredible.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,289,"Hector Flores Journal 6 I want to go into kinesiology as my major because I am very passionate about exercising and learning more about the human body. Before choosing this major I was very interested into civil engineering because I had a passion for technology. Since I was young, I have always been into video games and game design because of their animation. As I grew older, I got into building design and technology which made me choose civil engineering as my major freshman year of college. Sophomore year of college I realized I was not as passionate about civil engineering and therefore, I thought to myself what is another thing I can be passionate about? I came to the realization of me consistently working out and having fun doing it. Junior year of college I decide to change my major to kinesiology to become a physical therapist or nurse. I am very happy I made this decision because I know that I was not motivated as much to civil engineering as I am too kinesiology."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,292,"My major is kinesiology with an emphasis in social science I have a minor in business. The reason I decided to go into my major was because I enjoy health and fitness a lot. They are very important aspects in my life so I figured why not study them rather than study something I don't really care for like so many others I know. I jumped around majors at my community college. Went from business, communications, to animal science, ultimately landing in kinesiology. After school I am not entirely sure what I would like to do. I have moved on from the idea of becoming sports team doctor or a physical education teacher, just doesn't really appeal to me anymore. I guess I wouldn't mind working in corporate wellness. Who knows. I hear from practically everyone how they didn't end up using their degree at all and now they are doing something completely different from what they studied. So, we'll see what happens. I know whatever I do I'll excel in because I care too much to not do well. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,291,"I chose my major of Industrial Design because I really enjoy getting my hands dirty. I enjoy working with different parts and different machines, learning about how it works and what makes it work. My interest for computer hardware also stems from there. I think its what motivated me to build my computer. I used to play with Lego as a child and I could be stacking blocks for an entire day just letting my imagination out. I remember I once built a functional crossbow out of Lego and after that I just couldn't let this hobby of mine die. I decided to go into Industrial Design because it lets me explore my imagination and allows me to create things that might not even be worthwhile, but it sure is fun. I like to think of Industrial Design as Engineering but without the math, and for this very reason I decided to pursue it as a career."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,282,"See, I initially came to SFSU as an Industrial design student, and I realized that that's not for me. I recently submitted a request to change my major to the School of Engineering, and I really hope I get accepted. After I got to SF, I had my birthday and I got gifted a good amount of money, so I bought a 3D printer. It has been so much fun to use, and It helped me realize that I needed to change from Industrial Design to Mechanical Engineering. I've always been very interested in the inner workings of things and so I hope that I can pursue Mechanical Engineering as a career. I'm still somewhat interested in Industrial Design, but I looked into many of the jobs I would be trying to get, and they don't look nearly as fun as Engineering jobs. Too bad engineering is a lot more math! Wish me luck"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,290,"I wanted to go into kinesiology because I am passionate about the human body. Even before I switched majors I was always fascinated with the human body and wanted to learn more about how it functions. I always feel happiest when I am serving and helping others. With a kinesology degree, not only will I be educated in an area of genuine interest but I will have many career options in which I will be able to serve my community. I love how many different career paths you can take with a kinesiology degree. I have interest in being in a clinical setting like hospitals and other health clinics as a physicians assistant. I also have intrest in being more exercise health oriented such as a physical trainer or therapist. I will be able to better explore what makes me happy and what i am best at. With something like a nursing degree, my options would be more limited. There is so much to learn in kinesiology and I would like to be well versed in much of it so I can be a leader and a example of good health in my community as well as show other how to respect their bodies so that we can live long, healthy and and happy lives."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,293,"I want to go into my major because I have always wanted to help people. All of my hobbies revolve around the value of helping others, Acting, Boy Scouts, and Chiropractic have all been ways to help others and make people's lives a little bit better. Personally, I am choosing chiropractic because I love the concept of combining my physics loving side and the side of me that wants to help others. I have been asked why chiropractic over Physical Therapy and the reason why is because I love the more personable and community-based healing chiropractors do. It has been fascinating to me to see how chiropractors get to know each patient and see results while giving health tips to get better. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,286,"So in the middle of the semester I switched my major from kinesiology to biochemistry. I did this because I felt that I wanted to learn more about things in general other than just focusing on the movement and functions of the human body. Life and functions fascinates me so I chose to choose the major I felt that held those two things and really just elaborates on both. What I want to do in my major is find a branch of research to work in, as a sophomore standing, I have not found that yet but I know that I would want to work in a lab. I want to be able to use what I research on and share it with people who are not scientists and really just eliminate that knowledge gap because that is an issue that I really care about. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,288,"Why do I want to go into my major?            Choosing my major was not the easiest decision for me to make. I researched and researched until I finally found the major, I felt like most confident and comfortable with. I always liked designing and building and visual arts. I was also very good in math. That’s why I wanted to get into a major which is a combination of both with a good job market. I was stuck between architecture and industrial design. After researching and working as an intern in 3 companies (2 in industrial design and one in architecture) I realized I am more attracted to designing smaller pieces rather than big buildings. That’s how I chose my major. My family also helped me with research and gaining information about these majors. I feel like everyone should be careful about the job market of their major besides their interest and passion. I myself payed really close attention to the job opportunities open in my major and what I can start doing after graduation."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,283,"Teaching other's how to become physically fit is what brought me into my major. When I was growing up I played numerous sports and witnessed some of the coaching methods that were used on my teams. Some of them good, other's not so great. I was thrown into a weight room with minimal instruction on how to perform the exercises safely and efficiently. As I have become more educated in the field of Kinesiology, I realized that a lot of the mistakes I made in the weight room when I was younger have shaped the way my body is today. Having to work extensively to reverse some of the imbalances that were made, I have decided that I wanted to teach people how to exercise properly so that they don't have to make the same mistakes I did. Now I am a personal trainer and I have begun to do that. Studying Kinesiology has given me the knowledge to apply to my job, as well as my own weight training practice. I have chose this major because I want to give athletes the knowledge that they need to be successful at the beginning of their fitness journeys."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,287,This question took me about two years into my college terms to figure out but I have finally come to a conclusion. I want to be a kinesiology major so I can become a physicians assistant. I have done my researched and I have decided that this major was perfect for my career choice. I also loved sports ever since I was a kid and Kinesiology is all about being physically active and how the body moves so this major was the perfect match. I still have a year and a half to go and hopefully I will graduate and go into graduate school. I know that it'll be a lot of work but at the end of the day it is going to be with it and I will wake up every morning doing what I love and you can not put a price tag on that. I believe that kinesiology is the perfect major I am excited to take more classes.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,285,"There are several reasons that I went into Kinesiology for my major. I have always been interested in helping people, and I knew that in being a physical therapist I could help people get back to their daily living without chronic pain. Another reason I went into kinesiology is because I have always been interested in science, and typically science classes for me have been of interest. Even though I would usually receive better grades in English and history, I was always willing to spend more time studying science. I also knew that going into a stem major would reap a lot of benefits after I graduated. While my dream job would be to practice as a Physical Therapist in a sports setting, I know I can apply my Kinesiology degree into many other fields of health related careers. My family has always been an active family involved in multiple sports, so getting to learn about the body and the way it moves has always interested me. I am excited that I am finally in my upper divisions although, because even though my classes are requiring more study and prep time, I enjoy going over materials and it does not feel as much of a chore to me as was studying for English or a history elective."
