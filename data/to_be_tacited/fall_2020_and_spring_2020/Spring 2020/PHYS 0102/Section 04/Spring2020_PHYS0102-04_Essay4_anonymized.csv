2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,288,"Describe how online classes have impacted your learning and what you are doing for self-care. What concerns do you have for your learning and your well-being?”   Ida Lajevardi  04,22,20  Since my father got infected by the corona virus nearly a month ago, I had not choice but to leave San Francisco and go back to my country where he lives. I have been taking care of him ever since. This situation is being unbelievably strange and hard for me. I’m trying my best to stay positive and take care of my health, both physically and mentally. I try to stay focused and relaxed just to uplift his mood. I try my best to give him energy, make him laugh and give him hope. I believe our everyday life is greatly dependent on how we think and what we think of. For him now is the most effective thing to think positively and stay calm and hopeful.   I have been so away from school and busy taking care of the situation with my father that I’m now so behind. However, the teachers and instructors have been helpful and understanding. The fact that we as students have enough time to submit our work, is such a relief for me these days. I know that I can take my time with everything and sit behind my desk when I have the energy and mentality to work on my assignments."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,289,"Hector Flores Journal 4 The transition to online classes has affected my motivation by procrastinating on assignments and lectures because of the change of doing everything on a computer. When I had to wake up early for school almost every day, I had a routine that would help me become motivated to getting good grades and although I still have that drive for that objective, it’s harder for me to accomplish now because I have duties at home that prevent me from having a stable schedule to do my school work. To help me with this transition, I am exercising and enjoying the weather back home to relieve my stress of this pandemic and transitioning of school to online courses. Although we are ordered to stay at home, I like to motivate myself to go outside in my backyard and enjoy the fresh air because being inside all day can make me grumpy. The concerns I have for my learning are if I can get good grades in all my classes and retain the information I need to carry onto my other courses in the future. For my wellbeing, I am concerned about gaining unhealthy weight by not exercising and receiving more stress from things that I procrastinate from. Lately, I have adjusted to this new set up at home and I am continuing to progress towards my goal of getting good grades in all my courses."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,291,"Transitioning to online classes was actually pretty tough for me, which is weird because I already had a few online classes. It was actually quite a shock at first and it took some time to get to used to. Thinking back on it now, I actually really dislike having all the classes that I enjoyed go online, it just did not feel right. I definitely became even more lazy than I was before and couldn't really find the motivation to keep going. What keeps me going day by day is just me forcing myself to get out of bed at a reasonable time to do class work. Even though I hate it, I still try to drag myself through it. Regarding my mental health, it was also definitely quite a dramatic change. I'm not used to having so much free time on my hand. I used to work full time, go to school full time, and help out my student organization. I think having a bus schedule is what keeps me alive. Ever since the lock down, I've been just stuck at home, alone with my thoughts. I've been able to contact old friends again and play some video games with them. It makes me glad that event though all of society is on lock down, we still find a way to socialize and interact."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,290,"Online classes have disrupted my learning. If credit the disruption mostly to the required setting that I need to take these classes in. Sense I am stuck at home I am incredibly distracted. I also live with my boyfriend so we share this small studio apartment, so I can hear anything he is doing, including his online course. I also missed some assignments that I just completely forgot about which is totally out of character for me. It is a work in progress. I feel that I am adapting to working at home because I am more diligently working as the semester goes by. Separating myself from my phone and being hyper aware of due dates helps. For self care I am getting out of the house to exercise. I love to run, but during normal life demands I hardly have the time to do it effectively. Now that I can consistently make time to go out for a run, I am feeling better physically during the run and during normal daily activities. I have much more energy and am generating more powerful body movements. I have also started an extensive skin care routine so that by the end of shelter in place orders, I will be glowing. Hopefully that is something I can make routine even when normal life begins again."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,285,"Online classes have impacted my learning a lot this semester. I really do benefit from being in class and getting to ask the professor or instructor a lot of questions. I know that I could contact them over zoom or email, but it is not the same. Also, having online classes means that I am spending all day sitting down and staring at a computer. It is a lot more screen time than  I am used to. Online learning is also a lot different because I have moved back in with my family. At my family home, it is a lot easier to get distracted while trying to be present in class or even during homework. Also, I have always used coffee shops to get the majority of my studying done, so it is very hard for me to sit at home and study. As for Self-care, I am making sure that I am spending a little bit of time outside everyday, even though I have the privilege to where I do not need to leave for work or anything else pretty much. Also, reminding myself to find silver linings when I am stressed out helps me a lot. For example, I was not excited to move back home, but I am very lucky that I get to spend a lot of quality time with both of my parents."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,286,"To begin, I knew that from last semester when I took one online lecture that I didn't ever want to take an online course again by choice. When instruction switched to remote learning I had coming what I expected and it has been extremely difficult for me to get what I wanted from this semester. I feel that online learning does not create an ideal learning space for me to excel the way I need to in all my courses. I find it very difficult to keep up with multiple teachers style of remote learning. What I'm doing for self care is getting rest and staying in as much as possible to keep safe. I have been trying to establish a less strict routine to help me maneuver through these times. I like to read in addition to school work and listen to music, drink more water and just eat healthier. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,287,"The pandemic didn't feel like it was something to worry about until very recently. When the school finally made its announcement it was a shocking. I didn't know what to do at first and most of my family and friends didn't know either. These past few days I have been worried about school, my job, and my family. The most frightening part about the Pandemic is that no one knows for sure how long this is going to last and when will things go back to normal. It's been tough adjusting to online classes and being in a lockdown but hopefully things will get better soon. Also, Ever since the start of the pandemic I was monitoring my food and health very well. However, as the pandemic went on, I noticed that I began to eat more and more junk food and I did not care about my health as much as the start. I tried to do  my best at first but I began losing hope that the pandemic wouldn't end and there was no need to watch my health if I was going to be inside my home and no one was going to look at me."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,294,"The shift from regular in class sessions to online sessions was a drastic change. I always avoided taking online classes previously, because I was never good at keeping up with them. Ive taken two online classes before in the same semester and did absolutely terrible. I ended with withdrawing from these courses a my community college and told myself I would never take them again. So, this whole pandemic issue making in person classes unavailable was hard to process. I knew that it was going to be a huge challenge for me, but knew there was nothing that I could do. Other than the challenges online classes, I have been doing things in my free time to keep my body moving. I do home workouts to keep me on track with my training, I try to eat as best as I can by making home cooked foods, and I try to get as much rest as possible. I do not really have much concerns, other than knowing that my family is okay and staying healthy. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,292,"Physics is very interesting and it is involved in every day life. There is motion and energy in every person, place, and thing which means they all involve physics. In actions such as walking, driving a car or using a phone, physics is present. Online classes have definitely impacted my learning for the semester. I think I learn more when I am in a classroom. So, this has definitely been an adjustment. However, I am very grateful for the semester not being completely cancelled and also how hard all my teachers have worked to make this a smooth transition. For self care, I have been working out at home a lot and going on walks (away from everyone of course). I am lucky in the sense that I am still working. I work with animals, which veterinarian hospitals are considered an essential business. Being able to work still I think has been the best self care because I have been able to get out of the apartment every day and be occupied rather than being cooped up in my room all day. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,283,"Thus far, online classes have shown mixed results on my learning. Some teachers are doing exceptionally well with the transition to remote instructions. Others, however, are doing poorly. I think that teachers need to provide live online lectures to achieve effective learning. Although, some teachers have shown that posting recorded lectures to be effective. I think that the teacher is really the determining factor in a successful online class.For self care, I am spending a lot of time eating healthy, exercising, meditating, and practicing good hygiene. There is a lot more time to practice these things now that I don't have to transport myself to class. It has saved me plenty of time I am not particularly fond of looking at a computer for as long as I have been. But, I am making the best of it. I feel like my brain is zapped after looking at lectures online all day, on top of doing my normal schoolwork. Sometimes it is hard to fall asleep after spending that much time with technology. In-class instruction is preferred for that reason alone. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,282,"Online classes really ruined me. I'm not saying that's what really caused it, but because of the migration to online, it really made it difficult for me to stick to a schedule. I missed a ton of assignments before I finally got up and did them, and my grades suffered in some classes. Honestly this classes online transition was the smoothest, and the online labs have all the info I needed to succeed, and I could do it on my time. I do miss some of the other students in my class, but this class had the best online hands down.As far as self care, I have done very little. I let my sleep schedule die and so that ruined a bunch of other stuff, but now I'm getting back on track. I still wake up at 3 pm, but thats besides the point. I go to bed around 3 or 4 am so it really messes me up for the rest of the day. One thing that's helped a lot is that my Mom makes really good dinner every night at 7. I try my hardest to eat with my family every night so that's been nice. I still talk to all my friends from the outside every night when we play video games, and sometimes we drive by and talk for a bit. That's something that's really helped me :))"
