2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,285,"Depending on what parts of my gets challenging, I react differently. For example, if situations with people get difficult I usually will take a step back to look at the bigger picture before responding. This is because I feel like when I do not take time to think about my reaction to other people I tend to only consider my feelings in the scenario which is not fair, but I am always a work in progress. In the aspect of school work getting hard I do the complete opposite. When school gets more challenging for me, I like to spend a lot of time just dissecting all parts of the issue that are hard for me. For example, I tend to need a lot of time to work on my chemistry homework. This is because taking time away from it will not help me learn or be able to repeat the material. Getting to sit down and focus while taking the material slowly allows my mind to grasp the concepts at my own pace. "

2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,289,"Hector Flores Journal 3 When life gets challenging, I like to find solutions by rethinking what happened and how it went wrong. In the first journal I wrote, I talked about how difficult it was for me to keep up with my lab partners in the experiment because they had already taken physics before. Since this is a challenging subject for me, I came up with a solution to help me overcome my obstacle by reviewing my work and reading the summary’s of the lab to have an idea of what’s going on. Although life is challenging and there seems to be no other way to solve them, there always is a solution. I have had many challenging times where I thought there was no other way to overcome them but, as I kept pursuing a solution to pass the obstacle I found one at the end of my efforts. Although the solutions can be challenging themselves, it is worth the effort to do them because if you succeed, it feels like you are on the top of the world. However, every time you overcome an obstacle, there will always be a new one to arise. In my view, overcoming obstacles strengthens and establishes you to become a better person next time a problem similar to that comes around."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,287,"When life gets challenging I tend to lean towards my friends and family for support. They are the people who are the closest to me and they always have good advice to give me. I can talk to them when life is challenging because they are respectful, thoughtful, passionate, and sympathetic towards whatever I have to say. I know that whatever situation I am in, they will have my back and full support. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,294,"I typically ask my peers if they are going through the same things, or have been through it already. I do this to get ideas on how to solve the problems that are in my path. Other than that, I may distract myself by doing things that I enjoy doing in order to relax my mind. I understand that there are resources available to me on campus, however, I usually reach out to friends or family first and that has been the best way for me so far. Challenges are meant to be in our lives in order to make us stronger and they can weigh heavy on us. We just need to take them as they come to better ourselves.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,286,What i do when life gets challenging is very different for many situations. When it is something that I feel that I can control I often take a step back to observe what is challenging in that moment then I just allow myself to work on that challenge. That can include me making a plan on how I will overcome that challenge and find a motivation to have the will to overcome whatever is pulling me down. I feel that I often run into self induced challenges when I lose sight of my goal and motivation so I always try to recenter and refocus myself. If I am feeling like I'm overwhelmed and it is something that I can't control or that I may need help from someone. I usually turn to specific people in my life for specific challenges in my life to get advice. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,291,"When life gets challenging I usually have to step back and just breathe for a moment. Sometimes I just need to look at all the problems and situations from a different point of view. After I do this I decide what my game plan is and then from there I plan how I will operate. Most of the time this process can take a couple of days. Sometimes it even stresses me out to get through this process. Something else that I do when life gets challenging is just going to sleep. Sure it may sound unhealthy but usually when life gets challenging I am also very sleep deprived. After a good nap or a long night sleep I feel much better in the morning and then realize that my challenged are not that hard at all. I also tend to eat a lot when life gets challenging, this is also unhealthy but it just helps me. I also go for walks as a stress reliever. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,290,"When life gets challenging, I usually take time to reflect after I have stressed enough about a particular challenge. I find that identifying the source of the problem helps tackle it. I also know that once Ive been burnt out by stress, I will be incapable of solving an issue in that state of mind. Taking a rest and coming back with a fresh mind, perhaps after a night of sleep, is the most efficient way for me to get though challenging things. When I am being effected by things that are out of my control, I try to focus on the things that I can control. Even acknowledging simple things that I am in control of, like my wardrobe or friend group helps ease the mind. The most comforting fact that is true in majority of challenging situations is that it is all temporary. Knowing something is temporary will help me strive till the very end."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,282,"Historically, when life gets hard, I give up. It just usually works out for me. This last semester I had a calculus final coming up, and I didn't attend one class for all of this corona virus online time. The last day before the final, I just sat down and studied all the recorded zooms the professor had posted. Eventually I had been studying for hours, and I just gave up because it got too hard. In the end, I got an 82% of the final which wildly exceeded my expectations. I'm really surprised I got that grade, but pretty happy. That's what I mean though. Every time some class gets hard, I just give up and it works out. I had the same strat in high school, and it got me out of that. I hope to change my ideology soon though, it's just a very hard habit to break."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,292,"When life gets challenging, I do my best to stay positive. Its hard to stay positive all the time but it's important to remind oneself that no matter how bad things might be, believe it or not, they can always be worse. A few years back my family and I had a family emergency. One of my brothers was in a coma for 6 months and when he woke up, along with the physical appearance changes, there were also clear signs of brain damage. Today, he still suffers from minor setbacks, such as seizures and bone-structure correctional surgeries. He is not the same person I grew up with. At all. Sometimes it feels as if I am getting to know a stranger when he and I talk. However, with all this said he is still alive and I am beyond grateful for that. I often look at my brother when things get challenging and I see how he is doing his best to adapt to his new life. He keeps pushing forward, sure he has his moments when he is sad, but nonetheless he is trying. Seeing him do this is just a reminder that I could be going through something much more challenging. It can help me recenter myself, stay positive, and keep pushing forward. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,283,"When life gets challenging, I breath. I take a step back, perhaps sit on the floor with my legs crossed, and meditate. I observe my thoughts, and let them flow. Becoming aware of my current mind state allows me to overcome any challenge put forth. I know that any challenge is mental, it is from within. If I can manage my own body and mind, no problems can defeat me. All of which is much easier said than done, however, I strive to have the awareness of self that allows me to overcome these issues. At times I use cannabis to handle the issues, a much less viable or feasible option for overcoming challenges. It allows me to forget the issue temporarily. Although, this is not ideal. It is a secondary coping mechanism.Usually the gym or other exercise is the best outlet, during the daytime at least. Afterwards I am left with the prior option. The gym allows me to forget, and it is a healthy way to do so. I supplement the gym with a proper diet, which prepares me for life's challenges in a physical way.Together these strategies allow me to handle challenges in life. All challenges are within, and I manage them accordingly."
