2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,282,"I would say that most of my college experience has been on my own. I don't really let my parents get too controlling of how I live in SF, and now that I'm back at home, its a little disappointing being under their rule. My Mom helped me when I was first signing up for college, but since, they don't help too much. My Grandma helped me out sometimes too when she made dinner or showed me how to make some good food instead of top ramen and chips. I did get a lot of help from the various resources we have at SFSU so that was nice. I'm generally a pretty lost dude, and I don't always know whats going on, but they helped me cut a real straight path to the finish, so I have more guidance now."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,288,"How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""             The values of my community have helped me throughout college so much due to the support they gave me. I am not the first one in my family that goes to college so I have been pretty familiar with how things will work. My mother’s experience in graduation helped me a lot with getting to know the college life better and how to deal with new experiences in college. I feel like the effects of family and culture is huge on students who go to college. Both my parents also helped me with choosing my major. I knew what I wanted from the beginning, but I wasn’t sure what major should I chose since so many majors look alike but are actually different. They helped me research and motivated me to choose the major I feel more confident in. They also (unlike so many families) didn’t pressure me to pick a particular school or major. Choosing a college can be really stressful for teens and I believe all parents should try to be understanding instead of adding more stress by pressuring their child. My parents made the decision open for me but guided me through the process of making the right decision."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,286,"How the values of my family have helped me navigate through college is by always being hard working. I come two immigrant parents who are very hardworking, in fact a bit too hardworking which has really helped me see what I want in life and of course I chose college. My family values lie in being the best for those you love and that has definitely enough to get me out of bed to get through college. The values of my community when it comes to the people that I am surrounded with is always lending a helping hand and that also has helped me navigate through college in many ways like helping someone who needs it or not being afraid to ask for help when I need it too. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,294,"My community and family have always taught me to gain knowledge from others as well as myself. Also, to cherish any relationship made with peers and or mentors. I feel that cherishing or respecting relationships can go along way. Especially in college, it is great to build relationships with faculty, and staff around campus. These people can ultimately give different perspectives on how they pushed through college themselves. Whether it be mentally, for physically. Building relationships with classmates will also be beneficial, as you can relate to those around you who are going through the same things, and you can build on your strengths and weaknesses. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,285,"My family has a lot of values that I have used throughout college. My immediate and extended family is rather traditional in the values it believes. Nothing crazy conservative, but just a normal amount of values. One of the values that I grew up with was to be patient and to respect everybody. I know this helped me so far throughout college. I need to realize that everyone is different and will work differently. Everybody working differently needs to be accepted and given encouragement. Another value is to keep my home clean. I didn't realize this was a value that everyone had until I moved out. One of my roommates was consistently not tidy in the way she kept her room or herself or even the house. I saw firsthand that it affected her mental health and that it only added to her stress of college and living away from home. So, it always reminded me that having a clean home and room will bring less stress into my life."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,292,"Ive grown up very family oriented. They are everything to me and I remind myself everyday how lucky I am to have them in my life. Since a young age my parents have instilled the values of being hard work, honesty, and doing what makes you happy. No matter what I do, as long as I am happy I know they support me. My parents never went to college. They both came from lower class families, were married young, working multiple jobs to support their family. Having said that, the idea of college was never emphasized growing up, or was never something we were told we have to do. Out of the four of my siblings, myself and one other decided to go to college. It was our choice and of course my parents and family support us along the way. Because I was raised with the idea that if I apply myself and work hard, I can succeed in anything I want. So, when things get tough in school I just tend to keep my head down and continue to work hard. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,283,"My family has always valued college. My mother, who is a nurse, completed nursing school. With this being a form of higher education, she always pushed me to pursue school. My father also completed some level of college, attaining his associates degree. Since my father went to community college, I was encouraged to go to community college to save money. So far, I have not gone in debt with school because of this decision. The financial situation I have been in has been low stress because of this, and has allowed me to navigate through college pretty well.The community I've come from, in Santa Cruz, CA, has taught me a lot that has guided me through college. In this city I have learned the true value of health; in the mind, the body, and the soul. Growing up in this consciously progressive area has introduced me to eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and meditation. All of these are tools that help me succeed in school."

2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,290,"I think that the values of my family helped me navigate through college the most. All my elders (mom, aunts uncles, grandparents) all had children very young and that made it hard for them to strive for careers and education. So growing up I was always told to focus on myself. To focus on how I can make myself better and be successful. I was always interested in going to college so they always pushed me to do good in school. They taught me how to be tough. My family always emphasized how it is important to not be 'soft' because life presents many challenges and if I can overcome my challenges I will find myself not only successful but also happy. While I have been in college I have faced many challenges. Being financially independent from my mom and having to always work while going to school was hard but it has helped me become strong enough to bare heavy work loads. Also being the first in my family to go to college is tough because I did not have many people who I could look to for advise and wisdom regarding school, but being tough helped me have the guts to reach out for help from strangers and teachers. I think that the family I came from really helped me get out to a good start and I am excited to make them proud by accomplishing my dreams."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,291,"The main thing that keeps me going through college is knowing that I'm the first person in my family to attend a 4 year University. Because of that, I have the pressure of keeping my family proud and living up to their expectations. My family is not so fortunate and isn't as strong as other families, but that is what I like to keep in mind when times are tough in school. It also depends on the morals that I hold for myself. I know for a fact that I'm not the brightest or smartest student, but I always try to give it my best even though I can be extremely lazy most of the time. I also want to have a good life later on. I always have that dream in mind, of having a place to live and being able to sleep comfortably at night. I think having those thoughts in my head is what keeps me going."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0102,--,4,287,"I was never supposed to go to college. I am a first generation college student whose parents are immigrants with the hope of having a better life. Also people in my community back home don't make it out of the community, they usually drop out of school, work construction or other 9-5 jobs, or succumbed to the street ice and go to the jail.I guess this was one of the reasons why pushed me to go into higher education and pursue a degree. I wanted to help my family financially and also get out of my community even though it made me who I am. My family is also a big part in how I navigate through college. They supported me through this process and always give me a hand or advice. At the end of the day, I am grateful for what my community and family have done for me in the past and I would always remember that."
