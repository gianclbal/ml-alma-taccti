2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,489,"Online classes have impacted my learning mostly negatively, but not by too much. The positive I am taking away from these online classes is that my professors have been amazing when it comes to recording their lectures and posting them on iLearn so that way if I do get distracted during the live session I can always go back and review what I missed. The negative aspect of these online classes is due to the fact that I can get distracted frequently as it does not take much. I have fallen back on some work for certain classes where there are no live sessions and the teacher just posts videos and we can watch them on our own time. I do prefer that format as opposed to the live sessions since my internet is not the best to support the live streaming on Zoom, but then I usually continue to put off the recordings. Self-care wise being at home is more than enough and way better for my mental health and well-being. The only learning concerns are things that I have to fix myself and that's procrastination. I tried my best not to take any online classes for the rest of my Bachelor's for this very reason, but I am going to have to really buckle down for the rest of this semester and the Summer as well since it will also be online."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,486,"Online classes have really just made me cynical and unmotivated and I was already a little cynical and unmotivated. Its just been really hard for me to watch someone lecture on my phone or laptop for hours and expect me to retain any information or engage back with them. It's basically forced a whole generation of students to teach themselves and its really ineffective for teaching us for the workforce. In a more short term sense it makes me worried about my future classes and being prepared with the information that I should have for those classes, like I have to take physics 3 and linear algebra and I don't know if I'll be prepared with the information that they will expect me to have. Anyways for self care I got myself some rats because my girlfriend grace has adopted my hamster because of the covid situation and that's helped a lot because I like pets. Anyways I'm excited for life to return to some semblance of normalcy and be able to hang out with my loved ones like I used to be able to."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,492,"Online classes have made it harder for me to apply myself I'm finding, but I'm still trying my hardest to do what I can. It's definitely a lot more effort to make myself just tune in to all of my zoom lectures, when it's so much easier to skip them, especially if I find that they're in the way of the schedule I want to make for the day. For self care, I've just been trying to continue my day to day without all the going out. I've kept my work out schedule, and I've also continued my diet throughout all of this. I am kind of worried about learning and missing out on my lab courses. I was in a chemistry lab this semester (my favorite subject) and it sucks that I can't learn how to work with lab equipment hands on, or go through my labs physically, hands on, like I expected to be doing at the start of the semester. But overall, I'm not too worried about everything, just wish it was over. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,500,"Mary Nicole TangogPhys 232-09April 10, 2020                                                                                    Consciousness #5	As we continue to learn remotely, there’s definitely pros and cons to it. I live in East Bay and used to commute very early to make it to class and also back home to go to work. I must say, it’s a lot more comfortable learning from home, but this is also where I struggled the most. I am in a more comfortable space and attending class is not really the problem, but keeping up with the given assignments. There’s a lot more distraction while I try to learn at home, but at least I don't have to spend an hour to an hour and a half to go to SFSU and back home. I use this time to do homework and sleep. Due to the shelter in place order, I’ve been home, as the majority of us are, except for work. I work in an online pharmacy, which is considered essential, so I still have to be present. I try to be cautious of my surroundings and we are supplied with disinfecting cleaners to clean our tables and the things around us. I also wash my hands, apply hand sanitizer, and lotion as it can be drying when I frequently wash my hands. I’m concerned about how long we’ll be in quarantine and I heard that there are schools in California that have already announced that remote learning will continue until the end of this year. I’m also worried about what my classes and grades will be like. I just hope that everyone follows the rules and stays home. I’m worried that there are still many people going out who are infected or unknowingly infected. This is why it’s quite scary to go outside because you don’t really know who is infected and not. Stay safe!"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,476,The corona virus pandemic is possibly one of the worst things to happen to me. I have been struggling financially ontop with being back home where it is hard to focus. I try to stay away from any corona virus related news but it is pretty much impossible so it has also taken a big toll on my mental health. I hope this ends soon and things go back to normal.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,475,"Online classes have made some of my classes more difficult than normal. For two of my classes, we've already been preparing for remote learning for a while so it's business like usual for those classes. But for some, especially my physics course and lab, everything is totally different. It's hard to learn the lectures through zoom for many reasons. There are some students being obnoxious which interrupts the professor, the professor also doesn't look comfortable teaching through a computer, and now are labs aren't in person anymore. Which is unfortunate since I feel like lab is where the concepts from lecture are cemented. For self care I'm just trying to keep my family and I entertained because, slowly but surely, everyone's going crazy or depressed. My concerns for my learning is that this semester will hurt my gpa and we're forced to teach ourselves or try that much harder to learn the material."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,498,The online class have impacted me in a good and bad way. The good way is that I am doing everything from home and not going to class and saving money on my commute. The bad is its not the same as if we were in the classroom where it way easier to understand then to look at the laptop for 3 hours class after class. For my selfceare I tend to go on walks and do exercise to avoid taking naps.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,491,"I have to take personal responsibility in how I deal with online classes. I haven't done too well in most of the online classes I have taken in the past and that is why I now try hard to have all my classes in person. So far the semester has gotten harder for me. I am trying to stay on top of everything but a mixture of things have made it difficult. I didn't go out for walks or anything for over 2 weeks and ended up a bit depressed as I had been in the past. I realized it a bit late (I just didn't see it coming back) and since this Monday I have changed my focus to go out more and to not fall into the old ways. But with the tension of trying to understand the material through zoom lectures and now on the back foot in terms of gotten behind on my studies, I'm struggling a bit with this online only stuff. I really hope we can pull through this pandemic and be able to meet again in person on campus. I'm with my family and I just need to seek their support and change my behavior to get through this."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,488,online classes have it harder to learn because I tend to get distracted easily and not being in a class to keep me focused has made re-watch several lectures. It's also made knowing whats due a lot harder because It often feels like I don't have school so I just forget theres still things I have to get done.To cope with this habit I write down all things that are due during the start of the week. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,501,Since  i can't  ask my professor  in person questions  im having  trouble  catching  up  with  everything thing but i went to YouTube  and start  searching for  the thing  that i don't  know  but unfortunately  i might  have  to  go back  home  because  of covid-9  so i will have trouble  because  the time difference 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,483,"I think online classes have impacted a lot on my learning, I feel like after classes being online, I can't be disciplined very well anymore. I feel very lazy most of the time. Due to this situation, It all make sense for online classes. Our health always comes first. My concern is my future career. I am going to graduate next year and I haven't done any internship or I don't have any experience for my field. Well I got the chance of an interview for an internship, upcoming summer. And I succeeded all the interview process but now it is on hold. Which is very sad and this situation is out of control now. I am only hoping for the best that everything will turn up to normal again. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,484,"I will not lie but having all my classes online kind of sucks and it makes me feel more lazy. I can usually handle 1 to 2 online classes but 5 classes online are too hectic. I’m scared that I won’t be on top of my homework and what not if this pandemic continues until fall semester. I’m really concerned that I won’t be as focused and I’m scared that I might fail a class. As far as for self-care, I’m trying out new hobbies and right now is baking. Despite the fact that I’m unable to go outside I think I’ve realized that there are more things I can do while I’m at home and it makes me think outside the box and try out new things. I am concerned that I will start to feel inpatient and lonely because of the lack of socializing."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,480,"Online classes have many kinds of impacts on my life. First of all, I need to motivate myself to attend classes. This is not hard because I already took calculus two online last semester. So compared to others, I smoothly move to online courses from courses in person. The most challenging thing online classes is I don`t have a discussion with other students about the concepts which I don`t understand. This might make some subjects harder. The most advantage which I get is I don`t hurry up to show up class. I have classes from 8 am to 5 pm on Tuesday and Thursday. When I take the course in person, I need to run to show up the classes. I had only 15 minutes interval between each class. However, online classes make my life easier in terms of time. In the current situation, people tend to stay at their house most time.The hardest part for people is how to blow off some steams at this time. I frequently run around my house to refresh myself(of course, my house is the place where people can keep social distances). This saves my life. Keeping good mental health is important as same as caring for physical health. Exercise saves my life. My concern is what will happen to people if they don`t communicate with each other in reality. I am curious about this. Do communications online have the same impact as communications in person? We are social animals, so we require interaction with others. If online connections like chat or video calling work as well as our original commutation, the structure of society will change, our current situation seems horrible now. Still, When we look back to this situation someday, the case might be a game-changer for a better society because people might notice something important rather than the economy. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,487,"The online classes are easily fitted in my daily schedule right now, but it makes it harder for me to learn because I'm able to learn more in person to person classes. Right now, I'm washing my hands more often than I use to before the virus outbreak, and reducing unnecessary outdoor activity is another self-care that I'm doing right now. So far, I do not have any concerns about my learning and well-being. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,496,"I am having a really hard time with online classes. I don't retain the information as well, and it's been hard for me to find the motivation to do things purely online. I'm concerned that I'm going to fail this semester, and it will greatly impact my GPA. I'm worried about retaking this whole semester once we can go back to campus.As for my well-being, I've been trying to go outside when the weather allows. I would walk Koda, or do some exercise outside. I'm trying to allocate my time wisely, but it's hard not to spiral down into depression."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,481,"Online classes have affected my ability to connect with what is going on I think. I have noticed a change in my notes and note taking, I seem to just be writing down equations now and not explaining like I used to. I am worried that I am not going to be understanding the root of the physics concepts behind the problems and equations. Instead, taking the approach of just memorizing the equations, and while this may work for my classes now. I worry that in the coming semester of physics or even more so in grad school physics this will become a problem because I will lack the fundamental understanding of the basic concepts for which all these other higher level ideas are built upon. My self care has not changed much, I am trying to eat just as healthy as I was at school though being home makes that more challenging especially where I am at, my mother wants to feed me junk food to make me happy I guess and most of my family is not very fit so health is not on a lot of peoples priorities so its hard to stay motivated. But I have done a good job of eating clean meals, just need to cut out some snacks, but I figured I am young I can afford to eat snacks and live a little and still maintain a high level of fitness. I still workout everyday, though my routine has changed because I do not have a gym I am making do with what I have. The only problem is my cardio as I have not ran in a couple weeks but its okay. I have also started doing yoga more frequently than i was during the school year."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,494,"I have taken many online classes before, in community college, so I'm really used to it and like it that way for myself. Although many teachers seem to be having a really hard time and that makes it hard for the students or at least I see it that way. I understand that if we were to take a midterm we might be time or so but if they are asking for scanned pdf files, problems written in pen, they should at least give us more time than just the class time to have everything looking neat, but it is what it is. We all just have to meet each other half way and make the best of it. I have been taking care of myself by not going anywhere except for grocery shopping or my job, that way I can minimize exposure to the virus for myself and my family. The concern I have about online learning is that I really hope we, as students, can  really learn as much from online classes as if we were in the physical class room. For example what if we miss a concept or topic about a subject that down the road we could have benefited from its knowledge to land a job or internship somewhere."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,485,"I've noticed that it's harder to pay attention to online classes. I feel like they're not as engaging and lose importance. Some professors are better at online teaching than others. For example, one of my professors uses an iPad for the Zoom meetings and he can write on top of pdf handouts that we all download, so we can go through the material at the same pace. That's very useful and more engaging. However, I have another professor who tries to write on a tiny whiteboard she holds up next to her head and write on it while she is explaining and it doesn't work very well. The other day she didn't even have the whiteboard, she tried to write on a notebook with a marker and it was terrible. Othes just use power point slides, which is ok.For self-care, I go outside to the backyard and work out now and then. I no longer go to grocery stores because of the lines. Costco had a huge 1hr+ line, and Trader Joe's line wrapped around the store. Now I just order groceries online and order pick up from restaurants. Honestly, I'm usually at home, so the change is not too drastic aside from obtaining food and online learning making things more difficult."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,493,"I think that online classes have made it harder for me to understand the lectures. I think that I don't take online classes because I feel like I can not keep up with them, I feel like all my life I was used to in class lectures, therefore going from that to online in days is a lot. I have taken online classes don't get me wrong but it has been classes that I know I will be able to manage. I have never taken math or physics nor engineering classes online. With online classes I feel like there is a lot but at the same time there is not, I feel like I miss something all the time no matter if I keep a planner. Somehow I just forget about one class. I am trying to work out more and we have family game night some times, I feel like that helps. Like I said before some of my concerns are that I am not able to really focus on my classes because of a lot of distractions, also missing things, assignments. I am trying to get more organized so it will be something I have to work more on. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,499,"I feel that at home online classes, all students are faced with fair teaching videos, fair homework, no so-called ""disturbed"", no so-called ""unclear blackboard"", etc., which is more like self-discipline. Self-discipline is getting better and better, self-discipline is fake, and the teaching content is gradually becoming a book of heaven. After the outbreak, the net class ended, the school gathered together, and the verdict was sentenced. It was really hard work and reward.So I think we should discipline ourselves during this time. For the protection of the epidemic, I have made adequate preparations, hoarded food for one month at home, and reduced the number of trips. I believe we can survive this disaster."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,495,"As we all know online education learning has its own advantages and disadvantages, the main advantages of online classes are given below which play an important role in our learning and seeking knowledge; You can learn very easily and very effectively without any problems and efforts whatever you want.Online eLearning provide comfort to the students. All necessary lectures and needed course materials are easily accessible through online portals of universities, so we will easily have found them from the comfort of your home.  Through online eLearning the student was made self-paced learner.The important and big advantage of online classes is that it cost nothing as compared to other education system.  These online courses provide totally best worth to the student in term of well education, accessible to world’s best tutors, self-paced learning, comfortness to the students.  Doing for self-care;During the pandemic period.

2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,219,"I have taken online classes before, but this semester has truly been a different experience so far. This semester, most of my classes were geared towards focusing on in-class learning such as laboratory classes and science/engineering classes that were aimed at solving problems in class and having one-on-one advice from the instructor. For one of my classes on microcontrollers, a lot of the in-class learning was using a physical microcontroller kit and constructing devices out of them while using the computers at school to create the code needed for the microcontroller to function. I have a greater appreciation for labs now, where a lot of the learning was experienced through hands-on tasks and problems were solved through problem solving and experimentation. I miss getting technical with laboratory equipment. I also realized how being in class with other students and working with and alongside them have a significant impact on learning. I feel like as social creatures, eventually we thrive and have purpose when we are creating experiences with others. I now realize how important it is to go through an educational program with motivating peers who also want to succeed and are not just at school for the degree because who you hang out with, even in an educational setting, ultimately plays a factor in how a person develops into the person they want to be. With all this being taken away by changing all in-person classes to being virtual, you learn to fend for yourself more and to focus more on you.For me, self-care starts with coming back to realizing who I am without external influences. One way is through meditation but another, more practical method is through reflection. Without having to spend time commuting to school, walking across campus to class, or being distracted by socializing in the library, there is a certain space that opens up where you have a bit more time to focus on the self and evaluating if your actions thus far align with who you strive to be in life. All those things that take up not only time, but also energy, become less existent and more energy can be focused on completing tasks in the near future but also planning out long-term goals and plans. From that, I find my solace."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,497,"Online classes have impacted my learning. Sometimes my internet isn’t working, other time it’s my professors internet. I’ve also had zoom meetings that have gotten hacked and it’s just wasted our time in trying to learn and get our questions in. My physics teacher has also made the course a lot more tougher because of moving online. I am concerned the online physics will be to rigorous for me because my teacher has only made the class more difficult and demanding than it already was. To self care I am basically just staying inside and keeping in touch with my class peers. Also I am keeping in touch with my professors as much as possible to try and be always on the same page."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,490,"Ever since we have been quarantined, it really has gotten some getting use to. Things started off really rough because of the way I had to learn new topics. I am so used to learning in class and having that learning experience that this whole thing through me off. Even now it is taking some getting use to. As far as self care, I try to do some light workouts. It is different because I am use to getting a haircut every two weeks and now my hair is really long. I am having concerns with two of my classes because when this happened it through everything off. I am really struggling with one of my classes. I tried to drop it but I am having trouble contacting the correct department. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,479,"Zoom lectures, in my opinion, are not very good as almost half the class goes towards figuring out the tech stuff. Learning this way is very hard. Certain professors post video lectures and hold zoom sessions for people who have questions, which is the best way to go about this but not everyone agrees. For self-care I have mainly been working out and playing video games to keep myself entertained. My main concern is teachers not replying to emails. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,477,"For the first couple of weeks, it was hard to get used to working in my room since I can only really concentrate once everyone in my house was asleep. I also have become accustomed to sleeping at around 3-4 AM and waking up at 1 PM, so I'm not really sure if that's helping me out much. Since I usually like to stay home anyway, quarantining hasn't taken much of a toll on me, however I do take my dog on walks and I think that can count as self-care. My major concern is falling behind on work because I'm so used to doing all of my work at school and relaxing at home, so doing my work in my room feels really weird, especially since I associate my desk with entertainment like gaming and watching shows. I am getting a bit more used to it though, so I think everything will feel more normal soon."
