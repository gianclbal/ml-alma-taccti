Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,475,"I’m here as a prerequisite for my major. I took this course last semester but failed due to outside issues and not dedicating enough time to actually learn the material. So I am determined to finish this lab and class the right way this time. The things I’ll do this time around to make sure that happens is freeing up my time to study and try to find more of an interest in the material, rather than just seeing this as another class I have busy work for."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,476,"Why am I here? Well I have many reasons that explain why I am here but let me just explains the reasons that are the most significant. Well to start, I am majoring in computer engineering so this is one of many classes that are on my roadmap so I can keep advancing into other computer engineering classes. Secondly, I think it is very important to know the science behind magnetism and electricity especially if I am studying a topic that relies on electricity. The reason why I want to become a computer engineer is so I can program games to make kids happy and to make my parents and myself financially stable."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,477,"I’m here because I enjoy science and i want to learn as much as I can about as many subjects as possible. I enjoy learning about how our world works because it allows me to come up with ideas as to how we can make it better. Also, if I’m going to be a good game developer, I want to know how my physics engine works."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,478,"Me being here is actually quite a surprise to me. Growing up I never thought I would go to college or let alone be alive at 20 years old. I was always getting bad grades, kicked out of schools, and doing things that I shouldn't have been doing. So to actually be here in Physics 2 studying for a civil engineer is huge accomplishment for me. I am very thankful for where I'm at today and very thankful for the lessons God has taught me. I look forward to a great semester. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,479,"I took this class because it is a requirement for my major but after the first couple of lectures I found the class material interesting. iI am here because I find physics very interesting as it affects us on a daily basis and is the reason why we have things that make our lives easier, such as phones, the internet, cars, etc. I am here because I enjoy learning about things that affect humanity on a daily basis and are always at work. In addition, there is so much to research and learn with physics that there is no limit to learning. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,480,"Why am I here? It is a bit difficult question to answer. People might say it is prerequisite to situs their major, and so on. Personally, the reason why I am here is that I decided to study physics to do research and business. You might think physic is not relevant to research and business but they are connected. When I was child, I read a biography of Galileo Galilei. His life inspired me to become scientist because even if he was being excused and became blind, he never gave up his passion. I was impressed by this story. This is one of the reasons why I pursue becoming scientist and studying physics in this class."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,481,"I am here mostly to get my lower division requirements over with. I’m a freshman and i have 230/232 and 240/242, i figured it’d be better to try and finish all of these types of courses first so that i could go into things that were a little more exiting like intro to quantum or theoretical. i want to take this class now because i’m trying to graduate in three years but since i added minor in math and astronomy idk if that will happen. i’m thinking i’ll have to take some summer/ online courses but that wouldn’t be so bad. could even end up just maxing out in units for the next two years. since i already have the credits of a junior i’ll graduate as a super senior or sadly. i also want to graduate early to save money speaking of which i just remembered i have a lot of scholarships i need to apply for."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,482,I am here because this course is going to take me a step further to getting my degree. I enjoy learning new things and pushing myself academically and I know this course will help with that. I am here to learn as much as I can so my future self can be the best at whatever it is I end up doing. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,483,"I am here because my major is Computer Science, therefore I am taking this course in order fulfill the requirement. Besides, I am confident that this course will gain my knowledge."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,484,"Hi Bryce!My name is Mariella and the reason that I’m here is because one it’s a required requirement for Physical Chemistry, my major is Chemistry, and two I enjoy the concept of Physics but I do find it very hard to take in. It’s been one year since I last took the first semester of physics calculus base and not gonna lie I’ve forgotten a chunk of the course but usually the lab classes helps me understand the subject a little bit better and I do tend to ask a lot more questions during labs because I know the instructors are there to help me understand the topics. I look forward to this semester!"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,485,"The reason why I’m currently here at this school consists of different reasons. I first wanted to be an electrical engineer so I could work on the field of renewable energy. I was adamant about trying to make the planet’s resources more efficient and make them last longer. I knew that California had good schools for that, and also, because of my G.I. Bill, I actually get paid very well while I attend school in this city. I’ve now switched over to computer science and am intrigued by everything from Artificial Intelligence to Web Development."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,486,So there are a few different ways it seems we could’ve gone with this question but i’ll go with the why am I here in context to this school. I’ve been wanting to be an engineer for basically as long as I can remember so it’s no surprise that I’m in a college... But as far as san francisco state that’s a whole different beast. I wanted to go down south to maybe Cal Poly SLO but as it turned out my measles 3.6 gpa was no match for college acceptance standards so I was rejected from most of the schools I had my eyes on. As it came down to the wire I accepted San Francisco state and figured I could just transfer if I was unhappy. But as it turned out it was one of the best things to happen to me.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,487,"I'm here because I have to take this course with the other physic class, but more importantly, I'm trying to learn as much as I could. Also, I'm interested in how the stuff works around us in our daily life. Furthermore, I believe that this course would help me out with the other physic class too."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,488,I am here to get a degree I hope that this class teaches me something that will be useful in my career so that I’m not just taking time out of my day to fulfill a requirement and get nothing out of it by the time the semester comes to an end
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,489,"232-09Why am I here?	I am here because I am motivated to try and be successful. From my results last semester, I received all A’s which felt amazing since the rest of my college career was abysmal based on the transcripts. I do want to succeed, but I am not afraid to fail either as long as I can find one thing of any size to show I learned something and what to do for the next time. I understand that this course will be difficult, but that brings an exciting challenge because it would make it that much more satisfying given that I do succeed."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,490,I am here for an endless amount of reasons. The main reason I am here is to get a degree I have worked so long for. Things have not come easy for me for several reasons but I have continued to persevere and will continue until I get my M.E degree. Another reason why I am here is for my family. My family has always stood behind me after so many hings have happened. I feel that they deserve this as much as me or even more. The final reason I would say I am here is to learn. I am always curious to know how things work so to learn about it makes me feel like I am accomplishing one of my curiosities. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,219,"I am here because despite all the order that needs to be in place for our universe and the things in it to be in relative equilibrium, I am a product of the spontaneity of our universe. I am here because as humans, we learned to be more present and to have direction in our lives. I believe the human experience is to build and develop a purpose in our lives beyond our primal instincts using the complex minds that we were gifted with. For me personally, I have chosen to try to be a positive effect on those who I am connected with. In this present moment, I am building myself up through education and experiences so that later in my life, I will be able to contribute to the personal growth of others and help them through their endeavors.(Note: I apologize for the late submission. I was not able to attend the first lab session earlier in the semester which was the reason why I never got to submit this. Since you opened up late work until May 16th, I realized I could go back and finally submit this consciousness assignment.)"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,491,"I am here because I want to have an engineering degree. To have that degree I need to learn physics, and use it once I have learned it. It is my goal to help with what I have learned in Pakistan. I want to make things that my family living over there can benefit from. I am studying computer engineering and I want to use that to help my family, and anyone else that might also benefit from whatever is it I can do/make for them. For all of this I need to first learn how to solve problems and how to think critically and according to Dr. Man, physics is taught to help us (engineers) learn to problem solve difficult questions/problem."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,492,"I’m here in this class because it was required by my major to take it. My true desire though, is to learn and excel in chemistry, my favorite subject and major. Since I first began to take it, I have felt a connection to chemistry, and now finally I am on the path to creating a career for myself in a field I really enjoy and do well in. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,493,Ana Martinez  PHYS 232-09  Why am I here?  	I am here because this class is a requirement for my major (civil engineering). Apart from this class being a requirement for me this class is pretty interesting. I think that I can learn a lot and I do like learning things that a person does not think about on a normal basis. I am also here because I want to learn and understand physics. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,494,"I am here to get a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. This is My first semester in SF state coming from community college. I do like physics although I would not say I am good at it, I know that it would be very helpful to understand main concepts so I can apply them to my work if I ever go into making video games or some type of 3-d project. I am looking forward to this semester event-hough I know it will be a lot of work."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,495,I am here to read all my physics chapters and to learn all necessary stuffs regarding assignments and homework and quizzes.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,496,I'm here to get my degree in mechanical engineering. I recently transferred here after taking a break for two years due to a traumatic event. I'm glad to be back and learning again.
