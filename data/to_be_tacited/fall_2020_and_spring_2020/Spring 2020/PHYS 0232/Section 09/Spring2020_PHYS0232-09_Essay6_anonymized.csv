I chose science as my major. Before I enroll in university, I decided to study physics. I was not sure why I chose physics from many subjects in science. At least, I can say I like science. When I was child, I read the biography of Galileo Galilei. His story made impression on me because he always never gave up. Even if he became blind, he tried to continue his research. I felt something in common about his life. After I grow up, I was not sure what I really want to do in my life. However, I remember the book of Galileo. This affected my decision. Now, the idea is different from what I used to be. Physics is a foundation of science so it applies to learning other scientific subjects. So, I continue majoring in physics. I have still no idea about I really want to study Physics. At least, I continue learning science because I like it."

2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,485,"Consciousness # 6  Why do I want to go into the STEM field?  The STEM field aligns with my personality. I’ve always been curious about the way the world works. I believe this is the essence of STEM. I believe every STEM student is a curious person at heart, and we yearn to figure the ins-and-outs of our surroundings. We are interested in taking things apart, dissect them, learn, put it back together, take it back apart, make some modifications, and create something new. All for our enjoyment and love for learning and the pleasure we get from making sense out of everything. I think what makes me drawn to STEM is this joy I get from making sense of the world around me and being able to explain why something is the way it is to myself and to others."

2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,475,"Robin Fernando 5/7/20 (Late) 232-09  WHY DO I WANT TO GO INTO THE STEM FIELD?  Honestly, I don’t have an exact reason why I’d join the STEM field other than calculations and numbers has always been something I’m comfortable with. Currently I do not know exactly what I want to do with a Computer Science degree, but my older brother has told me it would be a good fit for me. But this was also a judgement he made by just watching me grow up and him also being in the same field. It’s not something I’m being forced into, but it is something I do see as a future I can grow into. This all sounds uncertain because I don’t know a lot about the field in general; I just know I want to work with computers and it’s what I’m good at."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,493,"Ana Martinez   PHYS 232-09  4/24/20  Consciousness #6   I want to go into the STEM field because I feel like I have granted more towards topics  related to math and science. I am not a super big fan of science but I am of math. Compared to  other subjects math has been something I understand it is not something that has a lot of answers.  There is only one answer and many ways to get to that answer if that is the case. I feel like with  math you can do many things in my opinion, I am not saying I am the absolute best but I like it a  lot. I was drawn more towards civil engineering because I like the idea that something on paper  can just become something people can enjoy, I like how and idea becomes true. As I keep going  along my journey, classes do get harder but I just keep learning something each day. I did not  think of how beams were affected by the weight or how physics played a roll in all this. I got into  civil engineering liking the idea but I now love it. I want to go into the STEM field because I  want to see people enjoy a structure I helped build, I want to see the joy in everyoneÕs faces  when we are done with it as well. And just seeing that all the time after every new project."

I am going to STEM field because pursing it will give a range of future opportunities after graduation. For example, my major is Computer Science, I can work in a lot of areas like I can work as a game developer, website designer, graphic designer, and software engineer. And there is a huge societal impact, like our life surrounded by science, technology, engineering, and mathematics."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,481,"I want to go into the STEM Þeld for no other reason than it is what I feel I can enjoy the most  while still giving the most I can back to society and the world. STEM is where I feel I can make  the biggest di!erence while having the most fun as possible, though this is subject to change. I  have also always been better at STEM comparatively to my skills in other Þelds such as arts or the humanities. While I donÕt think that STEM is the only option to make good money to live the  life I would aspire to have it is certainly a good option, because with the rise of tech there are  thousands of tech jobs opening up every week. I think that a lot of people go into STEM because they are forced by there parents to go into it so that they can get a good job at a tech  company and make a lot of money or be a doctor or whatever. I personally just came because I  love physics and wanted to know as much as I possibly could about it. I am not too particular about Þnding a job after, there are plenty of jobs."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,494,"I want to go into STEM because the Þelds that it includes are what are shaping the world for  the better. Being a part of that means I can have an input of my own to share with others and  help create something new or help improve something that needs work on. I am interested in  and have been working on becoming a software engineer or a web developer, but no one really  knows where weÕll end up. I have also heard from teachers that there is a 1% rate for  unemployment in engineering compared to 5% in any other occupation, so that sounds like a  safe bet which can assure me I can Þnd a job with my major. Why do I want to go into the STEM Þeld?"

2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,499,"I went to school at San Francisco State University, so I am familiar with the environment here, and the climate is better here. I came to this school to hope that I would have the opportunity to graduate to find an internship near Silicon Valley, further study computer knowledge, and cultivate professional qualities and experience. The reason why I chose engineering is because I like to delve into some scientific problems, which can trigger my thinking. I like to use my brain instead of communicating with others."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,478,"Why do you want to go into the STEM field?   Well my main reason for studying engineering was to get a high paying job. I soon came to  think the job would be very healthy for me considering we are not in an office all day long. On  top of that I really enjoy the challenge. I like the look on peoples faces when I tell them I'm a  civil engineer, it feels good. Over the past year I have been studying network marketing and  financial markets in my free time. I am an independent business owner and plan to never  work a 9-5 job again. I am still in school because I would like to finish what I started but I have  no intentions of being a civil engineer anymore. My main reasons for joining was the job itself,  the income, and the challenge. Now engineering is my back up plan, and if you ask me it's a  pretty good back up plan. Very thankful I decided to go to college."

Another reason that I want to get in the STEM field is to try to get in the aerospace field to get a job, either on spacecraft or planes and helicopters."

I feel that as a kid I always liked to build stuff and played around with electronics. I would sit and try to figure out how to make something work and how to fix things. As time started to go by, my interests still were the same, but I explored other interests. In the end, I came to the realization that this is something I wanted to pursue for the rest of my life. Stem is one of the most interesting things I have ever learned and will continue to learn and I cannot wait to learn what else is out there."

Engineering different solutions to problems and studying science has just been so cool to me for longer than I can remember so getting to explore that realm of our existence is really cool to me. Plus it doesn't hurt that engineers make lots of money! My love for engineering has grown for the most par since I found out about the possibility as a child but I have certainly run into difficulty like realizing the syllabus for engineering is super outdated and such. Regardless I’m still really hyped for the possibility to be an engineer some day and be designing all kinds of trivial shit!"
