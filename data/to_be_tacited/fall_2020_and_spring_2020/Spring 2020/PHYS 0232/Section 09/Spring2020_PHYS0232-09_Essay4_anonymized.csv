2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,479,The coronavirus has made my semester a lot harder and learning very hard. Quality of education is very low. A lot of professors are doing too much extra work and it would be much more helpful to simply record and post lectures online and hold optional zoom sessions for office hours. Certain professors also gave midterms during transition week which made Times a lot harder. Looking forward to the end of this pandemic and hope the death rates keep going down. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,486,"HAHA well as my roommate you probably have some idea as to how the corona virus has effected my semester, but more than displacement and such it's just causing a lot of unnecessary stress in my academic life and personal life. Online learning just isn't the environment that I thrive in so its really been tough to make the transition so suddenly and poorly because the teachers just aren't prepared for this transition either. I'm starting to get used to the difference in classes but the effect is farther reaching than my academics, because being away from my San Francisco life has already had a negative effect on my mental health and we're less than a week in. Regardless you're handling it as well as I would expect so I'm not really worried about you because whatever labs are fucked. Anyways I cant think of any ways to make the labs run smoother but if I come up with any ideas I'll shoot you a text or something."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,497,"The corona virus has effected my semester drastically. I simply dislike online class which is why I never take online classes. All my classes have always been in person. Now all my classes are virtual. To top it off, all my classes are stem class so it will only make it that much more difficult for me. I also lost 1 of my jobs. Due to that I can’t afford my rent anymore so I had to move back home to Southern California. I’m in the process of ending my lease and bringing my things down. This is all so overwhelming trying to find employment while trying to complete my studies online."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,485,"COVID-19 has made life so confusing. I accidentally missed one of my classes this week because being at home feels like I'm done for the day. I had one class online in the morning and then I got distracted and totally forgot I was supposed to have a class right after. In school, I physically have to move from classroom to classroom, so change is more obvious. Being at home all day feels like nothing is really happening. It's harder to stay focused at home. I have to set alarms for everything so I don't forget to log into zoom. Now, I don't even ""get ready"" for class. I don't have to put my shoes on. I don't have to pack up my backpack. I don't even have to do my hair nor get dressed even. Also, some companies are canceling their internship programs for the summer, so it's messing with my career in that way. If this goes on, the Veteran's Affair has said that those veterans using the GI Bill will get their allowance cut in half because classes are now online instead of in-class. Basically, this whole situation is terrible for education, finances, and life in general. It really sucks that we have to do this lab online, too. I was excited to play with electricity."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,495,"This corona virus’s global lockdown of our educational sector is well going to causes a big and major (and likely unequal) interruptions in students’ seeking knowledge and learning; discontinuity in internal assessments; and also, the cancellation of public assessments for qualifications. Also, students are mentally and socially disturbing because at school universities they have a lot to enjoy and participate in different social gatherings and competitions to explore students’ skills. Due to this pandemic they are unable to explore all these skills.    My big concern is about how all educational institutes manage all this academic semester well for the sake of students well-being?How they explore out skill and keep busy their students socially?"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,475,"The corona virus has forced me to move back home. Classes are obviously taught online which is making some of my classes more difficult than normal which is going to negatively affect my grades this semester unfortunately. In terms of work, I was laid off because there is no business at this time so with no income I can't afford rent so I'm unsure what my landlord will do with me. On a brighter note, I do know some professors that are being a little more understanding in terms of coursework and helping where they can. For me, the labs did help me understand the physics material so much more, but no more hands on experience will hurt in that area. I am worried about my grades this semester but I just hope I can finish strong."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,499,"PHYS 232  Hangchu Chen     I think the coronavirus directly affects the normal life of our international students. As an international student, I could not go back, and after San Francisco closed, I could only stay at home. And the plane back home has stopped, so I can only stay here for online classes. But I think I'm fully prepared. I bought vegetables and grains for three months. I can't go out, my limbs are lying down and degenerate. I want to eat a lot of delicious food. I look at the album every day as a tour, but because there are online classes. In general, learning has not been affected much.  Medical industry: In the era without infectious diseases, there will also be various exercise strategies for preventing infectious diseases.  Learning: Online tutoring classes may also be popular, but online tutoring classes cannot replace physical tutoring classes. After all, the atmosphere of learning online tutoring classes cannot be created at all.  Food: In recent years, game products will be strictly investigated, but from a long-term perspective, it is out of luck and curiosity. Game can't be completely banned, so there will definitely be similar virus outbreaks in the future, almost ten years later."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,477,"I don't have to get up at 5 AM which is nice, but it also took a while to get used to working in my room as opposed to the library. I've gotten kind of used to it now, but I still prefer to be in a school environment since it's more motivating."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,500,"Mary Nicole TangogPhys 232March 22, 2020 This crisis that we are experiencing came to everyone's surprise. No one would have known or prepared for what was about to come. The semester was somehow going smoothly for me and although by february, we heard more news about COVID-19, I didn’t imagine it was going to be this way. When the news of possible closure of the university, I wasn’t sure whether to be relieved by it because I commute daily, or worry because this will make it harder for me to learn and study, which will highly affect my grade. This was probably the biggest worry I had following the announcement of the closure of the university. Classes are not easy and are challenging in a traditional classroom setting, more so will it be transitioning to a virtual class. Although I’ve taken online classes in the past, there are some classes that are still better to have in a traditional class setting, for example our lab. Although it is somewhat harder and will require more mental preparation because I am not in a setting where I have to be focused, this is a better option when it comes to everyones’ health. I just hope the remaining of the semester will go smoothly, especially we will be doing remote classes until the end. My only question is, how exactly will the lab run for the rest of the semester?I know this is not easy for you as well, but I’m glad we still have this opportunity to learn away from the university. Thank you and stay safe."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,491,My worry is that the classes being online will be hard for me. I haven't done well in the past in the online classes and so worried about not doing well. I do like that we are doing zoom sessions and there is a form of lecture happening and so far it has been better than not having any lecture at all. I think being physically in the classroom helps me focus more and I retain more information. So far all the professors and all the teachers have been great with their help and making the adjustments to the class. I will try my best to stay on top of everything and take ask for help when needed. That will be my goal through all of this.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,483,"I think it has affected very bad. I prefer my classes in person because beside lectures, I was able to get help from the tutoring resources. Especially for my physics lab class it is very hard to do it remotely. I prefer doing the experiments and most of them were interesting, in addition I was able to learn visually by the experiments. Therefore, I am not happy with this situation. I hope it won’t last long."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,480,"How has the coronavirus affected your semester? Please include any questions and/or concerns you may have. Coronavirus affects people all over the world. I am also concerned, as well. University closes face-to-face classes right before my physics midterm. So, my physics professor postponed the exam and changed the questions. When I heard that the courses would be online, I thought it was convenient for students. However, I figured out every class online would affect students negatively because my physics exam gets harder and becomes strict. I guess professors are afraid that students will cheat while taking exams in the house. So they limit the time of the exam strictly. This is one of the negative effects of coronavirus. Another negative effect is that it is hard to keep the efficiency of studying. Studying everything by myself is harder than I expect. I understand taking lecture and casting questions to professors save my time. It is also hard to keep the motivation to study. When I take face-to-face lectures, I can communicate with other students. This motivates me to study. Now, I don't have motivation from outside. So I need to motivate my self to do homework and to prepare for exams. Anyway, I guess this situation won't continue longer. I hope we can return to campus soon."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,487,"Weixi Zeng  Phys 232-09  12:30-15:15  03/22/2020  Stream of Consciousness#4              This coronavirus situation affects a lot of thing in my daily life. First of all, my daily routine schedule has been affected and I have to rearrange my daily schedule. Also, I have to pack up my stuff recently and move back with my family since this situation is getting more serious with the confirmed case spiking up nationwide and CA government announced that everyone should stay home and quarantine. This are the changes that I have to make on my daily routine due to the coronavirus. Furthermore, this situation changed the whole semester to online only, which is making it difficult to me because I learn a lot better when I’m able to get my hands on the materials instead of getting it from online. Lastly, the online courses is causing conflicts while I’m moving back with my parents because I missed some of the classes and assignment due date during the move."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,496,"It has affected my semester greatly. Right now, we are basically stuck at home for 3 weeks. The only good part of this, is I don't need to go on my very long commute to get to campus. At the same time, I miss being able to learn on campus. I was looking forward to getting to play with circuits in lab. I learn okay online, but it isn't my strongest suit because I get lazy. Hopefully, I can keep it together for the rest of the semester. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,488,Coronavirus hasn't affected me physically but has affected every part of my life. This virus is keeping me inside and has led to early closure at my work with less shifts available. Then all of school is online now  which makes it hard to know about the scheduling of the courses and how much our course outline has been affected. In short a lot has changed in such little time leaving little time to adjust especially when living in sf where everything is so expensive the sudden changes are incredibly impactful.  
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,489,"The coronavirus has effected my semester very negatively in terms of keeping up with school work and the safety of myself and others. Going completely online for the Spring semester brought the severity of the situation more to light as I didn't believe the campus would go through this closure. I understood the basics and was all for keeping the campus open. That was before understanding that for a majority of people it may not affect them severely, but the purpose of going remote and being told to stay home was to stop the spread and be able to give relief for medical workers who are attending to those affected. Academically though, I feel like I am suffering from online courses, I find it easy for me to procrastinate or be distracted when at home. I hope my grades do not suffer too much as a result and I do hope for this virus to blow over for the sake of public health. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,476,I honestly hate going to class on zoom. For me it kills the learning environment and it makes me do less well than I would in a normal academic setting. Honestly this virus totally made my life different. I got laid off and everyone in my family is stressed so I’ve been trying to keep them calm. I really hope this pandemic ends sooner than later. But I’ve learned the importance of balance and keeping your sanity in situations like this. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,219,"The coronavirus has brought a lot of uncertainty to my semester.Overall, my 2020 year was going extremely well. Academically, I was proving to myself that I could not only survive, but thrive in my classes. Despite having a history of sleeping through early classes in college because of a sleeping condition that I have, I could honestly tell myself that I rarely missed class during the first half of this Spring 2020 semester. To me, that was monumental because I had an 8am on Mondays and Wednesdays, a lab at 9:30am on Thursdays, and a 9am on Friday, and yet I pushed myself to not start missing classes knowing that I usually had a mid-semester slump in previous semesters. Before the coronavirus hit, I proved to myself that I was capable of academic success when I was determined and focused.Added to my academic success, I was also working out consistently and steadily progressing towards my health goals. I was ready to do at least 20 hours of community service this semester as part of a community service organization too. My relationship with my significant other could not have been smoother (little to no arguments). A side thing is that I am planning on moving out of my living accommodation of living with 5 other people because a few of them are not as clean/sanitary as they should be, which upsets me constantly throughout the weeks.So, fast-forward to when the coronavirus hit and how it has affected my semester. When you're doing well academically, you want everything to be routine and to stay the same so that you can be consistent. First though at the thought of moving to online classes, a student would think that things would be easier: not having to wake up as early, not having to drive to school and find parking, not having to walk from the parking garage all the way to class on the opposite side of the campus. Seemed plausible. Going online and attending a lecture on Zoom in your bedroom seemed more convenient than attending your classes in-person. BUT when I went to attend the online Zoom lectures, I experience laggy feedback. My professors' screens were delayed, audio was getting cut off constantly to the point where I could not understand sentences, and I felt like I spent the whole online lecture time trying to understand my professor but could not which made me feel like I had wasted my time. For one of my classes, apparently attendance was being taken and I had missed that part of the lecture so I was given 0 points for that day. My solution to this is moving back to my hometown and trying to do everything there but in this time of transition I was already penalized for what seems like wifi that is not able to support Zoom as well as I had expected. I will be moving back home this week but it takes preparation to move everything I need back home.Health-wise, it was smarter to stop going to my gym because of all the transfer of bacteria that goes around there; they eventually closed down anyways. But with my decline in working out, I lost energy throughout the day that I gained somehow from working out and it is depressing to transition from having access to a gym to, let's say, working out at home with no equipment. The community service organization that I am in (I have been in it for almost 5 years now and has brought me great joy throughout college) has stopped activity, and self-containment, as well as the school closure, has resulted in not being around friends who motivate me and allow me to motivate them: I tell you, it is depressing.My relationship with my significant other still seems solid even during this time. It is hard though when one of us starts to feel sick, the other understands that distancing will prevent the spread of the virus. But it is in our nature to want to be together and to care for each other. \To add on to that, just today, one of my housemates brought his girlfriend into the house and she kept having these forced coughs. I counted 15 coughs within 5 minutes at some point. It seemed wise to tell my housemate that she should not be in our house if she is sick or possibly contagious, but since I am non-confrontational, all I did was hide in my room until they left many hours later. It was like my housemate did not care about the health of the other people in the house, but only cared about being with his girlfriend. Once they left the house, I began to disinfect some common parts of our house knowing that I was the only one there at the moment who cared about preventing the spread of germs. But as I cleaned, I put myself at risk of being exposed to what could have been the virus itself, and therefore potentially exposing it to other people I come into contact with. Because I was cooped up in my room for such a long time, I was barely able to eat and even then I was paranoid about what parts of the kitchen could have been contagious. It does not help that the housemate mentioned above (with the potentially contagious girlfriend) started coughing earlier in his sleep, which could mean that he is not contagious too and constantly living at our house without caring about the health of the rest of our housemates (some history to this but too long to explain).I know many others have it harder but this is just my experience of how the coronavirus has affected my semester so far. There's a lot of uncertainty of how things are going to progress from here both academically and health-wise as well. I just dislike the idea of how my life was going so smoothly before the coronavirus hit because of my determination and perseverance, but now the conditions have changed and some of the very factors that had helped me succeed were stripped away from me and old annoyances in my current living accommodation (bad wifi and dirty housemates) have resurfaced and seem like they are giving me bigger disadvantages during this stressful time of adapting to life during the time of the coronavirus."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,484,"I wasn’t too concerned of the virus a few weeks earlier but now that it has gone 10x worse within a blink of an eye, it’s quite scary. How the virus effected my semester is that everything is online now. Although, instructors are using zoom with still displays a visual PowerPoint I still find it kind of hard to focus and fully grasp the concept. I see myself as a visual and an interactive learner and the fact that I can’t physically go to class everyday it’s gonna be a lot of adjustments. I am glad that the campus are doing this for precautionary due to the virus. I feel somewhat safe but not. I heard that the semester will remain to stay online for the rest of the semester. What’s gonna happen for this lab? Are we just going to keep analyzing video clips of the lab and or an interactive activity online. Thank you Bryce! Please stay safe and healthy!!"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,478,The coronavirus has affected my semester by making it much more stressful than it already was. I have been having trouble learning from home because the zoom calls often have errors and are not as thorough as in class teaching. I also feel like I am more of a hands on student. It is much easier for me to learn when I can talk to the teacher and write on white boards. I think this semester should be curved for all students because teachers definitely understand the difficulty and inconvenience of whats going on here. I hope that everyone is staying healthy and that this virus disappear as quick as it showed up. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,492,"Coronavirus is really just affecting me in superficial ways. I do not feel like it has hit me as hard as other people. I still have my job, and for the most part, all I do is school otherwise. But it has taken away a few of my hobbies. I used to go to the gym 5 days a week, but now every gym I can go to has closed down! I was concerned with leaving the city to head home, especially after the shelter in place order, but I think it will still be fine for me to drive home. I'm concerned now with how the rest of my semester will proceed. I'm not a big fan of online classes and I feel like they'll challenge me less. I wish that things could go back to normal, but, such is life. Got the roll with the punches."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,490,"The Corona Virus has affected my semester a lot. It has caused me to switch gears and learn how to work in an element I am not use to. I have to learn through computer learning, when I am so use to learning in a in person situation. This has also affected me this semester because I have to figure things out online rather than being able to have that face to face contact. This essentially is a big curve ball. A lot is happening and I have to set a schedule and reminders because due dates are not the same and sometimes I can seem to forget things. This is going to take some changes but I am ready for it. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,493,"I think that the coronavirus has affected my semester a lot. It is weird how you don't realize how going to school helps you cope with a lot. I think in a way online classes help because there is more questions being asked but it also affects our way of learning because we are looking at a computer for a long period of time and sometimes gaze off from the lecture itself. A major thing for me is that getting a lot of emails all the time is overwhelming and hard to keep up with them, for that I am trying to stay as organized as I can but it is just a bit hard. I think not having a physics lab sucks because it was a thing that in a way helped me understand the lecture way better.I think that having timed tests is the worst too, I get anxious taking them in the class room and everything is fine but taking them online when it is timed is something else because the internet can crash, I feel like I am also more rushed and I can not go back and forth between the problems. Well not in the case of the physics test we just took, every section of the test was timed and we couldn't go back and check our answers because we had to submit them. So far that was the hardest thing to go through. Apart from all the craziness I think all the instructors are doing their best to keep these online classes working. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,501,Since all my  classes  become  online  im having a trouble  with  catching up with the work. Also  i was planning to travel  i had  to cancel  my  planning.Iam wondering  how we are going to  do the final  exam?
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,494,"Covid-19 has put so much stress on everyone, specially those that are out of work because of the lockdown in California.I am fortunate enough to still have a job doing security Monday to Friday but my main job as a bartender on the weekends is currently on standstill. That stings a bit but I still have a job, so I can't complain on that. Everyone is worried that they might have the virus because of allergies or a cough that they might have, so that is really worrisome. School has been really good with keeping everyone updated, so that has been great.  I'm just hoping everything gets better sooner than later, since there is just so much distress all over the place."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,498,The coronavirus effected my semester in a bad way because I am a commuter and just to get to school I would have a high chance of getting the coronavirus. Then this class and Engineering- 200 the labs are gonna be very difficult because it has to be hands on and without it is very difficult to learn. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,9,481,"the coronavirus has effected my semester severely. as my last semester of lower division physics i find it necessary that I really grasp the concept that i will be taught. However, I fear that because of this online schooling that will not be possible. I do not learn well in an online format and while most of these things I have already covered I do not understand them at the level I deem necessary to preform good enough next year. This could have an impact on my future grades and understanding in that class as they are built off topics from these classes this semester. Thus impacting my performance and chances in graduate school. All around I am not scared of the virus health wise I am scared of the impact it may have on my future. I feel more stressed out now than before because of the challenges I discussed that come with online school and because of the virus I had to cancel a backpacking trip and a trip to Yosemite both of which would have been extremely fulfilling and stress reliving. All in all i am just pissed off about the whole situation, not at the fault of the school or anything I understand they had to do what thehy had to do but at the panic demonstrated by so many people. It has so many unforeseen consequences on everything."
