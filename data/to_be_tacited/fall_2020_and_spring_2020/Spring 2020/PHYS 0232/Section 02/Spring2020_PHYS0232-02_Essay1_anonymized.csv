Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,211,"I am here because I am trying to continue my path of graduating with a Bachelors of Science, Civil Engineering. I have enjoyed this University thus far because I feel as if every teacher is doing their best to help us pass. I am not a huge science fan, but it has started to grow on myself as I have been moving on with my journey. I am taking the most out of every class so that way I could be the smartest and most efficient engineer in the industry. I think that i am here because this is the path that God lead me down and I am very grateful. I don't talk to much, but I am always listening and learning as much as possible. We are all here for the same reason. Either for ourself or someone very important to them. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,450,I am a Undergrad Mechanical Engineering student and I have to finish my PHY classes to graduate. I have transferred from Fiji and have been in the US since 2015. Also I like to know how things work around us either be physics or engineering. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,451,"I’m here primarily because the computer science department requires me to take a physics course. However, I know that 232 is the section where waves, electricity, etc start to come in and that does directly apply to my field and interests of understanding how the machines I build software on work at a more fundamental level. I’ve also found that physics has been a good “brain gym” in some ways. It helps me solve problems better and better recognize patterns in general, which has helped me tremendously in reading and organizing code."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,452,I am here because this is a lower division requirement for computer science. This will be one of my last lower division classes so that I can focus on more of my upper division classes. The only interest I have in physics doesn't include the calculations necessarily but more so the ideas that we prove or disapprove to explain how something works in physics just surprises me.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,453,"Why am I here?I am here to learn about the real world applications of physics. School is essential in to days society in order to obtain a well paying and generally higher stature job. This is to be honest the real reason I am here today. I enjoy physics and the applications of physics, but if I had my own choice or another avenue to go down I do not think school would be that route. School is a great tool, but it focuses too much on testing your knowledge in a standardized way rather than making the information easily digested and enjoyed. But to answer the question I am here to obtain a degree and hopefully a job after school."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,454,Why am I here? I am here because this class is a prerequisite for my major. My first physics class was here at SFSU and it was an eye opener. Understanding how physics is involved in our everyday life gave me a better perspective. I did very well in Physics 220 but Physics in general gives me anxiety. I’m very confident in math but I want to also build my confidence for physics so I hope this lab will help me achieve that goal.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,455,"I am here to fulfill my requisites for my bachelor's degree in computer science. More importantly, I am here because the education system in this university deems that this laboratory portion is necessary in order to put in practice the concepts taught in the lecture portion so it helps us have a more interactive and meaningful experience with the course materials. I, however, do not find physics easy or intriguing which is why I am only here because it is required of me. This laboratory is my 4th college level physics course and I still struggle to understand it's fundamental concepts because it requires too much of my time to comprehend which is limited by the immense amounts of coding that I will have to do in my career. I hope I can find a better reason for this laboratory course as time progresses."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,456,I am here because its a required lab for getting further ahead in my degree. I also love solving problems. My major is Electrical Engineering so this lab is going to be very helpful for me to get my initial basics down. I am honestly excited to get started and learn new things in this lab. I love experimenting and finding out results as it gives me to relate the theories that I learn in lecture class with physical data and retain better. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,457,"Why am I here?I am here because I have to fulfill a major requirement, and I also want to get the knowledge needed to go further into my major. I want to be successful in my current and future classes, that is why I want to do well in them all. I’m also here because one of my closest friends took this time slot and since we had lab together last semester, I figured it was going to be just as fun. Aside, I want to reflect more in physics from lecture and lab."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,458,﻿ I am here to fulfill a covenant with myself and become an Electrical Engineer.  I am here to be a learned person.I am here to share what I know.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,203,I’m here because I need to take this class in order to pursue my engineering career which I want to eventually use this degree and work with cars
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,205,"Im currently here to inch towards my goal of getting an engineering degree. Even though im extremely paranoid of the virus right now, im trying to pull through and hold my position here at school. Through different experiences ive come to solidify the idea that math and science is something near and dear to my heart because it is where my brain works the best. The logic and the tediousness is no longer weird or annoying, it is necessary and helpful. It helps me understand the world around me on a daily basis so i make even more informed decisions even if it is in the tiniest of details. It is what helps humans push forward in progress and find new frontiers and challenges. It is the curiosity in humans that drives us to be smarter and innovative."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,459,"Ravi Johnson  Physics 232-02 January 28, 2020  Why Am I Here?         I am here because I am attempting to become a Civil Engineer. I moved to SF a year and a half ago, and am planning got leave after I graduate. I am wanting to become a civil engineer and specialize in residential construction. Growing up I have always wanted to become a Civil Engineer. Physics 230/232 are both a requirement for me to do so. I am excited to see what will happen with these two classes."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,460,"“Why am I here?” Before even getting started I feel like to do anything there must be a reason! So, “why?” Me myself I enjoy physics, I am fascinated by how everything thing in this universe, from tiny atom to the space is connected to physics. And as being a student of engineering the main reason why I am here is to see how thing actually works, how applicable the lecture are."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,461,Hello!I’m here because I have to fulfill this prerequisite for my computer science degree. I really have a hard time understanding physics and understanding why it’s a prerequisite but I’m eager to learn and my instructor seems very eager to teach so I hope this class is successful at teaching me at least one thing. That’s why I’m here right now. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,462,"Why am I here?I am here because I decided that education is important to me. I am in college to learn as much as I can because I think the more I learn, the more capable I am of thinking well, of being useful, and the more beautiful and amazing I think the world around me is. I am in this physics class because physics is required for my major, but my dad loves physics and encouraged me to take physics with calculus instead of the physics course that does not incorporate calculus. I have been greatly inspired by the intellect, positivity, and enthusiasm of the physics teachers I have had, so I think I might continue taking physics courses even though this course is the last physics class required for my major."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,463,"I’m here because I want to learn more about the properties of electricity and magnetism. Specifically, I want to see how magnetic fields impact electricity. When I was young, I read about Farraday and how he went from being an insignificant lab assistant to leading sections of physics by simply working with an open mind. I want to be like him, and to discover things about science by learning without restrictions."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,464,"I am here to learn and experiment. I am here to link what I learn in class through textbooks and actually do it in person so I can get the concepts even better and probably understand it more. Experimenting is always fun be it with the devices at home or at the labs. The difference is we have a manual for what to do in lab but not for the devices I tear apart at my house. I do have YouTube though, which helps but can't be sure what works and what doesn't. So experimenting in a lab is so much better with some rules and manuals. Therefore, I'm here to learn and have fun at the same time."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,465,I am here because I genuinely feel like this will benefit me later in my attempt at becoming an engineer. I feel that it is important that as an aspiring engineer that schooling is one of the best ways to learn the information that is required to not only receive a degree in mechanical engineering but the only way. I am here in this classroom because I must receive a grade that will determine whether or not I will be proceeding to the next class. Schooling is important because after we are done we will be released into the world with the ideas we have been forced to learn and with all that information we have to make money. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,466,"I am here because it is part of one of my major classes. I am excited to take this class because you will really never know what you are going to run into during your experiments. I cannot wait to see what type of obstacles my group and I are going to take on and how we will tackle it. There is no telling what type of experiments we are going to do and what we will learn. Everything that we are going to tackle is foreign to us. That is what makes up learning. You do not know what will be in front of you or if it will be easy or hard. This is what learning should be. After, you will eventually learn how to tackle and solve the problem that is in front of you. I want to learn new things that I never knew before. This is why I am here. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,467,"I am here because it is one of my last classes i need to graduate. It is not the only reason however, I find the class interesting and always preferred learning through experinentation and doing rather than take notes. I am excited to learn from the experiments we are going to do in the class."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,468,"Why am I here?Sometimes I find myself asking that very question. There are times I feel like an imposter in my classes. I do not belong here is what I tell myself. I’m not smart enough. I don’t know what I’m doing. Well am I not be smart enough but I work hard enough to be here. I definitely do not know what I’m doing but I’m not the only one. I’m here because education is important in my family. My parents couldn’t obtain their education because they had other priorities but they made sure to work hard and guarantee that their kids will have the opportunity, the choice, to obtain their education.  I am here because I enjoyed doing math, doing experiments, and putting things together."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,469,"I am here because this course is required for my major of mechanical engineering because it will teach me critical information that will later serve as a foundation for more advanced courses. I chose mechanical engineering because I have some personal experience with automotive repair and maintenance, and have always been a visual and physical learner. My dad also works in aerospace manufacturing, so its kind of in the family. All that has led me thus far to this course, which I am actually retaking this semester due to some personal dilemmas that occurred last semester. Hopefully this semester my home life will stay sorted out, allowing me to succeed in this course."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,470,"Why am I here? I am a computer engineering major and the reason that I'm a here is because I love the science of it and also because this is the path to achieving my goal. I also like labs because I am a tactile, hands on kind of person. I like the physical part of science and math."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,471,"i am here because i am trying to be a mechanical engineer. i am sitting in this chair because i am enrolled in physics 2 with calc and the supplemental lab. i look forward to this class and lab because after the first day i can tell that this will be a better time around than the last physics class i had, both my teachers were somewhat robotic and did not have fun. the teachers this year in both my classes seem to be very enthusiastic which will further my learning experience. "
