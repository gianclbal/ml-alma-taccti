2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,211,"I wanted to go into the stem field because I have a passion for making money and I know that there will always be a need for engineers. Specifically I chose ciivil engineering because my mom is a civil engineer and she showed me the ropes as to how to become an experienced and well knowledge man. I think that it is interesting because my mom worked on the Bay Bridge and the construction and planning it took to create that was immense. I give her and her team so much credit and thanks because that is something that will last for over 100 years. I think 2 years from now, I will love the job I will have because I will be financially stable and mentally happy."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,474,"I want to go into the stem field because I like science. I want to figure out how our world works, but not only that I want to learn how to build a lot of mechanical things. Maybe start of simple and start off with a car then work my way up to something better. I just want to be able to figure out ""why"". Why does the robot move this way, or why does the machine work? Just some questions I have to answer. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,465,Growing up in an Asian house hold it was very suggested that I do something STEM related and I didn't really want to but as I grew to understand my own interests I developed a liking for math and physics. I believe that it stemmed from my training in table tennis. I would always be thinking about how the ball would react in relation to how I hit the ball. As I started to take physics classes I would apply the equations of rotational motion and kinetic friction to further my understanding of what what actually happening between the ball and my paddle. The STEM field then became almost like a no-brainer. I had to be something STEM. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,454,"At first I wasn't too sure what field I wanted to get into but my friends and family reccomended COMPSCI. Tech has envolved quickly and seems to be a high paying job but in the end I didn't see it fitting my lifestyle. Taking pre-requisites like math, BIO, CHEM and physics has opened my eyes into different fields that interest me. The STEM field has made me a more well rounded person and I want to stay in the STEM field to further grow."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,469,"I want to go into the STEM field because its really where I feel like I can thrive, both personally and professionally. I have a passion for mechanical systems, and I love the process of taking something broken apart, and not only fixing, but improving it, and I also enjoy designing a system and then building it. Its part of why I gravitated towards working on cars at such a young age. if I can understand how something works and what its purpose is, I can modify it to optimize it, and doing that with cars is also why I'm always varying degrees of broke, but I enjoy it nonetheless. I like using my imagination to figure out a unique solution to a problem, that is not only practical, but functional. Also they pay isn't bad if you're not a total idiot and I've got a serious addiction to vintage muscle cars, which i'm going to have to finance somehow."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,459,"I want to join the STEM field because it has always interested me. Growing up I have always been into math and science. I would build things as a kid, and experiment on my free time. I love to build things and decided that I would go to college to study engineering. If that did not work out then it back up was to go into construction and work with that. I also have a lot of interest in chemistry, but decided not to go into that field because of the danger of working with chemicals. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,461,"I want to go into the stem field to represent women and people of color. I want to go into the stem field to make a difference for people who are marginalized and want to find advanced ways to help the world become a better more compassionate place. STEM seems like the field least likely to have emotional and compassionate motives but I want to make that stereotype change and show the world that stem can be used to help individuals with their problems, whatever that may be. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,458,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field?       To be part of the evolving transportation technology is the reason that I chose to be an electrical engineer. I've been a trained mechanic for most of my life and have been aware of the evolution of the auto mobile, from carbureted, to efi, to electric. I would like to be a part of a research and development, to produce the self charging automobile."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,203,I want to go into a STEM field because discovering new things interest me and I want to work with cars. Plus math is the easiest subject for me to understand once it's explained.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,462,"Why do I want to go into the STEM field?I want to go into the STEM field because I want to be part of the illustrious human tradition of wondering about the world and then doing science to quantify, describe, and overall better understand what is happening. I specifically want to work in the field of biology because I enjoy understanding how my body and the bodies of other living organisms are structured and how they function. With our current understanding, we can cure diseases and alleviate suffering. Someday, possibly, our understanding will allow us to become the masters of our fate as far as evolution goes. Perhaps we will learn how to upload knowledge and the pathways for physical skills to a person's brain so they can learn something in a matter of moments that now takes years of diligence to acquire (Matrix, anyone?). Perhaps we'll be able to manage diseases as they arise so effectively that we'll have the potential to lives hundreds of years, or possibly indefinitely. Perhaps through gene editing we'll unlock new ways  to sense and experience the world, the equivalent of hearing when you could never hear before, seeing when you could never see, tasting when you could never before taste. All of these possibilities excite me, and even if they are not realized in my lifetime, I want to be a part of moving humanity towards these scientific possibilities."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,451,"I was initially studying to be graphic design, wanting to work in computer animation and character development for an animating studio - be it for a video game or a movie. While studying graphic design at the school I was at, I found that it was a lot more about the art & design aspect and there wasn't really anything about animation - which was what I wanted, to work with computers & 3D animation. During the course of my graphic design curriculum, I had a web design course that I absolutely loved. My dad is a software engineer himself and something about writing code was really fun for me - it hit both the creative side (front end development) and the analytical side (back-end architecture) of my brain and it was equal parts fun and challenging. There was always new things coming out, and it was easily applicable to any job market. I thought it would be the best choice for me - to be able to create things and to have a future-proof job so I don't go broke and start selling meth or turning tricks in the Tenderloin."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,460,"One of the major reason I choose STEM field is to help others. I believe by learning new skills and with my new ideas, I could make a difference. I want to help community by building something that everyone could afford and will make their life simpler. I don't exactly know what right now but I'm working on it. I also choose STEM because math has always been my favorite subject. I like how logically we can approach to the problems. This even helps me to understand physics better. I don't memories the definition, but I do translate the equation in words. either physic or chemistry anything with numbers and equation I love to play with it. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,455,"I want to go to the STEM field because it is a field that I am more passionate in, specially in the technology sector. I began my college studies focusing in business and healthcare management because I was previously working as supply and logistics as well as an administrator for the military so I thought I should focus on studying something I had experience in. However, as time progressed I found myself less motivated to accomplish my studies related to this particular field. Therefore, I took some time to really think what I wanted to study and work in for the rest of my life. I realized I should focus on something I have a passion for. The technology field has always caught my attention, but I could not play with technology as much as I wanted in my earlier days because of my economic status. I was not able to build my first computer, or have a good desktop or phone. I never partook in writing code for software nor did I have the tools necessary. This lack of experience made it challenging to enter the competitive field of technology but I decided that I should just go for it and worry about the challenges as they come, hopefully sooner than later."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,450,"'STEM' (Science, Engineering, Technology and Math) one of the reason I chose this field was because of high pay and its easy to get a job compared to non STEM career. I am also passionate about engineering and have always dreamed of working with one of the cutting edge companies who play an important role in the growth of our economy. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,464,"First of all, I feel STEM is the future so I will have a wide range of opportunities to choose from in the STEM field. Second and most important reason is to make an impact. Everyday life has so many elements possible due to STEM contributions and I want to be a part of making a difference in others life."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,472,"The STEM field offers me a lot of choices in terms of paths that help me complete my goals. My goals revolve around improving daily life with technology, and the best path to go down as far as educational institutions offer would seemingly be STEM majors. Specifically computer science, because I feel like a very large part of our future will be based on human interactivity with computer software. Using computers is the key to making life easier and daily tasks more efficient and optimal. Physics in particular will help me be more aware of fields that have a lot in common with computer science. I may run into certain problems that require me to have a general knowledge in these side fields, and physics and chemistry I feel are a big part of daily life that pretty much everyone should know about."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,452,"I want to go into the STEM field because I think everything that STEM is interests me much more than other subjects ever offered in schools. Physics isn't exactly my first choice but after taking the intro class to physics, it enlightened me that it wasn't as bad as the first time I took it since Elaine Tennant teaches it in a way I can understand a lot better. I wanted to get into Computer Science because it was actually the only subject I liked when I explored it while at my community college. Even though I did struggle in my first programming class, it was pretty satisfying after every assignment that I got the code to work just as it was supposed to. From there, I knew I wanted to get into it after all the time it took me to realized. I'm actually glad I did because I'd probably still be wasting time trying to figure out what I wanted to do. On top of that in the path I took, I met some good friends which I still keep in close touch with. It's still a pretty bumpy road to finishing my studies but at least I'm on the path I want to be. Not only I like this subject, it also stimulates me to want to learn more rather if I chose a different major, I think it would only disappoint me at the end knowing that I chose the wrong path."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,205,"I tend to look at things and try to think about how they work. I love looking at things like the mechanics of a car or installations and such. When something catches my eye, I like to stop and try to make estimated guesses about how something might function so learning about the basics for the natural laws of the universe has changed my perception of the world. Being able to see calculus in daily life and having that affect my decisions of all types really makes me appreciate the sciences for what they are. Especially when it comes to at-home projects, I've been able to build stronger and more efficient things like plant beds. I hope to someday make art installations for public places that catch people's eyes but puzzle them with how it works. Making the pieces as things that go against people's assumptions of reality to make them think outside their realms."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,473,"I want to go into stem field so I can reach my goal of obtaining a PhD in biomedical engineering. I believe with the increase in technology, there is a lot of potential to manipulate mucle and organ functions with the use of engineering. I believe that there is so much to learn and develop through biomedical enginnering, That is why I entered the stem field"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,457,"I want to go into the STEM field simply because I like what I’m doing. However, it is scary to think that maybe one is not suited for STEM majors, I still want to try my best to get as far as I can to accomplish my personal goals. Also, because it could offer me financial stability. Most importantly, it  helps me to inspire more young girls that are close whether they are my family or friends to (maybe) pursue a STEM major, because they can feel supported by me (obviously if that is what they want)."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,453,I have an interest in cars and mechanical systems. This was the first reason that I wanted to be an engineering major. Another reason I wanted to go into the STEM field was because of the money and readily available jobs. Having an interest in the engineering field due to my interest in cars and also the great job opportunities out there for engineers are the main driving factors form me to go into the STEM field. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,468,I want to go into the STEM field because I liked the idea of building something that helped society with groups of people. You’re never really alone in the things you do and you have people who always have your back.  Teamwork is very important to me
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,467,I want to go in to the STEM field because I want to work with current technologies and help develop AI for games and other things.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,463,"I want to go into STEM because I like to discover and explore solutions to problems.  I enjoy taking a complex issue and breaking it down into its component pieces, and then figuring out how to do each step of each task.  It makes me feel super capable, and I get a great deal of satisfaction out of it.  One day, I want to apply what I know about math, physics, engineering, etc into a venue that will value my inputs for their legitimate validity.  Working for an engineering firm or company would be cool and could probably net a lot of money, but I feel like I enjoy research more than production cycles.  I like long-term grappling with potentially endless questions.  I like being a student and living/working/studying around other active students.  If I could, I would go straight from my bachelors into a masters."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,466,"I want to go into the STEM field for many reasons. I want to be the first person in my whole family to be an Engineer. This extends to all the way through my mom and dads side of the family. From grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins. I will be the first person in the family that will become an engineer. Having that in the back of my mind will always push me into this field and never want to give up. I also genuinely have a fun time learning all the materials and classes that are needed for this major. In grade school, I was never the best student, but once I got to college the flip had been switched. I learned that my middle school teachers did not believe that I could go through this major. This made me want to stay in this major and prove all of them wrong. There are many reasons as to why I want to stay in the STEM field and I will keep staying in the STEM field until I complete it all."
